42428408,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7hFh,1515366623,2018's Challenge: What Are Crypto Assets Really Worth?,"Bradley Miles and Sid Kalla are the co-founders of Turing Group, an incubation and advisory firm focused on token protocol design and the ICO sales process.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      If 2017 has taught us anything, it's that there's no shortage of tokens.  Yet, this strength in numbers has brought pitfalls for new investors and analysts, many of whom seem to be having a hard time trying to understand or value their options. Why is that? After all, Wall Street has been valuing other asset classes like stocks and bonds for over a century, and it has a fairly sophisticated models to value derivatives.  One of the primary reasons is that token behaviors can be vastly different among projects.  This is quite unlike the behavior or some traditional assets, such as stocks, which have very well defined value characteristics (dividends and price appreciation, arising out of expectations of future cash flows generated by a firm). In contrast, the value characteristics of crypto assets are very hard to define, let alone standardize for a valuation framework.  Sharing the wealth  The good thing though is we can witness, in real time, great economic experiments, even if most of them fail.  Even small choices in designing the right token can lead to differences in how the ecosystem distributes the value it creates. There is no universally right token design, only lessons learned and best practices to be gleaned.  This flexibility is a double-edged sword – there are unprecedented possibilities when it comes to designing the crypto-economic characteristics of protocols, but it's also easy to mess up. This new asset class is going to be unlike anything we've seen before, and we'll need our own unique set of tools and mental models to get things right.  After the speculative dust settles, crypto assets need to justify their valuation. The value that accrues to a token, however, isn't trivial to identify or define. It is possible to create an immensely successful platform or protocol enabled by a token, where the value accrues to the users instead of the token holders.  One such example is the ""utility token,"" which we're beginning to understand could support a huge economy with only a very small monetary base, if the velocity of money is high. In this way, entrepreneurs designing the next generation of crypto protocols need to realize that the role of the token is not just in creating value but also distributing that value.  One for all  As investors become more sophisticated and begin to grasp the underlying fundamentals of value creation in the ecosystem, they will naturally gravitate toward the protocols where reasonable value accrues to the token holders. The success of the protocol or the company building the protocol isn't necessarily a measure of the success of the token.  Investors doing their due diligence need to understand the whole spectrum of token characteristics, from the project's monetary policy to how the token facilitates interaction among the users. Add in the technical complexities of a lot of these projects, and you begin to get an idea of how early we are in this space.  Ultimately, the role of the crypto token in the protocol is essential to get right, but it isn't a sufficient condition.  The token needs to do several things, and do them all right. It needs to incentivize the right economic behavior from the participants. It needs to enable the right modes of interaction among the stakeholders, including the users, investors and the development team. It needs to be able to build network effects and grow the ecosystem without hampering the incentives of existing stakeholders.  It needs to ensure that value is generated on the platform, and that value is distributed among the different stakeholders fairly in order to sustain the ecosystem for the long run.

42428406,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7hBh,1515322802,"A Legal Renaissance, Blockchain Style","Joshua Ashley Klayman is co-head of global law firm Morrison & Foerster LLP 's Blockchain + Smart Contracts Group and chairs the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance Legal Working Group.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review, and represents the author's personal views, not necessarily those of her employer.      The year that just ended was transformational.  Blockchain and cryptocurrency entered the common vernacular. Previously, my family and friends, many of whom likely viewed me as earnest and well meaning – yet nonetheless tinfoil hat-wearing – politely tolerated my attempts to regale them with tales of how ""blockchain can change the world."" But now, dinner conversations regularly revolve around digital tokens and exchanges – and the ever-popular question, ""Why didn't you tell us sooner?"" I find myself smiling at the realization that, now, sometimes I am the one at the table who tries to change the subject when cryptocurrency come up.  Those exchanges aside, geeking out about blockchain remains one of my favorite pastimes, and, happily, in 2017, I had the pleasure of meeting many like-minded people. This time last year, however, I had no idea that many of my closest crypto-collaborators, my blockchain sounding boards, and, truly, some of my best friends, would be lawyers I'd meet in the market.  Lawyers at large firms, small firms, no firms, in-house. Lawyers from across the United States, and from around the world. Whether formed in think tanks and legal working groups, or forged on social media platforms, like LinkedIn, those blockchain legal relationships have proven to be meaningful, real and enormously valuable.  Perhaps that is my take-away: 2017 was the year that individual lawyers and law firms got over themselves and worked together, at least in the blockchain space.  My prediction: In 2018, the speed and scale of technological developments will make non-traditional legal teaming not just nice to have, but critical.  Lawyer as artist?  In recent years, the legal profession has not exactly been known for its imagination or its cross-firm collaboration.  Lawyers as a group are famously risk averse – intense legal training designed to illuminate potential hazards and liabilities also may make it hard to un-see or look beyond those identified risks. Lawyers often are applauded – or, at least, self-applauded – for their abilities to guide entrepreneurs down well-worn deal paths, sticking to precedent, doing things the way they are supposed to be done.  In fact, a more experienced lawyer once cautioned me, ""the last thing any client needs is a creative securities lawyer.""  But 2017 was a year that turned this and other conventional law firm wisdom on its head, at least in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. For me and likely many other lawyers, this was the year that I rediscovered a life of the mind and the law became fascinating and fun again.  At the end of 2016, the idea that the next twelve months would bring with them more blockchain and crypto-related work than one law firm, or even several law firms, could possibly handle, may have sounded to many like a wild and unrealistic hope. To the contrary, in 2016, at least one major financial institution had openly expressed an intention to develop smart contracts with a goal of reducing legal spend.  Could any of us have predicted how many new legal questions and theories would arise, or how many old and supposedly settled areas of the law would awaken and pose exciting new puzzles? Technological innovations and the proliferation of token sales and cryptocurrency trading have transformed deal planning into veritable law school issue-spotting exams.  Who knew that technologists and founders would be discussing the Howeytest at cocktail parties, that legal panels would be standing room only, or that the SEC's Cyber Unit would exist, let alone achieve a sort of celebrity status?  Alongside many brilliant founders, we lawyers in the crypto world have been given the tremendous opportunity and privilege, and the awesome responsibility, of being on the legal front lines of this exciting new ecosystem. We get to interpret and sometimes even shape the various regulatory frameworks that will or may apply. Shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients and each other, we lawyers have been given the chance to be co-artists and co-designers of compliant and truly transformative technological and commercial endeavors, and not just deal jockeys and naysayers.  New legal models  What has driven so many lawyers to band together as thoughtful, well intentioned allies?  Is it risk aversion? Partially. Many responsible lawyers may hesitate to give legal advice about novel questions without seeking the views of others whom they respect. Few lawyers may want to risk being the outlier, giving out-of-step advice. There may be a perceived safety in numbers.  Is it a matter of self-selection? In other words, are those lawyers who are most deeply immersed in the blockchain community naturally more open to new experiences, more collaborative, creative, and trusting, more inquisitive? Possibly. (Admittedly, as one of those lawyers, I kind of like that idea, because it paints a favorable picture. We all like to be special.)  In my view, however, these collaborative legal communities and relationships are emerging because they work and, I'd argue, are necessary for lawyers to continue to provide meaningful legal advice.  In the face of rapidly developing, expanding universe-scale innovations and ecosystems, we cannot go it alone. Even a single token sale, for instance, typically requires a team of lawyers from multiple jurisdictions, covering myriad legal content areas – among others, securities, commodities, money transmitter and other financial services, investment company and investment advisor, broker-dealer, tax and intellectual property – and many, if not all, of those legal content areas are changing or being re-examined in real time.  Fortunately for the crypto community, many talented lawyers have been brave enough to take stands and make them public, resulting in groundbreaking legal analyses and proposals – including ""A Securities Law Framework for Blockchain Tokens,"" ""The SAFT Project: Toward a Compliant Token Sale Framework,"" ""Not So Fast – Risks Relating to the Use of a “SAFT” for Token Sales” and “Conceptual Framework for Legal and Risk Assessment of Blockchain Crypto Property (BCP).""  These are not mere vanity projects. In a legal landscape filled with risk and few bright lines, we still need to provide practical advice to our clients now.  Rather than analytically wrestling alone with, for example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's The DAO enforcement action or Munchee cease and desist order, by understanding, critiquing and building upon our legal peers’ views, we arguably collectively can come to better reasoned views, and do so more quickly. Our learning in this space is incremental; why not build a knowledge ladder together and climb it?  Perspective sharing among lawyers (and interested non-lawyers) may take place in working groups (like the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance), ""think tanks"" like Wharton RegTech, panel discussions, LinkedIn posts or even just quick calls to across town (or across-the-world) colleagues or so-called competitors. To my mind, it matters less how these discussions take place than that they take place.  Blockchain technology has enabled us to form new communities that transcend geographic, socioeconomic and other traditional boundaries. Maybe it makes sense that the old, siloed law firm models need to evolve, as well.  We are experiencing a technological tidal wave of new business models and novel legal questions, and regulators, market participants and lawyers all are trying to navigate the current. The entire blockchain ecosystem arguably benefits when lawyers focus some of their energies outward, beyond their individual firms – advancing legal discussion and theory and grappling together to interpret and apply legal frameworks – rather than solely inward.  This shift in priority from maximizing at all costs an individual firm’s competitive advantage to developing a shared, industry-wide understanding may yield powerful economic, intellectual and interpersonal benefits, just as blockchain technology itself promises.  Aligning and realigning ourselves in flexible, nimble teams, across organizations and areas of expertise, may result in better thinking, more refined reasoning, a deeper combined knowledge reservoir. Not to mention more fun.  The future is fast  In our blockchain space, the very speed of change appears to be accelerating.  What we tinfoil hat wearers hoped for in 2016 is beginning to happen. Bitcoin futures exist in our present. Hedge funds are trading cryptocurrency. Governments around the globe are moving forward with blockchain technology initiatives. The United Nations' pilot program reportedly has sent vouchers to refugees using the ethereum blockchain.  The token sale genie is not going back into the bottle, and many predict torrents of self-described security tokens next year, particularly once a sufficient number of alternative trading systems have been launched.  Entrepreneurs and investors, eager to devise imaginative capital-raising techniques, are exploring mini IPOs and the intersection of equity crowdfunding and token sales. Chambers and Partnersreleased its first-ever list of blockchain and cryptocurrency lawyers globally. Legal white papers are quoted like bestsellers, and just about everyone has a view about the SAFT. It is an exciting time to be a crypto lawyer.  In my view, 2018 is likely to bring with it types of technological and economic artistry that we cannot presently envision, and nearly all of those innovations will need to be understood and analyzed through a legal lens. The global blockchain and cryptocurrency community needs a strong, yet quickly adaptive, base of legal understanding on which to build and blossom. We need an informed regulatory climate that protects individuals, while encouraging technological innovation to flourish.  The future is fast, and our legal advice must be sound. In 2018, cooperative and creative thought leadership by blockchain lawyers (and non-lawyers) will be key.

42428395,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7grh,1515319224,Regulatory Whack-a-Mole Won’t Beat Crypto Evasion,"Bradley Tusk is the founder and CEO of Tusk Ventures, which works with a variety of startups in regulated industries and has holdings in Coinbase and Ripple.      Everyone saw this coming.  TheNew York Times reports that both the Russian and Venezuelan governments are trying to evade U.S. sanctions by creating new, state-sponsored cryptocurrencies that can avoid U.S. jurisdiction. Of course they are – that's what rouge actors do. The question for us is how we deal with it.  There's a cliché called ""death by a thousand cuts."" In trying to resolve each specific problem only after it arises, eventually there are just too many wounds and the patient dies.  If the U.S. government just tries to go after each problematic example of crypto on an ad-hoc basis, that's exactly what will happen (just like the War on Drugs has been a complete and utter failure) and it'll never get ahead of the problem. That presents opportunity.  This is not the time to play whack-a-mole. This is the time to recognize that crypto is real and here to stay. It's time to start forming sensible regulations to help govern the sector broadly and wisely.  What does that look like in practice? These are the first four steps we should consider:  Acknowledge the reality  First, our institutions need to realize that the more they try to deny the legitimacy of cryptocurrency, the more they inadvertently reinforce why it exists in the first place.  Trust in official institutions like government, organized religion, the media, and higher education are at an all-time low, all over the world. That's why people want decentralized alternatives.  The more that top officials in the public and private sectors keep calling bitcoin a fad (or worse), the more they signal that they don't get it.  No one knows for sure whether any specific currency will succeed or fail long-term, but I do know that crypto isn’t going away. The federal government needs to recognize this too.  Industry acceptance  Likewise, the industry needs to recognize that the institutions aren't going away, either.  There are always bad actors in every sector and every walk of life. The public relies on government and the media to help separate the good from the bad.  Absent embracing some form of regulations, the bad guys like Russia and Venezuela (or sham initial coin offerings with no technological value) will drag everyone down.  Concrete steps forward  That's why we need national regulations on crypto assets (a 50-state patchwork approach is a very predictable disaster).  We need to accept it as a new and permanent addition to the financial system.  And then we need to regulate it as such: bank charters, licenses, standards, best practices and reviews.  We have a slew of regulations to ensure that banks, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, mortgage lenders and a host of other financial institutions meet certain standards. Some of those regulations make sense. Others don't. But we all agree we need some structure to provide guidance, direction and ensure good behavior (or at least try to).  The same applies here. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission should start working on what a national regulatory structure would look like and how it would work and the major players in the industry should eagerly volunteer to help provide ideas, advice, information and feedback.  Take it to the next level  Then it needs to go global.  Sure, between President Trump's views on NATO, the U.N., NAFTA and free trade, this isn't exactly a watershed moment for global cooperation. But for the very same reasons that bitcoin's creation was fueled by a lack of faith in the financial system, if the standards governing crypto aren't relatively similar everywhere, that futile game of whack-a-mole is still going to exist.  And while we may not see the U.S. take the lead during this administration, by the time we have U.S. standards fully in place, we may have new leadership in Washington. In the interim, the World Bank and IMF should do as much as they can to start producing sensible global standards (including those that can help exile state-sponsored currencies designed to evade sanctions).  Even if the value of bitcoin (or XRP or ETH or anything else) plunges, crypto will still be here. People will still search for alternatives to the status quo.  Either we can pretend it's not real and only exacerbate all of the problems by sticking our heads in the sand or we can embrace the advancement of new ideas, platforms and technologies and bring them into the fold, rationally and thoughtfully.  Russia and Venezuela are betting we'll pick the former. Let's prove them wrong.
