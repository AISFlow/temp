42399365,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixbZ,1474914622,P&C Insurer Trials Blockchain for Catastrophe Coverage,"One of Japan's largest property insurers is co-developing a prototype blockchain system for insurance derivatives.  Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings announced today that it is working with a firm called Soramitsu to develop a means to purchasing and exchanging insurance policies related to natural disasters and other catastrophic events.  The company said in a statement:  ""The Derivative System Using Blockchain Technology (tentative name) that Sompo Holdings and Soramitsu have begun jointly developing aims to create a service that simultaneously shares data such as contract details on the blockchain to accurately and swiftly carry out every step in the insurance process, from managing risk aggregation for derivative products to determining whether or not to pay out on claims and implementing procedures to pay compensation.""  Sompo isn't alone in exploring whether the technology can be used to create financial buttresses against disastrous situations.  Last year, French insurance firm Allianz announced that it was developing a prototype platform for the exchange of catastrophe bonds. At the time, the company cited the potential to increase the ""reliability, controllability and speed"" of those trades by using a blockchain-based system.  Further, last week, blockchain startup Symbiont held a demonstration in New York for a group of insurers and financial firms that saw it present a new system for exchanging catastrophe swaps. (An in-depth look at that demonstration can be found here).  According to Sompo, the trial with Soramitsu will potentially extend beyond the catastrophe insurance platform.  What these new products might look like remains to be seen, but Sompo indicated that any future developments would seek to ""to contribute to the safety, security and health of our customers"".

42399369,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixkQ,1474902011,8 R3 Banks Test Intel Blockchain Platform,"A group of eight R3 member-banks have successfully tested a blockchain prototype that simulated the exchange of US Treasury bonds.  Though a familiar use case for the tech, the test is notable given that it used technology developed by Intel and unveiled earlier this year. Called 'Sawtooth Lake', the platform offers a compelling take on how secure hardware could play a role in distributed ledger architecture.  Intel vice president Jerry Bautista said in a statement:  ""We believe collaborative exploration of blockchain usages is key to the development of this emerging technology.""  According to R3, the test involved the use of ""non-cloud-based nodes"" based in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America that were run by the banks as well as R3 and Intel. CIBC, ING Bank, HSBC, Scotiabank, Societe Generale, State Street, UBS and UniCredit took part in the test.  While a seemingly small detail, the statement hints at R3's thinking on its project architecture and the issues it believes may be inherent should financial institutions seek to host blockchain networks in the cloud.  Statements given by R3 head of research Tim Swanson at the Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai last week build on this idea further as he cautioned that ""the cloud"" is perhaps best conceived as a fancy word for ""other people's computers"".  ""Magic internet chains, magic internet coins, whatever the buzzword du jour is, no matter how you cut these systems, they are cryptographic data stored on a cloud,"" he told the audience. ""If you have to rely on an outside party, you still have to depend on these organizations to handle uptime and maintenance. There's no blueprint for that.""  The comments come at a time when cloud providers including IBM and Microsoft are demonstrating an increasing interest in blockchain technology.

42399373,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixnN,1474897973,Blockchain Post-Trade Startup Juzhen Raises $23 Million Series A,"Juzhen Financials, a startup led by China UnionPay veteran Lilin Sun, has raised $23m (¥153m) to develop clearing and settlement solutions based on distributed ledger technology.  The Series A funding was led by Wanxiang Holdings and included support from its blockchain-focused investment subsidiary Fenbushi Capital. The funding marks the largest investment round raised yet by an Asia-based blockchain startup, CoinDesk data reveals.  As a result, the Shanghai-based startup becomes one of the best positioned blockchain firms to seek to collaborate with banking incumbents on solutions for post-trade, with its potential market including broker-dealers, custodian banks, clearinghouses and exchanges.  But while Juzhen’s goals are similar in intent to other international firms including New York's Digital Asset Holdings and London's Clearmatics, Lilin noted that he believes China is in need of its own solutions provider.  Lilin told CoinDesk:  ""If you want to change the infrastructure, it takes a long time. It’s a lot of engineering work, and you have to understand the culture. We understand the Chinese market.""  Founded in 2014, Juzhen has long been working to determine how distributed technologies could offer solutions to problems in China's financial markets, even before Lilin said it shifted its focus to blockchain technology.  Lilin said he has long been interested in applying peer-to-peer technologies to finance, beginning with his use of eDonkey Network, a file sharing service created by Ripple and Stellar founder Jed McCaleb. (If that sounds too-early-to-be-true, at one point in the conversation, Lilin even delightedly showed a selfie of himself with McCaleb).  ""Lot of mistakes still happen in post-trade every day, but with blockchain, it’s easier to balance, faster and more accurate,"" he said.  Lilin also asserted that Juzhen is seeing traction with its ideas, amid a broader uptick in interest in the technology among China-based financial firms.  So far, Lilin said Juzhen is already working with partners including online banking giant Webank and the regional blockchain consortium ChinaLedger, both of which spoke at last week's Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai.  China's advantage  But while Juzhen's goals may seem ambitious, Lilin is optimistic about its prospects given that he believes China offers an accommodating regulatory climate for startups.  Whereas in the US regulation ""comes first"", Lilin said that China encourages innovation before deciding on the best rules to implement. Echoing comments made by executives from blockchain startup Circle, Lilin noted that this is why he believes mobile payments have so far taken off in China, but struggled elsewhere.  Overall, Lilin described his strategy with Chinese regulators as one that will keep the government ""close but not too close"" as it works to scale its offerings.  ""We are talking to an number of Chinese government departments and we are involved in several workshops and discussions,"" he said, adding:  ""We’re trying to be friends, but keep them at arm’s length.""  The comments follow new public statements from China-based financial institutions in which they called for collaboration with regulators to help advance applications of the technology.  Pace of change  But while the new funding means Lilin can allocate more resources to personnel, it also means that it must work to address the technological limitations of blockchain that are still pressing today.  Lilin acknowledged, for example, noted that most China-based financial institutions (like their international peers) are worried about privacy and confidentiality, and that today, technological solutions to these concerns are still being sought.  As part of this push, Lilin said that he will fund academic research on financial cryptography, and that his firm has asked 10 university groups to submit ideas as part of a bid to collect new ideas on the subject.  ""We will continue to spend resources on the research of cryptography,"" he said.  Lilin indicated that he believes solutions could be found through the creative use of hardware as part of a distributed ledger system, and that he intends to explore this intersection as his firm moves ahead with its roadmap.

42399358,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixdX,1474892844,Swift Kicks-Off Sibos By Unveiling Blockchain Contest Winners,"The hosts of Sibos kicked off the global banking conference today by announcing the winners of a blockchain challenge it launched earlier this year.  Unveiled by Swift's head of innovation programs, Kevin Johnson, the news set a tone that was fitting given that 2016 marks the first year Sibos will feature a track dedicated exclusively to distributed ledgers. Taking place in April, the first annual ""Industry Challenge"" gave blockchain startups a chance to work with 20 Swift customers to determine if they could more efficiently exchange bonds.  As such, Johnson explained the challenge was part of a bid by Swift to open its doors to innovators with new ideas for how the technology could be used.  Johnson told CoinDesk:  ""We didn’t want to go out and find five companies doing the same thing.""  The winners were San Francisco-based Smart Contract (which built an ethereum ""smart bond"" based on the LIBOR rate); London-based Rise Financial Technologies (for its ""bespoke"" post-trade distributed ledger); and London-based Coin Sciences (which focused on bond trading).  The startups will now work with Swift to help explain distributed ledgers at events throughout the week, followed by additional mentorship. There is no cash prize affiliated with the award.  'The family table'  This wasn't the last of blockchain at the day's events, though, as Swift director and deputy head of investor services at SEB, Göran Fors, joined the three winners at ""the family table"" in the center of a room filled with about 150 Swift clients.  There, Fors said that Swift has been looking into blockchain for the past 18 months, something he took particular interest in due to his role at SEB Group, a Swedish financial conglomerate that last year generated SEK 44.14bn ($5.16bn).  ""Disruption is something that I as a user want to see,"" said Fors.  Yet, he cautioned that new technology should also generate new business opportunities, not ""just shift the way of doing things"".  Smart Contracts CEO Sergey Nazarov told the audience he was ""surprised by the appetite"" that senior executives at Swift had for implementing the technology in the near term. Further, he advised audience members to adopt similar strategies.  ""The real decision corporate folks have [to make], 'Is this a sustaining innovation or a disrupting innovation?' In either case, the sound investment is getting your system ready and cryptographically connected to these networks,"" he said.  Swift and Sibos  To observers, it may come as no surprise that Swift kicked off Sibos with a nod to its blockchain work given the company is widely perceived to be at risk for disintermediation by the tech.  Though Swift's secure payments messaging service last year helped initiate 6.1 billion transactions, settlement still takes days or months depending on the product. Meanwhile, upstart competitors using blockchain are promising to cut that time down to near zero.  Former Swift board member Marcus Treacher, for instance, announced last week that his new firm, distributed ledger startup Ripple, had partnered with six global banks to build a network capable of almost instantly settling a transaction.  However, Swift's head of innovation explained why these ostensible competitors, from both traditional banking and disruptive financial technology startups, have come together to experiment and build with blockchain.  Kevin Johnson concluded:  ""It’s not about the technology at the end of the day, it’s about the business needs.""
