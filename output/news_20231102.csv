42392151,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1SPT,1698968958,Sam Bankman-Fried Guilty on All 7 Counts in FTX Fraud Trial,"NEW YORK — Sam Bankman-Fried defrauded his customers and lenders, a New York jury found after a five-week trial for the FTX founder and former chief executive.  A tentative sentencing date was set for March 28, 2024. Bankman-Fried could spend decades in prison (and theoretically up to 115 years).  ""Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said outside the courthouse after the guilty verdicts on all seven charges were revealed. ""This kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time. We have no patience for it.""  An appeal seems likely: In a statement, defense attorney Mark Cohen said Bankman-Fried respects the jury's decision but maintains his innocence and will continue to ""vigorously fight the charges.""  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried (Probably) Won't Get a 115-Year Prison Sentence  Jurors began deliberating a little after 3 p.m. ET. Just before 7:40 p.m., the judge said they had reached a verdict. The attorneys and Bankman-Fried returned to the courtroom and the guilty verdict was read out shortly thereafter to the packed courtroom.  Bankman-Fried kept still when the verdict was read. He'd been instructed by the judge to look toward the jury box, and jurors were told to look toward the court clerk and judge.  ""The verdict unanimous, your honor,"" was the message from the 12 New Yorkers who voted guilty on all seven counts. The judge thanked the jurors for their service.  The jury reached the guilty verdicts on the first anniversary, coincidentally, of the award-winning CoinDesk scoop that spurred the former crypto mogul's downfall.  Sam Bankman-Fried's parents  As the foreperson read the guilty verdicts, Joseph Bankman, the defendant's father, buried his head into his lap from a seat in the viewing gallery.  His mother, Barbara Fried, kept still, back straight, with a kind of sullen expressionlessness – staring straight ahead.  After the judge left the courtroom, Bankman-Fried stood up and his lawyers leaned in and spoke to him. He didn't look back at the viewing gallery, even as his parents shuffled over to the wooden divider directly behind him.  Read More: The Sam Bankman-Fried Trial Is a Family Affair  Arms around each other, they stared at Bankman-Fried's back while roughly three dozen reporters swarmed around them.  Bankman-Fried still hadn't looked back at his parents or the rest of the gallery by the time he was escorted toward an exit at the front of the courtroom.  Just as he was about to reach the door, he shot back a final glance at his parents – with a blink-and-you'll-miss-it half-smile and nod.  His mother brought her hand to her chest with an audible thump.  A month-long trial  Bankman-Fried, 31, was arrested last December and tried on allegations of defrauding FTX investors and customers, and Alameda Research's lenders.  The once-prominent crypto exchange CEO pleaded not guilty to all charges, and went to trial at the beginning of October. Federal prosecutors sought to paint him as someone who deliberately set out to steal his customers' funds – around $8 billion – for use in a variety of purchases and investments, including real estate, sports sponsorships and venture investments.  His defense team argued that Bankman-Fried was an overworked businessman who made the mistake of assuming the company funds he used belonged to those companies, rather than their customers or investors.  Bankman-Fried acknowledged ""there were significant oversights,"" but said on the stand he did not defraud anyone or set out to take their funds.  ""A lot of people got hurt – customers, employees – and the company ended up in bankruptcy,"" Bankman-Fried said on his first day of testimony before the jury. ""I made a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes.""  FTX collapsed nearly a year ago, after CoinDesk's Ian Allison reported that Alameda held a massive amount of FTX's exchange token, FTT, a revelation which, combined with a tweet from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, sparked what Bankman-Fried described as a ""run on FTX"" – ultimately leading to FTX, Alameda and the companies' various subsidiaries filing for bankruptcy.  Key FTX and Alameda executives, including former Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang, former Head of Engineering Nishad Singh and former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, pleaded guilty to various charges and testified against Bankman-Fried during the trial, saying that they had taken direction from the MIT grad who co-founded the companies. A number of other former employees similarly testified that Bankman-Fried set the direction for FTX's operations.  Bankman-Fried, however, argued that he trusted his handpicked lieutenants to safely operate the companies while he was busy with his own roles as the head of the multibillion-dollar empire, including acting as the public face of FTX and lobbying regulators and lawmakers.  All told, Bankman-Fried was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud against FTX's customers, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Alameda's lenders, conspiracy to commit securities fraud against FTX's investors, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud against FTX's customers and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

19731205,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558865,1698966038,Ethereum Yet To Shake Off 2022 Bear Hangover: Glassnode,"Data from Glassnode shows Ethereum is still experiencing negative momentum despite the year-to-date rise that the asset has observed. Ethereum MVRV Ratio Has Recently Indicated Negative Momentum According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the MVRV ratio has recently been below its 180-day moving average (MA). The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” refers to an indicator that measures the ratio between the Ethereum market cap and realized cap. The “realized cap” here is a capitalization model for ETH that assumes the true value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last moved on the blockchain. This is unlike the market cap, of course, which calculates the asset’s total value using the current spot price. Since the price at which each coin was last moved on the network can be assumed to be the price it was bought, the realized cap can be looked at as a sum of the total capital that the investors have used to purchase ETH. Related Reading: Solana Whales Deposit To Exchanges, Selloff Incoming? As the MVRV ratio compares the value that the holders are carrying right now (the market cap) against the amount that they have invested into the cryptocurrency, it can provide us with information about their profit/loss status. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV ratio, as well as its 180-day MA, over the last few years: The two metrics have gone through a cross in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 44, 2023 When the MVRV ratio is above the 1 mark, it means that the average investor is sitting on some profits right now, while it being below the level implies the dominance of loss in the market. From the graph, it’s visible that the Ethereum MVRV ratio observed some rise as the rally started at the start of this year. During this period, the indicator remained above its 180-day MA. “Periods, where the MVRV Ratio trades above this long-term mean, indicate investor profitability is increasingly meaningful, and is often a signal of a rising market,” explains Glassnode. In the last few months, though, as the Ethereum price has found some struggle, the metric has gone under its 180-day MA. The analytics firm notes, “despite the positive market performance for ETH YTD, by this metric the market is still experiencing negative momentum.” Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Why Ethereum Is Underperforming Against Bitcoin As is apparent from the chart, the Ethereum MVRV ratio has very recently just started to break above this mark, following the rally towards the $1,800 level. It’s still very early in the breakout, though, so it’s unclear if it will actually sustain there. “It seems that the hangover from the 2022 bear is still being slowly worked through,” says the report. It’s not something new that ETH is going through a phase like this; as the graph highlights, the asset has also faced similar periods of uncertainty in the past. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, up 1% in the past week.

Sellinger said Thursday in a statement.  Officials discovered the funds in crypto wallets belonging to Christopher Castelluzzo, a convicted drug trafficker, and his co-conspirators, according to federal officials. The wallets held the laundered proceeds of the crew's mail-order cocaine and designer drug operations, which were active between 2010 and 2015.  “Our forfeiture action of $54 million should serve as a lesson to those who mistakenly believe we can't trace their illicit behavior or their ill-gotten proceeds,"" FBI Newark Special Agent in Charge James E. Dennehy said in a statement.  What started out as $9,000 in ETH when they first invested the drug proceeds blossomed into about $53 million, authorities said, plus a wide assortment of other tokens Castelluzzo obtained, including solana (SOL), cardano (ADA) and bitcoin. Because it was tied to the original drug trafficking, the U.S. seized it as a forfeiture.  Castelluzzo and others were originally busted in a drug ring that was run through darknet sites including Silk Road and Blue Sky, getting payment at the time in bitcoin. The busy operation was said to distribute a range of drugs including cocaine and methylone from China.  While Castelluzzo was in the midst of serving a 20-year prison sentence, authorities caught him talking about his crypto strategy – including an intention to evade taxes and liquidate his holdings outside the country, the U.S. attorney's office said.  “I sold millions of dollars worth of drugs every single week for almost four years,” Castelluzzo reportedly stated in a letter to the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office earlier this year.  In prison conversations, he and others are recorded debating the merits of various offshore destinations for the crypto fortune, including Malta, Ireland and Latin America.  ""Bahamas would be awesome,"" Castelluzzo is quoted as saying.

The bullish momentum left some players in disbelief, while others capitulated to the price action and tried to capture some of the profits. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Whales Rouse From Slumber To Threaten BTC Rally As of this writing, SOL trades at $40 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded a 30% profit, but the monthly chart saw a 70% increase, while other tokens hardly saw double-digit gains. Solana Rally Changes Arthur Hayes’ Mind SOL’s recent bullish price action is even more impressive when considering higher timeframes. At the end of 2022, due to the collapse of its most prominent supporter crypto exchange, FTX, the cryptocurrency lost almost all its yearly profits. During the 2021 bull run, Solana climbed to an all-time high of around $250. In the last days of FTX and Sam Bankman Fried (SBF), the cryptocurrency declined below $10. Now that the token approaches the $50 mark, critics like the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, have reconsidered their position. Hayes has been vocal about its stance regarding FTX, Bankman-Fried, and the other bankrupted companies in 2022 and the tokens associated with these entities. However, regarding SOL, the BitMEX Co-Founder said: Fam I have something embarrassing I must admit. I just bot $SOL, I know its a Sam-coin piece of dogshit L1 that at this point is just a meme. But it is going up, and I’m a degen. Let’s Fucking Go! Arthur Hayes Expects Further Gains The former BitMEX CEO has publicly expressed his position regarding Bitcoin’s potential to reach new all-time highs. A rally in the number one cryptocurrency would inevitably spill over to Solana. As NewsBTC reported, in a detailed analysis, Hayes highlighted the intricate connection between global financial trends and Bitcoin’s future, emphasizing the influence of government policies and financial disturbances on investment strategies. The former BitMEX CEO anticipates a period of market turbulence, with Bitcoin’s value chopping around $25,000 to $30,000, driven by negative real rates and a shift towards diversified investment portfolios. This, he believes, will particularly favor cryptocurrencies, such as Solana. Looking ahead, Hayes projects a bullish trend for Bitcoin, estimating its value could reach approximately $70,000 by the end of 2024, influenced by the Bitcoin Halving event and potential Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) launches. His long-term vision extends even further, predicting an extraordinary financial boom across various markets, potentially driving Bitcoin’s value between $750,000 and $1,000,000 by 2026. This optimistic forecast is rooted in his belief that major financial indices, like the NASDAQ and S&P, alongside other significant assets, will experience unprecedented growth, marking a historic boom in the financial markets.

42392148,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1SA5,1698959472,The Other FTX Case,"The allegations at the heart of the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, or “SBF” as he has come to be known, paint a picture of a large-scale fraud — sweeping in scope, but limited to the misadventures of a particular corporate family at FTX and Alameda Trading. Misuse of customer funds, neglect or abuse of basic accounting responsibilities and lavish personal and political spending are surely serious and garner headlines.  But the allegations are not particularly relevant for the vast majority of the people in crypto or fintech. The government’s case does not represent a systemic threat to the core business model of most firms in this space, assuming those firms don’t act as SBF is alleged to have done.  Andrew C. Adams is a partner in the New York office of Steptoe & Johnson LLP, and a member of the firm’s Blockchain & Cryptocurrency team. Kane Smith is an associate based in Steptoe’s Washington, D.C. office.  But it’s worth considering charges that prosecutors have not yet had the opportunity to pursue in this first SBF trial, because they are of potentially broader relevance to anyone operating in crypto. Charges of bank fraud and illegal money transmission will not be put to the jury in the current SBF trial, and may never be aired at a future SBF trial. But digital asset companies continue to face a regulatory and prosecutorial environment, where the threat of such charges hangs over good-faith actors seeking to participate in global markets through traditional banking rails.  The charges the government did not pursue in the current SBF case are of systemic importance to the industry, reflecting the specter of regulatory and prosecutorial pressure that dissuades traditional financial institutions from engaging with lawful, ethical and viable digital asset projects. The mere potential for such charges place crypto and other blockchain projects between a commercial rock and a regulatory hard place.  The current fraud charges  In the immediate wake of FTX’s spectacular collapse in November 2022, prosecutors at the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) rapidly proceeded to file charges alleging FTX’s misappropriation of customer funds.  On Dec. 9, 2022, a SDNY grand jury returned an eight-count indictment, charging Bankman-Fried with multiple counts of wire fraud and wire fraud conspiracy, securities and commodities fraud, campaign finance violations and one count of money laundering conspiracy tied to the alleged concealment of fraud proceeds and the transfer of those proceeds through the U.S. financial system. Each of these charges relate directly to the core fraudulent activity that allegedly allowed FTX to attract victim-investors and customers to the platform, while undermining its financial stability, according to prosecutors.  When the government unveiled these charges in December 2022, Bankman-Fried resided in the Bahamas, where FTX had most recently operated prior to its downfall. The United States moved swiftly after the original indictment to request Bankman-Fried’s arrest there and to move for his extradition. By Dec. 12, Bankman-Fried was in Bahamian custody and those proceedings were under way; and by Dec. 22, 2022, SBF appeared in a Manhattan federal courthouse. (Steptoe represents eight former FTX executives in connection with this case).  ‘Rule of specialty’ blocks additional charges – for now  The timing and circumstances of that extradition would later frustrate the government’s effort to move forward on additional charges. When Bankman-Fried consented to, and the Bahamas ordered, his extradition to the United States, the United States was constrained to move forward to trial only on charges subject to that consent and approval by its foreign partner.  The government did proceed to charge Bankman-Fried with additional crimes beyond those included in the original indictment and approved by its Bahamian counterparts.Those new counts included two of particular importance to the crypto industry – including exchanges, token-issuers and payment platforms diligently seeking to avoid regulatory or criminal pitfalls while also seeking to participate in global financial markets.  First, the new indictment included a variant of bank fraud that prosecutors have advanced as requiring mere proof of a scheme to obtain funds under the custody or control of a bank through false or fraudulent “pretenses, representations or promises,” without a related intent to defraud the affected bank. In its most simple form, prosecutors have used this charge to pursue fraudsters making false statements on checks provided to a merchant, which are then presented to a bank by the merchant rather than the fraudster. But in recent years prosecutors have looked to this charge — in essence, a “no loss” bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344(2) – in both the cryptocurrency space and the traditional correspondent banking space.  With respect to such cases predicated on the now-defunct “right to control” theory, the Supreme Court’s long-anticipated rejection of that theory of fraud – the argument that an entity’s loss of the right to control its resources is a substitute for an actual deprivation of a property interest – forecloses prosecutors’ use of bank fraud charges in crypto cases where no loss occurred But digital asset companies should be alert to the possibility that prosecutors may nevertheless pursue § 1344(2) charges, or other charges, particularly where there are tangible losses.  Second, the superseding indictment included a charge of operating a money transmission business without proper registration by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) or state-level authorities as proscribed by 18 U.S.C. § 1960 – an offense with no element of fraud or misstatement required, but rather a charge that elevates a failure to register with a regulator into the realm of criminal prosecution.  Prosecutors have been using this charge in crypto cases for years but not, as yet, in a forum as prominent as the current FTX trial. Nevertheless, a § 1960 charge carries felony penalties and significant exposure under the federal asset forfeiture laws, all without reference to fraud and, importantly, without any concern for whether the transmission of value is in the form of a “security,” “commodity” or “currency.”  Uncharged offenses offer critical lessons  In the case of Bankman-Fried and these late-filed charges, the superseding indictment includes certain key allegations that stand apart from those concerning fraud on investors, lenders or customers. Certain of those allegations describe precisely the dynamic that vexes legitimate companies seeking to do business through the U.S. banking system. As alleged, because many banks, at the time, “were reluctant to do business with cryptocurrency companies,” FTX instead “instructed customers to wire dollar deposits to bank accounts that were owned or controlled by Alameda” to avoid registering as a money service business and comply with know-your-customer (KYC) obligations.  The indictment alleged that a new entity would “function as an account to receive and transmit FTX customer deposits” and misstated in response to due diligence inquiries that the account would be for that entity’s own trading, falsely claiming that the entity was not a money services business. Once funds were deposited, Alameda personnel, “who maintained control” over that intermediate entity, “manually credited or subtracted [a] customer’s FTX account with the corresponding amount” of currency. These facts describe an attempt to utilize a third-party company and bank account for the ultimate purpose of operating a business touching the United States financial system and consumer base, in an attempt to navigate the type of hurdles that exist for many crypto companies at U.S. banks.  The banking environment for crypto companies had changed significantly over the past several years, with many banks that had previously expressed skepticism about dealing with crypto businesses jumping into the digital asset space with both feet prior to 2023. But over the course of the past year – fueled in part by the collapse of FTX and other prominent crypto companies in 2022 – U.S. banking regulators have moved aggressively to constrain traditional financial institution’s interactions with crypto markets. Many digital asset companies are struggling to address the commercial risks posed by a possible loss of banking services in a way that does not create regulatory or even criminal risks.  The criminal litigation that led to the evisceration of prosecutors’ “right to control” theory illustrates the importance of the adversary process in uncertain areas of the law. Similarly, the outer limits of the federal bribery and “honest services” criminal statutes came into focus through vigorous litigation arising from contentious and high-profile prosecutions resulting in convictions that were subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court. The Ripple case reflects a similar effort to push back against SEC “regulation by enforcement” in the digital asset space.  The reality is that U.S. prosecutors will continue to be drawn to investigate cases that appear to involve complex financial flows and structures, reflexively assuming that these structures must have been designed to evade applicable regulations or for some other improper purpose. As long as this dynamic is in play, and as long as the limits of prosecutorial authority are untested, the digital asset industry needs to pay close attention to the issues raised by these untried FTX charges.  Digital asset companies should be careful to ensure that steps they take to mitigate banking risks do not lead to regulatory or criminal exposure. In this environment, even unobjectionable use of financial intermediaries to conduct legitimate transactions may draw the attention of regulators or prosecutors. Digital asset companies should consult with counsel on structuring businesses that must contend with the commercial reality that access to these institutions brings significant benefits, efficiencies, and opportunities for scaling, while also contending with the prosecutorial pressure applied to their platforms and traditional institutions.  In the event of a conviction at SBF’s first trial, the prospect of the United States spending diplomatic and political capital with the Bahamas to obtain consent to try yet more charges tied to FTX may dwindle significantly. Nevertheless, crypto companies should still be attentive to the lessons of the charges that the government is not pursuing.

19728163,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558851,1698958841,"Analyst Raises Red Flag On Bitcoin Rally, Predicts Imminent Retreat After 35% Spike","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate above the $34,000 mark, aiming to surpass and reclaim its yearly high, theories suggest that a retracement may follow the current upward spike in the coming weeks. On this matter, the renowned crypto analyst known by the pseudonym “Crypto Soulz” recently shared insights on the potential short-term retracement for Bitcoin in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). BTC’s Local Top At $36,000 Signals Potential Reversal According to Crypto Soulz, a key resistance level for Bitcoin is identified at $37,370. The analyst suggests that this resistance level will not likely be retested from the current position. Additionally, Soulz highlights that liquidity has been absorbed around $36,000, which he considers a “trigger” for taking short positions. The analyst points out that the local top for BTC was observed at $36,000, where a long wick was formed, followed by a retracement. This price action is seen as a potential indication of a reversal. Related Reading: Shiba Inu volume Gains Momentum Moreover, Crypto Soulz emphasizes using on-chain data as a confluence for BTC positions. Soulz highlights that the spot market showed an uptrend before the perpetual futures contracts followed suit. The spot order book (OB) is stated to be increasing but expected to decrease, along with the perpetual market. If $36,000 indeed serves as a local top, the analyst suggests that both spot and perpetual should subsequently decrease. Furthermore, Soulz highlighted that BTC successfully broke through key technical indicators, such as the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), the 200-week SMA, and the 365-day SMA, which is currently acting as support. Ultimately, Soulz further states that there is no substantial liquidity available above $38,000. The analyst identifies two liquidity pools, as seen in the chart above: the first at $33,000, which he considers its initial target, and the second at $31,000, where a slight bounce may occur. Bitcoin Potential As Store Of Value In another development, Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro, delved into the characteristics of Bitcoin and its potential to serve as a store of value and hedge against monetary debasement. Drawing parallels to gold, Timmer highlighted Bitcoin’s “unique attributes” and its ability to potentially gain market share in times of inflation and excessive money supply growth. Timmer acknowledged that Bitcoin had followed a pattern of “boom-bust cycles,” much like its previous market behavior. However, he also emphasized Bitcoin’s evolving role as a commodity currency that aspires to be a store of value. Furthermore, Timmer described Bitcoin as “exponential gold,” suggesting that it shares similarities with gold but with additional growth potential. While gold has traditionally been recognized as a store of value, Timmer noted its limitations as a medium of exchange due to its deflationary nature and lack of efficiency. Timmer drew attention to historical periods, such as the 1970s and 2000s, when gold exhibited strength and gained market share. These periods coincided with structural regimes marked by high inflation, negative real rates, and excessive money supply growth. Related Reading: Cardano November Momentum – An Over 40% Increase In The Cards? Timmer hinted that Bitcoin, with its potential to serve as a hedge against inflation and debasement, could play a similar role in such environments. Considering Bitcoin’s attributes and the changing macroeconomic landscape, Timmer expressed optimism about its potential to join the ranks of gold as a valuable asset. While acknowledging the volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, Timmer believes that Bitcoin’s unique characteristics position it as a viable contender in the store of value space. Currently, BTC is trading at $34,700, reflecting a 1.5% increase over the past 24 hours as it persists in reaching the $35,000 mark.

The crypto exchange reported a third-quarter adjusted loss of $0.01 per share, compared to FactSet estimates for a loss of $0.55 per share, marking it the third consecutive earnings beat for Coinbase. Total revenue for the quarter was $674.1 million, beating analyst estimates of $650.9 million.

In its shareholder letter, Coinbase noted declining overall crypto markets and volatility as behind the fall in transaction revenue.  Looking at the fourth quarter, the company said it generated about $105 million of transaction revenue in October. The crypto exchange further said it expects to ""generate meaningful"" positive adjusted EBITDA for 2023, a slight revision from the previous goal of ""improving"" full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA.

Is the Rally Over?,"Solana almost doubled in price over the past weeks, but gave up some of its gains Thursday.  BitMex co-founder Arthur Hayes said he's been a buyer during the rush.  Institutional inflows to funds and rising activity supported the trend, but some signs suggest the rally could halt.  Solana's [SOL] spectacular comeback – up over 300% this year – has captivated crypto market participants after the coin was one of the most beaten-down assets during the bear market.  The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit $46.60 early Wednesday, a 14-month high price. It began the year at around $10.  Read more: A Year After Sam Bankman-Fried's Downfall, Solana and Other FTX Holdings Are Flying High  The momentum captured the attention of widely-followed crypto investor and BitMex exchange co-founder Arthur Hayes, who tweeted earlier this morning that he had purchased some.  After roughly doubling in price over the past two-plus weeks, however, SOL has stumbled a bit since, lower by about 15% since that Wednesday morning peak to the current $40.  Why solana (SOL) rallied  Solana's run came after many observers questioned its future following the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange and Alameda Research trading firm almost a year ago. Bankman-Fried and his companies were large investors in the Solana ecosystem.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Started Buying Solana's SOL at 20 Cents Using 'Alameda Profits,' He Says at His Trial  It's been institutional interest and large investment fund inflows helped the price recover, according to David Shuttleworth, research partner at Anagram.  Indeed, crypto funds holding SOL enjoyed nearly $100 million of inflows this year, CoinShares reported, the second largest amount after bitcoin [BTC]. Ether [ETH] funds, meanwhile, suffered $125 million of outflows.  Shuttleworth also took note of a recent uptick in developer activity.  A recent upgrade also helped the network to become more decentralized by lowering validator hardware requirements and enabling confidential transactions using zero-knowledge (ZK) tech, asset management firm 21Shares said in a report.  What's next for solana's (SOL) price?  Despite the bullish developments, some signs suggest the rally could halt, at least for a while.  Derivatives traders with leveraged short SOL positions – bets on lower prices – endured nearly $10 million of liquidations during the buying rush Wednesday, the most in over the past three months, CoinGlass data shows.  The action of traders forced to capitulate by closing directional bets often mark a local top or bottom for the price, say market observers.  Despite the encouraging signs of rejuvenation for the ecosystem, total value locked (TVL) on the Solana network still lingered at $855 million, down from $10 billion two years ago, per DefiLlama data.  Lookonchain pointed out that the last two Novembers have not been good ones for SOL. While the reasons seem obvious – early November 2021 was the epic top of the entire cryptocurrency market and November 2022 included the FTX meltdown – Lookonchain noted that the Solana Breakpoint conference, an annual gathering for the ecosystem, is an early November event (this year's version is currently taking place in Amsterdam) and has coincided with local tops in price.  Blockchain data by Lookonchain also shows that crypto wallets of FTX sent a total of 2.1 million SOL worth roughly $90 million to exchanges in the past 10 days, making the company a likely seller as the price soared.  The FTX estate – which held $1.16 billion of SOL as of late August – is benefiting from rising prices. The estate received permission to sell digital assets from the bankruptcy court in September and hired asset investment firm Galaxy Digital to manage its holdings.

Analyst Says ‘Time To Load On The Dips, It’s A Different Sentiment’","The crypto market is bullish, with several altcoins charting notable gains. Solana (SOL) leads this charge, which has seen a roughly 35% increase in value over the past week. This uptrend is not isolated to Solana alone; other major altcoins like XRP and Cardano (ADA) also enjoy significant upticks. This trend signals a potentially broader market recovery and offers a positive outlook for investors who have weathered a prolonged bear market. Related Reading: Top 5 Bitcoin-Like Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In The Crypto Bull Run Buying On The Dip: A Strategy For Growth Michaël van de Poppe, a renowned analyst in the crypto analysis sphere, has recently spoken out about the shift in market dynamics. In his view, altcoins are not just rising; they are breaking out, signaling a more profound change in the crypto ecosystem. This breakout could be the indicator of an even more substantial growth phase for these digital assets, according to the analyst. Amid this resurgence, Michaël van de Poppe has offered strategic advice to the crypto investment community. The analyst believes that the current prices of altcoins represent a dip in the market, presenting a prime opportunity for buying. With a clear shift in sentiment, the analyst encourages investors to capitalize on these lower entry points. The analyst also draws an alignment between the current market conditions and the end of the bear market cycle 2018, suggesting that we may be on the cusp of a similar reversal. With the US monetary policy tightening phase seemingly coming to an end, there’s an air of optimism that the bearish grip on the market may be loosening, according to the analyst. Van de Poppe’s analysis also posits that the market is transitioning, setting the stage for the conclusion of the bear cycle and the beginning of sustained growth. #Altcoins are breaking out significantly and I think majors are going to follow suit. Time to load on the dips, it’s a different sentiment. Hiking policy is coming to an end -> end of bear market in 2018. End of bear market as we speak. Enjoy the ride! — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 1, 2023 Altcoins: SOL And XRP Record Double Digit Gains Except For ADA Meanwhile, before Van de Poppe’s analysis, Solana and XRP had recorded double-digit gains, with Solana taking the lead, recording a massive gain of 35% in the past 7 days.

Both assets currently trade at $41.51 and $0.60, respectively, at the time of writing, with SOL recording a mere increase of 0.2% over the past 24 hours and XRP gaining 1.4% in the same period.

42392146,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1S4x,1698953361,Discredited Crypto Terrorist Funding Figures Gain Fresh Life in House Hearing,"Despite a raging online debate discrediting the scale of crypto support for terrorist groups, the story continues to resonate in important places. Most recently on Thursday, the ranking Democrat at a hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives quoted a figure of $130 million in digital assets flowing to terrorists.  Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) lamented those vast crypto donations to groups such as Hamas and praised the industry crackdown from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as one of the things the agency is ""doing right.""  ""Some $130 million of cryptocurrency has gone to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad,""  Sherman said at an SEC oversight hearing of one of the subcommittees of the House Financial Services Committee. He said the assets are ""designed to be perfect means for hidden money, hence the term cryptocurrency, getting to the worst actors in the world.""  Massive industry pushback on those initial reports – including an Oct. 10 account from the Wall Street Journal – led to some backtracking. The Wall Street Journal issued a partial correction to clarify what it knew about the flow of virtual currency to terrorists, which had originally cited more than $90 million tied to Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). And the crypto analytics company the newspaper had relied on for data, Elliptic, put out a detailed blog post explaining how its transaction data had been misconstrued and that an actual amount of crypto donated to Hamas since Oct. 7 by the most prominent funding campaign – Gaza Now – was closer to $21,000.  Read More: Media Reported Hamas Got Millions Via Crypto, but the Data Provider They Cited Says It Was Misconstrued  A spokesperson for Sherman didn't immediately respond to questions from CoinDesk on his use of the statistics, which are now reflected in the congressional record.  Sherman had been among more than a hundred lawmakers signing an Oct. 17 letter that used the WSJ reporting as the impetus for a demand that the administration do more to combat illicit use of digital assets, especially in light of Hamas' attack on Israel. That letter cited more than $130 million in cryptocurrencies being raised by Hamas and PIJ.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/02/discredited-crypto-terrorist-funding-figures-gain-fresh-life-in-house-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11003a8b628b7aec237c21412138936c87ca56cd-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19725542,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558892,1698952009,Celestia Price Prediction as TIA Pumps 15%; Which Cryptos Could Surge Next During the Bull Run,"The price of Celestia (TIA) has surged over 15% since yesterday, making it one of the biggest gainers on CoinMarketCap. With the TIA token now hovering around $2.50, early investors are wondering just how high its price could go in the remaining weeks of 2023. This article will take a closer look at Celestia’s price action, forecast where the token could be headed next, and highlight some of the most promising new cryptocurrencies that could be primed for a significant breakout. Celestia’s TIA Token Surges After Mainnet Launch – Can the Momentum Continue? It’s been a great start to life for Celestia, with the project’s mainnet going live on October 31 and TIA tokens airdropped to 580,000 users. The hype around this event has resulted in a surge in demand for TIA, making it the 20th most-traded cryptocurrency globally. Although the token is only a few days into its lifespan, investors are speculating that the uptrend could continue throughout November and beyond. The token’s high of $2.86 on Wednesday is a natural target for bulls and may act as a minor resistance zone. If TIA can breach this level, the token will be in uncharted territory. The next level to watch will be the $3.00 and $5 marks, likely representing psychologically important barriers for TIA holders. With the current momentum and hype around the token, TIA could certainly aim for these levels in the coming weeks. However, sustainability remains a concern, given the likelihood of profit-taking after such an explosive debut. Regardless of what happens, it’s clear that Celestia has captured the attention of the crypto community, with its rapid rise highlighting the enthusiasm for new projects. Which New Cryptos Could Be Next to Surge? While Celestia’s TIA token has been in the spotlight recently, several other emerging cryptocurrencies could be poised for a breakout. As investors seek the next hot altcoin, the three projects below could have the ingredients needed to attract significant demand before the end of the year: Access Cloud BTC Mining & Staking Using Innovative Bitcoin Minetrix Platform First up is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a revolutionary platform that allows users to mine Bitcoin and earn rewards simply by staking their BTCMTX tokens. This mechanism, called “Stake-to-Mine,” provides a more accessible way for users to participate in the mining process without needing expensive computing equipment. Bitcoin Minetrix’s platform is still in development, although interested investors can buy BTCMTX tokens in advance through the project’s tier-based presale phase. The price per BTCMTX token is currently $0.0114, although it will increase by 10% in just over four days. Through this setup, those who invest the earliest are rewarded with a more attractive entry point – which could prove fruitful once BTCMTX is listed on the open market. Alongside speculative potential, BTCMTX investors can also benefit from staking rewards of over 185% APY, with 222 million tokens pledged already. If the development team can deliver on their roadmap goals, including a mobile app launch and partnerships with industry-leading cloud mining providers, then BTCMTX could be primed for an end-of-year surge. Visit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale Meme Kombat Gamifies Meme Culture with High Yields & Battling Mechanic Next up is Meme Kombat (MK), a brand-new meme coin project that draws inspiration from the famous Mortal Kombat franchise. Meme Kombat’s flagship feature is its Ethereum-based battle arena, where users can place bets using MK tokens on the outcomes of AI-powered battles. These battles feature famous meme coin characters like Wojak and DOGE – providing an engaging gameplay experience for crypto enthusiasts. On top of the battle mechanic, Meme Kombat offers a high-yield staking protocol whereby MK holders can generate APYs of 112%. Notably, these yields begin accruing during the presale, with rewards able to be withdrawn once the platform officially launches. From a tokenomics perspective, Meme Kombat’s team has allocated 50% of the MK supply to presale buyers and 30% for staking/battling rewards. This highlights their community-focused approach – one of the main reasons that Meme Kombat’s presale has generated such traction in recent weeks. The presale has already raised over $1 million and offers MK tokens at the low price of $0.1667. With DEX listings scheduled for once the presale concludes, MK could be another exciting altcoin primed for a price surge. Visit Meme Kombat Presale Groundbreaking TG.Casino Offers Anonymous Crypto Gambling Integrated Into Telegram App Lastly, TG.Casino (TGC) is a fully-fledged cryptocurrency casino integrated directly into the Telegram app. By integrating with Telegram, TG.Casino can provide users with a seamless and intuitive gambling experience. Users don’t need to download additional software or applications and can place bets anonymously since TG.Casino doesn’t require KYC verification. Moreover, users can fund their accounts using crypto, including TG.Casino’s native TGC token. Those who opt to place bets using TGC will be rewarded with 25% cashback on any sustained losses. These elements are underpinned by a full gaming license from Gaming Curacao, along with end-to-end encryption to ensure user data remains secure. TGC holders can even stake their tokens and earn yields exceeding 313% annually. Like the two projects mentioned above, TG.Casino is still in its presale phase, yet it allows investors to buy TGC tokens before their open market debut. TGC tokens are currently available for $0.15, although with over 66% of the allocation snapped up already, there’s a growing belief that the presale could sell out soon.

19725322,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558758,1698951601,Bitcoin’s 108% YTD Surge Highlights Crypto’s Growing Prominence,"Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a remarkable surge in its price, nearing the $36,000 mark, sending ripples across the cryptocurrency market. While multiple factors contributed to this price rally, one significant driver appears to be the decision by the US Federal Reserve to halt interest rate hikes, albeit with the potential for future increases. Additionally, the overall sentiment in the crypto market remains bullish, with a collective market cap of approximately $1.36 trillion, bolstered by the expectation of positive regulatory developments. Institutional Focus The recent listing of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by prominent financial giants such as ARK Invest, BlackRock, and Invesco on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) site has ignited speculation about their strategic intentions. These ETF listings are a clear indicator that these financial powerhouses are aiming at capturing the attention of money-loaded investors and institutional players. Related Reading: XRP Hits $0.6 In Unstoppable Surge: How High Can It Go This November? Such ETFs are designed to cater to the needs of larger investors who prefer a more regulated and mainstream entry into the crypto market. They offer exposure to Bitcoin without the need for direct ownership, making it an attractive proposition for institutions seeking to diversify their portfolios. The move to list these ETFs on the DTCC, a crucial infrastructure provider for the financial industry, signals a growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies within the traditional financial ecosystem. Federal Reserve’s Influence On Bitcoin Price The current BTC price, as reported by CoinGecko, stands at $35,365, reflecting a notable 24-hour gain of 2.5% and a seven-day increase of 2.0%. The decision made by the US Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates without further increases plays a pivotal role in the current state of the crypto market. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell kept the possibility of future rate hikes on the table, dependent on macroeconomic conditions. While this move has provided temporary relief to crypto enthusiasts, the uncertainty about future rate increases still looms. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $35,365. Chart: TradingView.com Historically, raising interest rates has been perceived as a bearish signal for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. Investors often seek safer options when interest rates rise, as these assets are considered more stable and provide a better return on investment. Therefore, the Federal Reserve’s decision to pause interest rate hikes has provided a favorable environment for BTC and the broader crypto market to flourish.

Solana Whales Have Deposited Tokens Worth $34.1 Million To Binance According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a few large SOL transfers have occurred on the Solana blockchain during the past day. Three of the transactions were all headed towards a centralized exchange: Binance. The first of these saw the movement of 256,652 SOL (worth about $11.3 million at the time of the transfer), the second 249,999 SOL ($10.8 million), and the third 282,695 SOL ($12 million). As the amounts involved in these transfers are substantial, it’s safe to assume that whale entities were behind them. Since the whales are influential beings in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, their transactions can be worth keeping an eye on, as they may precede volatility in the price. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Why Ethereum Is Underperforming Against Bitcoin How their transfers may affect Solana depends on what they intend to do with them. As the details of the first of these transactions show below, it would appear that the transfer originated from an unknown wallet (which is possibly the whale’s personal, self-custodial address). Looks like the transfer needed a very negligible fee of 0.000005 SOL to go through | Source: Whale Alert As the whale has moved their coins from self-custody to this central entity, they likely wanted to make immediate use of one of the services the platform provides. This includes selling, of course, but it’s hard to say from the transaction data alone whether that is the case here. When looking at the surrounding price action, though, selling would appear like a reasonable possibility after all, as the SOL price has enjoyed a sharp rally recently that has put the asset 34% in the green for the past week. It’s not unusual to see whales jumping at substantial profit-taking opportunities like this rally has provided. As such, if profit-taking is indeed the goal, then the rally could feel some impedance from the deposit. Interestingly, the data of the other two Binance deposits from today reveals the addresses involved were the same as the ones in this transfer, implying that the same entity could be behind them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Ramp Up Selling, BTC To Decline Below $32,000? The latest of these moves was made just a few hours ago, which might add merit to the theory that the whale is participating in selling, as Solana has seen an additional 10% uplift in the past 24 hours, so this humongous investor may be capitalizing on the opportunity. Another whale has also made a large Solana transfer inside the window of the last day, but this move is between two unknown wallets, making it hard to guess what the purpose behind it could have been. The largest SOL transaction in the past day | Source: Whale Alert This $66.2 million move could have been for selling through a P2P deal, or perhaps it was something as simple as the whale changing addresses. Whatever the case might have been with this and the other transfers, though, Solana has managed to keep up its climb just fine so far.

42392145,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1Rzp,1698946342,"If PayPal's Stablecoin Is a Security, Anything Could Be","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is requesting documents related to PayPal’s relatively new stablecoin, PYUSD. The payments giant is reportedly complying with the request, it disclosed in a quarterly report.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This marks the latest in a series of regulatory actions against the crypto industry taken by the securities regulator led by Chairman Gary Gensler. Notably, the SEC filed suit against the Binance-brand BUSD stablecoin issued by Paxos in March. PayPal’s stablecoin is also a product co-managed by Paxos.  To many observers, this latest subpoena, which could but does not necessarily have to lead to an official lawsuit, reeks of the SEC “picking winners” in the emergent world of crypto. In a sub-sector dominated by crypto natives, PayPal was the first major fintech to launch a stablecoin, followed shortly after by VISA.  At launch, in the depths of “crypto winter,” PayPal’s entrance signaled a strong show of support for the technology, which many see as beneficial to U.S. interests. Stablecoins are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and so arguably increase global demand for and access to greenbacks, which could be said to bolster U.S.’ monetary hegemony.  Though the PYUSD launch was also a controversial move. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), who until recently led the important House Financial Services Committee (from 2019 to 2023), said she was “deeply concerned” about the stablecoin in August. Stablecoins are a significant point of contention for U.S. lawmakers and regulators, and one of the few areas of crypto where progress is being made on the legislative front.  Waters has said the “issuance of a new form of money” requires “federal guardrails.”  But this may not actually be true. As Jesse Austin Campbell (who goes by his middle name) said, there is a massive exception to the so-called “Howey Test,” the guideline used by the SEC to determine what falls under its remit, which will likely be cited to argue that PYUSD is an “investment contract” under existing securities laws if the SEC decides to file suit.  “The problem is … if you are already in a more restrictive regulatory regime,” Campbell said. “That is to say, you know what's not captured by Howey? Banking activities and insurance — your JPMorgan checking account is not a security even if it pays you interest.”  By all accounts, PayPal followed the rules when launching PYUSD, a product that is overseen by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), one of the foremost financial regulators in the world.  Then there’s the open question of whether stablecoins, a type of blockchain-based asset meant to keep a monetary peg, could even be said to resemble securities. I asked Campbell for a good faith interpretation of the SEC’s argument:  “I think what the SEC would say to these things is “guys, we believe this is a securities arrangement,” because if you look at Howey as a coherent whole (not the specific four-prong test), the principles-based thrust of it is that if a ‘collective enterprise’ exists to make money than that is a securities arrangement. I think you really have to simplify it down to that level.  “PayPal and Paxos have a joint commercial arrangement to create this stablecoin — that they’re going to issue, not sell, to people — so as a result of that issuance there is a collective enterprise to make profits, and therefore it’s security.”  The only problem with that reading, Campbell said, is that under existing securities rules, the “profits” in question would need to come from a “collective enterprise” where the “expectation of profits” primarily comes through the “efforts of others.”  It seems almost silly to say this, but PayPal and Paxos are in this arrangement together. The effort is theirs. “This kind of asks the question, ‘where's the outside money coming from,’” Campbell said.  The obvious response here would be, well, people who send money to PayPal to receive stablecoins that they can use on- and off-platform. That money is then supposed to be stored by PayPal and Paxos in a reserves fund, which may or may not reinvest the capital to earn interest — the same type of arrangement that had made Tether and Circle, the two largest stablecoin issuers, into cash cows.  The only trouble is — whether or not these types of enterprises pay out a portion of those reinvested returns to stablecoin users or minters, which to my knowledge isn’t being discussed for PYUSD anyway, but would complexify the idea of a “collective enterprise’s profits” — this same type of arrangement would apply to any number of financial tools that are decidedly NOT securities.  See also: What's Wrong With PayPal's Stablecoin? | Opinion  Stablecoins, in this sense, resemble checking accounts, giftcards, reward points and … PayPal’s primary product — the cash-equivalent tokens used for online money transfers.  Campbell referred to this situation as a “reductio ad absurdum.” Effectively, the SEC can say anything is a security as long as they say it is. To be fair, others like crypto-focused lawyers Brian Frye and Lewis Cohen have made similar remarks, in part because the Howey Test is vague enough, technically, where any purchase that could lead to a profit — from fine art to collectible sneakers — could be considered a securities offering.  The question is: where to draw the line.  “If everything is a security so long as the SEC wants to define it that way, then from a legal perspective you could argue nothing is a security, because this undermines the entire premise of securities law,” Campbell said.

That Saylor is a bitcoin bull will not exactly come as breaking news, but he took note of a number of specific near- to medium-term catalysts.  First among them is what's soon be a sizable reduction in supply coming alongside a surge in demand. Bitcoin miners, said Saylor, need to sell bitcoin in order to keep the lights on, and he noted those sales are currently running at about $1 billion per month. The halving – expected to occur in April 2024 – however, means miners will soon have only half of that available to sell.  ""You're going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted into $6 billion of natural selling per year,"" he said. At the same time, he noted, spot bitcoin ETFs are going to be a source of increased buying pressure.  Secondly, there are soon to be new rules implementing fair value accounting for company bitcoin holdings. ""Long term,"" said Saylor, ""this is going to open the door for corporations to adopt bitcoin as a treasury asset and create shareholder value with their balance sheets.""

""Early crypto cowboys, the crypto tokens that are unregistered securities, the unreliable crypto custodians"" were liabilities for bitcoin, he argued.  ""For the industry to move to the next level,"" said Saylor, ""we need to migrate to adult supervision. We need to rationalize away from the 100,000 crypto tokens ... that people are manipulating to bitcoin.""

42419214,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4ir,1698945500,Will Hashdex's 'Undeniable' Distinctions Help Win Bitcoin ETF Race? Some Analysts Think So,"The probability of Hashdex's spot-bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) application getting the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval could be higher than others among the 12 spot-bitcoin applicants due to its apparently different approach to the application, according to some analysts.  During an Oct. 13 meeting with the SEC, the firm argued that its application is a ""novel proposal"" that is building upon the SEC's guidance as the ""fund will buy physical bitcoin from a regulated market, the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), and it will be entirely reliant on CME pricing.""  The Brazil-based asset manager aims to shift the investment strategy of its already trading Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) – approved in 2022 and listed on NYSE Arca – into one that can hold spot-bitcoin ETF. What may set the company's application apart, as Hashdex has argued since August, seems to be the firm's decision to use CME over Coinbase (COIN) for the SEC's requirement of a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) for all the applicants.  An SSA allows for sharing information about market trading activity, clearing activity, and customer identification, and is meant to leave a lesser possibility of market manipulation.  ""BlackRock and most other spot bitcoin ETF applicants believe a surveillance-sharing agreement with the exchange where BTC trades, solves this [SEC's SSA requirement], but there has been no evidence that this addresses the SEC’s concerns."" Hashdex's CIO Samir Kerbage wrote in a blog in August.  Read more: BlackRock May Have Found Way to Get SEC Approval for Spot Bitcoin ETF  This approach could give Hashdex an edge, analysts said in August.  ""In a way, this is a move trying to go around the Coinbase SSA by only doing certain types of transactions – EFRP (Exchange for Related Position),"" Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) at the time.  ""Basically [Hashdex] will exchange futures for equivalent spot exposure rather buying direct from exchanges with cash. This seems to be another angle where SEC/Gensler is kinda getting cornered,"" he noted.  Seyffart appeared to have since doubled down on his optimism about Hashdex's chance to get approval, following the latest development of the firm's meeting with the SEC.  ""In the event that the SEC finds a way to deny all other #Bitcoin ETFs (not my base case) @hashdex’s application is tailored to every argument SEC has made in the past. I don’t think they’ll be able to deny this one,"" he tweeted on Oct. 25.  Other analysts seem to have agreed that Hashdex's different approach could put it atop the list of spot bitcoin ETFs to potentially get the SEC's nod.  A ""brilliant move by Hashdex/NYSE"" tweeted Nate Geraci, co-founder of ETF Institute, getting a retweet from another Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas.  ""I would be shocked if the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity get held back and Hashdex makes it through,"" Balchunas said in a separate tweet later. ""Pre-SEC court loss maybe, but just think highly unlikely but it is clever. Can't deny that.""  Echoing Geraci and Bachunas, co-founder and CIO of the Altana Digital Currency Fund, Alistair Milne, also said the application could be ""hard to reject"" by the SEC.  The 12 spot-bitcoin ETF applications that are currently waiting for SEC's approval are from Hashdex, Grayscale, 21Shares (Ark), BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, Wisdomtree, Invesco (Galaxy), Fidelity, Valkyrie, Global X and Franklin Templeton.  Hashdex didn't comment about the probability of their application going through or the optimistic opinion of ETF analysts but suggested it had made changes to address SEC concerns.  “A filing for a strategy change of a futures ETF allows an issuer to take an SEC-approved approach and make changes to directly address SEC concerns around holding spot,"" Hashdex's Kerbage told CoinDesk in an email.  ""Since it would be live and already trading, investors have the added benefit of not having to switch from a futures to spot product,” he added.

These movements come at a time when the price of the meme coin is on the rise, raising concerns about whether these large holders have decided to start selling their large stacks of coins. Shiba Inu Whales Start Moving Coins Over the last few days, whale tracker Whale Alert has reported two large Shiba Inu transactions carrying a massive amount of coins. The first was reported on October 31 where a single transaction was spotted carrying over 4.47 trillion SHIB worth $35.35 million at the time. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Price Will Jump To $0.9 The next transaction came a day later on Wednesday, November 1, where another transaction carrying a large amount of SHIB was recorded. This transaction was similar to the first in that it was carrying 4.46 Trillin tokens. The dollar figure was however a little lower at $33.9 million at the time of the transaction. These two transactions were some of the largest transactions so far for the coin in the last few months, and naturally, drew the concern of investors due to their destination. The origin and destination of these transactions can often tell if they’re eventually bullish or bearish for the SHIB price. More Bullish Than Bearish For SHIB Looking at the origin and destination of each transaction shows a higher tendency for it to be bullish than bearish for the coin. The first transaction was actually moved from an unknown wallet to another unknown wallet. This could suggest that the owner is moving the coins to other wallets for safekeeping. However, there is also the possibility that this was an over-the-counter (OTC) sale. Even so, such sales are carried out in a bid to not affect the market price of a coin by not dumping the coins on the open market, which minimizes the impact. The second transaction is even more bullish given that it is a withdrawal from a centralized exchange. As Whale Alert shows, the transaction was actually the movement of coins from the Bitvavo crypto exchange to a private wallet, which suggests accumulation. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital and Invesco Bitcoin Spot ETF Join BlackRock On The DTCC Given that both of these transactions are not showing any indications of selling, it is likely that these whales are still keeping the faith and holding on to their coins. In such a case, it is more bullish than bearish for Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu is still trading at a fairly high price of $0.0000079 after jumping 3.93% in the last 24 hours. However, it is performing much worse on the weekly chart with 1.53% losses.

42419224,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4q5,1698943551,Market Sees 59% Odds Sam Bankman-Fried Is Found Guilty on All Charges – But There's a Catch,"The odds are greater than 50-50 that Sam Bankman-Fried will be convicted on all seven charges in his criminal fraud trial, if you go by the betting on cryptocurrency-powered prediction market Polymarket.  But there's an important caveat: only $4,512 has been cumulatively wagered, underscoring the current limitations of prediction markets, hamstrung by regulations when they operate in the U.S. and by the clunkiness of crypto when they don't.  On the question ""SBF guilty of all charges?"" ""yes"" contracts were trading at 59 cents Thursday morning – which equates to traders seeing a 59% chance he will be – as the judge began reading out instructions to the jury after a month of hearing testimony and lawyers' arguments in the case. Each contract pays out $1 if the prediction turns out to be true, and zilch if it is false. ""No"" contracts were priced at 41 cents.  The low volume could be read as an indication that crypto traders have moved on from the saga of Bankman-Fried, who stands accused of pilfering money that belonged to customers of his now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX.  After all, there are larger markets on Polymarket – the biggest, which concerns the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, had $5 million of bets outstanding so far Thursday.  But there are other factors limiting participation.  Straitjacketed  For starters, U.S. residents are not allowed to trade on Polymarket under a 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), so the platform is locked out of the world's largest economy. And traders in other countries can't bet in their local currencies, but must first buy and then deposit one of several cryptocurrencies (ETH, USDC or USDT), filtering out the ""normies.""  But Polymarket at least enjoys the freedom to host bets on spicy topics like the outcome of a criminal trial. The two mainstream U.S. prediction markets, which settle their bets in dollars, are, by comparison, straitjacketed.  Kalshi, the first and only federally regulated U.S. exchange devoted to trading on event outcomes, is required to certify compliance and/or seek approval from the CFTC for every market it lists. On Wednesday, the company sued the regulator for denying its application to list a market on the relatively anodyne question of which party will control each chamber of the U.S. Congress after an election.  And PredictIt, which has run political betting markets under the graces of a no-action letter from the CFTC, had to sue to prevent getting shut down altogether.  The situation makes it difficult to say how powerful prediction markets could potentially be in helping to forecast significant events. Theoretically, because traders are putting their money where their mouths are, they are at a minimum honestly expressing their beliefs about what will happen, in contrast to media pundits with no skin in the game. But the limited lucrativeness and obstacles to onboarding likely constrain the number of people with real expertise on a given topic who are able or willing to participate.

Abu Dhabi has unveiled a new regulatory framework for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and other entities built on distributed ledger technology (DLT), marking the first push toward such a framework by a Middle Eastern territory, the Registration Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) said Thursday in a statement.  The framework, effectively immediately, enables DAOs, which have long operated within a legal grey area, to operate legally and issue tokens to their members.  Distributed ledger technology, which provides the basis for blockchain networks, is a system of recording and storing information on different ledgers within a network to ensure data accuracy and security.  The move forms part of a larger initiative to ""foster initiatives in the broader blockchain and digital asset realm"" in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates’ second-most populous territory after Dubai.  Abu Dhabi is vying to become a crypto hub alongside Dubai as the UAE embraces the digital assets sector and has a regulatory framework that can be valuable for firms looking for regulatory clarity, in contrast to elsewhere in the world.  ""The new regime serves as a driving force for positive change in the digital assets sector,"" ADGM Chairman Ahmed Jasim Al Zaabi said in a statement.

The jurors were dispatched Thursday afternoon to do their duty – reviewing the seven fraud and conspiracy charges Bankman-Fried faces – after Judge Lewis Kaplan finished reading them 60 pages of instructions. Jurors will break for dinner from 6 to 7 p.m. ET (22:00 to 23:00 UTC), and deliberate as late as 8 p.m. (midnight UTC).  Thursday morning, prosecutors gave their final remarks to the jurors. Promising customers that their ""assets are safe"" and then taking that money and spending it on yourself and your companies, ""is not a 'reasonable businesses decision,'"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon said of Bankman-Fried's behavior – invoking a phrase used by a defense attorney in his closing argument a day earlier. ""That is fraud.""  The government's core argument is that Bankman-Fried misused billions of dollars worth of funds belonging to users of his FTX crypto exchange, siphoning them to businesses, political candidates and real estate ventures via Alameda Research, his crypto trading shop.  Bankman-Fried broke a ""sacred, unbreakable rule"" when dealing with FTX customer money, Sassoon told the jury. ""Your money is your own,"" she said. ""It's not for others to use.""  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried on Verge of Tears as His Lawyer Concludes Defense  Sassoon used her final remarks to poke holes in the closing statement of defense attorney Mark Cohen, who appealed to the jury Wednesday to consider whether a real fraudster would agree to an interview on ""Good Morning America"" just days after he was accused of committing crimes.  Bankman-Fried's post-collapse media blitz ""was part of an effort to present himself as reliable,"" Sassoon said.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried's Post-Collapse Media Blitz Has Clearly Backfired  As for why the FTX founder continued to pay back lenders in his crypto empire's final days – rather than hoard customer funds for himself – the prosecutor said that Bankman-Fried didn't plan to ""run with the money"" and risk being exposed. Even after Nov. 7, the day she said FTX collapsed, ""he still thought he could fool the world,"" she said.  The defense argument that most incensed Sassoon, according to her, was Cohen's statement to the jury that the government's star witnesses – top FTX and Alameda executives Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh – were incentivized to lie when testifying.  ""That's outrageous,"" Sassoon said loudly, calling it a ""desperate and unsupported accusation.""  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Scoops Help CoinDesk Win a Loeb Award, a Top Journalism Prize  Again and again, she told the jury Bankman-Fried's testimony and the defense's arguments don't make sense. ""You know that it's a made-up story,"" she said. ""You should reject it.""  Regarding perhaps the defense's favorite argument, that FTX didn't have a risk manager and thus Bankman-Fried didn't know what he was getting himself into, Sassoon said it proved the opposite of what defense lawyers claimed: ""That's not a defense, it was a strategy.""  ""The defendant knew what he was doing was wrong, and that's why he didn't hire a chief risk officer,"" she told the jury.  ""Don't fall for [his lies],"" she concluded her statement. ""Find him guilty.""  Jury instructions  Judge Kaplan spent more than two hours reading the charging document, which detailed the specific charges Bankman-Fried faces, the different legal theories the jury could use to find he is guilty or not guilty, and other pieces of information about how they should conduct their deliberations.  While jurors have access to the written charge document during deliberations, the judge is required by law to read it out loud as well, he said as he began.  The judge denied a defense motion to seat the jury on Friday, when court is scheduled to be on break. A three-day weekend is not that different from a two-day weekend, he said. If the jury does not return a verdict Thursday, court will be in recess until 9:30 a.m. Monday.  Just before Kaplan began, a courtroom deputy told those present they could not be allowed to leave during the reading, and instructed the Marshals to lock the doors.

42419210,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4ej,1698941273,Bitcoin Round-Trips Its Way Back Under $35K as Fidelity's Timmer Calls It 'Exponential Gold',"A late Wednesday/early Thursday pump higher in bitcoin [BTC] saw the price nearly punch through $36,000 for what would have been the first time since the spring of 2022. The move, however, appeared to trigger a wave of sell orders, with bitcoin now having tumbled almost $1,300 over the past few hours to the current $34,700.  The slide in bitcoin's price is particularly notable as risk assets across the board are sharply higher on Thursday. In the U.S., the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are each ahead by 1.5%, and Europe's Stoxx 600 is up 1.8%. Traditional markets are rallying alongside steep declines in interest rates on growing conventional thinking that major Western central banks may be done with rate hikes. The Bank of England this morning followed the U.S. Federal Reserve yesterday in holding policy steady. One week ago, the European Central Bank did the same.  Despite the pullback, bitcoin does remain higher by 1.25% over the past 24 hours, slightly underperforming the broad CoinDesk Market Index's (CMI) 1.6% gain.  ""Exponential Gold""  Perhaps inspired by bitcoin's big gains of late, Fidelity Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer tweeted that it might be time to revisit his 2020 bullish thesis on the crypto.  ""Bitcoin is a commodity currency that aspires to be a store of value and a hedge against monetary debasement,"" said Timmer. ""I think of it as exponential gold.""  He continued: ""During structural regimes in which inflation runs hot, real rates are negative, and/or money supply growth is excessive, gold tends to shine ...

The crypto exchange that has propelled Shiba Inu’s growth lately is the leading cryptocurrency platform, Binance. Shiba Inu Volume Doubles On Binance According to CoinMarketCap, Binance is the top crypto exchange for the Shiba Inu market. The total volume of Shiba Inu being traded in the crypto exchange has since experienced a double-figure growth over the past 24 hours, presenting a bullish trend for the digital asset. The upswing in Shiba Inu volume on the largest crypto exchange highlights the token’s appeal and points to a possible future growth spurt. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Accumulation: You Won’t Believe How Much SHIB Whales Have Bought SHIB recorded a significant volume of $37,739,036 in the past 24 hours, indicating a volume rise of over 21% in less than a day. But as of the time of writing, the digital asset’s 24-hour trading volume is pegged at $40,539,374.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu Reverses December Downtrend – Good Days Ahead For Investors? Rare Signal Sparks Price Increase For SHIB Following a bullish trend in the TD sequential in the past week, the indicator has presented an upward trajectory for the price of Shiba Inu. According to Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential sparked a rare ‘9’ buy signal on the Shiba Inu’s weekly chart; this signal presents a significant growth price for SHIB due to the infrequency of the particular signal. “The TD Sequential flashed a buy signal on [the] SHIB weekly chart. Notably, the previous two bullish turns from this indicator led to price surges of 118% and 71%, respectively. Given the infrequency yet precision of such signals, it’s a pivotal moment to keep a keen eye on SHIB,” Martinez stated. The last time TD Sequential indicated a ‘9’ buy signal for Shiba Inu was in September; the token’s price increased by over 71% during the next nine weeks. With the signal emerging yet again, we are likely to see a bullish trend.

42419227,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4tB,1698939900,Crypto for Advisors: Opinion: Direct Crypto Ownership Is Best,"Bitcoin started the week at $35,000, showing roughly 62% gains in 2023.  Christopher King, founder and CEO of Eaglebrook Advisors, shares his opinion on why direct ownership of crypto is the best path forward.  Our bitcoin ETF survey closed this week. Results are similar to the recently published NASDAQ survey that highlighted that over 70% of advisors hold crypto currently and would invest more for themselves upon approval of a bitcoin spot ETF; however, less than 10% feel comfortable advising their clients on this asset class. See the summary of results below.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Why Advisors Should Not Wait for the Spot Bitcoin ETF  While access to a bitcoin investment might be easier with a spot bitcoin ETF, Advisors could miss a significant opportunity if they wait for approval. Advisors with access to investment vehicles right now (Crypto SMAs) have the unique ability to “front run” larger institutions for maybe the first time in history, positioning clients to benefit from bitcoin’s historical four-year price cycle in a tightening bitcoin supply environment.  Cyclical Price Action Within a Secular Growth Trajectory  Bitcoin has followed a four-year cycle, with price reflecting the waxing and waning sentiment of an emerging innovation/asset class. Significant drawdowns have been followed by parabolic years of growth. These cycles demonstrated similarities in sentiment, price action and regularity.  As seen below, historically bitcoin has followed a pattern of three years of impressive gains followed by a significant drawdown in price. This cycle is driven by the natural changing of sentiment of an emerging asset and solidified by the underlying mechanics of bitcoin’s known code.  Every four years, the new supply of bitcoin entering the market is cut in half in an event known as the Bitcoin Halving. All else equal, this incremental reduction in the pace of bitcoin supply growth puts upward pressure on the price of bitcoin from a demand/supply balance standpoint and builds the narrative around the four-year cycle with media attention highlighting the critical characteristic of bitcoin’s fixed monetary policy. Bitcoin was down 65% last year and is over 100% YTD in the first year of a potential new cycle, with the next halving slated for April 2024.  Strike Before the Iron is Hot  With bitcoin at a favorable price relative to its historical four-year cycle and looming positive catalysts, advisors who have access to bitcoin should take this time to strike before the iron is hot, to get out in front of the institutional inflows and before the barriers to a bitcoin investment are lowered.  A spot bitcoin ETF approval and progress toward broader regulatory clarity around crypto could propel the next bull market, allowing latent demand to enter the market. By utilizing today’s available tools, such as Crypto SMAs, advisors can take advantage of the disconnect in the market between underlying demand and actual investment flows.  Further, bitcoin’s supply on exchanges is low by historical standards as investors in bitcoin are holding their bitcoin for longer and longer (41% of bitcoin supply has been held over three years compared to 27% in 2017), limiting the actual supply available to trade and increasing the price impact of any surge in bitcoin demand.  With technical and fundamental catalysts lining up for the next bitcoin bull run, advisors waiting for a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF may miss the boat. While a spot bitcoin ETF might help legitimize an allocation to bitcoin in the eyes of the broader investing public, there are more efficient investment vehicles to own bitcoin.  Direct Ownership is The Way  Direct ownership is the best structure from an investment vehicle perspective and is available now. There is minimal tracking error compared to other products, such as an OTC public trust, which can have meaningful premiums and discounts and, thus, tracking error. Further, there is 24/7 liquidity for crypto SMAs, allowing investors and advisers to sell or buy anytime.  The second and arguably more important reason is that direct ownership is in the clients’ best interest in the long term. An advisor who takes the time to position their clients in a favorable investment vehicle for a given asset class, even though it requires extra effort, will build a reputation for putting clients’ needs first. Further, this will showcase domain expertise relative to advisors who are not knowledgeable about the crypto market. A new asset class requires innovative infrastructure and education. The client will value the upfront work of advisors who utilize a Crypto SMA, increasing the trust in the relationship.  Slowly, Then Suddenly  Bitcoin will continue to take on the ups and downs of an emerging asset and deal with roadblocks in the form of bad actors, regulatory hurdles, misconceptions, and the volatility of an emerging innovation. To be sure, there will be more bumps ahead with volatile price movements and potential price drawdowns. Further, a bitcoin ETF approval could be a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" event.  We view bitcoin as not a trade but a generational opportunity with the upside materializing over a long-term investment horizon for three, five or 10 years. But that doesn’t mean advisors have the luxury to wait for a spot bitcoin ETF. With arguably better investment vehicles available, a lining up of favorable tailwinds for bitcoin price, a potential deluge of new capital flowing to bitcoin, and a tightening supply of bitcoin, now is the time for advisors to make a prudently sized allocation to bitcoin, before the institutions for once.  – Christopher King, Founder & CEO, Eaglebrook Advisors  Bitcoin ETF Survey  During the past two weeks we asked advisors to partake in a survey focused on their investment interests for bitcoin spot ETFs. The results are in.  Slightly more than 50% of respondents stated YES, they would invest in a bitcoin spot ETF when approved in the US. 15% said NO; the remainder of respondents were based outside the U.S. Interestingly 82% said they would personally invest in a bitcoin spot ETF with the other 18% saying they would not.  When asked, “What would be the reason you would not allocate clients into a bitcoin spot ETF? (check all that apply),” 32% of respondents selected “lack of understanding and education,” 28% selected “inappropriate risk profile for your clients,” 17% selected “availability at your firm's product shelf” and 28% selected “other” with write-in responses including “not suitable for clients aged over 65,” “prefer income-producing assets,” “inconsistent with investment mandate” and “BTC doesn't offer the commercial utility of other alt coins.”  As 32% of respondents selected, “lack of understanding and education,” please note there are several courses and designations designed to help you learn and use digital assets. The CDAA and DACFP are two such designations.  Thank you to everyone who responded to the survey. Since the goal of this newsletter is to formulate an advisor community and dialogue, while the survey has concluded, we encourage you to reply back to this email with additional thoughts and topics of interest.  – Sarah Morton  Keep Reading  UK moving forward with crypto rules and regulation, mirroring TradFi regulations.

42419215,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4jt,1698938480,U.S. SEC's Knock From Congressional Watchdog May Not Budge Crypto Accounting Policy,"The Government Accountability Office handed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission another high-profile setback in its crypto policies, declaring the agency erred in not treating SAB 121 as a rule under the Congressional Review Act.  Crypto observers doubt Congress will overturn the policy, but the finding may echo through other legal disputes.  As the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair keeps chasing non-compliance in crypto, his agency was slammed by the watchdog Government Accountability Office (GAO) for its own compliance failure in issuing crypto accounting standards without treating the policy as a formal rule.  So, what now? In practical terms, probably nothing much.  The agency is likely to rectify the accusation that it sidestepped the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by submitting Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) to Congress, as the GAO argued should have been done when the controversial policy was issued in 2022.  Under the review act, Congress is meant to get a chance to overturn new federal rules before their ink dries. But the current Senate and House of Representatives are split between political parties, and the closely divided Congress is unlikely to agree on what to do with SAB 121, despite the goals of some Republicans.  ""This sets an incredibly dangerous precedent,"" said U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), the lawmaker who originally requested the GAO review. ""I plan to use the Congressional Review Act to block this rule in the coming weeks.""  The accounting bulletin basically instructed financial institutions that when they take in customers' crypto assets, they should factor those assets into their own balance sheets – effectively telling banks to maintain expensive capital reserves against their customers' digital assets.  ""Ultimately, this would deter institutions and firms from offering custodial services – denying Americans access to safe and secure custody of their assets,"" said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee that oversees the SEC. ""SAB 121 was drafted with zero input from prudential regulators and the public, and now Congress must step in to block this harmful rule.""  If the SEC sends SAB 121 as a ""rule"" to Congress under the CRA, both chambers have about two months to pass a resolution repealing it.  Meanwhile, the SEC isn't showing signs of budging on the bulletin.  ""The GAO opinion expresses its view that SAB 121 is a 'rule' for purposes of the CRA,"" the SEC said in a statement this week. ""The opinion does not otherwise affect the status of SAB 121.""  Will Congress act?  While the Republican-led House may embrace a reversal of the SEC's push into crypto accounting, crypto insiders are saying, the Senate is controlled by Democrats who are usually sympathetic to Gensler's SEC. And President Joe Biden is unlikely to favor bucking his hand-picked SEC chair. If Democrats rose up against the Democrat-majority SEC, a rejection of SAB 121 would mean the bulletin would be wiped in its entirety, and the agency would also be disallowed from introducing another rule that takes the same approach.  The CRA has been around for nearly three decades but had hardly been used until recent years, most notably when Republicans overturned 16 rules during the Trump administration.  As it stands, the SEC's crypto accounting bulletin is technically nonbinding, though various U.S. industries have long argued that there's no such thing as nonbinding guidance from federal regulators, and Republican lawmakers have waged battles in the past over agencies using guidance in place of going through the many hoops of formal rulemaking.  SAB 121 has been chasing large banks and brokers away from the crypto sector, said Paul McCaffery, who works as a managing director focusing on digital assets at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a banking firm that services the financial sector. When people can't find a regulated home for their assets, they go to the unregulated firms that are more prone to disaster, he argued.  ""It's not to be underestimated how much of an industry killer this was in terms of institutional adoption,"" McCaffery said. ""The reversal of SAB 121 would be way bigger news to me than a spot ETF approval.""  While he doesn't expect Congress to repeal the SEC policy, he said it's ""very exciting that at least it's getting the focus it deserves"" and that the agency is experiencing more backlash connected to what he argued was its repeated crypto ""overreach.""  Legal implications  Even if Congress doesn't come after SAB 121, the GAO's observation could have other legal implications.  Crypto firms that have been stymied in finding suitable custodians for their assets could consider legal challenges against the regulator. And if the SEC pursued enforcement actions on this point of accounting, its targets could accuse the agency of failing to follow the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to handle the bulletin as a full-fledged rule with proper comment periods, as the GAO's finding would suggest was the appropriate course.  ""The SEC should not have deprived the public of their opportunity to be heard pursuant to the APA's notice and comment procedures,"" Blockchain Association Senior Counsel Marisa Coppel had said in a statement after the GAO release.  So the fight over the agency's crypto accounting views may not stop at Congress.

The digital asset, known for its innovative approach to blockchain technology, has witnessed remarkable gains in recent days, leaving both crypto enthusiasts and investors curious about the trajectory it will follow in the coming weeks. The question that now lingers is, for how long will Cardano’s meteoric rise continue? To shed light on the potential outcomes for ADA this November, we must delve into its historical performance. Over the past five years, the month of November has held a mix of outcomes for Cardano. Cardano November Prospects: Up Or Down? Notably, three years ago, it concluded with an impressive 84% gain, showcasing the coin’s ability to deliver substantial returns during this period. Related Reading: Solana Bull Run Could Smash Through $40 Barrier This Week – Here’s How With this historical context in mind, ADA holders find themselves pondering two potential scenarios for this month: a soaring ascent, with the price surging by 43.5% to reach $0.41 per token — or a dip, bringing the value down to $0.279 per ADA. 🐳🦈 #Cardano has hit a major dormant coin activity milestone. Monday marked the highest amount of older wallets moving $ADA since April, 2022, indicating more coins are moving back into circulation. 100K-10M $ADA wallets are also accumulating again. https://t.co/TwwQkHZbzA pic.twitter.com/kDjntuV7AS — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 31, 2023 Adding to the intrigue surrounding Cardano’s current performance, crypto data analysis firm Santiment has reported a noteworthy development in the behavior of long-time ADA holders. These investors, often referred to as “whales” in the crypto world, have begun moving the largest amounts of ADA tokens in over a year. This sudden movement raises questions about the intentions behind this significant shift. ADAUSD is currently trading at $0.308. Chart: TradingView.com Santiment’s observations also highlight that deep-pocketed Cardano holders have been quite active in accumulating ADA tokens recently. In just two weeks, these influential stakeholders acquired nearly 44 million ADA tokens, amounting to approximately $12.67 million. The aggressive nature of this accumulation raises eyebrows and leads to speculation about the motives behind these strategic moves. Cardano’s Meteoric Surge As of the most recent data available, ADA’s price on CoinGecko stands at $0.305896, reflecting a 6.7% surge in the past 24 hours. Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has rallied by 5.5%, further solidifying its status as a top performer in the market. Related Reading: XRP Hits $0.6 In Unstoppable Surge: How High Can It Go This November?

As always in the crypto world, the only constant is change, and Cardano’s journey is poised to be an eventful one. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

42419219,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4lx,1698936820,Want Crypto Adoption? Give Consumers What They Really Want,"The first step to solving a problem is admitting you have one. In crypto, our problem is the profound gap between what people say they want, and what they actually want. This phenomenon, called the “value action gap,” helps clarify why belief doesn’t always turn into action. In crypto, the mismatch is huge: despite strong theoretical sentiment for crypto’s underlying principles, adoption remains shy. But if Web3 is to reach even a fraction of its potential, we can’t ignore this gap any longer.  Mags Kala is the founder and managing partner of Double Down, a Web3 fund.  Crypto’s values are grounded in two powerful ideals.  First, there is the movement toward radical self-sovereignty: you own your money, you own your keys.  Second, there is the dream of a decentralized internet, where we share in the profits companies generate from our activity, and retain increasingly more control over our online identities. The problem? Most of us can’t be bothered to set a strong password — let alone take on the responsibility that this level of control requires.  In the decade since Vitalik’s Ethereum white paper, we’ve seen an explosion of projects that tap into these desires for self-sovereignty and decentralization, from NFTs and DApps to blockchain games. But after three crypto winters, and a landscape littered with smart contracts, broken DeFi platforms, and PFPs, what do we actually have to show for it from the mainstream consumer adoption perspective? Not enough beyond the boom-and-bust cycles of a 24/7 casino.  People might care about crypto’s underlying values… but not enough to onboard solely because of them. Instead, what they want is far simpler: money, status, and unique functionality that actually solves a real problem (shocker!). If we hope to truly catalyze the crypto space — as founders, builders, or investors — we must acknowledge this reality and embrace users for who they are, rather than who we want them to be.  What’s Really Driving Adoption  In a Consensys survey published in June, respondents overwhelmingly said they want more control over their online identities and data. But is that really what’s driven adoption in Web3 so far? The evidence points elsewhere: namely, speculation. It’s everywhere in crypto, thanks to our inherent bias toward immediate (and potentially outsized) gains. Maybe it’s time we stop apologizing for users’ speculative interests, and embrace their root cause: humans are financially motivated, especially when their financial security is otherwise non-existent, as is the case for millennials.  We can intellectualize crypto all day long. But if we want to drive real, mass-scale adoption, we need to be honest about what consumers actually want  We’re driven by status, too – something that has fueled much of the activity in NFTs. NFTs are more than digital assets: they denote social standings, group affiliations and taste. NFTs unlock unique experiences in IRL spheres, offering nuanced social and cultural interactions. While the tokens themselves hold speculative value, for some, the experiences, communities, and new social strata they enable are priceless. The most powerful status markers are earned, not simply bought – and crypto offers a powerful array of tools and experiences for both how tokenized “status” can be earned, and what it can provide.  Finally, we’re driven by unique functionality – that is, technology that solves key problems in our life in novel and powerful ways. Think Ledger, which made it easy and accessible to protect your keys (show me a stronger need for crypto native customers… I’ll wait). Or, some of the most now-fundamental apps in tech, when they first arrived: Uber, Stripe and Instagram. Before these products became ubiquitous, they solved one key problem incredibly well, in a way we hadn’t really seen before. In Web3, we’ve yet to see more than a few innovations of this type.  Double Down on What’s Working  We need to be radically honest about what drives consumer behavior in the crypto world: money, status and unique functionality. Everything else is garnish. Axie Infinity and Top Shot didn’t surge because of the decentralized utopia that was promised, but because they tapped into these fundamental human motivations — the chance to make money and have the new hot/rare thing. Products that lean into these drivers have done exceptionally well, especially in the short term. Instead of resisting this reality, the winning strategy is to double down, building products that align with consumers’ true motivations, supported by long-term sustainable business models. Here are the three investment theses that drive what we’re currently prioritizing as a firm:  The Money Game  In an era of widening income disparity and hopelessness around economic mobility, the fast gains made possible by speculative mechanisms (think: sports betting or meme coins) have lured a generation desperate to claw its way to financial security. For debt-saddled millennials looking to “get rich quick” in absence of credible “get comfortable slow” pathways, these platforms have served as shaky bridges to financial independence. Whether we like it or not, the cat is out of the bag on society’s speculative interests – the key now is to serve them in well-designed, transparent ways rather than with exploitative Ponzi mechanics.  But there is so much more to crypto’s money game. DeFi represents a real opportunity to rewrite the gig economy, democratize access to real-world assets, and rapidly deploy liquid capital where traditional systems falter – particularly in poorly financialized countries. Technical advancements and globalization have outpaced financial innovation, and crypto can bridge the two, adding much needed flexibility to financial markets. It’s also making possible a wave of new business models, using mechanisms like protocol rewards, bounties, or finders’ fees to capture and redistribute value in innovative ways. Verifying public transactions on-chain may even help business lenders loan to projects that competitors can’t justify with traditional lending algorithms.  The Status Game  Web3 has brought a new social layer to the internet, best represented by blockchain-based communities built around status and digital ownership. We’ve already started seeing this in token-gated crypto communities like Friends With Benefits, or games like Fortnite or Roblox – where people spend loads on Gucci skins – or during the peak of the PFP NFT hype cycle, when celebrities were boosting BAYC on Twitter. We want to signal to peers that we are in, or the first, or the most prolific — and these status symbols have real social benefits. People flex with fashion, cars, and event access in the real world – and they are doing the same in the digital world, every day.  The question is: why haven’t these “status games” taken off in crypto like the “money games”? It comes down to two issues.  One, in status games, money cannot be the focal point of the relationship – unique/earned access is significantly more valuable than ubiquitous/easily purchasable access (besides, nobody likes money grabs).  Two, status doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and Web3 status games have lacked clear third spaces for the status to be flaunted. (Why do you think Twitter profile picture has become such an important real estate for NFT projects?). It's not enough to introduce leaderboards, loyalty points, or private discords – tech needs to be paired with deeper understanding of human aspirations to truly crack status games.  The Functionality Game  Now, consider what’s driven mass tech adoption (in crypto or otherwise) in the past: products far superior to existing alternatives. Amazon revolutionized the online marketplace. Apple revolutionized the phone. Rather than rely on the supposed benefits of decentralization, the functionality of new blockchain-based applications should thrust the user experience into a new paradigm.  Users will jump through hoops to get what they want – but you have to give them something they truly want. Music NFTs have yet to take off, for example, because minting music on-chain still hasn’t exceeded the benefits of instantly streaming millions of tracks for just $10.99 a month.  Feature parity won’t cut it either; we need to hold Web3 startups to the same standards as the rest of tech innovation, because that’s what target customers do too. Your product that happens to be built on blockchain needs to (a) meet the classic 10x improvement vs. existing alternatives adoption test, and (b) have credible source of defensibility vs. incumbents (who are particularly adept at the functionality game given their resources and distribution advantages).  Lofty ideals are simply too high on the hierarchy of needs for new consumption in the over-stimulated user environment – Web3 builders need to focus on the end-user benefits, serving core needs and wants first. Once users have onboarded to address their practical needs, then we can “smuggle in” the idealistic aspects of decentralization.  Conclusion  We can intellectualize crypto all day long. But if we want to drive real, mass-scale adoption, we need to be honest about what consumers actually want. To capture both consumer and investor attention, the pitch can't just be about the tech; it has to promise a better life in some tangible way. Are we making something that people not only want but will clamor to use?

19719033,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558766,1698933640,Dormant Bitcoin Whales Rouse From Slumber To Threaten BTC Rally,"Dormant Bitcoin whales, or long-term HODLers holding huge amounts of BTC, have suddenly awakened and started moving their funds. After over six years of inactivity, three dormant Bitcoin addresses containing thousands of BTC unexpectedly became active again, and they transferred a combined total of 6,500 BTC. With BTC now showing signs of the resumption of the October rally, these massive Bitcoin transfers could either increase buying momentum or threaten to capsize the current bull run. Dormant Bitcoin Whales Make Waves With Massive BTC Transfers Movement of dormant Bitcoin addresses has been sporadic this year, with most causing a stir and rising interest amongst the Bitcoin community. Whale movement and whale acquisitions also spiked up in October, as Bitcoin’s price saw its highest increase in 18 months. Related Reading: Unique Fair Pricing Model Puts XRP Price Higher Than Bitcoin, Here’s How Much In the latest record of whale transactions this year, on-chain data has shown that a set of dormant Bitcoin from 2017 has moved for the first time in six years. These transactions came from three addresses transferring a total of 6,500 BTC, worth approximately $230 million. An in-depth look into these addresses shows they received their assets on November 5, 2017, with no movement until now. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at around $7,400, putting the total value of the transaction at $48 million. BTC has grown substantially since then, with a unit now going for $35,230 at the time of writing. Selling Pressure Incoming? The timing of the acquisition and transfer of these BTC point to them being controlled by one entity. Uncertainty behind these transfers sometimes can threaten buyer confidence as it could indicate the whale expects a price drop and is securing profits. Alternatively, it could show they foresee further growth and are reorganizing for the next big rally. On-chain data points to the former, as the BTC is still held in private addresses, showing they are probably still in self-custody. Whale transfers to cryptocurrency exchanges have increased over the past few days, which may jeopardize Bitcoin’s present bull market and price gain. However, whale purchases have surged during the same period, indicating a combination of buys and selloffs from bulls and bears.

42419208,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4cf,1698933384,Sam Bankman-Fried Demonstrates Ineffective Altruism at Its Worst,"One year ago, CoinDesk's Ian Allison sent me the FTX balance sheet and asked for my take. I laid out what I saw, asking several times whether it was real, because a balance sheet that bad just did not seem possible given all we'd read about Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda and FTX over the preceding years. It was very real, and Ian brought down the house with his award-winning reporting. I'm proud to publish my latest thoughts on SBF here on CoinDesk.  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Maybe so. It may also be that those who choose the road to hell try to paint over it by claiming to have good intentions. Perhaps they even use their supposedly good intentions to justify actions that are anything but good.  Take the case of Sam Bankman-Fried. More commonly known by his initials, SBF, he briefly held the title of world’s richest 30-year-old, with an estimated net worth of $20 billion. His fame rose as he pledged to pursue “effective altruism” by donating most of this wealth to popular causes. These good intentions were a major part of the publicity campaign that differentiated his company from its competitors.  Cory Klippsten is the CEO of Bitcoin financial services firm Swan.com.  However, the road SBF took to obtain his riches and pursue his proclaimed good intentions was one filled with extreme carelessness and negligence, and likely also fraud. Today, his fortune is wiped out, and he faces criminal charges that could result in over a 100-years of jail time. All of the well-intentioned benefits he pledged have instead been replaced by terrible damage to the lives of his customers.  This would be a short cautionary story but for one curious fact. Despite the wreckage he caused, and the accompanying failure to do good, there remain numerous voices sympathetic to SBF.  Chief among them is well-known author Michael Lewis. Throughout his new book on SBF and FTX, ""Going Infinite,"" he paints a portrait of SBF as a misunderstood genius whose intentions were pure. On his book tour, Lewis has continued his sympathetic depictions, saying things like this on MSNBC: ""I think of him as a creature of modern finance. At almost any period in history, he’s like a high school physics teacher.”  If Lewis is correct, he should be indicting modern finance wholesale. After all, SBF, by skipping the effort of honestly earning the money he gave away (or which he spent on lavish properties, celebrity endorsements, stadium naming rights and sponsorships of extravagant galas), never actually performed a genuinely altruistic deed.  Instead, his intentions led to him committing dirty deeds. Is this what personifies modern finance?  In spending money that was never his in the first place on “good causes,” SBF defaulted on the most important prerequisite for being generous – having something of yours to be generous with.  How can his actions elicit sympathy instead of outrage? It appears to come down to a growing view that honest work required to provide a service is not as important as altruistic pledges.  Had SBF made it a priority to run a legitimate and responsibly managed business that earned honest profits, he would not have become the 41st richest American (according to Forbes). He also would not have garnered the unearned admiration he bought with stolen money.  The SBF story is an extreme example of the ever-growing phenomenon of putting lofty desires ahead of more important requirements – delivering excellent products.  If the pressure to appear altruistic was not so important, SBF might actually have focused his efforts on laying the foundation of building a sound business.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried's Altruism Wasn't Very Effective | Opinion  It ultimately should come as little surprise to us that if we do not show appreciation for the hard, time-consuming work required to deliver great services, the quality of what companies deliver us will decline.  Nor should we be shocked when cases like that of SBF arise in which the service itself turns out to be a complete fiction – doing none of what it promises customers, but instead directing all its efforts to those unrelated, altruistic practices which receive praise.  The story of SBF serves as a warning that it is crucial that companies prioritize building and operating good businesses – and that the standard that we use for judging them as good is how well they serve their stakeholders. There can, of course, be room for companies to be charitable.  However, if charity comes at the cost of running a company poorly, or worse, fraudulently, that charity will not last, and all the other valuable offerings the company exists to provide will also erode or disappear.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Cory Klippsten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/02/sam-bankman-fried-demonstrates-ineffective-altruism-at-its-worst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f04466b0154e03ed4467ed8e6af1091d69173c7a-1632x918.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419211,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4fl,1698930000,Bitcoin Miner Marathon Tests BTC Mining With Methane Gas From Waste Landfill,"Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (MARA) has started a pilot mining project in Utah that is using methane gas generated from landfill waste to make electricity to power mining operations.  According to a statement, the miner partnered with Nodal Power, a firm that develops and operates renewable energy assets, for the 280 kilowatt (kW) test project. Marathon may expand its methane-based operation if the test project meets its expectations, the statement added.  ""Marathon’s pilot project is part of a broader initiative being conducted by the Company to validate its ability to capture methane emitted from landfills, convert it into electricity, and then use that electricity to power Bitcoin miners,"" the firm said.  This isn't the first time a mining firm is looking to generate electricity - the major cost for a miner - from an alternative source while attempting to mitigate greenhouse emission-related problems.  Last year, a startup, Vespene Energy, said it raised funds to mine bitcoin from a similar energy source. Elsewhere, miners such as Crusoe Energy have been setting up remote facilities to use otherwise wasted natural gas to power mining operations. In the process, they have been reducing the amount of methane gas - the largest component of natural gas - released into the atmosphere.  ""The methane naturally produced from landfills, biowaste, and elsewhere is often stranded, and Bitcoin miners like Marathon are uniquely positioned to help convert this harmful gas into a productive source of clean, renewable energy,"" Marathon Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel said.  Methane gas is 80 times more harmful than carbon dioxide for 20 years after it is released into the environment, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said that municipal solid waste emissions accounted for approximately 14.3% of all methane emissions in the United States in 2021.  “At Marathon, we are constantly seeking innovative ways to diversify our operations, lower our energy costs, and leverage the unique aspects of Bitcoin mining to better the environments in which we operate,” said Thiel.  “By capturing the methane emitted from landfills and converting it into electricity to power our Bitcoin miners, we may have an opportunity to accomplish all of those goals simultaneously,"" he added.

42419226,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4r7,1698928479,Hong Kong Will Allow Some Tokenized Securities-Related Activities,"Hong Kong is set to allow primary dealing of tokenization by providing more guidance on tokenized securities-related activities, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced on Thursday.  “The SFC is of the view that it is appropriate to allow primary dealing of tokenized SFC-authorised investment products, as long as the underlying product can meet all the applicable product authorization requirements and the additional safeguards to address the new risks associated with the tokenization arrangement,” one of the two SFC announcements meant to be read together said.  The move appears to be another step in Hong Kong’s recently accelerated ambitions to become a virtual asset hub. It implemented a new regulatory regime in June, accepting applications for crypto trading platform licenses, and granted the first set in August, allowing exchanges to serve retail customers.  This was a U-turn after 18 months of hostility toward crypto. The latest move supersedes a statement from March 2019 when the SFC took the stance that security tokens were “complex products” and, therefore, extra investor protection measures would apply.  “SFC has been assessing various proposals on tokenization of SFC-authorised investment products, for example, some for primary dealing of a tokenized product (i.e., subscription and redemption) and some for secondary trading of a tokenized product on an SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platform,” the SFC said.  Tokenization is the process of creating blockchain-based tokens that represent ownership in an investment product, and with some market participants in Hong Kong already exploring it, the SFC said its “potential benefits” include increasing “efficiency, enhancing transparency, reducing settlement time and lowering costs for traditional finance.”  The SFC said those interested in any activities involving any Digital Securities (including Tokenised Securities) should discuss their business plans with their case officer in advance. While the SFC might consider applications by crypto trading platforms to exclude specific tokenized securities, it will require all operators to put in place a compensation arrangement to cover the potential loss of security tokens.  Hong Kong recently allowed intermediaries to sell spot products to a broader range of clients, not just to professional investors. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority had said tokenization could enhance efficiency, liquidity and transparency in bond markets a few months after a successful $100 million tokenized green bond issuance by its central bank.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  PayPal (PYPL) received a subpoena from the U.S. SEC requesting documentation about its USD stablecoin on Wednesday, the global payments giant said in a filing. In August, the firm announced it was entering the cryptocurrency market with the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD. ""On Nov. 1, 2023, we received a subpoena from the U.S. SEC Division of Enforcement relating to PayPal USD stablecoin. The subpoena requests the production of documents. We are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request,"" PayPal revealed in its quarterly earnings report.  An updated bankruptcy plan filed by crypto lender Genesis last week represents a significant change of plans, the U.S. government said in a filing on Wednesday. The lender is now seeking to liquidate its assets rather than reorganize them. The apparent U-turn by Genesis – made after the crypto lender and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) were sued by the New York Attorney General (NYAG) – could add extra delays to the wind-up process, the filing by U.S. Trustee William Harrington said. DCG is also CoinDesk’s parent company.  One of the most famous sayings on Wall Street is that a bull market tends to stay in motion unless an external force acts upon it. Bitcoin (BTC) has historically lived up to the adage modeled along Sir Isaac Newton’s third law of motion and could do so again, rising as high as $56,000 by the end of the year, according to crypto services provider Matrixport. “If bitcoin is up at least +100% by this time of the year, then there is a +71% chance or five in seven that bitcoin would finish the year higher with average year-end rallies of +65%,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in a note to clients on Thursday. “As bitcoin tends to reach its peak by December 18th, we could call the six to seven weeks from early November to mid-December Bitcoin’s Santa Claus Rally.”  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the six-month BTC options skew, which measures the spread between call and put options expiring in 180 days, has risen to 9.47%, the highest since August 2021.  It shows bias for bitcoin strength over the next six months is strongest in over two years.

19716399,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558763,1698926427,Shiba Inu News: ShibaSwap 2.0 And Pawzaar Unleash New Features,"In a significant development for the Shiba Inu community, the much-anticipated upgrades for ShibaSwap 2.0 have been teased with fresh details, and NFT marketplace Pawzaar has announced a new approach to SHIB burns that aims to bridge tokens from Shibarium back to Ethereum. Here’s the latest Shiba Inu news. New Features For ShibaSwap 2.0 The Shiba Inu ecosystem is abuzz with anticipation as the marketing lead Lucie hinted at innovative features for the upcoming release of ShibaSwap 2.0. In a statement that caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts, Lucie said: Shibaswap 2.0 is more than just a regular DEX; it’s a complete portal experience. As for why it can’t be produced like other DEXs in week, it involves intricate development and features. Additionally, Shiba Name Service is one of our pioneering features. Next week coming another feature. #shibarium x BONE X SHIB Expected to revolutionize the decentralized exchange landscape, ShibaSwap 2.0 remains under development, with the specific launch date still shrouded in secrecy. Although speculative mentions of an October release have emerged (which turned out false), the team’s strategic silence on an official date underscores their cautionary approach to community expectations. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Nosedives Following 7,700% Jump, What Happened? Lucie’s previous comments in April brought to light that ShibaSwap 2.0 will not only facilitate token swaps but also serve as a crypto portal — a comprehensive platform offering news, statistics, charts, and trends. Alongside the informational gateway, the DEX will boast new designs that are yet to be unveiled. This level of development suggests a qualitative leap, aiming to enhance user engagement and provide value-added services within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Pawzaar Implements New Approach To SHIB Burns Turning to the SHIB burn debate, Pawzaar, a burgeoning NFT platform on Shibarium, declared a key operational upgrade today: We have finished upgrading our platform! All SHIB burns now go to a wallet that will bridge the tokens from Shibarium to Ethereum. As addressed by Lucie, we have complied to the request for burns to take place on Ethereum. We will begin adding collections onto the platform! The platform is aligning with Lucie’s guidance, ensuring burns contribute to the SHIB’s total supply reduction on Ethereum’s Layer-1 network. The clarification came after Shib CoOp’s inaugural SHIB burn on Shibarium sparked a hotly discussed debate, emphasizing the need for a protocol that accurately impacts the SHIB supply. The community-driven burn tracker, Shibburn, laid out the technicalities, “If you burn a token like SHIB on an L2 chain, you are not actually burning the original token on the L1 chain.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prints Rare Buy Signal, What You Need To Know Lucie further explained the burning process across both layers, emphasizing the necessity for burns to occur on the Ethereum network to affect the original SHIB token supply genuinely. She explained that Shibarium projects which wish to burn tokens, have to make sure to bridge the SHIB back to the Ethereum network and then send it to the dead wallet. Pawzaar’s implementation of this directive is a first on Shibarium and showcases their commitment to the community’s consensus on token burns. Remarkably, the NFT platform launched only on October 24 and saw a massive influx of users thanks to the SHIB Dreams collection. The high demand was too much for the node provider and prompted the Pawzaar team to stop minting new NFTs for a while. Recently, Pawzaar also announced: “We will be adding collections and providing details on the upcoming PAWPASS. Expect announcements of some upcoming partnerships and PAW (PAWZONE) utilities on the platform. Keep building Shibarium NFT creators and supporting SHIB burns collectors! The fun is about to begin.” At press time, Shiba Inu traded at $0.000008, just above the 20-week EMA (at $0.00000798).

Team VESA and Vernissage have become fast friends, as the two entities share a similar vision for fine art NFTs and maturing of the market. VESA co-Founder Lotta has also helped Vernissage in storifying their message, some of which is showcased here. It has been an absolute delight to see Vernissage grow and this article is our token of appreciation in anticipation of their debut exhibit. Vernissage was born out of the electric crackle between art lineage value, molten paint dripped onto canvases over centuries, and the brooding engine room of new technologies. Lifetime entrepreneurs Richard and Tatiana wanted to see art nurtured and valued in the age of the internet, not trampled by the metallic onslaught of ironic pop culture references and diminished prestige. We forsake value at our own peril, a manic risk like pouring gasoline on a fragile artefact. NFTs are the anvil, Vernissage wielding the hammer. The underlying technology, the facilitator, the potential, like on that night when two artists knocked on Richard and Tatiana’s door and presented them with a box full of rolled up canvases. Richard and Tatiana Zalan Even though the platform is preparing for their first exhibition, Vernissage team Richard and Tatiana Zalan are no strangers to new technologies. Their interest piqued already in 2016, when they hosted meetups for people interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Art, as their passion, they approached via the high effort, fine art type of digital art, rather than art that was focused on utilities and marketing. They saw blockchain technology as a vehicle to safeguard artists copyright and transition in the third age of the Internet. True admirers of genuine art, Vernissage origin story started forming when one night, travelling artists knocked on Richard and Tatiana’s door, with a box full of rolled up canvases. It amazed them how these artists were willing to go to such great lengths to connect with their potential buyers, and this set the wheels in motion in utilizing technology to continue our fine art legacy in Web3. There it was, value laden, curated fine art in a fast-paced, snappy medium that was brought to the market by people decorated with experience, who were not in their twenties anymore. Unusual and quirky? Yes. Desperately needed? Also, yes. Vernissage had started to take shape. V is for Vernissage Vernissage means an exclusive, first viewing of an artwork before a public showing. The name perfectly fits the platform’s mission to support emerging artists specifically. It reminds of something exciting, quite intimate, but also distinguished and steeped in tradition and value. Vernissage is striving for something quite extraordinary. The platform has functions of a marketplace and a social network. The emphasis is on the social aspects of the community, and thus Vernissage community members can interact with each other and vote. Richard and Tatiana want to see their artists become financially successful, therefore nurturing collector relationships within the community is of utmost importance in Vernissage. Their social consciousness runs deep, as Vernissage will allocate resources for young artists’ education and personal development in the future. This focus, they feel, is represented also in the wider context of our society, where socially we live in crucial times. Art can serve a pivotal role once again, especially if new technologies are utilized boldly and innovatively. This is why Dubai has served Vernissage well since the local government has passed relevant laws to make the city a leader in the sector. Get to know the Vernissage platform here: https://www.vernissage.network/ Immersion explosion on November 8th Soon it will be time. Vernissage is gearing up for its maiden voyage exhibition with a brand-new armada of artists that they successfully held and open call for in September. Vernissage has secured an impressive venue for the event; the kanvas Gallery in an artistically relevant neighbourhood near Alserkal Avenue. Kanvas Gallery lends itself to some spectacular immersion, opening the entire view for the artists use and pushing the boundaries of sensory overload. Kanvas wants to explore how human relationships, nature and art interact specifically mediated through technology. Fittingly, the topic of the night is Technology and Humanity Canvas.

42419221,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE4o1,1698923257,UK Regulator Publishes Guidance for Crypto Marketing Regime,"The Financial Conduct Authority published its guidance on crypto promotions following a June-August consultation.  The FCA set out that firms approving crypto promotions for crypto that claims to be backed by a commodity should have sufficient evidence to prove this.  The U.K.'s financial watchdog published guidance on its crypto advertising rules Thursday, clarifying how they need to be applied after a new regime on promotions for the industry took effect on Oct. 8.  The guidelines, which follow a June-August consultation by the Financial Conduct Authority, require firms to include appropriate risk warnings on all communications to U.K. customers that have a “promotional” element. They also mention the need for evidence to support claims made in promotional material.  “While the new rules for firms marketing crypto to U.K. consumers are aligned with the existing rules for other high-risk investments, we’ve engaged extensively with industry and designed this guidance to specifically support crypto firms complying,” Lucy Castledine, the FCA's director of consumer investments, said in a statement.  The guidance says crypto assets claiming to be backed by a commodity will need to prove this. Firms can provide the evidence through disclosures, independent audits and proof of deposits, the FCA said. The industry will need to “demonstrate that claims of stability, such as links to a fiat currency, are bona fide,” according to the document.  As for financial promotions relating to lending and borrowing, specific risks should be disclosed. In addition, complex yield models need to have clear evidence regarding potential rates of return. A complex yield model occurs when person A markets the possibility for person B to transfer crypto to person A so that person B receives a rate of return.  The FCA also wants firms to clearly state the changes to legal and beneficial ownership of assets to customers. Plus, firms will need to conduct due diligence on both the crypto asset and service they are promoting, including ensuring the crypto is not linked to fraudulent activity.  “Firms should not use their regulated status in a promotional way. For example, by using their regulated status to claim or imply a competitive advantage over other firms,” the guidance said.  The regulator has already added 221 firms it deems non-compliant with the new regime to an alert list, and has promised enforcement action on companies that are not careful with approving ads.

Bitcoin [BTC] has historically lived up to the adage modeled along Sir Isaac Newton’s third law of motion and could do so again, rising as high as $56,000 by the end of the year, according to crypto services provider Matrixport.  “If bitcoin is up at least +100% by this time of the year, then there is a +71% chance or five in seven that bitcoin would finish the year higher with average year-end rallies of +65%,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in a note to clients on Thursday. “As bitcoin tends to reach its peak by December 18th, we could call the six to seven weeks from early November to mid-December Bitcoin’s Santa Claus Rally.”  As of writing, bitcoin is trading above $35,000, representing a 114% on a year-to-date basis. The impressive gain could be attributed to several reasons, including spot ETF optimism, speculation the Federal Reserve’s liquidity tightening cycle has peaked and haven demand. The expected 65% price rise means bitcoin could trade above $65,000 by the year-end.  “Based on these statistics, bitcoin continues to offer upside potential, and a +65% year-end rally would lift prices back to $56,000,” Thielen added.  The chart shows the historical performance of bitcoin in the first ten months and the final two months of the year from 2010-2022.  In seven out of the past 12 years, bitcoin scored at least 100% gains in the first 10 months. In these seven years, bitcoin rallied by an average of 65% in the final eight weeks.  “When bitcoin is up at least +50% by the end of October, there is, on average, a 78% chance that bitcoin will advance even more into year-end. Bitcoin rallied another +68% until year-end on seven of nine previous occasions. This analysis is based on thirteen years of bitcoin history,” Thielen noted.  Note that past data is no guarantee of future results.

MicroStrategy Acquired An Additional 155 BTC In October In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Saylor mentioned that his company acquired this amount of BTC for $5.3 million and now holds 158,400 BTC. The businessman made this comment while sharing the company’s third-quarter 2023 financial results. Related Reading: Unique Fair Pricing Model Puts XRP Price Higher Than Bitcoin, Here’s How Much The release also affirmed Saylor’s revelation as it gave a detailed analysis of its BTC holdings and the company’s unwavering commitment to continue stacking up the digital asset. The company notably stacked up a total of 6,067 BTC since the end of Q2 2023 for $167.0 million or at $27,531 per token. These figures instantaneously raise the presumption that Microstartegy’s Bitcoin investment strategy is currently in profit. This presumption is also backed by the fact that the company further went on to mention that it holds 158,400 BTC, which it acquired at a total cost of $4.69 billion, or $29,586 per token. It is worth mentioning that the company recorded a 3% increase year-on-year in its total revenue, which in part could be thanks to its Bitcoin venture, as the company’s CEO Phong Le suggested. He mentioned that his company is “well situated to capitalize on both the tailwinds in Bitcoin and growth in our BI business.” BTC recovers | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com MicroStrategy’s Commitment To Bitcoin Remains Strong Commenting on the company’s Bitcoin purchases, MicroStrategy’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Andrew Kang mentioned that their commitment to acquire and hold Bitcoin “remains strong,”, especially with the increased possibility of a wave of institutional adoption happening soon with prominent asset managers like BlackRock moving to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF. The company’s “Bitcoin Strategy” has also positively influenced the company’s outlook, with many (especially crypto natives) having an affinity to the company because of its crypto ties. These ties to BTC also seem to have had an effect on the company’s stocks. Related Reading: Bull Season: Analyst Outlines Breakout That Could Send Solana To $100 As Saylor highlighted in an X post, MicroStrategy’s MSTR stocks have seen about a 242% increase since the company incorporated Bitcoin into its balance sheets. This period, which dates back to August 2020, has seen the company’s stock perform better than major stocks like that of Apple and Google. MSTR has even performed better than Bitcoin itself in that period. On a personal level, Saylor continues to be one of the major advocates of the flagship cryptocurrency and recently shared a Bitcoin-related X post with the caption “Join the Race. #Bitcoin” in what seems to be him urging his followers to get bullish on the crypto token.

The firm entered the market with a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), in August.  ""On November 1, 2023, we received a subpoena from the U.S. SEC Division of Enforcement relating to PayPal USD stablecoin,"" PayPal revealed in its quarterly earnings report filed Wednesday. ""The subpoena requests the production of documents. We are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request.""  PayPal's stablecoin was the first from a major financial service firm. The announcement raised concerns in Washington because it was a reminder of the Libra stablecoin, a previous effort by Facebook, now Meta Platforms (META), that didn't come to fruition. The fear from some U.S. regulators is that a token tied to a major tech platform could expand quickly to wide usage and present a threat to U.S. financial stability.  PayPal's stablecoin threatened to push a divided Congressional debate over crypto legislation further apart. Some members, such as House Financial Services Committee's ranking Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), said a stablecoin bill would allow big tech to claim that sector of the crypto industry. PayPal's arrival offered a live example of that possibility.

This rally in Solana’s value set the tone for a day where altcoins gained significant traction. (Concurrently, Bitcoin experienced a late rally, breaching the $35,500 mark. This unexpected surge in Bitcoin not only solidified its position but also contributed to the overall bullish sentiment in the market.) The day’s dynamic movements highlighted the growing influence of altcoins, particularly Solana, showcasing their capacity to drive market trends. This collective push underscored a major shift in the crypto landscape, suggesting a broader diversification of investment interest beyond Bitcoin. Related Reading: XRP Hits $0.6 In Unstoppable Surge: How High Can It Go This November? Solana: Meteoric Rise And Resilience In The Crypto Market Solana’s recent strides in the market have been nothing short of spectacular, showcasing an astounding growth of over 80% in just a few short weeks. SOL demonstrated its bullish momentum by surging to approximately $42.30, as reported by Coingecko. With a circulating supply of 420 million SOL, Solana is valued at a market cap of around $17,685,464,775. Despite worries about its future following the bankruptcy of Alameda Research, a major investor in the Solana ecosystem, and Sam Bankman Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange, Solana has surprised many observers by emerging as one of the best-performing assets, rising by more than 300% this year. According to recent data from CoinMarketCap at the beginning of November, the value of SOL experienced a notable increase over the course of the last 30 days. Specifically, SOL’s market valuation rose from $9.80 billion on October 2 to surpass $17 billion on Wednesday, resulting in a substantial addition of approximately $6 billion to its overall capitalization. Against a backdrop of positive indicators and having already reached a critical milestone of $40, the cryptocurrency Solana is poised to attain a noteworthy valuation of $50. The current rising trajectory of SOL’s value, which has experienced a roughly twofold increase in the past month, establishes a solid basis for the anticipated milestone, lending credibility to its feasibility and potential imminence.

These assets are presently kept in a staking wallet. The act of unstaking described here is a component of FTX’s money movement plan, which has resulted in a notable rise in the overall amount of SOL transferred, approaching the threshold of $90 million.

Though getting to this point took over a dozen witnesses and more than a hundred exhibits, the DOJ's case is pretty straightforward.  Billions of dollars of FTX customer and investor funds, and some Alameda lender funds, are gone. There's really no disputing that. In the DOJ's telling, Bankman-Fried found FTX – a company he founded and mostly owned – to be a perfect cash cow for Alameda – another company he founded and mostly owned.  The defense, in contrast, argued that everything that happened with FTX was the result of poor risk management and a slow-building series of issues. The DOJ never managed to prove that Bankman-Fried himself was involved in some of the decisions and actions that led to its multibllion-dollar hole, and none of the witnesses ever testified that FTX was set up specifically to divert customer funds from the beginning, defense attorney Mark Cohen said.  We've reported the witness testimony and evidence across the last month, so I won't go into detail here. But it is worth taking a quick look at some of the main arguments we heard on Wednesday.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  The charges  Wire fraud/conspiracy to commit wire fraud against FTX customers (counts 1 and 2)  The loss of customer funds is obviously FTX's biggest issue. Per the DOJ, Bankman-Fried defrauded (and conspired to defraud) his customers by letting Alameda tap those funds. FTX customers deposited the money they intended to trade (or buy crypto with) into bank accounts that actually belonged to Alameda, letting Alameda misuse the funds, Assistant U.S. Attorney Roos said.  Cohen, Bankman-Fried's attorney, argued that the FTX founder – a heavily overworked, stretched CEO – genuinely believed that FTX was a safe company. He didn't know the extent to which there were issues until shortly before it all collapsed.  The DOJ brought two witnesses to the stand to testify that they thought FTX was a safe company to use to invest in cryptocurrencies, pointing to Bankman-Fried's tweets and ads produced by the company.  ""Here is what one customer said: He was relieved after seeing the defendant's tweets. He found it reassuring. Another customer told you that after seeing the defendant's tweets, he felt comfortable to just sit and wait,"" Roos said about Bankman-Fried's public statements immediately before FTX filed for bankruptcy.  Wire fraud/conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Alameda's lenders (counts 3 and 4)  The main idea here is that Alameda's balance sheets were doctored, and then sent out to companies it was trying to borrow millions of dollars from. Bankman-Fried reviewed and OKed the balance sheets that were sent to companies like Genesis (a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent firm) and BlockFi, Roos said. He pointed to Google-produced metadata showing that Bankman-Fried's email account definitely viewed the document that contained the balance sheets.  But, Cohen said, ""he only remembered reviewing one of the spreadsheets"" on that multi-tabbed document – and Caroline Ellison, Alameda's CEO, said she discussed ""some"" of the tabs with Bankman-Fried.  BlockFi's Zac Prince told the court that he would never have lent out funds if his company had seen the real balance sheets and knew that Alameda had borrowed billions of dollars worth of customer funds – though Cohen contended that this was a gotcha question, and BlockFi had previously conducted due diligence on more of Alameda's financials prior to any initial loans.  Roos' argument is: ""You cannot come up with an alternative version of your finances and give them out.""  Conspiracy to commit securities fraud against FTX's investors (count 5)  Companies like Paradigm and Third Point invested in FTX, and Bankman-Fried lied to these companies about what it was doing with the funds and how much revenue it was generating, Roos said, pointing to the EcoSerum staking revenue that former FTX executive Nishad Singh testified was only added by backdating revenue across 2021. Paradigm invested in FTX's Series C funding round in 2022 – after the 2021 revenue figures were out, in other words.  FTX also did not disclose it was shifting losses to Alameda or that its insurance fund was detailed by a ""random number generator,"" Roos said.  But Alameda – a company mostly owned by Bankman-Fried – assuming some of these losses isn't necessarily a crime, Cohen suggested. The company was a market-maker and payment agent on FTX and its role was to ensure smooth operations and liquidity.  Interestingly, Cohen did say that investors who invested in FTX prior to May 2022 weren't defrauded because this was before any of the financial issues really happened, despite the fact the EcoSerum figures were shared prior to that month.  Conspiracy to commit commodities fraud against FTX customers (count 6)  This is basically just kind of more of the above: Bitcoin and ether are commodities, customer funds were stolen, therefore there's conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, is the basic argument. The defense also goes back to whether or not Bankman-Fried knowingly and willingly engaged in fraud, which is the same argument as above.  Conspiracy to commit money laundering (count 7)  In short, the DOJ is alleging that FTX customer funds moved to Alameda's bank accounts, where they were then moved into investments or political donations.  Cohen's defense is that Bankman-Fried wasn't trying to conceal the movement of these funds, citing political donations – a ""heavily regulated"" form of giving – as an example.  Details  Roos and Cohen presented stark contrasts across their different closing arguments. The AUSA was extremely animated, constantly stepping around and gesticulating. At one point, when arguing against some of the defense arguments brought up over the past month, his voice rose in pitch, emphasizing his point.  Cohen did none of that. He leaned over the lectern (and it is a lectern, not a podium – I asked) and gestured a bit, but mostly maintained a sober demeanor. He was a bit more animated after the first half hour, arguing that Bankman-Fried was not a criminal mastermind or a ""movie villain,"" despite what the DOJ would have the jury believe.  The defendant – that's what Roos called him each and every time, ""the defendant"" – worked on his computer during most of the DOJ presentation. But when Cohen took over, Sam – how Cohen referred to him – just sat in his chair, looking over in the general direction of the jury box and his lawyer.  Listening to the competing attorneys, it's not hard to see where the defense's key issues might be. Though the burden of proof is on the prosecution, the DOJ does have a very simple narrative: Bankman-Fried knowingly and willingly misappropriated customer funds, lied about it, spent the funds on all sorts of things and then tried to mislead people when things fell apart. Roos spent the first few hours of his argument repeating the phrase, ""where did the money go, what happened and who's responsible"" – the three questions he wants jurors to ask themselves when they deliberate. He used quotes from the witnesses and court exhibits to illustrate the point, and kept mentioning the missing billions.  Cohen's argument, on the other hand, is by necessity far more complicated: There was a lack of risk management, efforts to hedge risk were unsuccessful or didn't happen, margin trading issues worsened FTX and Alameda's financial positions. FTX's real estate purchases and sports sponsorships were reasonable and justified expenses, and the prosecution's key witnesses testified either under cooperation or non-prosecution agreements.  ""None of the cooperating witnesses … acted like they thought they were doing anything wrong,"" he said. ""None of them resigned.""  Customers indeed had no major withdrawal issues until it all fell apart.  And these points are true. The entire inner circle continued working at FTX or Alameda into November 2022, which is also when withdrawal requests outpaced available assets. The expenses may well have been reasonable for a company seeking to draw talent to its global headquarters and attract customers via sponsorships.  But, as Roos pointed out, this is all kind of beside the point. The question is were the funds misappropriated and/or did Bankman-Fried lie about that?  Cohen said FTX's terms of service allowed FTX to take customer funds (which, look, you know my suspicions about that) and that the government didn't really make its argument in terms of the timeline of events.  But he almost struggled to push back against the DOJ's specific allegations. Bankman-Fried's infamous ""FTX is fine. Assets are fine"" tweet was up until he learned the truth, at which point he took it down, Cohen said. He saw so many emails and documents that he just signed off on things like the balance sheet. And Cohen sort of addressed the multibillion-dollar hole, but mostly he just tried to talk about the broader issues outlined above.  Bankman-Fried's own testimony did indeed turn out to be an issue that came up during the closing arguments. Roos commented that he seemed like two different people when testifying before his own attorney compared with the cross-examination.  Cohen seemed to be trying to rehabilitate Bankman-Fried as a witness, saying the DOJ would dismiss his efforts to defend himself in court regardless of how he responded to the questions. Cohen tried interpreting Bankman-Fried's discussions and comments with other witnesses – the ones he later tried to cast as being unreliable narrators.  Roos painted a picture of Bankman-Fried as someone who repeatedly chose to hide what he knew and when he knew it, in an effort to misappropriate funds. Bankman-Fried made ""criminal choices"" over and over again.  But Roos never explained ""why"" Bankman-Fried may have done any of that, Cohen said.  — Nikhilesh De  Courtroom scenes  Where is everybody? Barely 30 people were at the courthouse by 9 a.m. Wednesday.  Cohen repeatedly referred to the DOJ case as prosecutors creating a movie, with ""Sam the villain"" as its lead character. Reporters covering the case have, over the past two days, begun suggesting who may be suitable for the cast of this movie: Robert De Niro (who we did not see in the cafeteria again Wednesday) as Judge Lewis Kaplan, Harry Melling as Bankman-Fried and Jamie Lee Curtis as Barbara Fried.  Reporters who watched the sun come up from the courthouse steps also watched the sun go down from the overflow room. It was nice. (Editor's note: Also sounds exhausting!) And a reminder that winter is headed full-speed toward us.  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  So … there's a chance that Judge Lewis Kaplan is going to hold the jury in the courthouse to deliberate late on Thursday. How late? He was talking about how the jurors would get free pizza for dinner. The press pool probably won't be invited to that particular party.  There's also a chance the court may sit on Friday for deliberations. TBD on a final decision there.  Before we get to that: The DOJ has a final chance at a rebuttal argument, which sounds like it won't take more than an hour on Thursday. This will just be the prosecution saying (I assume) some version of ""Sam knew dang well what he did.""  Then, the judge reads the final jury charge out to the men and women who are going to decide on a verdict. It's more than 60 pages and will likely take a few hours. The jury will probably begin deliberations after lunch. And that means there is a very real chance that we'll get a verdict on the one-year anniversary of the article by my friend and colleague Ian Allison that kicked this whole thing off.  — Nikhilesh De",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/02/the-case-against-sam-bankman-fried,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The change threatens to delay bankruptcy proceedings further.  An updated bankruptcy plan filed by crypto lender Genesis last week represents a significant change of plans, the U.S. government said in a filing on Wednesday. The lender is now seeking to liquidate its assets rather than reorganize them.  The apparent U-turn by Genesis – made after the crypto lender and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) were sued by the New York Attorney General (NYAG) – could add extra delays to the wind-up process, the filing by U.S Trustee William Harrington said. DCG is also CoinDesk’s parent company.  “The prior plan provided for the sale of assets of the debtors and a non-debtor affiliate, a discharge of the debtors, and the reorganization of any unsold assets for the benefit of the claim holders,” said Harrington, a Department of Justice official with responsibility for bankruptcy cases. “The liquidating plan provides for the liquidation of all three debtors … the debtors have substantially and materially modified the sale plan.”  Harrington argued creditors will need more time to digest the impact of the significant changes made on Oct. 24 before deciding whether to approve them in a vote.  The bankruptcy, which commenced in January, has stumbled over how to treat over $1.65 billion Genesis is owed by DCG. In a filing made last week, Genesis said a DCG deal is now “not a viable route” after NYAG Letitia James accused DCG, Genesis and business partner Gemini of defrauding investors.

19711997,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558746,1698914132,Ripple Transfers 800 Million XRP Back To Escrow: Catalyst For Price Rally?,"Recent financial maneuvers by Ripple Labs have caught the eye of crypto sleuths again. Recent data from crypto data analysis platform Whale Alert has shown a significant movement of 800 million XRP tokens back into Ripple’s established escrow system. This move comes in the aftermath of Ripple’s customary monthly unlocking of one billion XRP, a practice that started in 2017 as part of the company’s strategy to maintain XRP price stability. Ripple Returns 800 Million XRP To Escrow The essence of Ripple’s escrow mechanism is to facilitate a consistent and predictable distribution of XRP to the market. This counteracts any potential price volatility that might arise from a sudden influx of tokens. In its commitment to this cause, Ripple, back in 2017, pledged to gradually release 55 billion XRP in 55 monthly tranches of one billion XRP each. Post-release each month, Ripple typically returns a majority of the tokens, mostly 800 million XRP, back into the escrow, retaining a minor portion, around 200 million XRP, for market circulation. Recent data from Whale Alert confirms that Ripple was no exception this month and has locked 800 million XRP tokens back into the established escrow system. Related Reading: XRP Price Rally Threatened As Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion Tokens Notably, the return of the 800 million XRP tokens occurred in two equal transactions, each involving 400 million XRP. Delving into the data from XRP Scan reveals that the first set, amounting to 400 million XRP, was directed back into escrow from an address known as ‘Ripple 10.’ Prior to this, ‘Ripple 10’ had received the said tokens from two different addresses: Ripple 22 and Ripple 23. The subsequent batch of 400 million XRP was transacted from ‘Ripple 23’ to another address dubbed ‘Ripple 11,’ before it was also directed to the company’s escrow account. The market value of the re-locked 800 million XRP stood at an approximate $480 million during the time of these transactions. Of the original 1 billion XRP that were made available, the remaining 200 million XRP, with a current valuation of about $121 million, was moved from Ripple 22 to Ripple 1. This balance is anticipated to facilitate Ripple’s operational expenses and other business-related activities. Related Reading: SEC Demands $700 Million Settlement From Ripple, Pro-XRP Lawyer Reveals Next Steps Ripple’s escrow holdings now total roughly 40.9 billion XRP. For context, their Q3 report disclosed that they had about 41.3 billion XRP in escrow at the end of September. XRP Price Poised For More Upside After XRP broke the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) line (blue) on October 21, the price has been on a tear. Within 11 days, the XRP price increased by almost 20%. That the XRP price took a breather from its rally yesterday is probably not due to Ripple’s monthly transfer from escrow, as the XRP tokens do not hit the market immediately and, moreover, investors know how to gauge the issue. A better explanation is that XRP encountered a strong resistance with the 0.386 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.625, where the price was rejected in a first attempt. Notably, the bulls could make another attempt if the price stays above the $0.60 level. If the breakout succeeds, the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.683 could be the next short-term price target. However, if the XRP price is rejected again at $0.625, a retest of the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.553 could be the next logical move.

SGKB, founded in 1868 with 35 branches in the east of the country, is working with SEBA Bank, a FINMA-regulated digital asset specialist that is helping the regional bank to offer custody and trading services in bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH].  The first customers will be wealth-management clients of the bank, but retail customers are next in line, and other coins and staking services are also planned, according to Christian Bieri, SEBA Bank's head of investment solutions.  There have been a number of Swiss banks joining up to provide crypto, often to private clients and high-net-worth individuals. Now the trend is moving to include retail consumers across the crypto-friendly country.  “It's the first bank with a clear retail focus that we have onboarded and an example of the development we are seeing in Switzerland,” Bieri said in an interview. “This started some years before with wealth management and private banking, and now we see a lot of interest as well from retail banks.”  SEBA, however, is not the first to push retail crypto banking. Last month, regulated business-to-business crypto specialist Sygnum partnered with Zuger Kantonalbank for a mobile-based crypto offering.  It’s a rising tide for all boats, according to Bieri. “But I think the market will be big enough for multiple offerings.

Will the Situation Last?","Put options or bearish bets tied to bitcoin [BTC] are trading at a discount to historical standards, offering a rare opportunity for bulls to snap up downside hedges at cheap valuations.  The conclusion is based on the ratio between two metrics – implied volatility for 25-delta out-of-the-money (OTM) BTC put options and the 30-day implied volatility (IV) of at-the-money (ATM) options. The ratio has dipped below 1.00, according to data provided by Amberdata.  It’s a sign that 25-delta put options listed at strikes below bitcoin’s current market price are undervalued in volatility terms relative to those at strikes near the spot price.  Implied volatility, traders’ collective expression of expected price turbulence, reflects demand for options. Professional traders often quote and compare options’ valuations in implied volatility terms.  A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, while a call buyer is bullish. Traders with bullish exposure in the spot/futures market often buy puts as a hedge against potential price correction.  The latest discount comes as traders scramble to add bullish exposure through calls amid bitcoin’s price rally. The cryptocurrency topped the $36,000 mark early today, extending October’s 28% gain.  That said, the window of opportunity to buy cheap hedges could be short-lived, as puts have rarely traded at a discount since early 2022.  “Put IV seldom dips below ATM IV, let alone for extended periods. Despite the current bullish market sentiment and reduced demand for downside protection, it’s difficult to imagine a scenario where BTC puts consistently maintain a discount relative to ATM volatility,” Chepal told CoinDesk.  “This prompts us to question whether this phenomenon will persist in the weeks to come,"" Chepal added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/02/bitcoin-put-options-which-offer-downside-protection-look-unusually-cheap-will-the-situation-last,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1ee7a61773991cba6eb85a94e01e4c66a75a5db-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In financial terms, psychological levels are key price points where traders and investors have historically shown heightened interest, often leading to increased buying or selling pressure. Crossing this mark after a prolonged period of market volatility signals a potential shift in sentiment for XRP enthusiasts, who have eagerly awaited a resurgence in the coin’s value. Related Reading: Solana Bull Run Could Smash Through $40 Barrier This Week – Here’s How XRP’s Remarkable Rebound According to the latest data from CoinGecko, XRP was trading at $0.606379, reflecting a notable 2.7% gain over the past 24 hours. Over the course of the week, the digital asset witnessed an impressive seven-day rally of 9.2%, solidifying its upward trajectory and instilling confidence in the cryptocurrency market. This upward momentum, while significant in itself, has also sparked a flurry of activity among XRP whales, who have long been regarded as influential players capable of shaping the market’s direction. Recent data from the crypto analytics platform Whale Alert shed light on a substantial transaction involving a major XRP whale. The data revealed that an anonymous entity had transferred a staggering 412,890,441 XRP tokens, valued at approximately $248,922,341, from one wallet to another. Such large-scale movements by influential holders can often trigger a domino effect, leading to increased interest from smaller investors and, in turn, contributing to further price fluctuations. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 412,890,441 #XRP (248,922,341 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown new wallethttps://t.co/FhYAxqGyXW — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 1, 2023 Related Reading: THORChain Beats Rivals In Top 100 Coin Rankings With 34% Rally – How RUNE Did It XRP market cap currently at $32.42 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Key Milestones And Challenges For XRP In parallel to these developments, Ripple, the company behind XRP, published its comprehensive market report for the third quarter, highlighting several key achievements of the cryptocurrency during the period.

However, amidst these positive indicators, the report also pointed to a slight downturn in the overall transaction count, registering a decrease of over 8% compared to the previous quarter. This decline, while not entirely alarming, underscores the need for continued market analysis and strategic measures to maintain a steady growth trajectory for XRP. As Ripple and its native coin XRP continue to make significant strides, market observers remain vigilant, analyzing various factors that could impact the cryptocurrency’s trajectory in the coming months.

The SEC alleges that these individuals orchestrated a “massive fraudulent scheme” involving the unregistered sale of SafeMoon (SFM), a “crypto asset security” as defined by the SEC. Per the complaint, instead of delivering the promised profits and taking the token “Safely to the Moon,” the defendants allegedly wiped out billions in market capitalization, misappropriated investor funds, and withdrew over $200 million in crypto assets for personal use. On this matter, David Hirsch, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, emphasized the need for caution in the decentralized finance (DeFi). SEC Charges SafeMoon And Executives According to the complaint, Kyle Nagy assured investors that funds in SafeMoon’s liquidity pool were safely locked and inaccessible to anyone, including the defendants. However, according to the SEC’s investigations, large portions of the liquidity pool were never locked, and the defendants allegedly misappropriated millions of dollars, indulging in extravagant purchases such as McLaren cars, luxury homes, and lavish travel. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Market Cap Soars On Regulatory Success: 59% YTD Growth Achieved The SEC’s complaint reveals that SFM’s price skyrocketed by over 55,000 percent before plummeting nearly 50 percent when the public discovered that the liquidity pool was not locked as claimed. Notably, Karony and Smith allegedly used misappropriated assets to manipulate the market and prop up SafeMoon’s price through wash trading. The SEC’s complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charges the defendants with violating registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Indictment Unsealed Against Executives For Securities Fraud An indictment was also unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn, charging Braden John Karony, Kyle Nagy, and Thomas Smith with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy. Breon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, announced the arrests and charges. United States Attorney Peace emphasized the commitment to pursuing fraudsters in the digital asset space, stating that their “ill-gotten gains” would not protect them from justice. Ivan J. Arvelo, Special Agent-in-Charge of Homeland Security Investigations, New York, highlighted the “relentless pursuit” of individuals exploiting investors and the financial system for personal gain. Related Reading: Bull Season: Analyst Outlines Breakout That Could Send Solana To $100 It is noteworthy that the charges in the indictment are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty. SFM Token Crashes To Lowest Trading Price Since Launch Following the recent disclosure of the news, SFM has experienced a significant crash, plummeting by over 52%. Currently, the token is trading at $0.00009142, marking its lowest trading price since its launch in 2022. This substantial decline of over 72% within the past year underscores the severity of the case. Furthermore, when examining other time frames, the token has seen declines of 49%, 34%, and 24% over the past seven, fourteen, and thirty days, respectively.

More Delegators Staking ADA, Confidence Remains High Sharing a screenshot on November 1, the user notes that roughly 250 ADA holders have opted to stake their coins daily for the past year. By the end of Q3 2023, there were 1.31 million delegators, up from 1.22 million recorded around the same time last year. This means that despite the harsh crypto market conditions, ADA holders seem to have been unfazed and choose to lock their coins instead of exiting for other coins like Bitcoin (BTC) or stablecoins, including USDT. Cardano uses the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which the team, Input Output Global (IOG), claims to be more scalable and efficient than other consensus systems, including Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW). In Cardano, Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) are tasked with validating a block of ADA transactions where they receive rewards after every epoch. Related Reading: Bull Season: Analyst Outlines Breakout That Could Send Solana To $100 SPOs eradicate the need for miners. Since anyone with a Cardano wallet can participate in the consensus process, the platform is thought to be more decentralized. ADA holders who choose not to run SPOs can delegate their coins through their favorite validator and receive staking rewards. More Stakers Engaging, What Happens To Price Next? As of November 1, there are 2,888 SPOs with stake, meaning they manage ADA from delegators. Meanwhile, there were 1.31 million unique delegators by the end of Q3 2023, an increase from the previous year. In total, 65.33% of all ADA is engaged, actively participating in consensus and helping keep the network decentralized. Even so, this is down from 71.57% recorded in Q3 2023. The active stake translates to 22.9 billion ADA, down from 25 billion in Q3 2023. According to trackers, there are 35.2 billion ADA in circulation. Despite the confidence among ADA holders, prices are relatively subdued. The coin is still trending below July 2023 highs of around $0.37. Even so, prices have been on an uptrend, breaking above the $0.27 high of October. A close above $0.40 could open up ADA for more gains towards 2023 highs of around $0.46. Conversely, any sell-off from spot rates may push the coin closer to 2023 lows of $0.24.

19701000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558637,1698883227,Analyst Reveals Why Ethereum Is Underperforming Against Bitcoin,"Ethereum has been notably underperforming Bitcoin through this latest rally. Here’s why this is so, according to a CryptoQuant analyst. Ethereum Net Taker Volume Has Been Mostly Negative Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn has pointed out what the “net taker volume” for Ethereum is looking like. The net taker volume here is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the taker buy volume and taker sell volume on the Bitcoin futures market. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the taker buy volume is dominating the taker sell volume right now. Such a trend implies buying pressure may be strong in the market currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Ramp Up Selling, BTC To Decline Below $32,000? On the other hand, negative values could suggest the presence of a bearish sentiment among the investors, as selling pressure is higher than the buying pressure. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Ethereum net taker volume over the past few years: Looks like the 30-day MA value of the metric has been near the neutral mark in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum net taker volume has been mostly negative during the past few months, implying that sentiment around the asset has remained bearish. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has enjoyed periods where the taker buy volume has surpassed the taker sell volume, as the chart shared by the analyst a few days back showed. The 30-day MA value of the indicator seems to have been green in the last few weeks | Source: @JA_Maartun on X Most notably, the net taker volume of Bitcoin is significantly positive right now, suggesting the strong buying pressure present in the market. Unsurprisingly, BTC’s sharp rally has come alongside these positive values of the metric. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal: MVRV Has Entered The “Danger” Zone Ethereum has no such buying pressure present at the moment. Maartunn believes this is why the ETH price has been performing considerably poorly against BTC recently. Ethereum Has Still Not Touched The Highs Set Earlier In The Year Ethereum’s underperformance against Bitcoin is easily visible in the asset’s year-to-date chart. ETH has enjoyed some rise during the past month | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView At the same time as Bitcoin observed its rally off the back of the highly positive net taker volume, Ethereum also saw a surge of its own. This rise, though, has been nowhere near as sharp as that of the original cryptocurrency, as ETH is still just trading around $1,800, which is notably less than the top of around $2,100 that the asset set back in April. Not only has Bitcoin surpassed the $31,000 top it set back in July, it has also done so in spectacular fashion, as it’s now trading above the $34,000 level, which is significantly higher. If the net taker volume is anything to go by, the second largest cryptocurrency may continue to underperform versus the largest, so long as investor sentiment around it remains negative.

42419246,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE6Fp,1698883200,"A Year After Sam Bankman-Fried's Downfall, Solana and Other FTX Holdings Are Flying High","A year ago Thursday, the first domino fell that led to the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire.  On Nov. 2, 2022, CoinDesk published a now-award-winning scoop that revealed Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research was mysteriously brimming with FTT tokens issued by his FTX exchange. It was the first sign that Alameda and FTX were more closely intertwined than Bankman-Fried had let on and that he was in a financially precarious position, but that wasn't the half of it. As was learned later, Alameda and Bankman-Fried allegedly – and, according to prosecutors, improperly – took FTX customers' money for their own use.  FTX and Alameda filed for bankruptcy nine days later, Bankman-Fried was arrested soon after and his criminal fraud and conspiracy trial is now close to its conclusion.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Ran 'Pyramid of Deceit,' Prosecutor Says in Closing Argument; Defense Calls Case Against FTX Founder a Fantasy  But what about FTX the company? It's still in bankruptcy court. Matrixport, a crypto financial services company, estimated in September that the company's reorganization would on average return 37 cents on the dollar to creditors – which seems surprisingly high, given how dire things looked a year ago when the company was in freefall, customers were scrambling to get their money and the company infamously got hacked hours after its Chapter 11 filing.  And that recovery estimate could even be conservative. For instance, the value of the bankruptcy estate grew by around $1 billion over the past two weeks thanks to a massive rally in the price of the Solana blockchain's native token SOL, a cryptocurrency and project championed by Bankman-Fried.  FTX holds some 55.8 million SOL tokens, the majority of which (42.2 million) are locked up and not immediately tradable on the market, according to CoinGecko. Last month, reports emerged about FTX's holdings in the form of an official debtor venture portfolio, which pegged the SOL holdings at a market value of $1.16 billion. But since then, SOL has risen from around $20 per token to around $40 now.  'Amazing to think about SOL'  ""It's amazing to think about SOL here,"" said Thomas Braziel, CEO of 117 Partners, which advises investors on buying distressed assets.  There are $10 billion of customer claims against the company, said Braziel, who expects them to recover at least 80% of their money – in other words, they'd lose out on $2 billion or so. But if SOL's price gets to $50 to $60, that ""leads to 100%+ certainty for creditors,"" he said.  And the secondary effects are ""huge,"" Braziel added. ""Creditors like the Voyager estate, for instance, would start to be in the money.""  That said, FTX's SOL holdings only start to unlock next year, and the majority of the tokens are frozen until 2027 or 2028.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Started Buying Solana's SOL at 20 Cents Using 'Alameda Profits,' He Says at His Trial  ""This is great, but it's not entirely straightforward because a lot of the solana is locked,"" Braziel said. ""Some of it is being moved around, being staked and perhaps there are plans to explore selling some of it. Just like with Anthropic, it's fantastic news, but the estate has to get liquid on this stuff.""  The Anthropic that Braziel mentioned is an artificial intelligence startup that Bankman-Fried bankrolled. Anthropic has recently enjoyed a wave of funding from the likes of Amazon and Google that has boosted its valuation and, presumably, the value of FTX's stake.  There have also been discussions about reopening the FTX exchange to squeeze out more money for creditors.  Against all odds and despite the allegations of misdeeds, FTX's fortunes have turned around massively even as Bankman-Fried's personal situation has worsened: Jurors could start deliberating his fate as soon as Thursday, the anniversary of the CoinDesk story that undid him.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,"Ian Allison, Nick Baker",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/02/a-year-after-sam-bankman-frieds-downfall-solana-and-other-ftx-holdings-are-flying-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/924f300d4a2f226716f6a66aaffc2326dbe79aad-2688x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
