10840513,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4588407-cipher-fastest-growing-bitcoin-miner?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1679095280,Cipher: The Fastest Growing Bitcoin Miner,"Summary In a few short months, Cipher Mining has scaled to be a top 5 BTC producer in the public markets. Cipher has been using a balanced approach to Bitcoin treasury management, selling production to fund operations while also growing the HODL stack slowly. The untapped equity shelf is both an opportunity and a risk depending on how management uses it. The fastest growing public Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner by production capacity is currently Cipher Mining ( CIFR ). The company has quickly scaled a mining operation over the last several months and is now one of the leaders in the public Bitcoin mining space by several key metrics. Cipher Mining became a public company through a SPAC merger with Good Works Acquisition Corp back in 2021. At the time, the company had a valuation of $2 billion with plans to use cash from the merger to grow out a Bitcoin mining operation. Data by YCharts Having now been 2 years since the SPAC merger was announced and over a year since it was completed, Cipher has become the third largest Bitcoin miner by market cap - though with a 75% reduction to the original $2 billion merger announcement valuation. In this article, we'll look at the production growth, treasury strategy, and point out some things to keep an eye on. Production & Capacity Guidance As mentioned, Cipher Mining has very quickly scaled a mining operation over the last few months. Capacity at the end of February was 5.2 EH/s. This rapid increase in mining capacity since November has propelled Cipher into the top 5 public miners by production capacity as of last month: BTC Production Trend (Company filings) With 398 Bitcoin produced in the month of February, Cipher now produces more Bitcoin each month than Bitfarms ( BITF ), HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ), and Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ). While EH/s growth has been strong since getting the company's Odessa site online, Cipher has guided a somewhat conservative approach to scaling from here relative to what has been brought on in the last 3 months. EH/s Guidance (Cipher Mining) Cipher anticipates a total potential hash rate of 8.2 EH/S this year, which would come primarily from its Bear and Chief operating sites. In the earnings call earlier this week, CEO Tyler Page gave insight into the strategic approach going forward and offered rationale for why the company hasn't jumped on faster expansion despite machine acquisition opportunities being available: However, given volatile market conditions, we want to be mindful of not overextending ourselves. So we will continue to evaluate expansion in light of market conditions. This near-term opportunity for growth with strong built-in unit economics but without operational spending commitments is one that few if any of our competitors have and demonstrate Cipher's continued approach to look for low-risk opportunities. Some of the opportunities the company says it has declined to move on involved credit terms that were unfavorable and acquisitions of businesses that have fundamental flaws. Treasury Strategy One of the things that I look at each month is the net change in the Bitcoin balances for each publicly traded miner. While selling down BTC positions isn't always indicative of a company that is in trouble financially, I do view 'stacking' as a positive sign. In the event that BTC goes up substantially, the value of the assets the company has in treasury will increase as well and those spikes in BTC price can be used to opportunistically raise more cash without diluting shareholders. BTC in Treasury January 2023 February 2023 Mo/Mo Cipher Mining 424 465 9.7% Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 6,978 7,058 1.1% Bitfarms 405 405 0.0% Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 11,418 11,392 -0.2% Hut 8 9,274 9,242 -0.3% HIVE Blockchain 2,430 2,365 -2.7% Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ) 115 101 -12.2% Bit Digital ( BTBT ) 971 697 -28.2% CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 301 100 -66.8% Source: Company releases In February, Cipher had the largest percentage change in BTC HODL - increasing nearly 10% from January. The nominal increase was just 40 Bitcoin, or about 10% of Cipher's February production, which indicates a balanced approach to BTC treasury as the company is selling most of the monthly production to pay expenses while holding some for price increase optionality. This optionality is important because the company could potentially have to raise cash soon and has a couple different levers it can pull to bring in fresh money. Risks to Consider In the company's earnings report from earlier this week, it disclosed a little under $12 million on cash at the end of December, though that figure has increased to $16.4 million at the end of February as Cipher has been able to use BTC sales to fund operations. In the event the company needs funding, which I view as likely if the price of Bitcoin reverses lower, there is a $250 million shelf that Cipher has yet to draw from: Earnings Deck (Cipher Mining) During the conference call, Page was pretty clear that the shelf would be tapped if it made sense to do so from an operational expansion perspective. The example the CEO gave involved the immediate use of equity offering cash to scale capacity at Odessa. However, the 2023 economic viability of Bitcoin mining is still up in the air and depends on the price of Bitcoin to a significant degree. If the price of Bitcoin does indeed fall back down below the $20k area for a sustained period of time, Cipher may need to hit the shelf for opex given the $41.1 million total operating expenditure over the last half year. Cipher's SG&A expense was more than six times revenue in Q4-22 and CFO Ed Farrell indicated on the call that the run rate from the second half of 2022 could be a reasonable expectation for 2023. This run rate is probably fine at $25k BTC, it's much less fine at $20k BTC. And this gets us to the expenses. Cipher reported production costs of $5,143 in electricity per Bitcoin at its Alborz site and $6,293 in electricity per Bitcoin at its Bear and Chief sites. This is outstanding compared to peers, but we don't have clarity on what the electricity cost is at Odessa and that's where the majority of the mining has taken place so far this year: Site BTC Mined YTD Cipher Owns Odessa 770 770 Alborz 186 91 Bear & Chief 111 54 Source: Cipher Mining I think it's also important to mention that Alborz, Bear, and Chief are joint ventures with WindHQ LLC and Cipher owns roughly half of the Bitcoins that have been mined at those sites year to date. This means 84% of Cipher's Bitcoin that has been mined in 2023 has come from Odessa and this is the site that we don't yet have electrical expense clarity. Summary While I think Cipher is interesting, I'm waiting a bit before I consider opening a position. I'm a bit concerned by the company's non-operating expenses and I want to see what that looks like following a quarter with operations that are more reflective of current production levels. There is no doubt the electricity costs the company disclosed at Alborz, Bear, and Chief would be industry-leading but I still think it's a little too early to be in this one. I would only be selling CIFR shares if you think the price of Bitcoin is about to go down. Short of that, Cipher stock is a hold.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4588407-cipher-fastest-growing-bitcoin-miner?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10840513.jpeg

42421225,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqkn,1679090066,Baron Davis: Bringing Athletes to Web3,"For National Basketball Association fans of a certain age (raises hand), we remember Baron Davis as the electric point guard who, in 2007, led the Golden State Warriors to a stirring upset over the heavily favored Dallas Mavericks. Davis was fearless and feisty and knew how to fire up a crowd.  He still does. Or, more accurately, since he has pivoted to entrepreneurship Davis has worked to excite and engage communities across a range of projects – offline and online and now Web3. With The Black Santa Company, Davis launched a mix of block parties, games, mixed-media stories, apparel, books and non-fungible tokens (NFT) to celebrate diverse and inclusive storytelling.  This interview is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week.  The Black Santa Company is a multi-hyphenate – lots of different things at once – much like Davis himself. He can rap, he can act, he can cook up savvy business plans. That was tougher for athletes to do 20 years ago. “When I was making beats and rapping, you couldn't put out an album as a basketball player,” says Davis in a Zoom interview. “Now, 20 different athletes have albums out and their fans support them.”  So as more athletes are becoming creators, Davis is building Web3 tools to empower creators and help them engage with their communities. Enter his newest venture, SLiC, which stands for Sports Lifestyle in Culture. Ultimately, Davis envisions SLiC as a multi-hyphenate mix of platform, production studio, community hub, publisher and streamer that connects fans and creators.  One of the first verticals Davis will launch is SLiC Images, which aims to be a decentralized platform, file storage product and licensing system for photographers – pros and amateurs alike. “If a picture says 1,000 words, we want to capture history now because in blockchain and Web3 those words can live for 1,000 years,” says Davis, who opens up about the goals of SLiC, how he sees athletes using social tokens and utility tokens in the future, and why even in the bear market, despite all the negative press, NBA players who know web3 are “still excited about it.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Let’s start with The Black Santa Company. Was that part of your journey to NFTs and Web3?  Baron Davis: We were out pitching Hollywood every day. Some producer, director or studio exec. Finally, we got an offer from a studio and they told me that they would pay for me to basically not be attached to the project for two years while they develop it.  And I was like, ""Well, I have this whole vision for being able to bring in a group of creators.” And because of who Black Santa is, this should feel communal and we should be able to license the IP to small businesses.  Right. You wanted a seat at the table.  I didn't want to go around Hollywood with the Hollywood elites and sell out my brand, sell out my community, sell out my culture.  And then NFTs came along. So that’s how Web3 came about. It was like, “Let’s make Web3 and NFTs simple for our community.”  What are the goals of SLiC Images, and what problem is it solving?  The problem we're solving is, one, photographers never had a marketplace. Another one is, think about the way that photos are shared and the way people take photos and random photos and selfies at conferences or basketball games. When you look at the LeBron [James] shot [breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s scoring record], everybody in the arena had their camera out. There are 1,000 pictures of LeBron's last shot. With SLiC, you could see, nominate and identify certain photos to use and license.  Ah, so in theory, SLiC would be a platform for everyone in the arena to store their photos, on-chain, and they would truly own them and could license them, as opposed to just giving them to Instagram?  Absolutely. If a picture says 1,000 words, we want to capture history now because in blockchain and Web3, those words can live for 1,000 years. So we look at that and say, ""Well, SLiC Images should be the database where you can go back to 2023, 20 years from now, and type in a date and then all of your photos will pull up and they belong to you.""  Interesting. So is this almost a competitor to Instagram, in a weird way?  Yeah, it's just a longer process [with Instagram]. If you were shooting a documentary, or if you wanted to use a photo for a flyer, right?, our goal is to create a database for those photographers, those galleries, those publishers. And now the next great documentary or Hollywood movie or festival will have the ability to have access to the photos.  Smart. What has it been like to launch this in the bear market?  I think it has greatly affected us. We’re just a small design shop, right? We haven’t had the greatest visibility. So as we were coming out the market was crashing. But we're builders.  I’m sure you’re still in touch with NBA players. What would you say their attitude is now about crypto and Web3? Have they soured on it in the bear market?  I would say for the ones that know and understand it, they're still excited about it. I think they're waiting for the right opportunity and the right platform.  For us, we want to invest in culture and we want culture to have a seat at the table of ownership, so it's a true partnership. Because I would like to buy an NFT, an image, a highlight, a photo, a trading card knowing that it's coming from the players in some way, or from someone who was actually a part of it, right?  As opposed to just uploading my picture to Instagram and waiting 10 years to figure out if I'm ever gonna get paid for content that I don't own anymore.  You’ve commented on utility tokens in the past and how you see them as distinct from social tokens. Can you elaborate?  Oh, man, I will give you all the sauce. So there's two use cases for tokens, I believe. For us, from the SLiC side of things, the social tokens allow you to socially interact with talent and content and experiences, things like that. You can earn perks, you know what I mean? You can earn and win auditions, tryouts and things of that nature. Because you're a participant, you may not have the resources, right? You may not have the financial resources but you have the talent, and there's a way to get to know people socially through social media and enjoy their work. So I believe social tokens allows you into the community.  Utility tokens are your membership, right? That means that you're a part of something. You can bid on things. You can use your tokens to participate in things. You can use your tokens to support projects. So really, when you think about utility, you think about participation.  Some people buy tokens to hold them, right? Some people buy tokens to use them. And some people buy tokens because they want to see what's going on. And so for us, as we start working through our token structure it's more so about the utility.  What’s your prediction for how athletes will use tokens? Do you think this will be widely used?  Well, if I'm predicting SLiC and if I'm predicting the future I do believe that if the token is the utility, and if we look at the evolution of the internet, if we look at the evolution of a blog site or a fan page or Instagram or followings, we are communal in nature.  Our biggest responsibility as athletes is, in no particular order, to our family, the game, our team, the city and then the fans. And you know that the fans are who make you feel good about your work. So I feel like the athletes have the ability to create an infrastructure and a system through SLiC, right?, where they can interact with their fans through their token.  So is this type of token a future vertical for SLiC?  That’s the future SLiC. That’s also the now of SLiC, you know what I mean?  Think about the New Age athlete. Back in the day, when I was making beats and rapping, you couldn’t put out an album as a basketball player. Now, 20 different athletes have albums out and their fans support them.  And as people [athletes who are also entertainers] start realizing, “I have to align myself with a community,” we want to be that destination.  Let me take a stab at synthesizing this. You point out an important cultural trend, that over the past 10 or 20 years athletes now have the ability, the agency and the tools to be creators in many different facets of their lives. Even if crypto didn’t exist, that was already happening in a broader trend. And Web3 can help accelerate this trend by removing friction from the system and empowering them to have true ownership and engage with their community? And SLiC can help with this. Am I warm?  Absolutely. I love how you worded it. I’m glad this is being recorded. [Both laugh.]  Before we wrap up, what other projects excite you in the space?  I would say on the gaming side, metaverses. We have a project, “History of the Game,” where our goal is to build the digital Hall of Fame of storytelling for basketball. We have a mini-documentary, and you’ll be able to walk around and watch this documentary in a digital tunnel.  Do you want me to show you? I can show you?  Hell yeah.  [Over our Zoom, using his phone, Baron Davis then gives me a sneak peak of a mini-documentary of LeBron James passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the all-time scoring record. Davis directed it. He explains that it’s just a rough cut. It’s an immersive doc that you watch as you walk through a Hall of Fame-esque tunnel, with videos playing on both sides of you.]  This is really cool.  This will ultimately live in the metaverse that we’re building. It’s where we’ll store the work that we’ve done. And now we can create the NFTs in our metaverse. So SLiC, as a production entity, creates these assets, and then these assets of storytelling can now get ported into our museum. We can have award shows, concerts, or special storytelling in a virtual environment.

42421312,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpcL,1679086830,Could Legendary Hip Hop Platform DatPiff Serve as a Springboard for ‘Music NFTs’?,"Last week, social media was abuzz with whispers that DatPiff, the venerable hip hop mixtape platform, might be closing shop after 18 years of unparalleled service to the music community. Though the rumors were ultimately debunked, it got me thinking: What if the future of music non-fungible tokens (NFT) lies not in the countless new platforms that seem to launch every day, but in leveraging the intellectual property (IP) of a well-established brand like DatPiff?  Since its inception in 2005, DatPiff has been a cornerstone of mixtape culture, hosting exclusive releases from the likes of Lil Wayne, J. Cole, Meek Mill, Wiz Khalifa, Future, Chance The Rapper, A$AP Rocky, Mac Miller, Big Sean, Travis Scott and others. The deep emotional connection that fans have with the platform's content could be the secret ingredient that finally makes music NFTs resonate with the masses, far more than the gimmicky offerings we've seen so far from Web3 newcomers.  Azeem Khan is the fundraising and partnerships lead at Gitcoin, an open-source Web3 fundraising platform that uses quadratic funding. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Culture Week.""  Today's music NFT landscape is littered with platforms that differentiate themselves only by their partnerships with a single industry player or the blockchain they’re launching on. Despite their potential, these relationships often fail to gain traction with the executives who hold the keys to the music industry's treasure chest.  See also: Ethereum's Regens Tend to Ethereum's Public Goods | Opinion  But what if instead of chasing partnerships we used DatPiff's existing IP to build an NFT marketplace with streaming capabilities and a curated selection of content that fans already know and love?  The inherent advantages of such a strategy are numerous. First, DatPiff boasts an established user base, providing immediate access to potential buyers. The platform has cultivated a large and dedicated community over the years. By leveraging its existing audience, a music NFT marketplace could tap into a pool of potential buyers, even if they were initially offered free content.  Additionally, the platform's curated selection offers a strong foundation for an NFT marketplace, giving users a diverse range of music to collect and enjoy. In an era where content overload is a real concern, the value of curation cannot be overstated. DatPiff's catalog consists of a wide array of mixtapes, including many popular and influential releases, providing users with a well-rounded selection of music they'll be eager to collect and listen to.  Perhaps most importantly, DatPiff's brand recognition within the hip hop and rap communities could lend credibility and trustworthiness to the NFT marketplace, making it an attractive choice for music lovers. Building a brand is no small feat, and DatPiff's established reputation would make it easier for users to feel confident in using the platform.  By capitalizing on DatPiff's artist relationships and unique offerings, a music NFT marketplace could also secure exclusive and limited-edition content, providing additional incentives for fans to participate. The connections that DatPiff has forged over the years would prove invaluable in obtaining exclusive material, further enhancing the marketplace's appeal.  It's worth noting that most artists in the Web3 space today are new to the scene. The music industry is notorious for its long path to success, often taking a decade or more for artists to establish themselves. Unfortunately, Web3 music platforms don't have the luxury of time to wait for artists to develop.  The challenge of building a multisided marketplace is daunting because securing a supply of content does not guarantee an eager audience of buyers. This is the predicament facing many of today's music NFT platforms.  See also: Who Is Building Ethereum's Public Goods? | Opinion  However, DatPiff could change the dynamic. Launching a music NFT marketplace with access to DatPiff's music catalog could bypass many of the obstacles faced by new platforms, offering several advantages over starting from scratch.  While the future of music NFTs holds great promise, realizing that potential requires a more strategic approach than merely launching new platforms with limited differentiation. By leveraging the established brand, user base, curated content and artist relationships of a platform like DatPiff, we can create a music NFT marketplace that resonates with fans and accelerates mainstream adoption.  It is time to embrace the legacy of successful platforms and use them as a springboard to revolutionize the way we interact with and consume music in the digital age. In doing so we can ensure a more vibrant and diverse future for the music industry, where artists and fans alike can thrive in an era of digital innovation.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Azeem Khan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/17/could-legendary-hip-hop-platform-datpiff-serve-as-a-springboard-for-music-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd479fea4f8b5f31ad6edd7745b884993fc90118-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421310,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpbJ,1679084989,NFT Marketplaces Should Promote 'Underrepresented Artists and Art Forms',"Since its inception, Web3 has promised us a rainbow. But when it comes to non-fungible tokens (NFT), we’re still in the monochrome days. Too many artists from diverse cultures find themselves underrepresented and unseen in Web3.  Isn’t it time to make inclusivity and accessibility as much of a priority for NFT marketplaces like OpenSea or Blur as floor prices seem to be?  J.D. Lasica is the CEO of Amberfi, a platform for launching NFT marketplaces including the creator-focused marketplace Expressions. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Culture Week.""  Take a tour of the major NFT marketplaces and you’ll see a steady stream of copycat generative art projects. Many of these are wickedly fun and provide value to both creators and collectors, but it’s time to unlock the door and let in the millions of artists from six continents who are still sitting on the sidelines.  What are they waiting for? I’ve been asking that question of hundreds of creatives, artists and photographers from South America, Africa, the Caribbean, Asia and elsewhere.  Overwhelmingly, these creatives tell us they see the current NFT landscape as largely a playground for Western, Euro- and American-centric visual artists – a reflection of the traditional art world, with a strong technological patina slathered on top.  Western art continues to dominate NFT land and is often seen as more valuable and prestigious than art from other cultures, which can limit the visibility and recognition of non-Western art forms.  That’s not to say non-western creatives aren’t welcome in Web3. They are, if you make a concerted search on Foundation, SuperRare, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, OpenSea and other platforms.  Still, many artists are not yet seeing their works attain any sort of meaningful value in this burgeoning new ecosystem. Many feel caught in a self-perpetuating cycle where Western art is seen as more valuable simply because it is more frequently bought and sold.  When speaking with Caribbean artists, for example, we’ve encountered a profound mistrust of established Western institutions as a byproduct of hundreds of years of colonialism.  The entire history of the Caribbean, you could say, has been one big rug pull.  In today's digital age, the world of art is constantly evolving and new technologies are opening up exciting new possibilities for creators. One such innovation is the rise of NFTs, which are digital assets that allow artists to monetize their work in new and innovative ways.  See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work? / Learn  Recently, I had the pleasure of speaking with Gus Adolfo, a talented Puerto Rican artist who is embracing this new technology and planning to release his first NFT collection in the coming months. As we chatted in a crowded cafe in Old San Juan, Gus shared his perspective on the unique cultural heritage of the Caribbean.  The people of the Caribbean have a rich and complex history, one that has been shaped by both conquest and colonization, he said. This legacy has left many Puerto Ricans feeling defensive and wary of outsiders thanks to the weight of historical baggage that has been passed down through generations.  What can be done, in light of historical injustices and power imbalances that exist to this day? I asked.  Should we create a more inclusive and equitable ecosystem where artists from all backgrounds can thrive by encouraging NFT marketplaces to promote a wider range of underrepresented artists and art forms?  Should we prod collectors and galleries to diversify their collections and break down the biases and assumptions that underlie the dominance of classic Euro-centric art?  Should we launch education and awareness-raising campaigns to promote diversity and inclusivity in the NFT world?  Gus smiled. “I feel it starts with the individual. I’m proud of my Caribbean essence and Puerto Rican heritage. We’re doing a lot of healing work. Getting in touch with our ancestral roots,"" he said.  Ultimately, he sees the rise of NFTs as an opportunity to celebrate and share his culture with the world, one collector at a time. By embracing this new technology, he hopes to not only monetize his art but also to spread awareness and appreciation for the stories and traditions of the Caribbean.  As we move forward into an increasingly globalized and interconnected world, it's important that we take the time to celebrate and honor the diversity of our shared humanity. By embracing new technologies like NFTs, we can break down barriers and build bridges of understanding and appreciation between cultures and people, he suggested.  See also: The Australian Open Goes Full Web3 / CULTURE Week  He mentioned that a lot of his friends are Latino artists, some of whom have left Puerto Rico for a better life on the U.S. mainland. “Some of them have been accepted. But some have been rejected, too. For me, moving away would be a false promise. Chasing the wrong thing.”  After all, the light that’s worth chasing isn’t out there.  He takes a long sip of his drink and looks around the room at the sea of bodies jostling for a seat at a table. “In the end, we are all made of light. I’m a light worker. Made of light, energy and frequency. I don’t have enlightenment. But I’m working on it. It all starts on the inside.”  CORRECTION (MARCH 22, 2023 – 20:00 UTC): AmberFi is a platform for launching NFT marketplaces.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,J.D.

42393741,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA0VL,1679084146,The NFT Louvre Exhibit That Wasn't: Untangling the Public Mess of a Non-Event,"On Monday, March 6, Claire Silver, a well-regarded non-fungible token (NFT) artist who uses artificial intelligence (AI) in her work, excitedly announced on Twitter and through an exclusive article in Variety that she would be exhibiting her art at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.  According to Variety, her work was going to be presented at the Louvre ""courtesy of Superchief Gallery NFT"" and would premiere on March 21. The ""Superchief-Louvre show,"" as Variety wrote, would be a showing of her latest collection titled ""can i tell you a secret,"" which would be a series of 100 pieces created with AI.  Silver, whose work has been auctioned off by Sotheby's and displayed in galleries around the world, also shared on Twitter that her one-of-one NFT artwork ""Love in the 4th Turning"" would be on exhibit at the Louvre.  The news garnered praise and support from artists and collectors across the NFT space, who saw the exhibition as a sign of how digital art is gaining legitimacy in the traditional art world. Other museums, including Paris’ Centre Pompidou, the British Museum and the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) have recently embraced NFT art, so a showing at the Louvre initially seemed plausible.  Yet, Silver's announcement was immediately met with skepticism online from members of the traditional art space – some suggested the exhibition would likely be at the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall situated near the Louvre museum, while others cruelly implied that Silver was duped by unrealistic expectations.  On Friday, March 10, the Louvre confirmed that Silver would not be exhibiting there, leading to an outpouring of support for Silver by disappointed NFT enthusiasts left questioning how the embarrassing mixup happened.  A case of miscommunication?  When the Louvre finally set the record straight, Silver released (and deleted shortly thereafter) her version of the events. Later, she tweeted that she was ""unsure who misrepresented things.""  Superchief Gallery, the NFT art gallery that was helping to facilitate the exhibiting of Claire's work, also posted a lengthy statement to Twitter sharing its version of events. It said people at Paris Blockchain Week, a blockchain summit to be held at the Carrousel du Louvre later this month, had lied about the details of the exhibition.  ""They told us, Paris Blockchain Week has rented (“privatized”) the Louvre Museum. They said that the Louvre Museum had an event rental area, for the conference, and that they were excited for us to come in as their “Art Partner,"" Superchief Gallery said in its statement.  Shortly after, Superchief Gallery said its reps called Silver to share the news. The gallery contends that Paris Blockchain Week ""did not represent the details and facts in that meeting, or any meeting we had afterwards,"" only learning of the mixup on Twitter after the story about Silver's exhibition went viral.  Superchief Gallery claims in its statement that Paris Blockchain Week overpromised. Ultimately, the gallery decided to cancel its participation in the event entirely.  Paris Blockchain Week shared a different version of events. Organizers told CoinDesk that the location of the event was clearly expressed in the heading and in the text of the contract they presented. CoinDesk was able to view the contract over Zoom to verify.  ""It wouldn't have been in our interest to try to mislead in any way,"" the organizers said.  The team said that in planning the details of the exhibition space they did not speak directly to Silver.  ""We never heard of her. And she never heard of us,"" they said, adding that in light of the mishap they recently connected with Silver and offered to work together next year.  They shared that while the conference at large is being held at the Carrousel du Louvre, a fact that is splattered across their digital marketing materials, they are planning to host a private VIP dinner inside the Louvre museum, although they say this was never initially discussed with Silver or the third-party agency organizing on her behalf. They asserted that organizing the event came with ""very strict rules"" and that they have been ""extremely attentive"" to the images and text used to promote that event.  Messages reviewed by CoinDesk suggest that representatives for Paris Blockchain Week discussed the private VIP event inside the Louvre museum days after Silver shared news about the exhibition.  ""Only after the Louvre contacted Claire did the agency start discussions about ways Claire’s artwork could be displayed at any point that could be deemed inside the Louvre museum – out of desperation. We looked into solutions to try to accommodate, but without knowing the full extent of promises that had already been made to Claire by the agent.""  A spokesperson for global talent agency William Morris Endeavor (WME), which represents Silver, told Variety in a statement that “it’s unfortunate that a third party misrepresented the details of this opportunity to our client Claire Silver. We fully support Claire and believe that she acted with integrity throughout this process.”  It's unclear if a miscommunication occurred at some point during the negotiating process. Early, informal conversations about the opportunity took place at another event in Paris last month. However, the official contract was only signed between the two parties after Silver's public announcement had been made.  Ultimately, it appears that neither Paris Blockchain Week nor Superchief Gallery intended to deceive Silver or the public deliberately. Neither party would have gained in the long term by lying about something that was so easily disproved, only to hurt Silver's upstanding reputation in the art world.  The artist's burden  Many people on social media came to Silver's defense, noting that complex dynamics involving artists, agents, galleries, brokers and museums often exist. Ultimately, it appears that artists bear the brunt of the backlash from perceived failures, regardless of who else was involved or what happened behind the scenes.  ""A gallery’s success is measured by the success of its artists, and success for artists is determined by intricate measures of endorsement: Which important museum exhibitions have they been in? Which biennials? Have the right collectors caught on?"" wrote ARTNews in 2020.  Claire told CoinDesk that she has taken a step back from the situation to preserve her well-being.  ""I'm way out of my depth and have removed myself accordingly. Things went wrong at every level, and I was naive and flying too close to the sun to catch the issue myself.""  She explained that she had reasons to believe the exhibition at the Louvre was legitimate – she noted that the Louvre is closed to the public on Tuesdays and that the proposed exhibition would have been on a Tuesday. ""I've seen artists use the museum as a setting for music videos etc., so it made sense to me that an exhibition was possible on a Tuesday,"" she said.  Ultimately, she said she isn't placing the blame on any of the parties involved for the mishap. ""I respect what [Paris Blockchain Week] does for digital artists, and would have loved to exhibit at the [Carrousel du Louvre] if it was under any other context. I also deeply respect and am extremely grateful to Superchief for fighting harder for AI collaborative artists than anyone in the space.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/03/17/the-nft-louvre-exhibit-that-wasnt-untangling-the-public-mess-of-a-non-event,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b70bb9bed2e08d36a7cdfc59cbc6e59956661474-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization weathered bank failures, inflation concerns and ETH selling pressure to ride higher. Bitcoin was recently selling at about $26,780, up more than 30% over the past seven days, with much of its gains occurring since Monday. Ether has climbed about 21% over the same period.  Both assets made abrupt turns at the technically oversold Relative Strength Index mark of 30 on March 11, and accelerated their move higher following assurances by the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) that Silicon Valley Bank depositors would be made whole.  Bitcoin and ether now show RSIs of 70.7 and 61, respectively, moving them to the edge of the traditionally overbought reading of 70.  Historically, bitcoin has continued to perform well even when reaching overbought levels. Data dating to 2015 shows 408 occurrences where bitcoin’s RSI broached 70. Its average 30-day performance following an occurrence was a 13% increase.  Ether’s average performance was a less-robust 3% return after 30 days, highlighting that bitcoin has tended to trend higher when technically overbought, while ETH has been more prone to trim gains.  The two assets remain tightly correlated to each other, implying that investors still view them in a similar fashion despite their stark differences in how they’re used.  BTC and ETH’s performance ranked them fifth and seventh among cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $1 billion or more.  Leading the pack was STX, token of the Stacks layer 2 Bitcoin protocol, which finished up 75%. Immutable X ranked second among the group with a 69% increase.

Little significant data is likely to change expectations before the announcement.

However, bullish price action in Bitcoin means I'm still bullish on Coinbase. Below, we cover some risks to the bull case. The behavior we've seen in equity markets this year, in my view, means we're likely to go a lot higher by the end of 2023. There's plenty of fundamental news that is hard to be bullish in the face of, but if we simply look at price action of risk-on assets, I have a hard time not being bullish. Growth is outperforming value, the Nasdaq is destroying the S&P 500, and the subject of this article - cryptos - is another market where money is flowing in a very risk-on manner. Coinbase ( COIN ) has been in the crosshairs of the bull/bear argument in cryptos since it went public, which was less than two years ago. The company is a huge player in the crypto exchange market, and its fortunes, therefore, are tied mostly to retail traders wanting to own cryptocurrencies. When cryptos are flying, Coinbase generates huge revenue. Of course, that flow works both ways, and in recent months, there's been a lot of bad news for cryptos, and that's extended to Coinbase. The last time I wrote about Coinbase was back in December, and the company had just announced sizable job cuts. I slapped a buy rating on the stock at the time, and it's up 47% since then. Seeking Alpha If we look year-to-date, the stock is up a far more impressive 92% (!), so if we look at the stock in light of that gain, is it still a buy? The answer to that is somewhat tricky, as we've got a mixed bag in terms of the indicators I like to use. Let's dig in. Charting the path Let's begin, as we always do, with the chart of the stock. Coinbase is tremendously volatile - near-term options have implied volatility of 115% - so it's not for everyone. However, with big risks come big potential rewards, so volatile stocks just take some discipline to trade. I think Coinbase has a fairly favorable setup here, so let's take a look. StockCharts We can see the moving averages are strongly trending higher, and the rally in cryptos this week has seen Coinbase reclaim the previously lost 50-day simple moving average (in blue) and the 20-day exponential moving average (in red). The momentum indicators look good as well, with the PPO bouncing off of the centerline, which is textbook bull market behavior. In addition, the 14-day RSI bounced off of the 40 level, which again, is bull market behavior. The centerline of the PPO and the 40 level of the 14-day RSI are important support levels during bull markets, and we have those levels being respected for Coinbase right now. I'll note there's a huge amount of congestion in the $60 to $80 range, where the stock traded for months last year. That means there are a lot of holders with a cost basis in that range, and a lot of volume took place in that range. That means that we're very unlikely to just blast through and over that range, given we're likely to see sellers for those that bought last year and turned into bag-holders. That doesn't damage the longer-term case for bulls, but it's something to contend with as we look to eventually rally. The final panel in the chart is the correlation of Coinbase to the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), and we can see they are unequivocally linked. Therefore, it makes sense for us to look at Bitcoin itself, as the direction of Bitcoin will have a huge impact on the direction of Coinbase. StockCharts I'm quite constructive on Bitcoin right now, despite the failed breakout we had earlier this week. The level around $25k is a big one, and there was a very decisive breakout this week, that almost immediately failed. That's not great but I still think we're set up well here to eventually break out and go a lot higher. I've annotated the level the bulls need to break, as well as the next target, which is about 20% higher. If Bitcoin follows this path, Coinbase is going to soar. I think the balance of power with Bitcoin is firmly with the bulls right now, and that's very good for Coinbase. One final point on Coinbase with all of this in mind is that its short interest is still quite elevated. It's 19% as of now, which means that if we do get an upside move, it could snowball into a very sizable rally should short start covering. High short interest is not, I repeat, not, a reason to buy any stock. I'm simply saying that if the bulls can take over, the rally could accelerate quickly due to short covering. Let's now take a look at some fundamental factors. This is where it gets murky Anyone that has read my work knows I place a huge amount of value on charting and price action. However, fundamentals matter as well, and this is where the outlook is more challenging for Coinbase. Let's begin with revenue revisions. Seeking Alpha During the time where cryptos were super-hot, Coinbase's revenue flew higher, and estimates followed suit. The problem is that these estimates have come back down to earth in a big way. Now, can these be revised back up? Of course, they can, and if I'm right about the direction of Bitcoin, we will see these rise again. But this is a key risk of owning Coinbase right now. We have a rising stock price and depressed revenue estimates. Doesn't take a math wizard to figure out that means the valuation has deteriorated, and we'll look more into that below. In addition, Coinbase is still consistently operating at a loss, so there is no P/E analysis we can do, at least not yet. This is a $15 billion company that loses money, and that's something some investors (understandably) have an issue with. Doesn't necessarily bother me, but it's something to consider. Seeking Alpha's Quant Ratings are a useful tool when evaluating a stock, and Coinbase was relatively recently upgraded from sell to hold by the model. If you're curious how the model works, you can read about it here , but it's a way to approach stocks that take the emotion and opinion out of the decision-making process. That is exactly why I like technical analysis, because it takes the emotion out of investing, and it's why I reference the Quant Ratings. The upgrade of Coinbase by the Quant model is a feather in the cap of the bulls, in my view. Now, Coinbase was upgraded because its revisions and price action have improved dramatically, but the other three factors - valuation, growth, and profitability - all remain very weak. This is not an all-out buy signal, but for a business that has struggled for a few quarters, this kind of upgrade is often the precursor to a much bigger move. You can take or leave the Quant model, but to me, it provides additional evidence that the worst is likely already behind Coinbase. If we look forward, there are two basic scenarios to consider. My preferred scenario, and the one I think is most likely based upon current evidence, is that Bitcoin chops for a bit and then breaks out over the 25k level. Breaking out is the first step, and holding the breakout is the second one. Earlier this week, we saw half of this, but I think we'll get a breakout that holds in the relatively near future. That would unequivocally be good for Coinbase, and that scenario would likely see the stock soaring as revenue revisions would almost certainly move much higher. The other scenario is that the 25k level in Bitcoin holds as resistance, and Bitcoin retests its recent lows. If that happens, Coinbase could have a very significant downside. This is why we must use stops and not simply buy-and-hold anything. I look at stops in reference to major moving averages - the 50-day simple moving average in this case - and recent price lows. Based upon your personal risk tolerance, you should have a stop level in place if you decide to own Coinbase. On the risk side, apart from the risk that Bitcoin pricing falls, there's always regulatory risk for anything crypto-related. We've seen exchanges and financial institutions related to crypto fail, and that's always going to be a risk. This industry is still relatively new, and there's going to be headline risk that translates to Coinbase as a result. You have to be okay with this if you're going to own Coinbase. Valuing Coinbase stock Lastly, let's take a look at the valuation. As I mentioned, Coinbase has no earnings, so we'll use price-to-sales. TIKR The stock is at 5.3X forward sales, which is about the highest it's been since the start of 2022, apart from a couple of brief periods. I wouldn't necessarily say Coinbase is cheap, because the valuations prior to early-2022 were driven by bullish-all-things-crypto behavior in the markets. In other words, I wouldn't expect 10X or 12X forward sales again as a reasonable scenario to consider. Of course, one way for this ratio to come down is for revenue revisions to rise, and as I mentioned earlier, if I'm right about Bitcoin's price action going forward, we're almost certain to see revisions go higher for Coinbase. That would go a long way toward solving the valuation dilemma, so this is not a showstopper for me. But it's a risk I want everyone to be aware of, as the valuation was a lot more favorable three months ago. If we boil all of this down, what should we do? I recognize the risks of crypto-related stocks, and the headline and regulatory issues that can come with the space. Coinbase's valuation is also not something I'm jumping up and down about. However, the stock's chart looks pretty bullish to me, and above all, I think Bitcoin's bull case is strengthening in a big way. If we get a sustained breakout, Coinbase is going to be a lot higher than it is today, despite nearly doubling already this year. For this reason, I'm sticking with my buy rating despite the stock having a monster 2023 already.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4588353-coinbase-stock-rose-over-91-percent-ytd-is-it-buy-opportunity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10834813.jpeg

42411031,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB4B1,1679082091,The Truth About Artificial Intelligence and Creativity,"The past year has been a very successful coming-out party for advanced versions of two types of artificial intelligence. We’ve been blown away by large-language models, or LLM, that can mimic a friendly conversation or a high schoolers’ history homework. And we’ve had our minds blown by art processors including Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.  The models are fun toys, and some may become reliable enough to have serious commercial applications. But LLMs and image processors face a major, even defining limit: Both LLMs and their graphical equivalents operate entirely by copying existing work.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week.  That has quickly led to lawsuits against AI firms that have trained their models without paying to properly license training images or other data. Those suits are an ironic followup to the wave of intellectual property (IP) lockdowns of the 1990s, which began with tougher controls on music sampling and culminated in 1998’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Those rules were pushed by the same kind of huge conglomerates that are now creating AIs – and fighting for their right to, at least according to critics, steal whatever they want.  Artists feel rightly threatened by the exploitative drive of the Googles and Microsofts of the world – but they also see promise in AI. Producer and vocalist Holly Herndon is among those who view AI as a potential tool for her creativity rather than strictly a threat to her ability to make a living from it. But that future, friendly to both artists and AI, can only exist under the right regime of IP laws and practices. Early efforts to develop such a framework include experiments with non-fungible tokens (NFT) and other blockchain tools.  Glorified autocomplete  The claim that AI models are effectively doing nothing but copying will surprise many, especially those who’ve enjoyed their often uncannily good output, but don’t know how they actually work.  The output is so impressive because what AIs do is an advanced, nuanced kind of copying. Rather than lifting specific phrases or images, they extract and regurgitate the underlying patterns of human expression. This is why some have called LLM AIs “autocomplete on steroids.”  Read more: Crypto Long & Short: Finding Alpha in AI-Related Crypto  “At a literal level, these neural nets are trained to do one thing and one thing alone, which is predict the next word,” says Beerud Sheth, founder of Elance (now Upwork) and now CEO of chatbot developer Gupshup. “The miracle is that autocomplete on steroids actually is a pretty good description of a lot of human language … It creates all sorts of amazing things.”  Those amazing results can mask the fundamental simplicity of what’s going on under the hood. While they’re really just juggling numbers and taking probabilistic guesses based on pre-existing work, chatbots and art AIs have shown they can mislead some into believing they’re creative, or even self-aware.  Large larceny models  The creators of AIs benefit from that misperception, and some have been subtly fostering it. Even the increasingly standard term “generative AI” implies more originality than these bots actually have. Such overselling helps foster unrealistic perceptions of what the technology is capable of – most importantly, among investors.  That’s not so new: Tech companies from Facebook to Uber have spent much of a decade promising AI would help them scale and reach profitability. Those long-ago promises remain entirely unfulfilled, and after less than a year the serious limitations of even the new wave of advanced language models have made themselves known.  But perhaps even more useful than misleading Big Tech investors, the mystification of “expressive” AI helps distract from how it often works: via copyright infringement on a massive scale.  “Everything an LLM knows comes from copyrighted expression,” argues intellectual property lawyer Matthew Butterick. “There’s no moment where it becomes a generator of underlying ideas.”  Butterick is pursuing what he says are the first two major lawsuits aimed at enshrining that argument in case law, and he expects similar cases to multiply in coming years. Such litigation could pose a major obstacle to the profitability of some AI applications, which might be forced to pay licensing fees for all of the millions of pieces of human-crafted expression used to train them.  Read more: Megan DeMatteo - How AI Is Changing Artistic Creation and Challenging IP Laws  “When you go down that path of arguing, ‘It’s some data derived from the image in a certain way,’ well, that’s just a copy,” says Butterick. “It’s just a fancy way of figuring out how to store the data and regenerate it later.” Renowned science journalist and sci-fi writer Ted Chiang recently made much the same point in the New Yorker magazine: Chatbots and other AI generators, as he put it, are best understood as “a blurry JPEG of the web.”  Butterick is hoping to make that view of chatbots and image generators part of legal doctrine. Butterick represents a trio of artists in a lawsuit as part of a class action suit filed in January against AI image generators Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt. The suit argues their AI image model was trained using unlicensed images. Getty Images has made similar claims in a subsequent infringement suit. Butterick is also leading a class-action suit against Copilot, a Microsoft-backed effort to use AI to craft computer code – which it accomplishes by nicking human-crafted code, in part from the open-source repository Github.  Copilot in particular, Butterick says, has been caught simply cutting-and-pasting large blocks of code from human developers into its supposedly “generative” output. It also offers its clients a half-million-dollar indemnification against copyright infringement suits for code they deploy, which strongly suggests Microsoft understands that it’s playing with fire.  Funky precedent  All of this, Butterick argues, clearly violates well-established copyright standards. One major moment in the development of those standards revolved around an earlier technological innovation: digital sampling tools.  Many important legal precedents in IP stem from the use of samples in hip hop music, a practice that produced staggering creative innovation and masterworks like Public Enemy’s “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back” and the Beastie Boys/Dust Brothers’ “Paul’s Boutique.”  But when sample-based records started making money, record labels took artists to court. By the mid 1990s, they had built an unwieldy and expensive sample-clearance regime that effectively killed the kind of richly layered sample-based tracks that gave the practice its cultural currency, and economic value, in the first place.  One sterling example of what this restrictiveness costs everyone is “The Grey Album,” a circa 2004 mashup of Beatles and Jay-Z songs that launched the career of producer Danger Mouse. Though widely admired (and not THAT hard to find), it has never seen a commercial release, and probably never will. That doesn’t just make it harder for fans to listen – Danger Mouse, Jay-Z and the Beatles are all missing out on revenue, too.  There’s no moment where it becomes a generator of underlying ideas.  Now, Butterick says, many of the same kinds of large IP holders that fought for these restrictive controls want to have their cake and eat it too.  “Microsoft [is] one of the biggest owners of IP in America. And now they’re like, we want access to all the code, forever, for free. The irony: You could be digging for days.”  Artists in control  “I think we get to redo how IP works,” says music producer and cybertheorist Mat Dryhurst. “Some artists will be more permissive, some more protective, and that is fine. Ultimately it should be up to the artist.”  Dryhurst is part of the creative team behind producer, singer (and Stanford University PhD) Holly Herndon. While a generalized processing AI can rip off any artists’ style for free, Herndon and her team are trying to beat the deepfakers at their own game by creating their own AI copycat, Holly+. Holly+ is an AI filter trained on Herndon’s own voice. It can be used by other singers who want to sound uncannily like Herndon. It can also be used to create tracks in Herndon’s style from scratch, as with a recent cover of Dolly Parton’s classic “Jolene.”  Dryhurst and Herndon are also part of the team at Spawning.ai, an organization building “AI tools for artists, by artists.” Their first project, now in beta, is haveibeentrained.com, which aims to help artists control their work’s use by large AI models.  Read more: Caitlin Burns - AI and Crypto Are Combining to Create Web3's 'Multiplayer Era'  But the goal is definitely not to stop that use altogether. Instead, Dryhurst, in an email exchange, wrote that he wants every artist to create their own AI, rather than having everyone’s work dumped into a single uniform model.  “My ideal would be for the base substrate large models to be stripped of as much data as possible that may encroach on an artist’s ability to make their data economically productive,” he says, “And to move towards … a relatively clean base model that supports more specific models that are owned and controlled by artists themselves.”  If artists can build and control their own models, they can also both control collaboration via, and make money from, those models. By contrast, big AI organizations such as Microsoft and OpenAI are in essence pushing for the right to ingest all cultural output into large, centralized models that artists don’t have any control over at all.  The Herndon team has used Holly+ as a testing ground for that improved AI future. Herndon exerts creative and a degree of financial control over who can use the Holly+ models, including screening recordings made with Holly+ before they approve public releases (though Dryhurst says they approve almost anything that’s “kind of cool”).  They and others have also experimented with NFTs as a way to allow access or generate revenue for Holly+ productions. And while it would depend on changes to the broader IP legal regime, it’s not hard to imagine a future of decentralized IP management, including for AI training, that builds on blockchain tools.  With their particular balance of broad access and granular control, blockchains are if nothing else a better conceptual model of how artists would like to manage their rights than the big centralized models currently threatening to devour the world – and leave artists out in the cold.

The Hong Kong-based firm has taken a firm stance in support of digital creators via its NFT licenses, which Siu said were issued as a way for creators to have a “legal way of protecting their royalty rights.” Siu recently emphasized the company’s position during the annual NFT Paris conference, underscoring the importance of creator rights and royalties within Web3.  Despite a bear market sweeping much of 2022, the NFT industry amassed more than $24 billion worth of sales.  “That means that billions of dollars went to creators but, more importantly, an even larger number went to owners of the assets of these entities that fueled an industry that made it possible to create companies like Blur, OpenSea or Magic Eden,” he said.  Siu said that without royalties there wouldn't be enough money in the ecosystem to support project innovations.  “If you remove that, then you actually end up sending the industry, from our perspective, backwards,” he said.  Saudi Arabia deal  Now, the firm is looking to build the next OpenSea in the MENA (Middle East-North Africa) region.  The firm recently invested in Nuqtah, Saudi Arabia's first licensed non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, he said.  “We view it [the investment] a little bit like when we made our investment in OpenSea back in 2019,” Siu told CDTV. ”One of the reasons we made that investment was because we wanted to sort of help build the rails of that NFT economy, which back then was nonexistent, and today has become fairly meaningful.”  According to Siu, major market players such as Japan have regional NFT participants. The MENA region, however, has yet to establish one significant player, he said.  Animoca Brands wants to kick-start NFT infrastructure development in Saudi Arabia, which Siu said the firm is doing by backing Nuqtah.  Siu did not disclose the amount of the private investment but said that no government money was involved.

The move is a setback for Web3 creators who use social media to promote their art and interact with their community – and signals that Meta maybe hasn’t yet figured out how to dive into Web3.  Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) continues to make its way into Web3 and we dove into the rules around intellectual property (IP) rights of works created with the help of AI. We also spoke to NFT artists about their view on utilizing AI in their work.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Meta’s NFTease: Meta Platforms, the parent company behind Facebook and Instagram, announced it would be winding down its NFT program after testing it out for several months. The feature allows some NFT creators to mint and sell their creations on the platforms and collectors to display their NFTs. Stephane Kasriel, Meta’s head of commerce and financial services, said in a statement the company “learned a ton” and would continue to build products “to support creators, people and businesses on our apps, both today and in the metaverse.”  Time and place: The limited rollout of the feature began in May 2022 – months after the NFT boom but just before NFT trading really dropped off – and expanded in September as NFT sales were still slow. Also, while some NFT creators found success on Instagram, others were skeptical that a Web2 platform like Instagram would really be the platform of choice for supporting the creator economy.  Robo rights: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney are being used to build in Web3, with artists and developers finding creative ways to integrate machine learning into their workflow. Beyond the moral and ethical questions, AI also raises some legal questions, like is art created using AI protected under intellectual property laws?  Artists weigh in: Contributor Megan DeMatteo digs into the question of how AI Is changing artistic creation and challenging IP laws, talking with creators using the tech as well as looking at what the requirement of ""Human Authorship"" means in copyright law and how it might apply to AI.Legal gray areas: Since AI technology is still new and progressing quickly, the laws around copyrights have not yet caught up. “The question here is to try to figure out where the copyright ownership begins,” trademark and copyright lawyer Jessica Neer McDonald says.  Metaverse drip: Metaverse platform Decentraland will host its virtual fashion week later this month, with brands including Adidas, Coach and Dolce & Gabbana showcasing digital clothing for avatars. Brands and experts are excited by the potential utility of digital wearables and are hopeful that they can right many of the wrongs that currently plague the fashion industry. But it appears that people still aren’t hanging out in the metaverse as expected, leaving many to wonder: Who is actually buying digital clothing?  Style evolution: Many builders have suggested that in order for digital fashion to find its target market, creators of virtual goods must continue to evolve. “To expand customer bases and utilize these technologies to their full potential, interoperability between metaverses must be at the forefront of creators’ minds to help better onboard their audiences,” writes CoinDesk’s Cam Thompson.  Fashion feedback loop: Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer and founder of Web3 consultancy Journey, says brands are also trying to figure out if virtual fashion can influence physical fashion. “What culture is being created that impacts what you see on people wearing on the street?” she writes.

42412598,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5R56,1679079578,Former NY Regulator: Crypto Isn't the Reason Why Signature Bank Was Closed,"New York State regulators did not shut down Signature Bank (SBNY) because of the firm’s crypto clients, said Maria Vullo, a former superintendent at the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  The decision was “based upon whatever the data was with respect to the withdrawals by customers,” Vullo told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday.  On Sunday, New York-based Signature Bank closed its doors following action by state regulators in what appeared to be a preventive measure to reduce further contagion following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).  A joint statement by the Federal Reserve, Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the U.S. Treasury Department said depositors at Signature Bank would be made whole.  According to Vullo, echoing recent comments by current Superintendent Adrienne Harris, Signature Bank did not provide reliable and consistent data, creating a significant crisis of confidence in the bank’s leadership.  “I don't think you close down a bank because of a policy reason, you do because its risk management or its financial picture is unsafe and unsound,” said Vullo, who served as NYDFS superintendent from 2016 to February 2019.  She said Signature Bank “may have also suffered the consequences of contagion risks” that were ongoing following the closure of SVB just days earlier.  Nonetheless, the timing by regulators is significant, Vullo said. By quickly dealing with SVB and Signature, bank regulators were able to “send a very strong message to the public that the system is OK and that we're going to take care of depositors,” she said.  The latter was important, Vullo said, because it gave depositors a reason “to not pull out their money from other banks.”  Read more: Silicon Valley Bank's Former Parent Company Files for Bankruptcy",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/17/former-ny-regulator-crypto-isnt-the-reason-why-signature-bank-was-closed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66999dc0d27d0fb1ed3a1327c609605de845f279-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421314,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpZF,1679078227,Web3 Offers a Cure to Toxic Pop Culture,"From Mozart and Madonna to the Beatles and Harry Styles, for as long as culture has existed it has been built on the backs of fans and the creators they admire and obsess over. And while our access to culture has rapidly progressed and recycled over the decades (disco is in, disco is out, disco is back in, etc.) via seismic shifts in technology and media, let’s ask ourselves: Has being a culture junkie gotten any better? Or just more toxic and complicated?  Anne ""Well"" Ouellet is the chief marketing officer of Galxe. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Culture Week.""  As pop culture became “a thing,” fandom followed down a winding path towards the challenging and even dangerous. Beatlemania turned so manic that the Fab Four said “no more” to performing live in front of actual people. Later, the world lost John Lennon due to a fame-hungry fan. Swifties have waged swift war on Ticketmaster and the U.S government, Beyonce’s Beyhive fan base is ready to sting at a moment’s notice.  Over on TikTok, toxic fandom is nearly as powerful as its algorithm, where fandom has been deafening, destructive and downright confusing. Is it any wonder TikTok will now impose a 60-minute screen time limit for kids? And why stop there? Most would agree that we need fewer feeds in our lives.  In an industry that has the potential to disrupt everything we know about the meaning of being a fan (and its potential), what is it that we are really fighting to change in Web3?  Kill your idols  We don't need to spin a broken record and wax poetic on how Web3 technology will save music, sports, designer fashion and the film industry. In the spirit of Web3, DYOR – do it your own research.  Instead, to truly fix fandom we need to rethink what it means to be a fan – both in Web2 and Web3. What drives brands to pay celebrities seven figures to pose with skin care products or swan dive into a bag of potato chips in a tuxedo? For the most part, brands aren’t banking on an influencer’s ability to comment on the levels of high fructose corn syrup in a product, they’re banking on idol worship – and idol worship is dangerous.  From pop culture to politics, things eventually go downhill when people put all of their faith into an individual. Yes, Web3 has had its fair share of influential and well-intentioned leaders, but the power of Web3 is that influence does not (should not, even) need to lie in the hands of a centralized entity or deity but rather with a community that owns the tools to govern itself.  Let’s be real, though: There is a lot of idol worship in Web3, and fandom often revolves around it. Would you be so shocked to find a Bored Ape altar in some crypto bro’s living room? Or hear that someone is living their life due to the 10 Commandments of Logan Paul? Are we so surprised that Sam Bankman-Fried followed Do Kwon? Why put our blind fandom into people and platforms when we can fly the flag of what our industry promises to achieve?  The promise of fandom in Web3 is not to blindly follow and obsess over the words or actions of those we admire. The promise is to help push forward and benefit from the ideals we align with. When fandom has substance driven by ideals – not likes, follower counts and the loudest, most controversial voices in the room – people might start making important stuff again.  Make it feel good to be a fan in Web3  A meaningful future of fandom in Web3 can mean many things: a culture of loyalty, financial freedom, collective ideals and ownership, shared success and even challenges. While we've come a long way as an industry and community, we still have a long way to go to pave a new path for fandom, whether around technology, communities or creators. An innovative culture of fandom in Web3 has the potential to be about more than just your pfp [profile pic], favorite Discord, oversized hoodie or who's at your dinner table in that picture from NFT.NYC 2021.  Full disclosure: I write these words while proudly wearing my Forgotten Runes hat and PoolTogether T-shirt – communities I'm proud to fangirl over because they are about more than idolized leaders but the people who put in the work to create something bigger than themselves. We can be more than the symbols we display, which sometimes can feel like a recycled version of the herd-mentality fandom we critique in Web2. It's up to us to dig deeper.  As an industry, Web3 is at an inflection point where we need to “do” a lot more than we “show” and especially “tell.” Actions speak louder than words, so let’s actually build things we are proud to be fans of.

42421306,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpXB,1679076662,This Crisis Will Define the Future of Money,"Ten years ago, a strange new digital currency called bitcoin (BTC) caught my attention for the first time as its price surged during the Cyprus banking crisis. Local authorities had infuriated Cypriots by slapping a 10% tax on withdrawals, unwittingly encouraging some to warm to the idea of bankless digital money.  Per Omkar Godbole’s reporting, I’m not alone in seeing parallels between the past week’s events. Again, bitcoin’s price has rallied on speculation that stress among U.S. and European banks will open people’s eyes to the leading cryptocurrency’s censorship-resistant, intermediary-free qualities.  But if this is bitcoin’s “Cyprus moment,” the context is very different from 2013. With crypto now embedded in public consciousness – negatively, mostly – the industry faces its biggest ever test, one that involves an intensified struggle with the financial establishment.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  With thousands of people next month joining CoinDesk’s annual Consensus conference in Austin, Texas, to discuss crypto’s challenges and opportunities, the community now has a narrow opportunity to seize the day and define the future of money.  Echoes of 2008-2009  Recall that the Bitcoin blockchain was born out of the chaos of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, with Satoshi Nakamoto’s immortal timestamp on Jan. 3, 2009, inscribing a headline from that day’s London Times: “Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks” (chancellor being the U.K.’s finance minister).  That crisis highlighted how our dependence on banks to run the plumbing of our money and payments leaves the entire economy vulnerable to mismatches in banks’ investments and liabilities, which can undermine their ability to honor deposits. And it showed how the largest banks, whose interwoven credit exposures create “systemic risk,” exploited their “Too Big to Fail” status – the idea that governments would always bail them out to protect the economy – to place asymmetric, high-return risky bets. It showed how Wall Street (and other financial centers) in effect, hold our democracies hostage.  Now, with the collapse of three high-profile banks, hundreds of regional banks facing worrying outflows, the U.S. Federal Reserve creating a new backstop facility reportedly worth $2 trillion, and Switzerland’s central bank bailing out Credit Suisse to the tune of $54 billion, the echoes of that prior crisis are loud.  As the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission scrambled last weekend to put a funding plan in place so that thousands of startups with deposits at Silicon Valley Bank would meet payroll this week, we got a flashback to Sept. 17, 2008. On that day, two days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Reserve Primary Fund – used by companies to manage their cash reserves – “broke the buck.” We feared that failures at similar short-term money market funds would lead to widespread chaos in the economy-wide system for paying employees and commercial contractors.  It’s not only the familiarity that’s striking here. It’s also the cause and effect. A direct line can be drawn from SVB’s failure to the policies introduced in the wake of that prior crisis.  In 2009, with a divided U.S. government unable to agree on fiscal solutions to revive growth, the Fed launched what would become a multi-year “quantitative easing” program, delivering a surfeit of dollars that left Silicon Valley’s venture funds flush with money that they poured into startups.  Those companies deposited the funds at SVB, which in turn made what must have seemed a conservative investment choice at that time: It plowed the cash into long-term U.S. government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The problem was that in January 2022, once the Fed finally acknowledged that its easy-monetary policies had stoked sustained inflation, it started aggressively hiking rates. This tanked the bond market and lumped massive losses on SVB, which had made the fatal error of not hedging its interest rate risk.  Now, as fear spreads to smaller regional banks, depositors have fled en masse into Wall Street’s too-big-to-fail institutions, making them even bigger. To an unprecedented degree, that will position an elite group of bankers as gatekeepers of our economy – a centralizing power that’s already showing signs of overreach.  Crypto as the bad guy  Bitcoin’s raison d'être has always been that, in removing intermediaries from payments and hard-coding monetary policy into a predictable issuance schedule, it offers an alternative to the centralized model of fiat sovereign currency run by central banks in coordination with private banks, and so mitigates the entrenched vulnerabilities exposed by this past week’s events.  At first blush, however, the news hasn’t been good for Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto community.  Silvergate Bank, the first of a trio to collapse, was brought down in part by its heavy exposure to failing crypto firms. That encouraged anti-crypto politicians like U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to call for tough measures against the industry, helping feed a guilt-by-association impact on SVB, although that bank’s actual exposure to crypto was proportionally quite low.  With authorities last weekend also shuttering Signature Bank, another crypto favorite, the government is either intentionally or indirectly using its relationship with those gatekeeping financial institutions to squeeze the industry. Crypto companies that previously banked with one or more of three shuttered institutions have been rejected repeatedly by bank compliance officers as they desperately try to open alternative accounts.  Although the New York Department of Financial Services said Signature’s closure had nothing to do with crypto and was instead triggered by a “crisis of confidence” in its leadership, people are scratching their heads over why a supposedly solvent bank was shut down. Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, now a board member at Signature, speculated in a New York Magazine interview that the New York financial regulator had made the bank “a poster child to say 'stay away from crypto.’” Later, Reuters reported the FDIC is insisting that any prospective buyer will have to give up on Signature’s crypto business. (The regulator later denied that report.)  Blacklisting a legal industry in this way is an abuse of power. But if that is what the NYDFS was doing – presumably in coordination with federal agencies – for now there’s little crypto leaders can do about it.  Meanwhile, stablecoins, which are vital to fiat-to-crypto exchange operations, have been caught up in this. When Circle Financial announced that some of the reserves backing USDC were held at Silicon Valley Bank, the stablecoin briefly lost its one-to-one peg to the dollar. That situation has been resolved, but the closure of Signature Bank has meant Circle can no longer use its 24/7 Signet dollar-clearing system for redemptions, forcing it to rely solely on the time-bound services of Wall Street behemoth BNY Mellon.  Power struggle  Still, as angel investor and Myth of Money newsletter author Tatiana Koffman wrote in a CoinDesk OpEd, “Bitcoin is made for this moment.” If people continue to lose confidence in banks’ ability to keep their money safe, the narrative around Bitcoin’s self-custody model will only get stronger. Its appeal will be further enhanced if the Fed is forced to reverse course and cut interest rates, which could weaken the dollar. (That prospect grew stronger Thursday with news of an unexpected softening in U.S. inflation.)  I see this all playing out in a complicated, multifaceted clash of power, one that ultimately compels governments to accelerate the implementation of new regulatory framework for the coming era of digital money.  On one level, the bank failures underscore the need to divorce payments from crisis-prone fractional reserve banking – precisely the solution for which fully reserved stablecoins are designed.  Given the USDC stablecoin’s hiccups this past week, the argument will grow for requiring stablecoin issuers to hold banking licenses with access to the Fed’s discount window, rather than storing their reserves at third-party traditional banks. This is what Wyoming-based Custodia Bank applied to do, only to be rejected by the Fed last month, in what now seems an especially bone-headed response. Circle, too, has long expressed a goal to become a bank.  If this model is endorsed, how will the traditional banks respond? They’re not going to want these new crypto players poaching their depositors, a super-cheap source of financing whose departure could provoke an even bigger banking crisis.  Might governments revert to direct control via a central bank digital currency (CBDC)? With CBDCs it’s believed that central banks can apply targeted differentiated interest rates – including negative interest rates – to incentivize people to continue storing their savings with higher-paying traditional banks.  Complicating things for governments, those same people could just exit their national currency altogether and put their savings in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. As the struggle to control the digitization of fiat money progresses, the OG digital currency will stand as a hard-money alternative.  Does that mean bitcoin becomes a real competitor to sovereign currencies for payments? Not necessarily. While it’s possible that developing nations facing monetary outflows amid this uncertainty will follow El Salvador’s lead and declare bitcoin legal tender, the use of existing national currencies will likely remain entrenched in larger economies. (Technologically, Bitcoin still has to prove itself as a payment mechanism.)  Still, Bitcoin’s mere presence as a competitor could pressure governments to change things up, especially as different economies – such as China’s – seize a competitive advantage in monetary digitization.  The countervailing force in all this is the public perception of crypto technology, which right now is deep in negative territory following the blowups of last year. Those events left millions of retail investors with losses and stoked the impression of a community dominated by scammers and selfish “bros” obsessed with gaudy trappings of wealth.  At its core, money is a confidence game, a matter of faith and trust among the population that uses it. It’s likely confidence in governments and their banking partners will wane in the aftermath of this banking crisis. But crypto is, for now, dealing with an even bigger mistrust problem.  As this battle to redefine money unfolds, it’s incumbent on members of the crypto community to engage in behavior that breeds confidence.

42421315,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpeP,1679072450,How Effective Altruism Power Brokers Helped Make Sam Bankman-Fried,"The leading so-called philosophers of the Effective Altruism movement were warned as early as 2018 that Sam Bankman-Fried was a liar who slept with multiple subordinates, according to new reporting from Time. They reportedly responded in part by threatening those warning the golden boy wasn’t all he seemed.  Despite formal attempts by Alameda Research staff to push Bankman-Fried out at the time, figures including Oxford professor William MacAskill continued publicly burnishing the FTX founder’s image as he built one of the largest financial frauds of all time. MacAskill and others were ultimately rewarded for their defense of Bankman-Fried’s behavior in the form of funding and prestige as FTX appeared to succeed in later years.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     This was not a matter of dismissed rumors and personal grudges, but of well-documented corporate processes derailed, in part, by people whose entire careers are premised on cultivating moral action. In April 2018, four top Alameda managers called a meeting to offer Bankman-Fried a buyout to leave the hedge fund, based on already-extensive concerns about his disdain for basic corporate processes and accounting.  Documents for the meeting described Bankman-Fried as indulging in “gross negligence,” being “unethical” and “misreporting numbers.” Among other actions leading to the intervention, Time reports Bankman-Fried reneged on a deal to share ownership of Alameda, and illicitly registered himself as the sole owner.  According to Time, MacAskill was warned about Bankman-Fried’s behavior and the plan to oust him. So were Nick Beckstead, an EA-aligned moral philosopher, and Holden Karnofsky, co-CEO of EA-centric funding platform OpenPhilanthropy.  MacAskill didn’t just dismiss the allegations against Bankman-Fried but “basically threatened” those raising the concerns, according to Naia Bouscal, a former software engineer at Alameda.  Because MacAskill was so powerful within the Effective Altruism movement, and so many early Alameda staffers were also part of the movement, his opposition discouraged and blocked those at Alameda who tried to hold Bankman-Fried accountable early on. MacAskill, according to one involved person, had the power to influence employment options across the constellation of EA-linked nonprofits.  Bankman-Fried reportedly wielded his connection to MacAskill as a cudgel within Alameda. “[Bankman-Fried] was like, ‘I could destroy you,’” one person characterized the then-Alameda CEO’s behavior to Time. “’Will [MacAskill] and Holden [Karnofsy] would believe me over you. No one is going to believe you.’”  Seemingly, in part, thanks to MacAskill’s defense, Bankman-Fried was not forced to resign after the April 2018 meeting. Instead, the four executives who initially raised the concerns left, along with about half of Alameda’s employees at the time.  MacAskill, Karnofsky and Beckstead, then, seem to have played a direct and key role in enabling the FTX fraud – and they were richly rewarded by their pet con man. After FTX’s explosive growth starting in 2020, MacAskill enjoyed a wave of interest generated by the supposed Effective Altruist billionaire he had spent years cultivating. Beckstead would be named head of the FTX Future Fund, a Potemkin nonprofit that helped build Bankman-Fried’s fluffy image – and attract more victims.  The revelations are damning for the individuals involved, and the Effective Altruism movement as a whole. While they may not have been aware of the details of Bankman-Fried’s misdeeds, they seem to have been well aware that his supposed moral stance was a fraud. Their alleged refusal to reckon with allegations of what amounts to workplace sexual abuse is particularly vile.  See also: FTX Paid Around $2.2B to Sam Bankman-Fried  The ideas advanced by MacAskill and his cohort have long been lambasted as a convenient fig leaf helping rapacious capitalists distract others, and themselves, from their exploitative greed. FTX became the literal instantiation of that theoretical critique, demonstrating a profound rot at the heart of the Effective Altruism movement – or perhaps more accurately, a palsy-inducing tumor in its head.  Like all tumors, this one should be excised: MacAskill’s continued presence at Oxford, in particular, is a nasty, dripping blemish on the face of the entire field of academic philosophy. Unfortunately, the FTX story has become an object lesson in how rarely such ailments are actually addressed at the very top of our society – how freely the cancer of greed and self-dealing has been allowed to spread its tendrils from Oxford to Stanford to MIT to the U.S. Congress, destroying the lives of normal people at every step of the way.

42421321,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpkb,1679066781,Bitcoin Is a Clear Winner of the U.S. Banking Crisis,"Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed on March 10, and since then the price of bitcoin (BTC) has been on a tear.  In the early hours of March 10, bitcoin was trading around $19,600. It whipsawed just above and below $20,000 until around 12 p.m. ET when it was announced that SVB was going into FDIC receivership. At that point, bitcoin shed $200 to dip below $20,000, jumped around a bit and spent most of the weekend trading above $20,000.  By Monday, March 13 at 9:30 a.m. ET it was trading at $22,386. And then the fun began. Just 24 hours later, bitcoin was trading at $26,175, at one point even touching up against $26,500. As of publication, it is currently sitting around $26,700.  I’ve maintained (here and here and probably elsewhere) that narrative matters a lot when it comes to the price of assets. If you don’t believe me, you could ask Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said that “people’s expectations of inflation have a real effect on inflation.”  So what happened to the narrative to lead to this type of aggressive 35% trough-to-peak change? It’s simple, really: A lot happened.  On one hand, the bank failures  Given Bitcoin’s history, the bank failure adjacency is obvious here: At least three banks have failed, others – both American and non-American – are failing. Because it’s not because of Bitcoin, that’s good for bitcoin’s price.  Actually, it isn’t clear who is at fault for the three bank failures, because who even knows if these banks are failing due to insolvency?  Sure, SVB failed due to an old-fashioned bank run that was spurred on due to apparent weaknesses on its balance sheet because of poor duration risk management. And, yes, Silvergate was running into some issues and had to take an FHLB Loan, but its eventual winding down was reportedly voluntary. And then we have Signature Bank, where even the regulators can’t figure out if the bank was shut down because of crypto or because of a “crisis of confidence” in leadership.  Let’s add on the fact that there are wider risks to the broader banking system. Credit Suisse (CS) just received a 50 billion Swiss franc loan from the Swiss central bank, and 11 banks just injected $30 billion into California-based regional bank First Republic Bank (FRC) in order to save it.  On the former, it is telling that the central bank wants to save Credit Suisse. On the latter, it is even more telling that banks want to save a competitor for fear of contagion. (Otherwise, why wouldn’t they just let a competitor fail?)  That all said, we know one thing that isn’t causing these banks to fail. These banks aren’t in trouble because of bets on bitcoin, crypto or the companies in those industries. What appears to be happening is the fractional reserve banking system is under stress due to rising interest rates, and it’s showing cracks.  And so the narrative goes: As the banks fail, opt out and buy bitcoin. That narrative is strong enough to propel the price.  On the other hand, stablecoins were unstable  With the failure of Signature Bank, we saw U.S. dollar stablecoin USD coin (USDC) lose its dollar peg last weekend. USDC regained its peg during the week, but the loss of the peg rightly spooked a lot of people. To USDC’s credit, it is worth considering how rapid its recovery back to $1 was. That said, its depeg did highlight that USDC is not immune from counterparty risk, as some may have erroneously thought.  So if we establish that both USDC and the dollars in a bank account have counterparty risk, you might ask yourself: “Is there anything without counterparty risk?”  Well, yes, there is with bitcoin.  A related stablecoin story also came into play with the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, converting $1 billion of U.S. dollar stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD) to bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies in the early hours of March 13. The conversion came as a result of Binance-rival crypto exchange Coinbase officially shuttering BUSD trading on its platform due to “liquidity concerns.”  Binance’s sale not only added to the buying pressure, but also could have potentially led to a “follow the leader” effect in which people also exchanged their BUSD for bitcoin.  And if I had another hand, the US Federal Reserve  It looks like we might have a suspension of interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which would give the entire market a well-needed breather, especially as some (myself included) view the failure of these banks as being closely tied to the raising of rates by a multiple of almost 20 over the last year.  From CoinDesk’s Jocelyn Yang:  On Wednesday, the CME FedWatch Tool, a predictor of interest rate decisions, forecast a 45% chance of a zero basis point rate hike. It’s now predicting an 80.5% chance of a 25 basis point (bps) increase. Both numbers contrast sharply from last week when the CME showed a 68% chance of a 50 bps rate boost.  Of course, that’s just the market hopping on the narrative that the rate hike might not be as high as previously expected. There has been no indication from the Fed that this will be the case. There goes that “narrative and expectation” again.  Lastly: I keep saying bitcoin, but don’t I mean crypto?  No, I don’t mean crypto. I mean bitcoin.  Amid all the market turbulence, bitcoin’s price is going up faster than even the much smaller and often more volatile altcoins. We see that with bitcoin dominance, a measure that looks at bitcoin’s market capitalization compared to the rest of the cryptocurrency market, which reached a nine-month high at 45.5% on Wednesday.  So in all: There’s systemic global bank risk, stablecoins in crypto proved they need those banks to be stable, and amid all the general angst the Federal Reserve may be pulling back on rate hikes. All that has added up to bitcoin swinging up massively over the last week.  That continues is anybody’s guess. To be sure, uncertainty is never cause for celebration because of its potential negative consequences on people’s lives. But for the time being, bitcoin, with its fixed issuance at a time of monetary expansion, looks like a way to opt out of this most recent crisis.  Maybe it is.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/17/bitcoin-banking-crisis-silicon-valley-bank-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a088b051f460a22d6dcc4461d0d6b8d7ab6a0b36-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421313,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpdN,1679066145,SVB Collapse Shows the Rot in U.S. Banking and Dollars,"It’s common knowledge that banks are the safest place to store your money, but the run on Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the collapses of Silvergate and Signature shook that assumption – and rightly so. Initially, many were quick to point fingers at crypto as the culprit for Silvergate and Signature’s failures, but SVB is less tied to digital assets. Instead, something else is to blame entirely: the Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates.  Nevin Freeman is the co-founder of Reserve.  What could have prevented this modern-day bank run? Perhaps different decision-making by the Fed or more conservative investments by the bank. More importantly, these events serve as reminders of the ever-present risks behind fractional-reserve banking and the confusing nature of the dollar itself.  What if money were real?  The U.S. dollar, as it exists today in the digital world, is no longer a store of value. The problem isn’t just the dollar’s loss of purchasing power to inflation; it goes much deeper. The dollar has become a sort of weird accounting trick.  When you give a dollar to a bank, you see the dollar in your account. It feels like it’s there, like it’s yours and like you have full control over whether and when to spend it. You can go to sleep knowing that you have the power to pay for what you need in business or in life.  Or can you?  When banks like Silvergate, Signature and SVB fail (there were 562 U.S. bank failures from 2001 through 2023, about 25 per year) we’re reminded that “dollar” balances in bank accounts are not actually “dollars” in the way we think of them.  If banks kept all of their deposits on hand and backed their customer balances 1:1 with real dollars, this would be fine. Bank customers could all decide to transfer all of their balances, and the bank would have no trouble doing that because it had 100% of the actual dollars.  However, they don’t. Banks often only keep about one real dollar with the Fed for every $10 of deposits they show to their customers. So if you have a balance of $1,000, the bank might only have $100 in real dollars in the background. There used to be minimums, but in 2020 the Fed removed these minimums and left it up to banks to decide how much to hold in reserves.  Think of it this way: Imagine you are the customer and I’m the bank. You deposit $1,000 in physical cash with me. I keep $100, and lend out $900. If you come back and ask for your $1,000 and I can’t get the borrowers to pay back the $900, I can sell that loan to another bank for 900 real dollars so that I can repay your $1,000 in full.  The problem with this is that sometimes those other assets can lose value in dollar terms. Suppose the loans I made are starting to look like they weren’t a good idea, and other banks are only willing to pay $600 for them. Now if you ask for your $1,000 I can only offer you $100 that I had kept in real dollars plus $600 that I can raise from selling the loan to another bank for 700 real dollars.  See also: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite Too Big to Fail Debate  That’s essentially what happened with Silicon Valley Bank – it held securities that ended up losing value and reached a point where people started to worry it wouldn’t be able to sell those assets for enough real dollars to cover all of its customers’ deposits. Once people realized this, everyone wanted to pull their money out first, causing a bank run.  How FDIC (sort of) fixes this  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) maintains a fund in order to insure customer deposits of banks that fail, so that if banks lose money on their loans and investments the account holders can be made whole anyway. They insure up to $250,000 per person or company that has an account with the failing bank, so as long as your balance is less than $250,000 with an FDIC-insured bank, you have less to worry about.  But our economy is powered by businesses, not just people. As businesses grow, they often have more than $250,000 in capital to manage. What do they do? The answer might surprise you.  They lend their money directly to the U.S. government instead of putting it in a bank.  It turns out the safest way for a business to guarantee that it’ll have dollars in the future is to lend those dollars to the U.S. Treasury Department in exchange for special receipts that prove they are owed the money on some particular date. Depending on the duration of the loan, the receipts have different names: Treasury bills (“T-bills”) are four weeks to one year, notes (“T-notes”) are two to10 years and bonds (“T-bonds”) are 20 to 30 years. Since they are all receipts to be paid back by the Treasury, all are often called “Treasurys.”  By holding Treasurys, businesses have no bank between them and the government, they are only depending on the Treasury to make good on its promise to deliver real dollars to the business’s bank account at some future date. If a bunch of banks fail in the meantime, that has no impact on the Treasury or the business, so the promise stands.  Since this is safer than a bank account with more than $250,000 in it, larger businesses pretty much all end up going this route.  Isn’t that strange?  There’s no way for businesses to just hold real dollars. It would be impractical and dangerous to keep piles of physical cash, and nonbank businesses aren’t allowed to have an account with the Fed, which keeps track of all digital dollars, so they play a game of continual lending and re-lending to the government because the receipts for those loans are the closest thing to real digital dollars they are allowed to touch. Loaning money to the government earns you interest as well, but it’s often done just for safety, not for profit.  This adds a lot of complexity and confusion to a system that could be simple and elegant, and it certainly seems to give the government a lot of borrowed money to play with.  (It’s also noteworthy that the FDIC’s resources aren’t unlimited. Its insurance fund was only about $128 billion as of December 2022, but it's on the hook to cover about $10 trillion to cover all accounts with a max of $250,000. While it’s hard to think about how all $10 trillion in deposits would need to be covered at the same time, to put things in perspective Bank of America has $1.9 trillion in FDIC-insured deposits across all accounts as of last December.)  What a real dollar could look like  If we wanted to, there’s no reason in principle we couldn’t open the database of real dollars to the public. You and I, along with Apple, your local ice cream shop and the government of Argentina could all have accounts with the Fed, which would have no risk of vaporizing, no matter how many dollars we had there.  See also: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite ‘Moral Hazard’ Dilemma Bitcoin Was Designed to End | Opinion  There’d be no need for FDIC insurance (where does that insurance fund money come from anyway?), and we could decide whether to lend our money out for interest instead of being forced to lend it to a bank any time we wanted it in digital form.  And yes, if we wanted, we could do it on a blockchain. If a real dollar were issued on a real, public blockchain like Ethereum (not a “permissioned chain” that only a few parties can access or administer), the financial infrastructure we could build and automate on top of that would be incredibly efficient and effective. If you don’t know what a smart contract is and have not yet played around with decentralized finance (DeFi), this will sound crazy to you. If you have, you’ll be nodding along. Before too long the majority of the population will start to see these implications.  USDC, the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, is the closest to a real dollar on a blockchain we have today – it’s mostly backed by Treasurys and bank balances. Users wanting to exchange one USDC for a dollar can essentially be sure the money is there.  This past weekend, however, it looked for a moment that USDC might implode. Some of its backing reserves were sitting in SVB bank accounts, so the market priced in the risk the money would be irretrievable or wrapped up in a lengthy bankruptcy process. That is until it became clear all SVB balances would be covered by the FDIC on Monday.  Image courtesy of CoinMarketCap.  USDC’s blip wasn’t a problem with crypto, it was a problem with how bank balances work. Likewise, if the Fed issued a dollar directly to public blockchains – it could issue on many chains, just like USDC – there would be no such risk.  But why stop there?  Asset-backed currency  In a world where we have the technology to create unforgeable digital tokens to represent anything and send them to anyone with very little cost or friction (we are in that world! it’s so cool!), there’s so much more we can do than just a real digital dollar.  Earlier, I waved inflation and purchasing power to the side so we could focus on this more obscure problem, but inflation is still a thing. Fiat currency supplies pretty much all end up being expanded faster than their economies grow, and this leads them to be diluted and lose purchasing power. Sometimes, extreme things happen and they’re devalued really quickly.  Wealthy people and businesses already have a solution for this: Don’t store too much wealth in fiat currencies.  When you have any real wealth, you keep a little in your bank account, a chunk in Treasurys and the rest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, real estate and perhaps some gold or bitcoin.  If we wanted to, we could issue tokens for each and every one of these assets on public blockchains, and we’d get the same incredible transaction properties, programmability and global accessibility we have with USDC today.  Once we had enough tokenized assets we’d get something that’s, in my opinion, more than the sum of its parts: an asset-backed currency. We could take all of those assets and aggregate them together, just like wealthy people and businesses already do, into a single portfolio to create an index of the entire global economy. And that index could then be represented with a single token.  Imagine buying a bag of groceries and paying with a token that represents a tiny slice of the entire world economy. It’s a wild idea, but do we really need it? What does it solve? This kind of money – an asset-backed currency – could be designed not to dilute.  Central banks have an impossible challenge on their hands. They are charged with keeping the economy stimulated and at the same time not inflating the currency. But adding units of currency is the easiest way to stimulate an economy, so they succumb to the pressure. I truly believe it’s a systemic thing, not incompetence or malice – if you or I were in their place, we’d end up making pretty much the same moves they do.  But an asset-backed currency could be independent of governments, with no mandate other than maintaining value.

It's costing us 25 banks a year, plus all the collateral economic dislocation, when we have 2023 technology that would make the leap to a point where it's like we were all banking directly with the Fed. Cutting out the bank layer would cut out the insane leverage that is an accident waiting to happen.  It’s confusing and counterintuitive, but cryptocurrency done right is actually less risky than a Main Street bank. Don’t let the myriad of scams and fraud in the industry get in the way of the good we can do with it.  Exactly how asset-backed currencies on public blockchains will work is yet undetermined. Global crypto penetration is about 5%, which is 1998 in internet penetration – the same year Google launched to compete against 20 established search engines.  The Google of stablecoins likely has not been invented yet and the 2020-2030s look like they’ll be the great unraveling and reorganization of the financial system.

AFM Chair Laura van Geest said cryptocurrency wasn’t good news, linking it to fraud, manipulation and speculation, and said the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) will only partly address its risks.  “Given the previous history, we see no reason to be lenient in enforcement” when it comes to applying the MiCA rules, which will require wallet providers and exchanges to seek licenses which will let them operate across the EU bloc in around 18 months’ time.  MiCA offers a single set of rules that will be put into practice by national authorities such as the AFM, potentially meaning some crypto firms will simply look for the regulator that offers the easiest regime. Van Geest said she’d have preferred to have more consistent supervision by EU-level agencies, but won’t be undercutting standards to attract business.  “It is not for nothing that a MiCA 2 is already being presaged,” she said, noting that the regulation doesn’t apply to problematic areas like crypto lending.

42421316,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpgT,1679064855,NBA vs NFL: What Dapper Labs’ Big-League Collectibles Say About Launching NFTs for Sports,"The early days of the COVID-19 pandemic showed us human nature in a largely new context. People around the world were locked down and separated, but at the same time newly connected via the internet and social media.  For too many, it turns out that was a formula for serious mental health challenges. But others channeled their twitchy cabin fever into a milder form of madness: financial speculation. From WallStreetBets to Davey Day Trader, 2020 and 2021 saw a manic rush of participants into speculative markets, fueling a huge price runup in Peloton stock and bitcoin – but also Cabbage Patch Kids, action figures and sports cards.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week 2023.  Some of that collectible interest infamously spilled over into an entirely new category: non-fungible tokens (NFT). Bored Apes and similar collections garnered the bulk of both fascination (and outrage) from mainstream onlookers. NBA Top Shot, Dapper Labs’ series of officially licensed digital collectibles featuring great moments in hooping, also saw a rush of interest, with sales volumes skyrocketing in early 2021.  Then, as in other pandemic bubbles, came the crash. Top Shot volumes and prices declined dramatically starting in April 2021, leaving many collectors disgruntled. A followup collection from Dapper Labs called NFL [National Football League] All Day launched in August 2022, but didn’t generate the same hype that Top Shot had. It’s a dynamic that has replayed across asset classes as a two-year pandemic party turned into a vicious hangover of systemic collapses and stalled growth.  Read more: Paul Paray - Dapper Labs Ruling Dunks on Private Networks  But NFTs, and sports collectibles more generally, aren’t going anywhere. Even today, Top Shot volumes are roughly 10 times higher than when the series launched. If it’s not time to pack it in and go home, what can we learn from the sparkling rise and sputtering descent of Dapper’s digital collectibles?  What made the difference between Top Shot’s spectacular success and All Day’s more muted reception? And is a Top Shot-style runup something the creators of digital collectibles should even want to emulate?  In search of insight, we went to the people who really know: the collectors themselves.  The gamer  Ahmad Ghahary was never much of a sports memorabilia collector, but he's been a huge sports fan and a die-hard fantasy sports player since the 1990s. “I like the season-long [fantasy leagues],” he says, “[And] I started playing more keeper leagues, multi-year legacy teams. So I got into figuring out what prospects will be good for hockey.” Ahmad is Canadian, so hockey came naturally enough.  He was also becoming a bigger fan of the National Basketball Association by December of 2020, when he says he finally learned about the boom in sports collecting thanks to a CNBC report. Ghahary thought he could use his sports insights to capitalize on the trend.  But a funny thing happened on the way to the wax pack.  “When I googled ‘sports card collecting,’ [NBA] Top Shot was the first thing at the top. I started googling NFTs, but there was almost nothing on YouTube. I thought, maybe there’s an opportunity here to get in early.” TopShot sales had opened in public beta in early October 2020.  Ghahary, a pharmacist by day, is a self-professed tech novice. But it didn’t take him long to become convinced that this newfangled NFT thing could work out.  “With sports cards, if you boil it down to what it is, it kind of sounds idiotic anyway, right? Someone printed something on a piece of cardboard and now it’s valuable?” he asks incredulously.  By comparison, Top Shot had a lot going for it. “[A card] is a static image from God knows when. But when you leave an NBA game, what you remember are these moments. And the NBA bottled those up with Top Shot. They’re keepsakes of that exact moment.”  Ghahary was, at least for a time, more right than he could have possibly predicted. He started picking up Top Shot pieces in December 2020, and within a month pandemic pandemonium had followed in his footsteps. Top Shot secondary-market sales exploded from under $10,000 per day in November to nearly $7 million per day by early January, according to data from CryptoSlam.  Sales kept going up. Top Shot frenzy reached a sharp peak on Feb. 22, 2021, when a staggering $45.8 million worth of the collectibles were traded in just 24 hours.  Then the Everything Bubble began to deflate.  The wind-down  Top Shot interest peaked just after the Dow Jones Industrial Average itself, and cooled along with the prices of bitcoin and stay-home stocks. Daily volumes tapered to around $2 million per day by May 2021 and continued declining – though even today, they’re roughly 10 times what they were when Top Shot launched.  Then came the NFL All Day launch in August 2022. While daily secondary market volumes spiked as high as $1.1 million that September, they never got anywhere close to Top Shot’s highs. Trading of the All Day collection has settled down to around $60,000 a day, a bit below Top Shot’s current levels.  Ghahary says he wasn’t primarily motivated by financial speculation, so he stayed in the market as things cooled off. Today, he says he has around 4,500 Top Shot items and close to 1,000 pieces in the NFL All Day series.  From where he’s sitting as a sports fan and collector, Ghahary identifies a few factors that made the difference between Top Shot’s rocket to the moon and All Day’s more modest reception.  Some of that came down to differences between the features of the two collections. “The [All Day] web site itself is not as good as Top Shot,” Ghahary says. “It doesn’t have all the same features, which is a bit confusing. Because it’s both Dapper Labs, so you would think they would use the same technology, but it is very much a separate project.”  Ghahary thinks an even bigger factor was supply. In January and February 2021, as Top Shot interest exploded, Ghahary says the supply of Top Shot’s early “Moments” was out of sync. Most highlights in the collection’s first series were released in editions of about 4,000. This scarcity, along with limitations on withdrawing funds from the platform, helped drive prices up sharply in early 2021.  Then in March 2021, Dapper Labs adjusted to Top Shot’s new popularity by increasing edition sizes and rarity tiers. According to a Dapper spokesperson, the largest editions went up to 60,000, and some players even had two Moments created in that quantity.  “I guess there was demand,”Ghahary says, “because when they sold packs [at that time], it would sell out. And you could flip it and make money. But as they pumped out more supply, values started dropping, and people started leaving. Even if you’re a huge sports fan, if you buy something for $2,000 and it’s worth $20 two weeks later, that’s not great. And that mindset can sort of set in.”  Ghahary thinks that applied even more to the most desirable items in the NFL All Day collection. Dapper Labs “didn’t really protect the scarcity of these moments that should be their most valuable. Tom Brady’s debut moment should be the most valuable one, but if you make 10,000 of them … people won’t value it as highly.”  The danger of speculators  Another Top Shot and All Day collector who came to the NFT world through a passion for sports goes by the username Eddiedunks. In the early days of Top Shot, they say a lot of buyers weren’t that much into sports at all.  “There were different types of collectors, who came from maybe the crypto space.” Many, Eddiedunks says, saw Top Shot as a way to diversify crypto investments, summarizing their motives as “‘[ether]jumped and I put it into Top Shot. I have no idea who these players are, I can just watch the charts.’” Those participants may have made the early 2021 price bubble both bigger, and more fragile. “They were more in-and-out.”  Read more: NBA-Branded 'Top Shot Moments' NFTs May Be Securities, Judge Rules in Dapper Labs Case  Ghahary admits he wished he had timed the market better, but he doesn’t seem too upset. As a collector rather than a speculator, the monetary value of his NFTs takes a bit of a back seat. “I’ve been buying all along. FOMO was setting in – [it felt like] if I don’t get the Run It Back set now, it might be out of reach for me later. It turns out I could have gotten it later for much less money but I’m happy that I have those.”  Ghahary also isn’t shedding any tears for the mood of early-pandemic Top Shot mania. “I didn’t quite realize when I got in that a lot of other people didn’t care about the actual highlight, they just thought of it as a way to make money. It’s stressful being part of the community when people are freaking out about [price] and complaining. The entitlement that’s in the space doesn’t really jibe with me.”  In response to the supply misalignments caused by Top Shot’s brief price spike, Dapper Labs says it has limited the maximum number of a single Moment created to 10,000. It has also lowered the number of Moments in the current fourth edition of Top Shot down to 16,000, which it says cuts the supply of some players’ Moments by as much as 85% compared to prior editions.  At the same time, Dapper says the overall supply of NFL All Day mints is larger than Top Shot’s, “with the intention of ensuring our Common tier wasn’t too constrained by supply.”  Eddiedunks speculates that Dapper made All Day bigger specifically because it didn’t want a huge initial price runup, or the fleeting speculator attention it attracted.  “My thought was that Dapper was careful to not replicate [with All Day] what happened with Top Shot, when it really spiked up, probably for a good reason … All Day has probably benefited from not having that spike like Top Shot.”  There are a lot of good reasons to avoid a short-term demand spike for a collectible, not least because it sets unrealistic expectations. NFL All Day’s rollout “seems like a more organic type of growth,” Eddiedunks says. “Top Shot is still having to adjust from the February 2021 highs.”  So while All Day might look underwhelming by financial metrics, it seems to be building a better foundation for long-term success. “It seems like a lot of people who are sticking around are really focused on the product itself,” says Eddiedunks. “The people with bigger net spend in All Day tend to be real fans.”  It’s worth remembering that sports trading cards, the inspiration for Top Shot and All Day, were barely better than trash for decades after they first appeared. Probably the most sought-after baseball card in existence, the T-206 Honus Wagner, was a free prize included in pouches of tobacco between 1909 and 1911. Nobody back then was talking about its value as a collectible – but one recently sold for $7.25 million. Prices like that are built on more than simply rarity – they rely on mythology, narrative, and other intangibles (which the Wagner card has in spades).  While NFTs may never have quite the poetry of a cardboard giveaway, they have one clear advantage over their analog forebears: community. While Ahmad Ghahary estimates he is slightly underwater on the market value of his huge collection, the shared passion of Top Shot and All Day collectors has been far more significant than any financial impact.  “I really forged some new friendships,” he says, through both online social circles and special events Dapper Labs has invited him to as a top-end collector. As a busy professional, he says, “it’s hard to do that sometimes.”  Community is often thrown around as a buzzword by NFT collections, but it’s hard to parse exactly how pictures of cartoon penguins are supposed to bring together a real community based on common interests. With its sports franchises, Dapper Labs has a much clearer path to something sustainable – even if it takes a while to get back to the market prices it saw in its passionate, tumultuous early days.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Z.

Despite a risk-off day in the broader stock market, the token jumped 7.5% to $26.76K as of shortly before 9:30 a.m. ET, extending its gains for the second straight session. That coincided with ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) 5% gain to $1.74K. Overall, a slew of major cryptos caught a bid with the global crypto market cap rising 5.9% to $1.14T, according to CoinMarketCap data . Call it a comeback? Some may suggest bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) ongoing rally is the start of a new bull run, while others reckon it's nothing more than a bull trap whereby traders buy the token believing its price will keep rising, when in fact, it will continue to slump. Only time will tell. Nonetheless, with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in risk-on mode, a barrage of crypto-related stocks, including Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), +7.9% , Marathon Digital ( MARA ), +8.8% , and MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), +5.5% , dominated premarket; here's a full list .

42412595,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5R62,1679058000,Crypto Derivatives Protocol Volmex Finance's Bitcoin and Ether Volatility Charts Now Live on TradingView,"Charts of Ethereum-based volatility and derivatives protocol Volmex Finance's implied volatility indexes for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are now available on technical analysis platform TradingView.  The charts went live on Friday, Cole Kennelly, founder and CEO of Volmex Labs, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk, calling the TradingView integration a ""massive milestone.""  ""This partnership between TradingView and Volmex is a massive milestone, as 50 million traders and investors using TradingView monthly can now access the Volmex Implied Volatility Indices, the BVIV Index and EVIV Index,"" Kennelly said.  Volmex's bitcoin implied volatility index (BVIV) and ether implied volatility index (EVIV) measure the expected price turbulence over 30 days, derived from real-time crypto call and put options. The indexes can be considered analogous to Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX index, which is derived from the options market tied to the S&P 500.  Traders use TradingView to confirm market trends and visualize key entry and exit points for buy and sell trades. The traders can now study Volmex's volatility charts to predict and bet on price turbulence in top cryptocurrencies.  ""Volmex also builds a suite of products around the Volmex implied volatility Indices, which make the indices tradable and investable for hedging, speculating and diversification,"" Kennelly told CoinDesk.  Volatility trading involves betting on the future stability of an asset instead of betting on the direction of future price moves. Going long or buying volatility means betting the asset's price might move violently in either direction.  Traders typically go long on volatility through complex options strategies or volatility futures contracts when the implied volatility appears to be cheap relative to its lifetime average or historical volatility, or both. Conversely, volatility is sold when the implied volatility appears to be too high relative to historical volatility.  Volatility trading is becoming increasingly popular in the crypto market, thanks to bitcoin's evolution as a macro asset since the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/17/derivatives-protocol-volmex-finances-bitcoin-and-ether-volatility-charts-are-live-on-tradingview,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5bb3a3e53e8863f46604bb12ea614efff32d63e-2970x1398.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is back trading above $26,000 for the second time this week, up 7.5% in the last 24 hours. The coin has been trading between $24,000 and $26,700 over the past week. Investors who went away for a while are back and adding bitcoin, according to Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. “We expect to see significant demand as bitcoin moves further past $25,000,” Thorn wrote in a note. Ether is up 5.1% in the past 24 hours and up 20% over the last seven days.  Bankrupt lender Genesis has requested a May 22 deadline for creditors to say how much they are owed by the company and June 27 for an auction, according to bankruptcy court filings dated Thursday. Bidders considering buying Genesis would have to show interest by May 5. The sale would comprise lenders Genesis Global Capital and Genesis Asia Pacific, as well as Genesis Global Trading, the last of which hasn't filed for bankruptcy. All three fall under the umbrella of Digital Currency Group, a crypto conglomerate that also owns CoinDesk.  Tokens related to artificial intelligence have had a strong week with the Graph’s GRT up 30% and SingularityNET (AGIX) up 45%. AI-related tokens have rallied following ChatGPT’s release of its latest version of the technology that powers the popular chatbot tool. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced the release in a blog post on Tuesday, stating the latest version can pass a simulated bar exam with a score at around the top 10% of test takers. SingularityNET is a decentralized AI marketplace running on blockchain, and The Graph is an open-sourced indexing platform used to collect, process and store data from various blockchain applications.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows ether's bitcoin denominated price (ETH/BTC) has declined to its lowest level since last July.  Traders seem to be worried that Ethereum's impending Shanghai upgrade, which is set to open withdrawals of staked ether, could potentially create a significant supply overhang.  These fears are likely to keep sentiment in the ether market weak ahead of the upgrade, Bernstein said early this month, adding that the actual increase in supply after the upgrade is likely to be negligible on a daily basis.

42412603,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5R9m,1679055003,On-Chain Data Reveals How Trading Firms Worked the USDC Stablecoin Repeg,"Trading firms were quick to jump on the USD coin (USDC) long trade last weekend as the stablecoin, which was meant to be pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, fell to as low as 87 cents on news that Circle Internet Financial, the token's issuer, had exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, the bank that collapsed last Friday.  The concerns prompted a wave of USDC sales across decentralized-finance platforms, with a pool on decentralized exchange Curve comprising three equally weighted stablecoins becoming unbalanced as the supply of USDC skewed.  Traders began to withdraw stablecoins from centralized exchanges and swap tether (USDT) for USDC on decentralized exchanges, causing the highest volume of stablecoin outflows from crypto exchange Binance since the implosion of FTX, another crypto exchange, in November. A total of $2.8 billion worth of USDT was withdrawn from Binance in a 24-hour period, according to CryptoQuant.  A couple of high-frequency trading firms, in particular, capitalized on USDC's plight, with one wallet receiving $215 million of tether from Binance before executing 59 transactions that involved swapping USDT for USDC and the DAI stablecoin. The wallet made a profit of around $16.5 million, according to CryptoQuant research.  The arbitrage opportunity of trading tether, which retained its dollar peg, with USDC when it traded below 90 cents was huge, but not without risk.  ""It was an evolving situation, and information was scarce,"" Mike van Rossum, founder of trading firm Folkvang, said. ""Given what recently happened to FTX and other big crypto players, you can see why many wanted to derisk quickly.  ""Nothing is safe, and trading is always about exposing yourself to some risk,"" he said. ""But at some point, we thought the market was pricing in more risk than we thought was reasonable. Especially after the U.S. government came in to save Silicon Valley Bank.""  Van Rossum confirmed that Folkvang bought the dip.

A block-producing node is responsible for producing blocks on the blockchain, while a relay node communicates with other relays and broadcasts blocks from block-producing nodes.  Dynamic P2P enables bidirectional usage of each connection, simplifying communication and increasing network resilience against failures or malicious behavior.

The sale would comprise lenders Genesis Global Capital and Genesis Asia Pacific, as well as Genesis Global Trading, the last of which has not filed for bankruptcy. All three fall under the umbrella of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.  “The bidding procedures are designed to encourage competitive bidding and thereby maximize the value of the Sale and potential recoveries” for the estate, one filing reads, adding that it constitutes an “orderly, uniform and competitive process.”  The plan was submitted by the company for approval in a bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York.

42412613,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5SV2,1679047348,Bitcoin Is Benefiting From Crypto’s Flight to Quality: Matrixport,"Bitcoin (BTC) is benefiting from instability in the financial system, falling inflation that allows the Federal Reserve to become less hawkish and a regulatory overhang that has hit stablecoins, crypto-services provider Matrixport said in a report Thursday.  “As those three trends persist, bitcoin prices can stay high and continue to rally,"" Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, wrote in the note.  “Investors have now woken up,” Thielen said, noting that the Fed’s interest-rate policy has severely damaged some investment portfolios and threatened the financial stability of the economy.  Several flights to quality are happening at the same time, Thielen's note said.  Traders and investors have shifted from higher beta – or more volatile – cryptocurrencies into bitcoin alongside a transition from stablecoins, which are less volatile. When Paxos Trust’s binance USD (BUSD) encountered regulatory scrutiny, money moved from BUSD to BTC, and when Circle Internet Financial's USD coin (USDC) lost its peg, money flowed from USDC. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, usually the U.S. dollar.  In addition, the Fed’s policy of raising rates has led to falling prices of Treasurys, lowering the value of banks’ portfolios. The collapse of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank (SBNY) has roiled financial markets this month.  The potential classification of some digital assets as securities has also become an overhang for many cryptocurrencies, the note added.  “While there appears to be a clear path to regulation, there is a specific understanding that some can escape regulation,” the report said, noting that regulators and central banks have classified bitcoin as a commodity, not a security.

Users of Arbitrum, which has seen immense growth in the past few months, were expecting the network to issue its native tokens for a long time. Arbitrum developers have previously denied they planned to issue tokens, but that didn’t dissuade traders from making bets on the possibility of the tokens in the future.  “Arbitrum airdrop by March 31st?” proved to be a popular market on the decentralized prediction market place PoolTogether, attracting $4 million in volume since its March 10 launch.  Traders could place bets on “no” or “yes,” based on whether Arbitrum would both launch and ""airdrop"" a native token by March 31. The launch was defined as a token deployed to Arbitrum's main network in a way that was actively transferrable or tradable and was listed on an exchange, such as Uniswap.  Bets on “no” trended until Thursday. Such claims sold for 70 cents each until last week, sliding down to 64 cents on Thursday morning. On the other hand, claims on “yes” fell to as low as 20 cents in the past week as the expiration date approached – before moving to 50 cents mark early Thursday.  The tables flipped after Arbitrum’s announcement, which may have come as a surprise to traders, confirmed the airdrop of tradeable ARB tokens starting March 23.  Yes claims jumped to 96 cents almost instantly, gaining a further 2 cents at writing time on Friday. Over $600,000 is now scheduled to be paid out to bettors on March 31.  No claims dumped to just 3 cents, netting investors a 95% haircut on their wager in just over two weeks, had they invested in the initial period.  All hope’s not lost for the no claims, however.

The central bank's lending facility provides loans to institutions, helping them manage liquidity risks and avoid bank runs.  Banks also borrowed $11.9 billion from the newly created Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), a liquidity lifeline for banks guaranteeing loans with holdings of U.S. Treasurys. This also is not a free money as borrowing banks must pay interest rates defined by the one-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate plus ten basis points.  Lastly, $142.8 billion were lent to the new bridge banks created by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for the crisis-stricken Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.  In the meantime, the Fed's holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities declined by $7 billion and $2 billion, respectively, as part of the central bank's quantitive tightening (QT) program kicked off in June of last year.  All things considered, the net assets on the Fed's balance sheet increased by $297 billion, undoing months of the central bank's efforts to shrink its balance sheet. But that's not necessarily stimulative like QE.  ""The increase in the balance sheet is a temporary reflection of the runs on the various weak banks,"" Andy Constan, CEO of Damped Spring Advisors, said in a tweet thread.  Constan added that bank reserves (liquidity) created by the newly launched BTFP program would be stimulative if those receiving the reserves create money for investment or consumption.  ""If they keep it at the Fed, it does nothing,"" Constan noted.  That said, the record borrowing by banks does signal a fear of liquidity drying up fast, a risk to banking sector stability. That may boost demand for bitcoin, which is now being seen as a hedge against bank runs.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/17/feds-balance-sheet-swells-by-nearly-297b-but-its-not-qe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19cfd8792d32ab3008c473ce4c1f9386d916a2ce-2616x858.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On-chain data first spotted by Lookonchain shows that an address controlled by the entity that exploited Euler Finance’s protocol earlier this week has sent 100 ether (ETH), worth $170,515 at current prices, to a wallet associated with Lazarus Group’s Ronin network hack.  It’s unclear if Lazarus Group is also behind the attack, or if there’s any sort of affiliation with the organization and the entity that exploited Euler Finance.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury added Lazarus Group, to its list of designated entities last April. In January, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that Lazarus Group, along with fellow North Korean hacking squad APT38, was responsible for the theft of $100 million in crypto assets from Horizon Bridge. Lazarus Group is a cybercrime organization run by the North Korean government.  In total, Euler Finance was exploited for nearly $200 million in crypto largely denominated in DAI, wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), staked ether (sETH) and USDC.  The attacker behind the exploit didn’t necessarily “hack” it, or break its code to intrude inside, but rather manipulated internal markets via a flash loan to drain its treasury.  Last October, a similar scheme was used to manipulate the Solana-based protocol Mango Markets to drain its treasury. The individual behind the exploit, Avraham Eisenberg, was arrested in Puerto Rico in late December.  The price of Euler’s token, EUL, was recently trading at $1.85, according to CoinGecko.

42412612,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5SU6,1679022599,OpenZeppelin Reveals Top 10 Blockchain Hacking Techniques in 2022,"OpenZeppelin, a crypto cybersecurity company that provides an open-source framework to develop secure smart contracts, on Thursday U.S. time revealed the final results of the top 10 blockchain hacking techniques of 2022, in an effort to make the crypto space more safe.  First and second place included a bug on the software node level of layer 2 scaling system Optimism and a vulnerability on the key generation level of vanity address generator Profanity. The Optimism bug, if exploited, causes “an infinite mint” of Optimism’s native token OP that “would collapse many (if not all) Optimism protocols,” while the vulnerability on Profanity put at least $160 million at risk, said Ashiq Amien, one of the six panelists on the project.  All of the hacking techniques were already publicly disclosed in 2022, before the start of the project.  Following Monday’s $200 million exploit of decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Euler Finance, the reveal of top 10 hacking techniques is meant to highlight the best practices for security measures on various levels of blockchain code including the smart contract level, key generation level and node level.  The project “helps to push security boundaries forward and strengthen the security of the whole ecosystem by basically accumulating all the research and ideally surfacing underrated research,” said Nikita Stupin, a blockchain security engineer and researcher at OpenZeppelin.  Stupin added in an interview with CoinDesk, “This primarily is for security researchers so that they are up to date with the most novel approaches, the most novel techniques, or the most novel attack vectors so that they can apply them and see them in their audits.”  Additional members of top 10 list include a bug that allowed exploiters to empty all wrapped token contracts, potentially forcing the wrapped ether (wETH) contract to be insolvent and a vulnerability on the Avalanche blockchain that was used to break security assumptions of several protocols, including decentralized exchange SushiSwap and lending platform Abracadabra, according to the announcement.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin is pushing past $25K and its correlation with stocks is decreasing.  Insights: Plagiarism, fork or simple mistake? The Shiba Inu community is debating the origin story of the Shibarium blockchain.  Prices  < CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,109 +18.8 ▲ 1.7% Bitcoin (BTC) $24,980 +629.8 ▲ 2.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,669 +15.4 ▲ 0.9% S&P 500  3,960.28 +68.4 ▲ 1.8% Gold  $1,924 −2.9 ▼ 0.2% Nikkei 225  27,010.61 −218.9 ▼ 0.8% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  High Buying Pressure Pushes Bitcoin Past $25K  Most major digital assets are in the green as Asia starts its business day.  Bitcoin is up 5.3% in the last 24 hours to $25,703, while ether is up about 2.8% to $1,697. Binance’s BNB token is up 8.7% to $331.  Kaiko Director of Research Clara Medalie said on a recent CoinDesk TV appearance that this mini-crypto rally is because of low liquidity in the market and high buying pressure. Binance converting $1 billion of BUSD to bitcoin, ether, BNB and other tokens was the fuel for the fire.  “This is a huge amount of buy pressure on the markets,” she said. “As the markets aren’t that liquid, any significant buying pressure is likely going to have a considerable impact on prices as a whole.”  Medalie also said Europe and Asia have a chance to be a magnet for liquidity orphaned by the collapse of Silvergate and Signature banks.  “There are quite a few crypto companies actually based in Europe or APAC [Asia-Pacific] that have maintained their banking relationships, so it actually presents a pretty big opportunity for these regions to accept crypto businesses,” she said.  Taiwan’s Maicoin, for instance, maintains a relationship with a large bank in Taiwan to act as its fiat pipeline.  Medalie added that the correlation between stocks and crypto is breaking, pointing to the divergence between crypto and equity markets at the start of the year and during this most recent rally.  “It flipped this week. We see crypto markets rallying, while equity markets have completely collapsed,” she said. “The divergence in these markets have flipped, and that’s being maintained, which is creating this decreasing correlation for both Nasdaq’s tech stocks and Europe’s 600 index.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA +4.6% Entertainment Polkadot DOT +3.7% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE +3.5% Currency  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Insights  Shiba Inu Community Debates the Origin Story of Shibarium  What’s in a number?  For the community around the SHIB token and Shibarium blockchain, it’s the difference between code that has been plagarized and open-source code that’s been recycled.  The drama began Thursday Asia time where an established member of its Discord pointed to the Shibarium chain using the same Chain ID number, 917, as the Rinia Testnet chain.  While Discord members were quick to generate their own explanations for the similarity, with some panic-selling the token, pushing it down 10%, the explanation from developers behind the Shibarium chain is something far more benign.  “Few chain IDs were picked randomly - 417(Alpha), 517(Staging), 917(pre-pod/beta) and these chains were not registered anywhere at that time, I made a mistake to not recheck when the puppynet network was launched,” tweeted Kaaldhairya, one of the pseudonymous developers.  Kaaldhairya tweeted that they were going to be “redeploying a new version of BETA network with a new chain ID.”  “Fresh deployments will be rare in the future but are possible because we will still be in BETA phase,” he continued.  Others pointed to similarities in code found on Github, a code repository.  Coders often re-use each others’ work for mundane and benign tasks. These pre-written blocks are known are libraries, and are available as open-source code. That is, code that’s intended to be copied and reused.  Andrew Angrisani, a member of the project’s Telegram community as well as its Discord, and a crypto security engineer, explained the code similarities to both Rinia and Shibarium using the same open-source code.  “Both Rinia TestNet and Shibarium copied open-source code for their block explorers called Blockscout and likely both were lazy in their implementation,” he said.  Another high-ranking community member, JesusM, called this all a “minor mistake made on beta.” JesusM said that this is the point of the beta process.  “Mistakes in it get tested and then fixed,” they said.  Angrisani speculated that part of this could be a ploy to drum up free marketing for Rinia and an upcoming project.  “The Rinia Testnet chain Dev is launching an [initial coin offering] for Firechain called a Shib Killer on March 31. They could be using this mud in the water to drum up free marketing since the ChainIDs were the same,” he said. “It may be an artifact of copying source code from an open-source project.”  This is also not the first time accusations have flown around. In February, questions on the Discord were being raised about similarities between Shibarium and Rinia.  “At the end of the day, Shibarium is likely still far off, Open Source code is being used (which is okay – other projects do it), Unification Fund is still working on Shibarium, and the Firechain/Rinia dev is using this to market their upcoming ICO,” Angrisani concluded.  While the SHIB token has regained some of its losses since the initial selloff, it’s still down 8% on the day.

42412614,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5SVy,1679015359,FDIC Denies Report Signature Bank Purchaser Must Divest Crypto,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation denied it would require any purchaser of Signature Bank to divest its crypto activities.  The FDIC responded to a Wednesday Reuters report that said “any buyer of Signature must agree to give up all the crypto business at the bank,” citing two unnamed sources. An FDIC spokesperson denied this to Reuters.  An FDIC spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email that “the receivership does not end until all the bank’s assets are sold and all the claims against the bank are addressed, and the acquirer decides the conditions of their bid.”  The acquirer will tell the FDIC “what assets and liabilities from the failed bank it is willing to take,” the spokesperson said, citing the agency’s resolution handbook. The spokesperson also referred CoinDesk to two joint statements published by the FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, one of which states that banks are “neither prohibited nor discouraged” from providing services to any sector.  Reuters reported that an FDIC spokesperson told the news service that “the agency would not require divestment of crypto activities as part of any sale.”  Signature was seized over the weekend by the New York Department of Financial Services and turned over to the FDIC. While Signature board member Barney Frank (co-sponsor of the Dodd-Frank Act when he was in Congress) claimed it was a political move, possibly caused by anti-crypto sentiment, a NYDFS spokesperson said in a statement the regulator had lost confidence in the bank’s leadership after a bank run last Friday and a lack of “reliable” information over the weekend.  The FDIC is now looking to auction Signature and Silicon Valley Bank – another bank seized by a state regulator last week – possibly by the end of this week, Reuters reported.

By increasing to 7.9 cents Thursday, the token’s fully diluted valuation or market capitalization of all tokens once released into circulation sits at $79.8 million at presstime, per Dex Screener, but at Paradigm’s purchase price of ARENA, the token has a fully diluted valuation of $40 million. The token’s 24-hour volume currently stands at roughly $61,000, per GeckoTerminal.  Earlier Thursday, the on-chain voting period for Code4rena DAO opened. Since then, a total of nine addresses voted, providing unanimous support in favor of authorizing the DAO to sell its tokens to Paradigm. Data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen shows 142 unique addresses holding ARENA, a 10% increase since Monday.  If passed, the $6 million sale to Paradigm will be authorized and the funds will be used as working capital for the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to grow Code4rena, according to the on-chain vote. The vote ends one week from now, March 23.  The author of the governance proposal said, “We’re excited to have [Paradigm’s] expertise in helping Code4rena achieve our shared mission of making the Web3 ecosystem more secure, whilst rewarding all contributors.” In 2022, $3.8 billion was stolen from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols in hacks, per Chainalysis.  In the past 15 hours, a Code4rena token lockup contract, labeled by Nansen, sent 55 million tokens to five addresses. Two of these five addresses participated in the ongoing vote.  Code4rena is an audit platform that organizes security contests for smart contracts and offers “guaranteed payouts” for audit contests, as stated in its technical docs. The security contest organizer for smart contracts had 46 users earn more than $40,000 for their efforts in uncovering vulnerabilities last year, data from Code4rena’s leaderboard shows.  The governance vote highlights Paradigm’s hands-on approach in blockchain safety: In addition to its involvement with Code4rena, Paradigm also organizes its own Web3 focused security competition called Paradigm CTF.
