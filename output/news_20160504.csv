42426848,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAzh,1462394458,"Bitcoin Markets Hold Steady, But Brace for More Craig Wright Details","Bitcoin markets experienced little change on 2nd May, providing a mild response to Craig Wright’s claim that he is in fact the digital currency’s inventor.  The Economist, the BBC and GQ all released stories on the subject that day, following months of speculation surrounding whether Wright created bitcoin. After Wright's assertions, skeptical cries arose from many corners of the bitcoin community, including several experts who spoke with CoinDesk at the Consensus 2016 event.  Regardless of which experts support Wright’s claim, the market’s reaction has been largely uncertain. Bitcoin prices dropped slightly early on 2nd May, falling from a high of $452.60 at 07:00 UTC on 2nd May to a low of $439.89 by 09:00 UTC, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data.  For the remainder of the day, the digital currency fluctuated largely between $440 and 445, an extraordinarily tight range for the normally volatile bitcoin.  In addition to enjoying stable prices, bitcoin saw little change in long-short ratios in the BTC/USD market, Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at full-service bitcoin trading platform Whale Club, told CoinDesk.  ""If anything, we've noticed an uptick in long positions as value traders see yesterday's panic dump from $450 to $440 as an opportunity to 'buy the dip.' Most traders are without a doubt betting on more upside,"" he said.  Aftermath  The currency’s price remained largely unchanged over the next few days.  Bitcoin prices opened at $444.51 on 3rd May and proceeded to reach a high of $450.89 at 18:00 UTC, lingering just north of $450 for the remainder of the session, BPI figures reveal.  The digital currency’s price dipped slightly in early trade on 4th May, falling to an inter-day low of $445.44 at 11:00 UTC and proceeding to fluctuate close to $445. At the time of reporting, bitcoin was trading at around $446.  These price movements took place as market participants made bullish bets on the digital currency. Whale Club’s long-short ratio stood at 5:1 in favor of longs at roughly 19:00 UTC, Zivkovski revealed.  ""This buy pressure can resolve in one of two ways over the next few weeks,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Either the support created is strong enough to buoy price toward a sustained uptrend above $470, or all these longs will serve as powerful fuel for a long squeeze (aggressive selling) should support break down.""  While bitcoin has been enjoying relative price stability, this may not last for long.  Calm before the storm  Should Wright succeed in convincing the markets his claims are legitimate, this development could trigger volatility in the digital currency, said Zane Tackett, director of community and product development at Bitfinex.  In addition, many are wondering what will happen should Satoshi begin selling off his approximately 1,000,000 bitcoins. While the market has thus far been ""undecided"" in its reaction to Wright’s claims, any decision made by Satoshi to start divesting this horde of coins could have a major impact, stated George Samman, a blockchain advisor and consultant.  “People will be very nervous they will be dumped into the market as those coins remaining static has been a benchmark for a long time,"" he told CoinDesk. ""They have long sat in the Tulip Trust and if they start to move, it would definitely shake the market and people would be watching.""  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, stated that Wright’s claims had “less of an impact” because several people have come forward in the past 18 months claiming to be bitcoin’s founder.  The far more important question, he said, is 'What is Satoshi going to do with all his coins?'  Charles L.

42426843,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAph,1462387706,Lawyers Argue Bitcoin Needs Change in Money-Transmitting Laws,"The lawyer representing Anthony Murgio in an ongoing case regarding his now-closed firm Coin.mx argued today why he thinks the law being used to prosecute his client needs to be changed.  Speaking on a panel with six other digital currency regulation experts during the final day of Consensus 2016, Brian Klein, a partner at law firm Baker Marquart, explained what he called the ""most important"" regulation pertaining to criminal money transmission that he said most people have never heard of.  Called the Prohibition of unlicensed money-transmitting businesses – 18 USC 1960, the statute includes three specific ways to violate the law and can be applied to a violator regardless of the person’s intent.  Klein said:  ""I do happen to think it’s overly broad. I do think there needs to be specific intent.""  Klein’s client, Anthony Murgio, was indicted for operating an unlicensed money transmission business in a case that involves allegations that he knowingly handled funds that were being used to pay a ransomware demand.  After a detailed review of the law’s requirements that money transmitters register with the state, with Fincen, and may not transport funds for ""some sort of"" criminal purpose, Klein said he was currently working to get the law changed.  Simplifying the requirements  Following Klein’s address to an audience of about 30 people, Dana Syracuse, a former New York Department of Financial Services attorney who helped oversee the state’s creation of the BitLicense for regulating digital currencies, talked about why he thinks its important for future versions of digital currency controls to keep compliance demands to a minimum.  In addition to advocating for what is widely called an on-ramping of the law which amounts to less-demanding compliance requirements for new companies, Syracuse, now a partner at law firm Buckley Sandler, argued for the standardization of state-by-state demands.  Syracuse said:  ""There really is a need for some sort of federal approach or some other uniform application.""  Gray aspects of ownership  One of the reasons regulating bitcoin is no simple task, is the proliferation of transaction types and ways to store bitcoin.  The resulting complicated relationships between those who own bitcoin, those who might own bitcoin and a wide range of other parties potentially involved makes it unclear who has custody of the digital currency at any given time, according to Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, who also spoke on today's panel.  Ranging from multi-signature wallets that can create the appearance of multiple custody owners, to third-party service providers that hold keys on behalf of clients, to so-called 'n-lock' transactions that only complete at some point in the future, the lines of ownership are blurred, complicating regulatory procedure.  Multiple variations on custody status can also be implemented simultaneously, further complicating the task of sorting out who owns what at which time.  Van Valkenburgh argued that clarifying these fundamental questions of custody in the digital currency economy was essential to establishing viable, clear regulation.  He said:  ""What we need is a careful thinking about how we define custody in this space where these different variables are possible.""  Varied regulatory landscape  Other members of the panel included Reuben Grinberg, an associate at Davis Polk & Wardwell, who spoke on facilitating securities transactions with blockchain; Patrick Murck of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, who spoke about how to trace ownership of digital assets and what kind of property rights can be claimed; and Elijah Alper, legal counsel at Wilmer Hale, who spoke about the unintended consequences of FINCEN’s guidance on ""virtual currencies"" implemented in October 2014.  Overall, the panelists demonstrated the broad set of regulations that already need to be considered by companies interested in getting into the digital currency business. While not all regulations are applicable to all companies in the digital currency business, knowing what controls one might bump into is a fundamental step for any company getting started.

42426855,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxB7h,1462381213,"Educating Regulators a Priority, Say Blockchain Policy Experts","If digital currency is ever going to go mainstream, regulators will need to remove the doubt that surrounds it. But before that happens they need to understand the technology.  At a series of panels during the second day of the Consensus 2016 conference in New York City, a representative of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, a former member of the White House communications team and multiple startup founders took turns predicting the future regulatory climate for digital currencies like bitcoin.  What connected each of the panels, which spanned a wide range of topics, was a distinct sense that the chasm between regulators and digital currency was only as big as the industry’s willingness to teach them.  Educating the regulators  Former spokesperson for President Obama, Jamie Smith, argued on her panel that the first step to getting a more widespread regulatory blessing on digital currency is to teach international regulators about the technology.  Now global chief communications officer at mining company BitFury, Smith is working to expand the firm's services to include a wide range of blockchain efforts. And, true to her word, she’s engaging with industry leaders and bureaucrats to standardize the way we talk about cryptocurrency.  Smith said:  ""Everybody wants to be part of something special and they want to talk about it. I think we shouldn’t underestimate that a lot of regulators are really young and fresh on the scene and others have been around for while, and they’d both like to have something interesting to engage with.""  By standardizing the way we talk about this new technology, she believes regulators will accelerate the rate they learn and, as a result, be less likely to react negatively to topics they don’t immediately understand.  While Smith mentioned the Blockchain Alliance as a specific example of a group able to get influential people in one room to educate them, panelist John Edge noted another option.  Edge is the founder of the non-profit digital ID startup Identity2020 and the White Chapel Think Tank, which aims to help increase trust in distributed ledger technology by regulators and policy influencers.  Edge told the audience of how White Chapel had once managed to gather about 16 representatives from the ""Central Bank"", the Executive Branch of the US Government and other regulators for a conversation with Adam Back, the creator of Hash Cash and co-founder of Blockstream.  To help them better understand blockchain, Edge said, governmental organizations and companies should create sandbox environments in which they can safely experiment, then invite younger members to take leadership positions exploring the technology.  ""You’ll end up with an army of young people,"" he said, adding: ""Before we can do those conversations, we have to do what Jamie’s talking about.""  Jonathan Levin, founder and CEO of Chainalysis, had his own strategy for doing exactly that – teaching policymakers at any organization, including large corporations about blockchain.  Instead of pursuing an “army of young people,” Levin advocated that the organization should identify a single person with at least some bitcoin or blockchain knowledge, and offer them a position as a specialist.  ""What works really well for any business who’s not in this [is] to find a point person,"" said Levin, who is also the co-author of a paper written to teach the British government about blockchain.  While it’s unlikely you'll get 25 or 30 people to understand and take action to implement a blockchain strategy, one person can become a valuable leader and an advocate, he explained.  ""That person usually works three times as hard when they’re given that responsibility,"" Levin said.  Overcoming the banking problem  It’s not just government regulators who have been shy about getting involved with bitcoin and other blockchain applications. Policy makers at big banks have also proved wary – a fact made clear by a report released today by Coin Center.  Co-authored by Partin Valabhaneni of international law firm Arnold & Porter, the report titled ""Overcoming Obstacles to Banking Virtual Currency Businesses"" paints a bleak picture of the banking industry’s relationship with bitcoin companies.  Effectively, and with very few exceptions, the digital currency industry still has very little success when applying for bank accounts. And if a bitcoin entrepreneur is eventually given an account, it could take between six months and 12 months, according to the report.  ""You are bucketed by many bank’s standards as a very high-risk account,"" said Valabhaneni.  Though he spoke primarily to US bitcoin companies, he said most of them had global platforms that experience similar difficulties abroad.  While Valabhaneni said there’s no single industry bank or regulator to blame for the constricting conditions, he agreed the solution was education.  ""We would employ banks to learn,"" he said. ""Many banks are investing lot of time through various labs … yet those very banks are reluctant to provide those same companies accounts.""  Not all banks are so anti-bitcoin, however. Silvergate Bank CEO, Alan Lane said his company is currently doing business with between 15–20 banks and is open to digital currency-based firms.  ""We are in the business of providing service to businesses. It just so happens that bitcoin and blockchain companies are all businesses,"" he explained.  To overcome objections from the bank’s board, Lane indicated that he and his team had to figure out a way to ""articulate"" the opportunity in a way that didn’t raise fears that doing business with bitcoin might negatively impact their reputation.  He said:  ""It’s not something you’re going to talk about until you’re ready. I guess what I’m saying is we’re ready.""  Contrary to the Coin Center report, Lane said he can onboard a bitcoin company in between 30 days and 60 days. The firm’s due diligence can include a visit to the company’s office, among other things.  Xapo president Ted Rogers also chimed in with some advice to startups looking to do business with banks, with his firm being one of the better known bitcoin companies to be granted a bank account. But even with $40m in venture capital available, Rogers said it wasn’t easy.  In the early days of the application process, he said, the company may have had an “attitude problem"". After “going through the five stages of grief”, though, the team decided to play nice with the banks.  For entrepreneurs who don’t have the venture backing to afford such a learning curve, Rogers suggested they should stop viewing the banks as the enemy. Instead of going after a high-end enterprise account, founders should be willing to start slowly with something smaller, teach the bank about their service, then add more complicated services later.  Rogers said:  ""I think it’s good for the virtual currency group as well, because you’re going to learn a lot.""      Digital cash for central banks  If all goes well, one of the more extreme possibilities is that central banks around the world, such as the Federal Reserve, might issue a digital currency of their own.  While this may seem like a far-fetched dream of the cryptocurrency diehards, David Andolfatto, vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, suggested the idea is more accessible than some might think.  Andolfatto said:  ""Its essentially what we have now. Most of our money is already online anyway.""  Another hypothetical idea floated by the panel was the idea that a so-called ""FedCoin' might compete against other digital currencies, something Andolfatto said he was “hopeful” might lead to a more stable financial system, should it ever come to pass.  Simon Johnson, a professor of entrepreneurship at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, said that perhaps non-central banks might run ""their own private version of currency with increasing ease.""  ""You’ve also got to think about before 1914,"" he added, in a reference to the founding year of the Federal Reserve.  Instead of being a threat to the Federal Reserve, Johnson said that a FedCoin would simply give the bank another tool, adding:  ""Its really just another denomination of currency.""

42426851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxB1h,1462377607,Implementing Blockchain: Who Are You Going to Call?,"A year ago, the blockchain industry landscape consisted mostly of technology companies.  It was dominated by various blockchain protocols (eg bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple), some bitcoin derivatives (Mastercoin, Counterparty), bitcoin API companies (Chain, Gem, Coinbase, Coinkite) and a patchwork of sprouting middleware overlay software companies that were not yet known.  Fast forward to today, and we see a different landscape of players, with entry from several new companies that are focused on implementations, and other newcomers with software capabilities at higher stack levels than the blockchain protocols themselves.  So, if you are an enterprise organization pondering your implementation options, what choices do you have in order to get going?  The table below summarizes the main options:  IT Services  This option is pursued via a typical outsourcing arrangement with a firm that will deliver or build anything you'd like.  Most of the known global IT/consulting firms now have a blockchain practice, and some of these companies specialize in particular technologies or have specific alliances with certain solutions or technology providers.  Others will start via a consulting approach to help you discover use cases or build strong cases for proofs of concept and trials.  Some choices: Accenture, ConsenSys, Cognizant, Deloitte, IBM, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), Ernst & Young.  Blockchain first  In this case, you work directly with the given blockchain tools and stack.  Assembly is required, so this isn't for the faint of heart at this point, as many of the technologies are still developing and evolving. However, working directly with the blockchain provides a good degree of innovation, for example in building decentralized applications.  This is where entrepreneurs are creating ambitious end-to-end, peer-to-peer applications, such as OpenBazaar (on bitcoin), or Clearmatics (on Ethereum).  Some choices: Bitcoin, Ethereum.  Development platforms  Here, you don't start with a preference for a blockchain.  Rather, you start with a development approach orientation, and you build an app that backs into a blockchain infrastructure that could be served in the cloud.  The goal here is rapid development and you focus on the blockchain programmability.  Some choices: BlockApps, Blockstream, Eris, EthCore, Hyperledger, Tendermint.  Vertical solutions  This segment is where we have seen the most rapid metamorphosis in the past year, mostly in financial services.  These solutions are industry specific, and they are based on private blockchain or ledger infrastructures.  A caveat here is that some of these are not full blockchains. Rather, they are distributed ledgers, which are a subset of blockchain capabilities. And some don't even include a consensus element, which takes the implementation another level down from distributed ledger tech.  Some choices: Axoni, Chain, Clearmatics, Digital Asset Holdings, itBit, R3.  APIs and overlays  This approach uses the blockchain as an asset, ownership or identity-binding infrastructure, and you build applications with a specific focus on chains of proof, ownership rights, title registries or other specific services with a built-in trust-based component.  Some choices: Blockstack, Factom, Open Assets, Tierion.  Several large organizations are poking at these five areas in parallel because they can learn from each one of them. Each approach has its own merits and challenges.  Which one(s) are you taking? Why not let us know in the comments below?

42426841,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAhh,1462323211,Dueling Blockchain Visions Face Off in Consensus 2016 Day Two Finale,"The final panel on the last full day of Consensus 2016 featured a gentlemen’s dual of philosophies over the merits of public and private blockchains by two of the biggest names in the business.  On the one side was David Rutter, founder and CEO of distributed ledger banking consortium R3CEV, which has over 40 member banks and is working to build from the ground up a faster more transparent way for those banks to conduct a wide range of transactions. On the other sat Balaji Srinivasan, founder and CEO of 21 Inc the most heavily funded bitcoin mining company, with $121m venture capital making a wide range of plays into other areas.  The panel’s moderator, Paul Vigna, author of ""The Age of Cryptocurrency"" and writer at The Wall Street Journal, provided the prompt for the debate with a friendly request for the two founders to pick apart the weaknesses of each other's strategy.  Srinivasan, who had just announced the launch of a new plan to make every computer a bitcoin mining computer took the first swipe, began by explaining what he considered the limits of a trusted blockchain or ledger network.  Citing a recent dispute regarding Alibaba, he said that the lack of trust between the US and China was evidence of exactly the dangers of over-expanding a trusted network.  Srinvasan told the audience:  ""That kind of situation is something where you can only expand a private blockchain so much until you start getting into things that are in Russia or in China or in Iran or some region that is really not fully a trusted party.""  As a counter-point to his argument, he held up his own preference for the bitcoin blockchain, which because is not only distributed, but public facing, means parties can transact across wide distances without knowing anything about one another.  The former CEO of ICAP electronic broker, Rutter responded that banks don’t need such assurances because of other existing protocols that have been in place for years.  Specifically, Rutter mentioned legal documentation embedded in banking processes and regulations as evidence that a trustless system for his potential clients simply wasn't necessary.  Rutter said:  ""I think that from what we’re trying to solve for and with the institutions, we’re trying to solve it for which is global financial institutions not just banks. There’s this embedded trust.""  Unusual competitors  Though on the surface the two companies may appear to some to be competitors, the potential customers are certainly varied; 21 Inc is marketing to ambitious developers, while and R3CEV working to build products for global banks.  Another difference between the two ostensible competitors is their time to market. While Rutter admitted he’s under pressure from his members to create useful products on a tight schedule, Srinvasan said his company has lots of time before his vision needs to come to fruition.  Both seemed trying hard to play nice in spite of some difficult questions.  Srinivasan said he was previously a “bear” about private blockchains until he read Richard Gendall Brown’s recently published paper explaining R3CEV’s Corda. Rutter implied he may actually own some bitcoin, though where exactly the key was he couldn’t be sure.
