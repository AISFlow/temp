On Dec. 30, a team of officers from CGST (Goods & Services Tax and Central Excise) Mumbai East Zone, tax authorities in India’s financial capital, tweeted this:  On Dec. 31, the tax authority revealed details in a statement saying “the case is a part of the special anti-tax evasion drive, which relies on intensive data mining and data analytics, initiated by the CGST Mumbai Zone.”  The agency also warned that it “will cover all the cryptocurrency exchanges falling in Mumbai Zone and will also intensify this drive in the coming days.”  The Binance-owned WazirX blamed a lack of clarity in regulation for the matter, saying it’s “been diligently paying tens of crores worth of GST every month.”  The exchange added: “There was an ambiguity in the interpretation of one of the components which led to a different calculation of GST paid. However, we voluntarily paid additional GST in order to be cooperative and compliant. There was and is no intention to evade tax. That being said, we strongly believe that regulatory clarity is the need of the hour for the Indian crypto industry.”  Following the WazirX search, Mumbai’s Tax authority, along with DGGI, the national law enforcement agency under the Ministry of Finance responsible for fighting tax evasion in India, searched the offices of about six cryptocurrency service providers on Saturday.

The Detroit native has acquired about 20 NFTs on OpenSea under the name Shady_Holdings. Eminem, whom Rolling Stone magazine named one of the 100 Greatest Artists of all time, won the 2002 Oscar for Best Original Song, and has garnered 15 Grammy music awards in a career dating to the 1980s.  In a tweet, BAYC member GeeGazza, who sold the ape, thanked the entertainer for purchasing the NFT. “I’m living in a simulation,” he wrote, adding: “Madness. Let me write a lyric in your next single.” GeeGazza had been hoping for months that the entertainer would buy the ape.  Georgio Constantinou, artist manager of Web 3 digital agency Six tweeted that the firm had helped Eminem buy “the EminApe.”  Eminem’s interest in NFTs is not his first brush with crypto.
