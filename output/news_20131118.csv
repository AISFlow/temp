42376696,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOPj,1384803643,"Whether or Not Bitcoin Needs it, Regulators are Going to Regulate","UPDATE: The full video of today's Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing can be viewed here.  ————————————————–  As the Senate’s Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs begins its hearing on virtual currencies today, one question stands out: do we need one?  One commenter on bitcointalk.org said: “Waste of time. A decentralized currency doesn't need that.”  The whole point of bitcoin, after all, is that it was designed to usurp central control. Like the Internet itself, it routes itself around regulation. And yet, bitcoin advocates including Jeremy Allaire, founder of merchant payment services firm Circle Internet Financial, are gathered in a room in Washington, DC, to try and help regulators understand it. Why?  “It is very short-sighted for community members to think that bitcoin can be anything but a niche tool by eschewing policy makers and government,” Allaire told CoinDesk. He should know – some $2m of the $9m that Circle raised will likely be spent on achieving regulatory compliance.  [post-quote]  “Whether one wants it, or thinks the currency needs it, or not, the fact is that the Senate will hold hearings, and regulators will regulate,” agreed Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and director of its Technology Policy Program, who also testifies today.  “Bitcoin can't be controlled very easily by governments, if at all, but the development of its infrastructure by entrepreneurs and innovators can certainly be hampered by bad law and regulation,” Brito said. “So if it's going to happen anyway, what's the harm in being there to present a rational and reasonable perspective?”  These hearings are generally fact-finding expeditions to brief senators on the details of a topic, and to prepare them for potential legislative measures further down the line. But most people CoinDesk spoke to didn't think there would be many decisions made on the back of this hearing. Instead, lawmakers are simply trying to understand how the whole thing operates.  “It's an opportunity for Congress to learn about the issue, to learn what the agencies are doing, to learn what the private sector is doing, and to chime in with what it thinks is the right approach,” Brito said. “I doubt we will see any virtual currency-specific legislation anytime soon.""  In fact, that may be the industry speakers’ purpose at this hearing; to soothe senators, and avoid knee-jerk reactions like this one, in which Senator Chuck Schumer blasted the “surrogate currency”, by linking it directly to Silk Road.  Increased understanding  Even Senator Tom Carper, who is chairing the hearing, admits that lawmakers need a better understanding of virtual currencies.  “Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others, and confused the heck out of many of us,” he will say today. “Indeed, based on conversations my staff and I have had with dozens of individuals both inside and outside of government, it is clear that the knowledge and expectation gaps are wide.”  Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck isn’t alone in thinking that there’s enough regulation already. In his testimony today, he will argue that the Foundation saw the introduction of FinCEN’s guidance on virtual currencies in March as a signal that ""existing regulation covers most of the business activity taking place in the bitcoin ecosystem"".  Today, he will say:  “Bitcoin’s differing characteristics potentially make it a different asset class than what existing regulation recognizes. But it fits well within the legal and regulatory regimes that bar frauds like the Ponzi scheme at issue in that case.”  There are those who are more concerned about bitcoin’s use for criminal activity. In his opening statement, Carper highlights concerns about the anonymity of virtual currencies, which can make it hard for law enforcers to track criminals, and will reveal that the individual who sent ricin to President Obama was a Silk Road vendor.  “Whether it is bitcoin or any of the other virtual currencies, the federal government and society as a whole need to come together to figure out how to effectively deal with it,” he will say, adding that “a few bad apples” shouldn’t be allowed to spoil the whole bunch.  Ernie Allen, the president and CEO of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, will also testify today. He is halfway through an investigation of virtual currency and criminal economies targeted for release in February, says that he is already seeing cases of bitcoin use in child porn rings.  Both bitcoin and Tor are being used for this purpose, he says. While the market was small compared to the use of bitcoin for drugs and other illegal goods, he points out that those accepting digital currencies for child porn were often the producers of the content. He lists several sites in his testimony, owned by an operator arrested in August (Freedom Hosting), which he said accepted bitcoin.  But such talk leaves Jon Matonis fuming. “I don’t even know why they’re invited,” said Matonis, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, and a contributing editor to CoinDesk.  “There’s nobody who disagrees with the issue on that,” says Matonis of the child exploitation risk, arguing that the Bitcoin Foundation isn’t a law enforcement agency. But cryptocurrencies don’t have morals, he says, citing the old NRA adage: “guns don’t kill people – people do.”  The benefits for financial inclusion, for the unbanked, for personal financial privacy and individual control, far outweigh the negative uses of the currency, Matonis warns. “Society has to make a decision on accepting some of the negative to get the good.”  Controls  At the crux of this security hearing, then, is the same age-old argument that accompanies any enabling technology: should you regulate it because criminals can use it? Phil Zimmerman, the inventor of the PGP encryption protocol, faced the same issues when the US government made a case against him (and subsequently dropped it) in the nineties.  The new crop of enabling technologies faces the same questions, Matonis says. “Tor is there also. What do you think that the Tor project will say when asked the question ‘what can you do to track these transactions so that people don’t use Tor anonymously’? Will they come out with Tor Lite?” he laughs. “And what’s bitcoin going to do?”  But some are already proposing technological controls to accompany the legal measures already imposed at the exchange level in the form of AML and KYC. Today, in his testimony, Allen will discuss ‘clustering’, the act of analyzing patterns in bitcoin usage to identify perps, and he will explicitly discuss that in the hearing today.  Another idea is marked coins, which are bitcoin outputs tagged so that every subsequent output will also have a tag. They would enable a bitcoin client to tell a user that an output came from money that was ‘marked’ earlier, possibly because it was involved in criminal activity. But Mike Hearn’s discussion of this last week prompted uproar from the bitcoin community.  “I know that people at the Bitcoin Foundation wanted to get past the public hearings before we started talking about that, but it is the next big thing to tackle,” says Matonis of coin marking. But the majority in the community don’t approve of it, he says.  Brito isn’t sure that such a scheme would be workable, either technically or from a regulatory perspective. He said:    “It would be akin to taking out of circulation any dollar bill that has ever been used by a drug dealer. More importantly, how will it be decided what uses are clean and which are not?      And how do you get the massive buy-in you'd need from the bitcoin-using public. Color me skeptical.”    And then, of course, there’s the idea of tying bitcoin addresses to identities, as proposed by Coin Validation. The Foundation itself is unimpressed with the whole idea of making coins more identifiable.  “The Bitcoin Foundation does not support the use of money for identity tracking,” said spokesperson Jinyoung Englund this morning, hours before the Senate hearing started.  Tension and dissent  The most interesting part of this Senate hearing isn't really what’s happening inside the room. There, the community is simply trying to get regulators up to speed on bitcoin to avoid them taking any rash measures.  Instead, it's the tension and dissent in the larger bitcoin community that is perhaps most telling. On the one side, those trying to build large, ongoing businesses from bitcoin are doing their best to placate regulators by working with them to avoid commercial risk further down the line.  On the other side, we have a collection of users who point to the original ethos outlined in Satoshi's white paper. This faction is vehemently anti-central control, and will aggressively defend any attempt to impose such control on the currency.  And then, you have people like Roger Ver, who sits somewhere in the middle. Ver, aka the “Bitcoin Jesus,” has been an ardent defender of Silk Road on libertarian grounds. But he is also an investor in around a dozen bitcoin companies, many of which must dance toe to toe with regulators to succeed.  ""The approach I like the best is to comply with all the regulatory requirements, but point out every chance I get that the only reason I am complying is because these strangers, who I have never met, will hurt me if I don't comply,"" he says.  No matter what happens at these hearings, bitcoin will continue. The question is whether it continues unhindered in the US, or whether key tools like price discovery mechanisms move offshore, concludes Matonis.  ""There are not many available options when it comes to altering gravity,"" concluded Matonis. ""It would be akin to changing the trajectory of an incoming asteroid.""

42376706,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOYX,1384796046,Bitcoin Wallet App Developer Hive Purchases Android App Bridgewalker,"Hive, a company that has developed a stylized bitcoin wallet for Mac OS X, has acquired the Android bitcoin app Bridgewalker.  Bridgewalker  is a Euro-based platform for bitcoin designed with speed in mind. Some of its framework and design cues will be integrated into Hive's product strategy.  ""Basically, Bridgewalker will become part of Hive's offering. In addition, I will be joining the Hive team and initially focus on developing an Android port of Hive,"" says Jan Vornberger, the developer behind Bridgewalker.  The main attraction of Hive's wallet software on Apple's PC platform is its design. It's built to be attractive and usable for a non-technical crowd, an audience that has become increasingly interested in virtual currencies since they are becoming more valuable.  Although Hive is available for the Mac OS X PC operating system, Apple's behavior towards bitcoin apps for iOS is a foreboding sign for distributed electronic currencies on its mobile platform.  Bitcoin wallet and payment processor Coinbase, just weeks after releasing its first iPhone/iPad app, was unceremoniously removed from the Apple App Store last week.  One other app available for iOS that allows users to send and receive bitcoins is Gliph, which uses a messaging system that allows the attachment of bitcoin to messages. Gliph received $200,000 in venture capital funding back in September.  Vornberger believes that he can help bring Hive to Android, where his experience lies, and give it a great looking interface.  ""The first objective is to provide a bitcoin wallet for major platforms that really puts the focus on usability and looks great,"" he told CoinDesk.  ""Many of the wallets out there right now still cater to the more technical early adopters. We try to focus on the next wave of users and try to provide a good starting point and an easy-to-use interface for those newcomers.""  There are a number of bitcoin apps available for Android, and the popular Blockchain.info even has a wallet app on the platform.  In August, it was discovered that there was a flaw in Android that made bitcoin wallets vulnerable to theft. The vulnerability was patched by Google just a few days after it was discovered.  Vornberger, the Bridgewalker developer, says that his app will still be available while Hive's is being developed for Android.  ""Bridgewalker will continue to operate as an open beta and we will explore how to best integrate it into the Hive ecosystem down the line. It will be put a little bit on the back burner and the focus is on a pure bitcoin wallet for Android in the style of the Hive Mac OS X interface,"" he said.  ""It will be somewhat along those lines of the Mac app - not necessarily along the lines of Bridgewalker, but maybe some inspiration from there as well.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/18/bitcoin-wallet-app-developer-hive-purchases-android-app-bridgewalker,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7486963009ac8da7e2a96d7c4fcf80c1672aecc-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376694,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOOT,1384794926,Why China is Leading the Global Rise of Bitcoin,"The bitcoin story in China sounds like a mini-metaphor for the Chinese economy itself: while the rest of the world was looking elsewhere, its citizens worked to acquire vast amounts of new wealth before bursting into the headlines only recently as a superpower.  As of this November, China is home to the world’s largest-volume bitcoin exchange (BTC China), some of the largest mining operations, and could well be leading the global rise of bitcoin.  It was in May that China surpassed all other countries with 84,000 bitcoin wallet downloads, a world record few noticed.  Then came a half hour CCTV2 (Chinese state-owned television) documentary on digital currencies which sparked local interest, and even provoked a mining boom.  There was a gold rush as the Chinese tech community constructed mining rigs on a grand scale, paying $12,000-$15,000 for hardware and recouping their setup costs within a few weeks. Although increased difficulty means it’s now more a matter of months before breaking even, mining remains a popular pursuit.  China now also has the world’s second-highest number of bitcoin nodes according to Bitnodes, with 14,100 online in September 2013 (that’s 11.3% of the global total).  BTC China, world #1  China’s main exchange, BTC China, beat Mt. Gox and Bitstamp to become the world’s highest volume bitcoin exchange at the end of October. Also this week, BTC China secured $5m in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners' local arm Lightspeed China to expand its operations further.  Some 109,841 bitcoins changed hands in the week preceding 4th November, compared with Bitstamp’s 93,372 and Mt Gox’s 76,673. Unlike the world’s other large-volume exchanges, BTC China does not charge any transaction fees.  CEO Bobby Lee, a long-term resident of the US, returned to China a few years ago and joined BTC China in April 2013 to help bitcoin fulfill its promise in the world’s second largest economy.  He notes it was actually China that set the record for bitcoin value that month:    “The all-time high price record was set in mid-April, at CNY 1,944. Very few people know about this — our all-time high price equated to $308, whereas most media sources quote $265 as the all-time price (on MtGox/Bitstamp), back in mid-April.      So for a good 12+ hours back in April this year, people in China were trading bitcoin well above the $265 levels.”    BTC China then went on to surpass its own record with a CNY 1,978 value on 8th November 2013. At the time of writing, the value was CNY 2,726.01, or around $447.43.  At present, BTC China trades only Chinese currency* for bitcoins. Though the site has an English interface, limited access to that currency globally limits its user base to China residents.  A local view  One such resident is Zennon Kapron, a Shanghai-based Canadian bitcoin enthusiast who performs research and consulting to the financial technology world through his company Kapronasia.  He also writes regularly on Chinese business issues and delivered a presentation titled Bitcoin in China: Chomping at the Bit? at the recent Bitcoin Singapore 2013 conference.  To what does he attribute bitcoin’s popularity in China, and how could others benefit from it?  “There’s BTC China’s no-fee trading for starters. You can leave your money on the platform, your coins on the platform, and trade in and out for free,"" he said.  The entry and exit points aren't free, with a 0.5% Tenpay (China’s PayPal equivalent) cash in/out fee, and a 1% bank transfer fee.  Capital controls in China are strict. It’s easy to bring money into the country, but getting it out (to invest or spend) is more difficult. That means there are are plenty of wealthy Chinese citizens and residents looking to move their money around the world with greater freedom. Kapron explained:    “Some people have the equivalent of tens of millions in dollar-equivalent value in China and they want to get it out.      They want to send their children to school in Canada, the US, Australia. Wealthy families, new and old money — it's not a lack of trust in the local system, it's just a need to diversify their investments.""    China’s huge population is cash-heavy yet increasingly wired, he said. Domestic investment options are limited to stocks, property, and more property.  Kapronasia itself has separate entities registered in mainland China and Hong Kong, but even moving funds between the two is problematic. To do so in the fiat economy, one actually has to invoice the other and perform a currency conversion.  To test bitcoin’s efficiency Kapron bought 10 BTC in the US through Coinbase, sent it directly to BTC China and withdrew the money in CNY, which “takes 20 minutes or less once you know what you’re doing”.  ""I was shocked by how easy it was. The value was CNY 20,000 when I cashed in and CNY 30,000 when I cashed out because of bitcoin’s increase in value, so I made even more,"" he added.  Despite the increased trading activity and media hype, the story ‘on the ground’ in China is smaller-scale.  The only physical stores accepting bitcoin are a couple of enthusiast cafes in Beijing and, while about 134 individual sellers on Taobao (China’s answer to eBay) accept bitcoin, it is far from a popular payment option.  Kapron said:  “This is all being driven by a very very small part of the population. When I speak to other people they’re very interested and want to get involved, but they know nothing about it yet.""  You may or may not have heard, but China has been down the digital currency road before. Quite a way down, as it happens.  Q coin, a centralized digital currency controlled by instant messaging service QQ, became wildly popular in the mid 2000s with a trading volume equal to $60,000+ per day by 2007.  Government regulators stepped in, stamped down and severely limited its use, fearing it was being used for ‘black market transactions’ and money laundering.  Bitcoin may be bringing back memories of Q coin’s glory days: with a more user-friendly interface, and with government control restricted to fiat entry/exit points, it could give the Chinese a transaction method for which they’ve already shown a preference.  Publicity stunts  Kapron recently covered a story about local company Shanda, whose real estate arm promoted a recent upmarket condo development by announcing it would accept bitcoin as payment for property.  Whether the Shanda real estate deal was an authentic financial experiment or just a promotional gimmick is unknown; nor do we know how many people actually paid or part-paid for new apartments in bitcoin. But Shanda is primarily an IT company and its customers mainly young and tech-savvy professionals, so their choice of PR tool was an effective one.  Search giant Baidu’s ‘announcement’ it would start accepting bitcoin was a little underwhelming in reality: it was an unofficial statement by the company’s security software arm, perhaps also trying to create hype.  Chinese are still really into mining  “It’s also hard to tell exactly how much mining activity is coming out of China these days,” Kapron said. Shenzhen-based company Bitfountain is also a popular manufacturer of USB mining hardware worldwide.  “The numbers were pretty incredible when we looked into operations,” he said, adding:    ""Some were providing ‘hosted mining’ — renting out the space and equipment, or providing rental equipment for miners to host themselves.      Around April-May 2013, the fast payback (just a few weeks) from doing that was amazing.”    China’s challenges are your challenges  Bitcoin’s reputation in China faces the same hurdles as it does in other countries. There is software and security usability, public awareness and the threat of government attempts to intervene.  There are also the problems of inexperienced and rogue business elements jumping in to take advantage of the hype. Just last week, a (supposedly) Hong Kong-based exchange called GBL went missing in action, taking with it $4.1m in its customers’ wealth.  At the time of writing, BTC China’s rate was 1 BTC for CNY 2,972 ($487.84).  *CNY: the currency of China, also known as renminbi (RMB) or Chinese Yuan.

42376698,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOTV,1384784136,MatrixVision Wants to Make Bitcoin 'Cleaner Than Cash',"A new analytics service called MatrixVision aims to make bitcoin “cleaner than cash” for large trade volume enterprises, helping them to avoid association with illegal activity and stay on good terms with their partners in the traditional finance industry.  Bitcoin exchanges, payment processors and fund managers are seeing huge amounts of wealth pass through their servers.  As this rises even further, many are concerned not only that a proportion of this traffic could be the proceeds of illegal activity, but also about actions that could be taken against them by regulators and law enforcement should such evidence be found.  Regulators themselves have repeatedly warned bitcoin businesses they are viewed as money transmitters, requiring them to take steps to identify illegal activity and report it to the authorities. This might include evidence of money laundering, the proceeds of large-scale thefts, or regular suspicious trades.  MatrixVision wants to do exactly that: trawl all available information in the bitcoin block chain and real-world data, cross-referencing them using its custom matrices (hence the name) and providing a degree of extra visibility to stop criminals cashing out their funds at scale.  This enables businesses to work in jurisdictions where bitcoin use is either heavily regulated, or not at all. Users can take their suspicions to whichever local entity handles their entry and exit points to the fiat economy.  Tokyo-based CEO Marco Crispini says MatrixVision is designed to identify suspicious activity even when obfuscators like bitcoin ‘mixers’ and chains of different wallets are deployed to hide it.  “By analyzing all the information out there we’re able to compress the distance from source a money launderer attempts to create and see what’s suspicious anyway,” he said. “If you’re talking large amounts of money, there are many, many more data points for us to correlate.”  He added:  “We use all the obvious techniques like examining block chain data, and we cluster it based on certain attributes. Then there’s real-world information like a disconnect between a company’s official turnover and the amount of money they’re putting in and taking out of an exchange.”  Any financial services business dealing in large amounts of bitcoin will inevitably face dealing with the kind of clients it needs to avoid. 4,100 BTC ($1.2m at current values) recently disappeared from ‘secure’ wallet service Inputs.io, and evidence of that theft will forever exist in bitcoin’s permanent ledger in some form.  At some stage, the perpetrator will probably attempt make use of the proceeds, or may even attempt to cash out into fiat currency.  “Now if you’re another exchange out there, you don’t want to be anywhere near that money,” Crispini said.  He is quick to point out that MatrixVision does not ‘taint’ coins in any way — that is, leaving them with a permanent stain of criminal activity and cursing future innocent owners to harassment based on their money’s history.  It’s not his company’s mission to surveil or police the block chain – as a non-US business, his company will respond to appropriate subpoena but prevent governmental over-reach or 'data farming', he said.  Primarily, it aims to identify patterns to show businesses what percentage of their incoming funds could be the result of suspicious activity, and let them start asking more questions.  This would be preferable to the current ‘open door’ whereby criminals are free to cash-out at large scale without attracting much attention.  With government scrutiny increasing and a frustrating drip-feed of bitcoin theft stories in news headlines, the next wave of digital currency services will likely see more innovation in the analysis and due diligence fields.  There will be a number of different approaches offered, such as Coin Validation, which also launched recently.  “Some people have been incredulous as to how effective something like MatrixVision could be,” said Crispini.  He added:  “The truth is, you can’t identify every last item. But as a money transmitter you need to keep your head above water and take reasonable steps to avoid the proceeds of illegal activity simply by being able to identify it. It’s still up to the authorities to catch the criminals.”  Crispini describes himself as “libertarian but not anti-government"". ""The parts of government that stop drug cartels, human traffickers, the kind of groups who destroy people’s livelihoods and liberties, are useful in my view,” he said.  Originally from the UK, Crispini based himself in Japan to study Aikido and MMA, and because he simply “likes living here”. Having previously worked in healthcare imaging, he originally wanted to start a bitcoin exchange in the UK but found himself running up against the very problems MatrixVision now aims to solve.  “I started getting into bitcoin about a year ago and it quickly got all-consuming,” Crispini said. “I’m a big believer, but it needs to be more accessible, more mainstream. Bitcoin businesses do need some degree of regulation, and the ones dealing with huge amounts really need to have some peace of mind.”  Marco Crispini officially launched MatrixVision at the Bitcoin Singapore 2013 conference on Friday 15th November. The conference, featuring various bitcoin luminaries as speakers and panelists, focused on the rapidly growing bitcoin economy in the Asian region.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/18/matrixvision-wants-to-make-bitcoin-cleaner-than-cash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cf0d2e0f9b9631535c7c84a800663dd96ce861f-1000x742.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376693,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOND,1384780297,World's Largest Bitcoin Exchange BTC China Gets $5 Million in Funding,"The world’s largest-volume bitcoin exchange, BTC China, received a lift today with $5 million in Series A venture funding from institutional investors Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners.  BTC China surpassed both Mt. Gox and Bitstamp in trading volume and market liquidity within the past month, and now claims the highest number of registered users. It trades 90,000 bitcoins per day, totaling over CNY 200 million ($32.8 million) in transactions daily.  BTC China’s CEO and co-founder, Bobby Lee, praised Lightspeed’s track record and depth of knowledge in the bitcoin ecosystem:  “This investment is a huge endorsement to our team at BTC China, and will allow us to keep innovating, to become the best bitcoin company worldwide. We will continue to build the most reliable and secure bitcoin trading platform for the China market, to offer great customer service, and to have a global impact on bitcoins,” he said.  At the time of writing, 1 BTC was trading for CNY 3,900 (around $638) on BTC China and $608 on Mt. Gox. Prior to November 2013, BTC China actually held the record for highest bitcoin value, trading at CNY 1944 ($308) while the rest of the world was getting excited at Mt. Gox’s record $266.  The higher prices reflect the growing demand for bitcoin in China, with some suggesting that country is one of the forces driving the global value higher. A younger generation of wealthy and tech-friendly residents, hungry for investment opportunities beyond stocks and real estate, have been leaping in. Strict capital controls, especially on money leaving the country, make a global digital currency network attractive.  Should the value discrepancy between BTC China and other global exchanges continue, a possible opportunity for arbitrage exists for anyone able to access both. Fees of 1% to navigate fiat gateways at each end, however, might be enough to discourage the eager.  “The BTC China team is strong in terms of both technology and long-term vision,” said Managing Director and co-founder of Lightspeed China, Ron Cao.  “We think that under the leadership of the founding team, BTC China will continue to build out the Bitcoin ecosystem and bring more efficiency and value to the Chinese consumers, enterprises, and the overall financial services industry.”  [post-quote]  BTC China is China’s original bitcoin exchange, opening for business in June 2011. According to TechCrunch, it will use the $5 million injection to “aggressively grow and expand the business,” and for general operating expenses.  Unlike many other major digital currency exchanges BTC China, charges no transaction fees on trades within its system. At this stage it trades only in Chinese yuan (CNY; also known as renminbi, or RMB) and users must move cash in and out of the system using China-based payment services like Tenpay and bank transfers from local Chinese banks.  BTC China CEO Bobby Lee, who joined the company earlier this year, has long been a bridge between US and Chinese enterprise. The Stanford graduate has also been in senior management at Walmart China’s e-commerce arm, SMG’s BesTV New Media, EMC China, and worked at Yahoo! in Silicon Valley.  Lightspeed China Partners (LCP) has played a leading role in bringing Chinese startups onto the internet and mobile services stage. It focuses on early-stage funding and has venture-funded dozens of Chinese startups over the past decade, teaming up with Lightspeed Venture Partners (LVP) worldwide for international reach. LVP has branches in Silicon Valley, India and Israel and manages over $2 billion in committed capital.

42376691,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOKh,1384775830,French Sushi Shop Now Accepts Bitcoin,"A French sushi shop has become one of the first shops in the country to accept bitcoin.  Maki Wrap, an upmarket sushi takeaway that opened on 4th November, says it adopted bitcoin payments partly in protest at “excessive fees” levied by French banks on businesses.  The shop uses BitPay, with customers scanning a QR code to send their bitcoins – a similar setup to other businesses that accept bitcoin payments.  “It would be easier and much cheaper for us if all our customers could pay in bitcoin,” Maki Wrap CEO S de Lagarde told CoinDesk in an email. He asked that his first name be initialised.  Maki Wrap  uses an iPad as a cash register, making it easier to integrate bitcoin payments, and when their wallet reaches €20 worth of bitcoin, the money is transferred to their normal business account.  So far, the Lyon-based business has only had four bitcoin payments, but despite the small volume of bitcoin trade so far, de Lagarde is convinced of the currency’s potential.  He first began using bitcoin at the beginning of 2012, back when one bitcoin was worth less than $10. He said:  “I'm convinced that this kind of cryptocurrency is the future of payment. Bitcoin is one of the biggest inventions of our century.”  He sees it partly as a way to undermine the current status quo of the banking system: “[Accepting] bitcoin is also symbolic for us, in order to protest against French banks who are asking excessive fees, for payments and account holding.”  Like in other places, there haven’t been any regulatory barriers to accepting bitcoin payments, but de Lagarde says he is looking forward to working with the French government to define rules around bitcoin, pointing admiringly to the German government’s decision to recognise bitcoin as ""private money"".  However, the French government has taken some steps that put it ahead of other governments when it comes to bitcoin. In December 2012, Bitcoin-Central, a French bitcoin exchange operated by Paymium, was given approval by French regulators to operate like a bank.  The decision meant that Bitcoin-Central accounts under €100,000 were protected by French taxpayers and users could spend their bitcoins using a bank debit card.  In an announcement on the Bitcoin Talk forum  , a Paymium staff member said they had “raised the bar” for bitcoin exchanges.  Though Maki Wrap is one of the first food outlets in France to accept bitcoin, if not the first, some French businesses already accept bitcoin payments. A bed and breakfast in Paris lets visitors pay with bitcoin and a filmmaker also accepts bitcoin payments via their website.  Two more Maki Wrap outlets are on their way, says de Lagarde, and they will both also accept bitcoins. If you don’t like sushi rolls, the shops also sell salads and smoothies, plus the company is dedicated to making every aspect of their operations environmentally friendly.  What’s not to like? If you’re in Lyon, head over to Maki Wrap and drop some virtual currency.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/18/french-sushi-shop-now-accepts-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92dfc1681b86c449124858eae6ff5a36aaf5a8ba-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376687,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOIB,1384743609,Bitcoin Foundation Plays Down Silk Road Connection at Senate Hearing,"UPDATE: The full video of today's Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing can be viewed here.  ————————————————–  Even the title of Monday’s Senate Committee hearing on bitcoin reflects the overriding concern. “Beyond Silk Road – Potential Threats, Risks, and Promises of Virtual Currency” brings together several speakers from the government, industry, and non-profit sectors to give their opinions to the Senate’s Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs about the potential security risks of the cryptocurrency. Here is a roundup of what to expect from testimony given at the event.  Given the title, it’s perhaps unsurprising that Silk Road features heavily in some testimony. In particular, Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general for the US Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, uses it in his prepared statement as an example of why regulation of decentralized currencies should be ""sufficiently robust"".  Anonymity vs privacy  Silk Road  , the online black marketplace taken down by FBI investigators in October, highlights “challenges investigators face when they encounter these systems, some of which may ultimately require additional legal or regulatory tools,” Raman said, singling out the difficulty of accessing customer records as one of the most significant challenges facing law enforcers dealing with virtual currencies.  Ernie Allen, president and CEO of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, is also worried about anonymity in virtual currencies. In his testimony, he will voice his concerns over the use of virtual currencies including bitcoin for child pornography and sex trafficking payments.  “In our consultations with law enforcement worldwide, we have heard the argument that there is a difference between privacy and anonymity. Law enforcement leaders embrace the broadest possible privacy protections for individuals, but emphasize that absolute internet anonymity is a prescription for catastrophe,” he says. “Our challenge is to find the right balance.”  Other testimony challenged those concerns about anonymity, though. ""Anonymity is also a two-way street,"" says Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, in his prepared statement.  “A top dealer on Silk Road was actively working with federal law enforcement, the anonymity of Silk Road making it easier for them to make undercover drug deals and subsequent arrests,” he explains.  Murck also has some feedback for those that hold up Silk Road as an example of bitcoin’s dangers, cautioning against tying bitcoin and Silk Road too closely together. He cites the Genesis Block’s analysis of the contribution that Silk Road made to bitcoin pricing.  In late December 2010 and early 2011, people buying bitcoins to make Silk Road purchases may have spiked the price from $.30 up to $.80. The price was then boosted by mainstream media attention, before settling at around $5, he says. Further price spikes were unrelated to Silk Road, and even its takedown in October had little long-lasting effect.  “The less this colors public and policymaker assessments of Bitcoin, the better,” he argues in his testimony. “Criminals do turn the beneficial instruments of society to their ends. But overreacting to this simple and obvious fact because Bitcoin is exotic and new could delay Americans enjoyment of Bitcoin’s benefits, which are vastly greater than its potential costs.”  Decentralized vs centralized currencies  Jerry Brito  , a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and director of its Technology Policy Program, testifies that a decentralized currency like bitcoin would in any case be less appealing to online crooks than a centralized digital currency, like Liberty Reserve, which was taken down after its founders were arrested.  [post-quote]  “Serious criminals looking to hide their tracks are more likely to choose a centralized virtual currency run by an intermediary willing to lie to regulators for a fee, rather than a decentralized currency like bitcoin that, as a technical matter, must make a record of every transaction, even if pseudonymously,” Brito points out.  Brito compares centralized digital currency Liberty Reserve's estimated $6bn in crime-related revenues to under $200m in drug sales via Silk Road. He adjusts the Silk Road revenues down from the oft-quoted $1bn figure to reflect bitcoin value over the entire period.  At least one regulator seems sympathetic. FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery points out in her testimony that virtual currencies have yet to overtake more traditional methods to move funds internationally, whether for legitimate or criminal purposes.  “Any financial institution could be exploited for money laundering purposes,” she points out, adding, “While of growing concern, to date, virtual currencies have yet to overtake more traditional methods to move funds internationally, whether for legitimate or criminal purposes.”  Inter-departmental collaboration  FinCEN itself is hard at work, and several FinCEN virtual currency experts gave a comprehensive presentation on the topic to an audience of Federal and state bank examiners at an FFIEC Payment Systems Risk Conference, Calvery says, adding that the agency also works with the FBI, with the Treasury Cyber Working Group, and “a community of other financial intelligence units”.  This inter-departmental collaboration is an important strut of the government’s approach to law enforcement in virtual currency, says Raman, especially in the context of the Government’s Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime. The Department of Justice works closely with FinCEN and the State Department, and it was this relationship that enabled the co-ordinated targeting of Liberty Reserve, he says, adding:  “Such coordinated actions are integral tools in combating illicit finance. Investigations into illicit virtual currency businesses therefore often require considerable cooperation from international partners.”  He highlighted the fact that the Liberty Reserve takedown involved co-operation between 17 countries.  The Foundation is eager to talk up its relationship with regulators, even if Murck finds “details on which we might quibble,” such as the Foundation's desire for a notice-and-comment process before FinCEN issued its new virtual currency guidance in March. However, the Foundation has found federal regulators welcoming, on the whole, he says.  Harsh words for state regulators  He reserved harsh words for regulators at the state level, however, particularly calling out ""one state regulator"", which he said issued 22 subpoenas to bitcoin-related businesses, and made TV statements about ""narcoterrorism"". He’s referring to New York’s Department of Financial Services, who made that statement on the air.  “Irresponsible public statements like these make it more likely that legitimate bitcoin businesses will relocate to more welcoming countries,” Murck said.  However, he added that he saw positive signs among both state regulators and banking executives, indicating that greater understanding is coming.  Calvery echoed Murck’s conciliatory overtones, talking about an outreach effort to court the bitcoin community. FinCEN met with the Bitcoin Foundation in late August, and has invited it to present to a Congressionally-chartered forum, the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) scheduled for mid-December.  Jeremy Allaire  , founder of merchant payment services firm Circle Internet Financial, which recently received $9m in funding, also wants a collaborative approach to regulation. He identifies several dangers for an unregulated bitcoin community in his testimony, including tax dodging, fraud, and terrorism. Illiquidity and volatility are two other dangers, he warned, predicting wild price fluctuation if central banks and institutional investors are not able to act as market-makers in bitcoin.  “I believe we are at the forefront of another 20-year journey of Internet-led transformation, this time in our global financial systems, and the opportunity is to foster that economic change while simultaneously putting in place the safeguards that only government can enable,” he says.  The hearing happens at 3pm EST Monday 18th Nov and will be live streamed. Stay tuned to CoinDesk for more updates.
