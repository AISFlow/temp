42424884,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWtzh,1368648196,CloudHashing to offer Bitcoin Mining as a service - MaaS,"Fed up with waiting for ASIC mining rigs from suppliers who can’t deliver? Don’t want to spend money on a box that you have to power and maintain yourself?  Welcome to the world of Mining as a Service (Maas).  UK firm CloudHashing is offering users the chance to mine for bitcoins without buying any equipment. Just as companies in the software world began offering online Software as a Service (SaaS) contracts to customers who didn't want to invest in their own expensive servers, CloudHashing is trying to offer online mining services using ASIC equipment that it buys en masse. The firm will offer online mining capacity to users for as little as $150 a year, it promises.  The firm is offering two types of contract. The first, a one-year deal, costs $150, and yields 1Ghash/sec. The estimated payout is six bitcoins, of which the firm takes 10 percent, leaving the user 5.4 bitcoins. At today’s rate, that would equate to $640 in profit in a year’s time, or a 326 percent return. Returns are paid in bitcoins biweekly.  The alternative is an indefinite contract, which costs $246. This runs for as long as the user wants, and provides 1 Ghash/sec of compute power. With this type of contract, 30 percent of the return is reinvested in additional computing power, with another 10 percent going to CloudHashing and the rest paid back to the customer as profit. Returns are reinvested as soon as CloudHashing earns enough money to buy its next big mining rig.  The idea with the indefinite contract is to keep the customer’s investment growing along with CloudHashing. CloudHashing predicts a first-year payout estimate of six bitcoins per indefinite contract.  CloudHashing’s founder, Emmanuel Abiodun, who currently works full time as a software engineer for an investment bank, is basing the coin return forecast on predicted network terahash rates (one terahash is 1012 hashes). Currently, the Bitcoin network is running at 86 terahashes/sec. But Abiodun bases his expectations on a network hashrate of 180 Thashes/sec.  That’s a pretty hefty 110 percent increase in the available computing power on the bitcoin network.  Why would that happen? Because CloudHashing isn’t the only firm that will be introducing number-crunching ASICs into the network. Bitsyncom is set to start flooding the market with Avalon ASIC chips for others to build boards with using its OEM reference design, and Butterfly Labs hopes to start shipping soon too. ASIC Miner, which is already mining with its own ASICs, continues to add capacity.  CloudHashing initially expected to start its contracts in May, but now plans to begin them in July, following delays from Kansas-based Butterfly Labs, from which CloudHashing has purchased 6 Terahashes/sec of hardware. Abiodun offset the delay by purchasing boards from California-based Terrahash, based on the Avalon chip design. He is also in negotiation with KNC, which he says is pledging September delivery for its own ASIC products.  All of these manufacturers will host the ASIC rigs at their own facilities, meaning that CloudHashing doesn’t need a data center of its own. It really will be hashing in the cloud.  Customers who choose mining-as-a-service make several tradeoffs. On one hand, the cost per GHash/sec will be more than an outright hardware purchase. Butterfly Labs’ as-yet unavailable ASIC box offers 5Ghashes/sec for $274. This means that the capital expenditure on a MaaS contract is actually higher, which goes against traditional SaaS principles. Customers are also relying on CloudHashing’s own predictions about the network hash rate (and therefore the difficulty of mining bitcoins), and the return rate is not guaranteed. But then, that’s true for those people purchasing their own mining rigs, too.  So, where does the money go? It certainly isn’t into data center facilities, as CloudHashing doesn’t have any. But Abiodun says he has to factor contingencies into his margins. If the level of difficulty computing bitcoins spikes, for example, or a hardware supplier doesn’t deliver on time, it will force more capital expenditure on his part.  On the other hand, there are other benefits for customers, not least of which is being able to get in on the ASIC game early. Currently, ASICs are extremely hard to come by, and CloudHashing is near the top of Terrahash’s queue for Avalon-based boards.  “It’s an arms race,” says Abiodun.  Then there’s the capital expense. CloudHashing’s fees may be higher on a per-Ghash/sec basis than simply buying your own ASIC hardware, but ASIC rigs are costly because they’re so scarce. ASIC Miner’s castoffs are shipping on eBay for the equivalent of around $700 per Ghash/sec. And these are 10Ghash/sec boards, meaning that you’ll need around $7,000 to buy in.  Not buying the equipment directly also frees up customers from space and power requirements, and means that they can scale up their investment to keep pace with the network hash rate.  The firm has already taken $150,000 to 200,000 in contract orders from customers, and has spent $200,000 on equipment.  Abiodun says he plans to begin by joining an existing pool ... mostly likely the Eclipse Mining Corporation’s pool, which was run by Josh Zerkel before Zerkel became COO at Butterfly Labs. After a while, though, when everything is shown to be running smoothly, he will migrate off a third-party pool and concentrate on his own internal pool.  “If you have 5 percent of the network hash rate, there’s no real need,” he says, “but at the beginning it’s important to us to get it running smoothly.”  This is certainly the plan. In addition to the 6 Thash/sec of capacity from Butterfly Labs, it has bought 2 Thashes/sec of Avalon-based capacity from Terrahash, which will hopefully deliver in June. It is also hoping to add 20 Thash/sec from KNC Miner.  Abiodun is also in talks with a Canadian firm to make CloudHashing's own ASICs, which he hopes will free it from the constraints of other manufacturers and allow it to add more capacity far faster.  CloudHashing originally planned to start hashing at the end of May, but thanks to supply issues from Butterfly Labs this has been pushed back. If it can get the Avalon boards early enough from Terrahash, it will be able to start mining in late June. If it slips to July, it will add 50 percent hashing capability to its May contract holders, gratis, for the life of their contract. That's a sweet deal for those who opted for an indefinite contract, and illustrates how much headroom the firm has built into its margins for unexpected hiccups.

42424892,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWuBh,1368639429,Why are the feds seizing Mt. Gox and Dwolla funds?,"So exactly what is in that court order that the US Department of Homeland Security used this week to clamp down on Dwolla-Mt. Gox transactions? It appears the feds have decided there's reason to believe Mt. Gox and a subsidiary are operating as unlicensed money transmitting businesses in violation of US law.  Ars Technica  obtained a copy of the seizure warrant issued in US District Court in Maryland and signed by US Magistrate Judge Susan K. Gauvey.  The seven-page warrant cites an affidavit made by a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) stating there is probable cause to believe the contents of a specific Dwolla account are subject to seizure and forfeiture under US law. The warrant also reveals some of the background details leading up to Tuesday's halt to Dwolla-Mt. Gox transactions, including the use of a confidential informant who engaged in bitcoin trading over a period of six months.  ""Out of respect for the sensitivity of the issue and the two parties' legal responsibilities, we've been encouraging all interested parties to clarify or gather additional information from Mt. Gox and Homeland Security, this includes affected users,"" a Dwolla spokesperson reached for comment responded in an email Wednesday.  In the affidavit included in the federal warrant, the HSI agent refers to two applicable statutes of the law:  18 USC section 1960, which states, ""Whoever knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business, shall be fined in accordance with this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.""  18 USC section 981, which says the following properties are subject to forfeiture: ""Any property, real or personal, involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of section 1956, 1957, or 1960 of this title, or any property traceable to such property.""  The warrant signed by Judge Gauvey describes Mt. Gox -- the world's largest bitcoin exchange -- and a subsidiary company called Mutum Sigillum LLC. Mutum Sigillum, the warrant states, holds an account at Wells Fargo Bank that was established on May 20, 2011, and signed by one person: Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, also identified as the owner of both Mt. Gox and Mutum Sigillum.  In the paperwork to open that bank account, Karpeles allegedly stipulated that Mutum Sigillum was a business ""not engaged in money services.""  The warrant then notes that ""neither Mt. Gox nor the subsidiary, Mutum Sigillum LLC, is registered as a Money Service Business."" Such registration with FinCEN -- the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network -- is required for money transmitting businesses under US law.  A Maryland-based confidential informant -- referred to in the warrant as CI-1 -- told government agents he established new accounts with both Mt. Gox and Dwolla. The informant stated he deposited US funds in his Mt. Gox account, then used Dwolla to exchange those funds for bitcoins. He later used Mt. Gox to exchange the bitcoins back into US dollars, which were credited to his Dwolla account.  ""According to bank records, this transfer was completed through the subsidiary, Mutum Sigillum LLC,"" the warrant states. ""This demonstrates that Mutum Sigillum LLC is engaged in a money transmitting business but is not registered as required with FinCEN.""  Bank records showed that ""a number of deposits"" to Mutum Sigillum's Wells Fargo account were made via international wire transfers from Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Bank in the name of Mt. Gox. Afterward, those funds were ""frequently disbursed to Dwolla."" Because Mutum Sigillum transferred those funds without FinCEN registration as a money transmitting business, the contents of its Wells Fargo account ""were subject to seizure and forfeiture,"" the warrant states.  A seizure warrant for the Wells Fargo account was issued on May 9, 2013.  The seizure warrant issued on Tuesday, May 14, was for a Dwolla account registered in the name of Mutum Sigillum and held in the custody of Veridian Credit Union. That Dwolla account was ""the destination for the funds wired from the Wells Fargo account,"" the latest warrant states. Records indicate the Wells Fargo account was the only one funding the Dwolla account.  ""Therefore, it is evident that the Dwolla account was used exclusively to move funds between Mt. Gox and Mutum Sigillum and their customers,"" the warrant states. ""Consequently, there is probable cause to believe that Mt. Gox and Mutum Sigillum are using (the Dwolla account) to conduct transactions as part of an unlicensed money service business ... ""  No monetary amounts were stipulated in the warrant.  An ""unlicensed money transmitting business"" is defined as a business that affects interstate or foreign commerce and operating without an appropriate license to transfer funds ""on behalf of the public"".  According to the Dwolla spokesperson, Dwolla users have been sent the following message:  ""In summary: The Department of Homeland Security and US District Court for the District of Maryland issued a 'Seizure Warrant' for the funds associated with Mutum Sigillium's Dwolla account (aka Mt. Gox). In light of the court order, procured by the Department of Homeland Security, 1.) Dwolla has ceased all account activities associated with Dwolla services for Mutum Sigillum while 2.) Dwolla's holding partner transferred Mutum Sigillium’s balance to the proper authorities.  ""Dwolla requires a court order before honoring requests such as seizing funds or revoking access to an account.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/15/why-are-the-feds-seizing-mt-gox-and-dwolla-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/939b80abd1672d1af6d03d9aabda07a2db7b7da4-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A group of entrepreneurs is set to showcase one this week.  Robocoin Kiosk  , a machine that lets people buy and sell bitcoins, will be demonstrated at the Bitcoin 2013 conference this weekend.  The machine lets users insert dollars and then retrieve bitcoins by scanning a QR code with their bitcoin address. Alternatively, the Mt. Gox-linked device enables customers to redeem bitcoins for US dollars by scanning an address displayed on the kiosk's screen with their mobile wallet. They can then scan a receipt printed by the kiosk to collect the money. However, transaction processing for bitcoin sales can take around ten minutes, the web site says.  This isn't the only bitcoin ATM project out there. Coindesk previously reported on Bitcoin ATM, which was supposed to roll out in locations including San Diego, and Cyprus. However, co-founder Jeff Berwick publicly and acrimoniously split with the project, and its web site and Facebook page hasn't been updated in two weeks.

Or indeed Kim Dotcom recently arrested in New Zealand because his Megaupload site upset the US.  So it should come as no surprise to see US authorities taking action against US-based Dwolla. Nor that the action sends ripples through the market - Mt. Gox politely declined to talk to CoinDesk today citing advice from its lawyers. Exchanges are likely to be the first front line in this war - Bitcoin can survive for ever but will struggle for value if it cannot be converted into fiat currency.  A little history  The US government does not like its citizens betting on sports events. So it went after a London-listed company called Betonsports. In 2010 it went after individual staff members and arrested the company's chief executive David Carruthers while he changed planes at Dallas airport. Carruthers eventually copped a plea and got three years in prison.  Two years ago the US decided it didn't like online poker either and arrested 11 people working for sites offering the service. It also got fulltiltpoker.com closed down by authorities in Alderney - the Channel Island where the company was based.  Follow the money  The US has free access to the world's financial transactions in the name of fighting terrorism. It is likely that the US will claim terrorism and money laundering as the reason for its attack on Dwolla.  The ""Terrorist Finance Tracking Program"" operates via the SWIFT transaction network which is based in Belgium. It gives US spooks full access to all your banking transactions.  But like so much similar legislation it quickly crept far beyond fighting terrorism.  Last year US spies noticed a Danish gent called Torben Nødskouv had sent $20,000 to a German company in order to buy Cuban cigars - entirely legal under EU law. US authorities seized the money citing the US trade embargo with Cuba - an embargo which has no legal basis in Denmark, or Germany.  Despite appeals and complaints from Danish politicians Nødskouv did not get his money back, nor did he get any cigars. He had broken no laws but he lost his money.  Bitcoin companies might think they're smarter than the online gamblers and have better connected investors but US authorities have rules of their own.

42424906,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWuZh,1368607069,Homeland Security stops Dwolla transactions with Mt. Gox,"Users of the online payment network Dwolla began reporting Tuesday afternoon that an order from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was preventing them from transferring funds to and from Japan-based Mt. Gox, the world's largest bitcoin exchange.  Based in Des Moines, Iowa, Dwolla lets users send and receive money to and from their bank accounts without incurring costly transaction fees. Most Dwolla transactions are completed for a $0.25 fee, and many bitcoin buyers and traders use the service to send payments to Mt. Gox.  As of press time, Dwolla had not responded to an email inquiry from CoinDesk. Nor was there any information regarding the order on the DHS website.  Several hours after word of the court order began spreading online, Dwolla had still not posted any news about the situation on its website, Twitter feed or Facebook page. However, numerous users on the Bitcoin Forum and other sites posted a copy of the email they said they had received from Dwolla.  The email (see accompanying screenshot) stated:  ""As of 12:13 PM on 5/14/2013:  ""You’re receiving this notice because our systems have indicated that you’ve processed and completed a real-time Dwolla-to-Dwolla payment to Mutum Sigillum LLC (“Mt.

""Due to recent court orders received from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Dwolla is no longer legally able to service Mutum Sigillum LLC’s account.

""Note: Dwolla requires a court order before honoring requests such as seizing funds or revoking access to an account.  ""On behalf of Dwolla, we apologize for this inconvenience.""  Mt. Gox issued a statement on both its website and Facebook page. The Facebook statement read:  ""Like many who have contacted us, MtGox has read on the Internet that the United States Department of Homeland Security had a court order and/or warrant issued from the United States District Court in Maryland which it served upon the Dwolla mobile payment service with respect to accounts used for trading with MtGox. We take this information seriously. However, as of this time we have not been provided with a copy of the court order and/or warrant, and do not know its scope and/or the reasons for its issuance. MtGox is investigating and will provide further reports when additional information becomes known.""  Several posters on the Bitcoin Forum speculated the court order might have something to do with a federal lawsuit filed against Mt. Gox by CoinLab earlier this month. However, CoinLab's complaint was filed in Washington state, while the email to customers from Dwolla refers to the US District Court in Maryland.  Tuesday's developments also revived questions raised in 2011 about ""Mutum Sigillum LLC"". In its email to customers, Dwolla noted it is ""no longer legally able to service Mutum Sigillum LLC's account.""  Based in Newark, Delaware, Mutum Sigillum appears to have a relationship with Mt. Gox -- possibly as a partner of some kind allowing the Japan-based exchange to operate as a money business in the US, Bitcoin Forum members have theorized.  The Mutum Sigillum website shows no sign of any activity since April 1, 2009, when an update was posted reading, ""New service currently being beta-tested, more news coming soon."" The only other news item appearing on the home page refers to the Swell Project, a site that also appears to have been dormant for some time (with no updates since August of 2010).  To add yet another odd note to the circumstances, ""Mutum Sigillum"" means ""dumb seal"" in Latin.  Both Dwolla and Mt. Gox have been mentioned recently in the Department of Homeland Security's ""Daily Open Source Infrastructure Report."" Dwolla was named in an April 1, 2013, report about a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on the company on March 27; the report also mentions a March 29 DDoS attack on Mt. Gox.

42424888,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWu9h,1368594103,Today is D-day for bitcoin miner upgrades,"Today -- Wednesday, May 15 -- is the deadline for bitcoin miners and merchants to upgrade their bitcoin client or be left out of sync with the rest of the network.  The need for the upgrade stems from a ""hard fork"" that occurred in the bitcoin blockchain on March 11. That's when a miner running the then-newest version of the bitcoin client -- version 0.8.0 -- created a large block that was ""incompatible with earlier versions."" As a result, two divergent blockchains were created, posing a threat to the integrity of the bitcoin network.  A new version -- 0.8.1 -- has since been released that resolves the problem that led to the unusually large block. Bitcoin client users were given two months from the time of the fork to upgrade to the new version.  Gavin Andresen, lead developer for bitcoin and chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, described the hard fork situation on the Bitcoin Wiki:    ""A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an unexpected hard fork of the chain. The pre-0.8 incompatible chain at that point had around 60% of the hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve.      ""In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild and Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools would also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on the chain without the larger block. During this time there was at least one large double spend. However, it was done by someone experimenting to see if it was possible and was not intended to be malicious.""    Andresen added that ""the split was detected very quickly,"" with key participants on the network moving fast to resolve the fork.  After learning of the fork, Marek Palatinus of the Slush mining pool and Michael Marsee of the BTC Guild mining pool both downgraded their bitcoin nodes to the pre-0.8 version ""despite the fact that this caused them to sacrifice significant amounts of money and they were the ones running the bug-free version,"" according to Andresen.  Writing afterward on the Bitcoin Stack Exchange question-and-answer site, bitcoin fan Manish Jethani expressed concern about similar incidents occurring again in the future.  ""The next time there's a fork like this, it may not be so straightforward,"" Jethani wrote. ""The miners may not all agree on the proper resolution for the issue.""  A user named Charles Hoskinson responded that the most recent fork was ""special in that the 0.8 clients could never agree with the 0.7 clients due an issue processing a larger than normal transaction volume, but 0.7 clients still had 60% or so of the total hash power. In essence the network had two different legitimate bitcoins floating about.""  Hoskinson added, ""BTCGuild and Slush got to decide as they collectively control over 51% of the network's hash power. And also some people had to accept that the blocks in the orphan fork had to be lost for the good of Bitcoin. It isn't necessarily fair. It isn't fun. But Gavin and others handled it both quickly and transparently.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/05/15/today-is-d-day-for-bitcoin-miner-upgrades,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fa7d853d4946e6287f4126ed3994926714412e9-628x358.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
