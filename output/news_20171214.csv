42380125,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCMv,1513294214,"As Wall Street Bids Up Bitcoin, ICO Tactics Change","Dr. Paul Ennis is an assistant professor at The Centre for Innovation, Technology & Organization at University College Dublin, specializing in bitcoin and blockchain studies.      November was a tricky month for initial coin offerings (ICOs).  But one thing's for sure, the hype has most certainly cooled in an environment where Tezos has been beset by legal issues and Bancor by technical glitches, both reported by CNBC no less. Even more remarkable than the press attention, the report suggests, ""just 23 percent"" of ICO deals are now reaching their maximum goals.  This is no doubt linked to the bewildering array of ICOs currently on offer, all competing for the attention of investors at a time when simply holding bitcoin or one of the stronger alternative cryptocurrencies might be more appealing.  Furthermore, the ICO media-sphere remains immature, and this makes it difficult to assess what information is good or bad.  All told, this situation is particularly stressful for those ICOs that aim to avoid the hype cycle and operate cleanly. One recent ICO, Confideal, missed its target by a considerable amount, raising approximately 303 ETH ($160,000) of a projected target of 70,000 ether (roughly $35 million).  This was particularly frustrating for CEO Pyotr Belousov, who told CoinDesk that the market is ""full of startups who can't demonstrate any product or prototype, only a white paper and vague promises,"" noting that this ""reduces trust in all ICOs.""  It is an interesting phenomenon, then, that an ICO with a demonstrable product, in this case a functioning smart contract app, can get lost in the haze and effectively lose out to a hyped-up ICO running primarily on promotional steam.  Belousov has responded to this failure by taking a new strategy: the relaunched ICO will have a much lower cap, 5,000 ether, and it will target cryptocurrency whales and investment and hedge funds active in the space.  In other words, ICOs may look in the future to target large funds rather than rely on the collective power of smaller individual investors.  So many fish  The overall trend looks to center on how to distinguish one's ICO within the sea of generic options. One tactic is to avoid the ""ICO template"" website look that has dogged the area since its beginnings.  The aesthetic is no doubt familiar to us all, a white paper, a list of team members with minimal details and social media accounts with tumbleweeds passing through.  In response we are starting to see more visual creativity in the space, as in the bubbly aesthetic of ICOs such as CoinMetro. This shift is welcome, disrupting the empty slickness that has beset the space for quite some time. Another approach may simply be to aim exceptionally high (pardon the pun) – flying taxis in Dubai, courtesy of McFly anyone?  Perhaps one of the most significant, but under-the-radar, moves has been to capture big-name advisers, as in the case of NAGA, which has brought onboard no less a figure than ""Bitcoin Jesus"" himself, Roger Ver.  Ver told CoinDesk that he was “honored to be involved"" as an advisor to a company that ""shared his ideals.""  It is difficult to say whether these moves will pay off, though NAGA has currently raised a highly-respectable $17,165,44 for its pre-ICO at the time of writing, a number that outscales many actual ICOs at this point.  Goodbye Easy Street  ICOs, therefore, are coming to terms with reduced expectations. In short, they must now actively pursue an audience, rather than expect one to arrive passively.  However, this creates the right conditions for the differentiation of projects. The ideal outcome is that investors, as per the wishes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, become more discerning about their investments in ICOs, avoiding the potentially misleading celebrity endorsements in favor of a more investigative zeal.  It also puts pressure on ICOs to avoid lapsing into genericity, a vague landscape of future promise, a kind of crypto variation on vaporware.  Reuben Godfrey of Deep Green consultancy, who advises no less than 14 ICOs, told CoinDesk that he has seen subtle but important changes in the ICO ecosystem in this regard, with projects using the funding vehicle now having to work hard to make clear what they have to offer.  In other words, the days of simply assuming investors will buy up any token are gone and in their place we enter the era of the discerning ICO investor.

42380118,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCCr,1513290040,DOJ Alleges Bitcoin Involved in Attempted ISIS Funding,"A New York woman has been indicted for attempting to provide financial support to the ISIS terrorist grou in a scheme that prosecutors say involved the purchase of cryptocurrencies using fraudulently obtained credit cards.  Zoobia Shahnaz of Long Island, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York said today, has been charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of money laundering.  Though the indictment unsealed today makes no mention of the involvement of bitcoin directly, the office said in a press release that the funds she sent overseas – totaling more than $150,000 – were sourced in part from credit cards for which she fraudulently applied. Those cards were then used to purchase bitcoin and other unnamed cryptocurrencies, which were subsequently laundered back into the banks prior to being wired out.  Some of the funds were also generated through a fraudulently obtained loan, prosecutors said.  The office went on to explain:  ""[Shahnaz]...fraudulently applied for over a dozen credit cards, which she used to purchase approximately $62,000 in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies online. She then engaged in a pattern of financial activity, culminating in several wire transactions, totaling over $150,000, to individuals and apparent shell entities in Pakistan, China and Turkey. These transactions were designed to avoid transaction reporting requirements, conceal the identity, source and destination of the illicitly obtained monies, and, ultimately, benefit ISIS.""  Court documents name four banks – American Express Bank, Chase Bank, Discover Bank and TD Bank – that Shahnaz and a group of unnamed conspirators sought to use to transmit funds overseas. After the transactions were sent, according to the statement, Shahnaz was questioned by law enforcement while attempting to travel to Syria from New York.  At this time, it's unclear based on the available information if any bitcoin was sent overseas by Shahnaz.  If convicted on all charges, Shahnaz could be sentenced to as many as 90 years in prison, according to the attorney's office.

42380129,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCRx,1513285249,Goodbye Ethereum: Kik Plans to Move Its ICO Tokens to Stellar,"Mobile messaging startup Kik is planning to shift its Kin token network from ethereum to Stellar, CEO Ted Livingston confirmed on Wednesday.  Speaking in a live question-and-answer session on YouTube, the company's founder argued that ethereum's blockchain – which the app is presently based on – is unable to scale to the level that Kin needs, among other issues. The answer, he said, is to shift to the Stellar network, first unveiled in 2014 and created by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb.  Livingston went as far as to blast ethereum as ""the dial-up era of blockchain,"" noting that gas prices – which are needed to execute computations – and other transaction fees need to be built into the app to ensure users' transactions go through. Kik first announced it was contemplating a move onto another blockchain in October, stating that ethereum's scaling issues meant it ""might not be the right solution"" at the time.  In Wednesday's video, Livingston said Kin was pushing the limits of what ethereum could handle with its roughly 10,000 users. The network's reliability is another factor in the planned move, he said, pointing to recent network congestion as a result of the popular CryptoKitties app.  Livingston explained in the video:  ""Stellar was built by the guys at Ripple and the thing we like about it is it's custom-built for an application like Kin. It's not like ethereum where it's trying to be everything to everybody, and that makes it general-purpose and slow.""  Over the next few weeks, Kik will test Stellar's scalability and reliability, according to Livingston.  ""It's very focused on what it's trying to solve for: fast, reliable and inexpensive transactions for a lot of people,"" he said.  A Kik spokesperson told CoinDesk that a limited number of users would begin using the app by the end of December, which represents somewhat of a delay due to the CryptoKitties congestion.  Assuming the tests are successful, Livingston said he foresees a second-quarter rollout of the app, built on Stellar, to all users.  Brady Dale contributed reporting.

On Thursday, Bank Negara Malaysia announced the move in a release on its website, asking the public to weigh in on measures aimed at easing money laundering and terrorist financing concerns related to cryptocurrencies.  Following months of work in this area, the proposed regulations require businesses to verify their customers' identities, monitor transactions and report any suspicious activities to Malaysian authorities. Additionally, companies must report usage statistics to the central bank.  If approved, the regulations would apply to any person or company which exchanges cryptocurrency on behalf of someone else. And while the regulations acknowledge that companies might use cryptocurrencies, the nation officially still does not recognize them as legal tender.  The draft rules state:  ""Members of the public are therefore advised to undertake the necessary due diligence and assessment of the risks involved in dealing in digital currencies or with entities providing services associated with digital currencies.""  Bank Negara Malaysia is taking written feedback on the draft rules until Jan. 14, according to the release.  The regulations were explained by governor Muhammad Ibrahim last month as tools to prevent illicit money transmission. While the regulations will only apply to exchanges – ""which are being referred to as ""reporting institutions"" – the country's securities regulator is looking at creating a framework for cryptocurrencies in general as well.

42380132,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCQh,1513278028,Intel Sees Role for 'Blockchain Mining' in Genetic Sequencing,"A new patent application from Intel suggests that the tech giant is looking at ways to utilize the energy expended during cryptocurrency mining for the sequencing of genetic data.  In the patent application  , first filed June 2016 and released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, inventors Ned Smith and Rajesh Poornachandran describe a type of computer called a sequence mining platform (SMP) which would identify the order or nucleobases in a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA).  Nucleobases are the molecules that make up DNA and RNA, which contain the genetic information within every living organism on the planet. The order of these bases determines what physical traits a person, plant or animal features.  The patent application notes that the SMP would use a nucleobase sequencing unit to actually establish the order of nucleobases in a given sample, which would then be verified by the blockchain before being permanently recorded on it.  As the filing explains:  ""The present disclosure introduces methods and apparatuses for accomplishing additional useful work in conjunction with blockchain mining. In particular, as described in greater detail below, the present disclosure introduces methods and apparatuses for using data processing power of a data processing system to determine a sequence of nucleobases in a nucleic acid, and for then using the determined sequence of nucleobases as the basis for a [proof-of-work] for a new block for a blockchain.""  The combination of blockchain tech and genetic sequencing isn't exactly new, and cryptocurrency projects like genecoin have highlighted how the energy-intensive mining process (by which new transactions are added to a blockchain with new coins being minted as a reward) can be applied for scientific purposes.  According to Intel's application, proof-of-work algorithms ""make it impractical for an attacker or group of attackers to corrupt or hijack the blockchain.""  However, unlike POW systems used by the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains, the one mentioned in Intel’s proposed design would be multipurpose, as it would result in new blocks while simultaneously determining the genetic sequence from the data provided.  The POW algorithm would, therefore, be used to both identify the sequence and subsequently verify it, according to the application, and the sequence recorded on one block would be used as a base for the POW problems in the next block.

42380120,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCFN,1513270801,Yellowing Paper: What's Delaying a Crucial Ethereum Update?,"The technical paper that's meant to provide the definitive rules for all computers running ethereum's software is falling out of date.  Called the Yellow Paper, the document is what ethereum developers use as a reference when coding, and it's what clients rely on to stay on the same page with the network (without, say, creating bugs that could fracture it).  However, changes to the document haven't been made in over a year, putting a strain on efforts to further the capabilities of the world's second-largest blockchain by market value.  Instead of a clear-cut guide, developers must rely on ""community consensus"" to ensure things are functioning correctly, core developer Nick Johnson said at the recent meeting. And as the network struggles to keep up with adoption (see: CryptoKitties' popularity), the urgency for ethereum to adapt its code has perhaps never been so stark.  Indeed, with talk of possible fixes for network congestion growing, new attention is being paid to perceived issues with the Yellow Paper.  Aiding frustrations is that consensus bugs that emerged in the run-up to ethereum's recent hard fork upgrade – called Byzantium – might have been mitigated with a more accurate, cross-client reference point.  As Johnson said during the meeting:  ""If you want to build something that can sync the chain before the current hard fork, then you’re out of luck. You need to get out of bad information, and there’s actually no formal specification for that other than older versions of the Yellow Paper.""  Too much math  One of the issues with the current Yellow Paper is that it's expressed in mathematical notation, even though many developers would prefer a specific programming language.  Because of this, it has long been criticized as an unwelcoming starting point for ethereum newcomers. Core developer Piper Merriam, speaking at the meeting, said just that, contending that the Yellow Paper, as it's written today, vastly limits the number of people who can participate in ethereum development.  ""What it really comes down to is the ability to turn specs into that mathematical notation, which is something that I'm not an expert on – and I've got a math degree,"" he said.  Johnson also dismissed the document, calling it ""obscurantist and difficult to read"" and a ""bad description resource.""  On the phone with CoinDesk, he added, ""Very few people are significantly well-versed in the notation the Yellow Paper uses in order to make significant changes.""  Currently, developers are pointing to another document, KEVM, written in the programming language K, as a possible contemporary specification for ethereum.  While discussions have yet to formally begin with the current authors of the spec, Johnson described it as a ""promising route forward.""  Johnson concluded:  ""What I'd like to see is a more-approachable, but still well-defined and thorough specification that covers everything needed to build a new ethereum client from scratch.""  The gatekeeper  But until then, the document remains out of date, and despite the decentralized nature of the ethereum network, any updates must go through one individual.  This is because in its current state, the Yellow Paper is unlicensed software – which means its editorial rights divert to the listed author.  Specifically, that's Dr. Gavin Wood, Parity Technologies founder and co-founder of ethereum. Because he's the sole listed author, that makes him the key authority in its current state – but his efforts to improve the document seem to have come in fits and starts.  Earlier this year, Wood updated the document, but then shortly after, reverted back to the version of available in 2016. In a developer meeting in March, Ethereum Foundation engineer Yoichi Hirai said he had talked to Wood about the changes, and that Wood had reverted back only in an effort to correct mistakes before merging an update.  Since then, however, the Yellow Paper has seen no significant updates.  Because there's a total of 29 individuals who have contributed to the paper over time, Hirai, who has led the majority of attempted changes within the Yellow Paper repository, said, ""Legally, it's a big mixture of people.""  Speaking during the meeting last week, he added:  ""In its current status, it's very dangerous.""  Wood did not respond to several requests for comment.  Parity politics?  Less clear is Wood's role in any delay, an issue amplified by the fact that his departure from the Ethereum Foundation has long been dotted with conspiracy theories.  Amplifying perceived issues is that some feel ethereum's negative press this year all leads back to Wood. For example, the July hack of 150,000 ether (worth $30 million at the time) was due to an issue with Parity wallets, as was the recent fund freeze whereby a new coder ""accidentally"" initiated the lockdown of $275 million-worth of ether.  Plus, Wood has blocked efforts to change documentation in the past, according to Merriam, who pointed to Wood's former project CPP Ethereum.  In an effort to ""encourage the broadest possible adoption for ethereum"" last year, a copyright change was suggested for CPP ethereum – heralded as a way to make it legally possible for external projects, such as Hyperledger, to implement the code without licensing ambiguity.  That said, others believe it may simply be a sign of the fast pace of the technology's development.  ""I know that people have reached out to Gavin [Wood] about this issue, and he hasn't acted so far,"" Hudson Jameson, former communications lead for the Ethereum Foundation, said at the meeting.  Johnson, too, in interview with CoinDesk, said any attempts to suggest there's discord among developers aren't exactly accurate.  ""Based on my own issues on a smaller scale, I'd say there's a big chance he’s just busy and he hasn’t gotten around to it. I don't think there's any malign intent there,"" he said.  To Johnson, the issues are merely a sign a better solution is needed.  He concluded:  ""I do think we need a more decentralized process for managing the official standard.""

42380139,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCYF,1513264250,Up 50%: Ripple's XRP Sets Price Record Amid Overstretched Rally,"Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is scaling new heights today, but the rally looks overbought, according to price chart analysis.  XRP was last seen trading at a record high of $0.70 on data source CoinMarketCap, and has gained over 50 percent in the last 24 hours. Further, its market capitalization has jumped to $23.63 billion, making it the fourth largest cryptocurrency globally.  The token's six-month-long consolidation in the $0.15–$0.13 range ended with an upside break on Dec. 12 – seemingly due to increased demand for alternative cryptocurrencies as bitcoin passed over its recent record peak and started to appear overdone.  Possibly boosting sentiment for the network was the news earlier this week that banks in Japan and South Korea are set to test cross-border payments using Ripple-based systems. However, XRP itself is not being used in the trial.  South Korean markets, though, have certainly played a role in boosting XRP's price. A look at the individual markets on CoinMarketCap shows that trading volume on Bithumb, one of the largest exchanges in the country, has jumped 35 percent in the last 24 hours.  Clearly, the rally has substance, but it looks to be overstretched, as per technical analysis.  Ripple Chart (Bitfinex)  The above chart shows:  A bullish break of the sideways channel ($0.15–$0.30). As per the measured height method, the upside break on Dec. 12 opened doors for $0.45 levels (target as per the measured height method, i.e. range added to breakout price).  XRP rose to $0.45 yesterday (breakout target) and has extended gains to $0.65 levels today. Hence, the rally looks overstretched.  The relative strength index (RSI) also indicates overbought conditions.  View  The strong bullish momentum could push prices higher to $0.7255 (361.8 percent Fibonacci extension).  However, as noted, the rally looks to be overstretched, and there is some probability of a pullback to $0.50 (ascending trend line on 1-hour chart).

42380131,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCTD,1513260034,It's Time for Governments to Embrace Blockchain,"Marie Wieck is general manager at IBM Blockchain, where she focuses on driving ecosystem growth around the Hyperledger Project and delivering enterprise blockchain solutions.  This article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review opinion series.      Governments are custodians of their citizens' most precious information – their Social Security numbers, their tax information, their votes, their identities.  Now, a new technology is emerging that supports open government initiatives focused on unleashing innovation in the public sector. Using blockchain, governments can address the dual challenges of trust and transparency, and the need for data protection and privacy.  Citizens increasingly expect the same ease, efficiency and innovation from public services that they currently enjoy in the private sector. Conflicting data formats, longstanding interoperability challenges and a need to balance the benefits of openness against a need to protect privacy have made it difficult for governments to unleash the full potential of their data – until now.  Blockchain provides an immutable, transparent record of the truth, and it is changing how organizations carry out trusted transactions. Governments around the world are already exploring blockchain. For example, the U.S. state of Delaware is using blockchain to help companies incorporate.  Sweden is using the technology to test a land registry where property buyers and sellers, their banks and land registry authorities can all view and approve transactions on a blockchain in real time.  Dubai has set the ambitious goal of running its entire government on blockchain by 2020, digitizing all public documents onto this ledger to speed and increase capacity for new transactions.  Estonia has been heralded as the first government to embrace blockchain, initially with a focus on cybersecurity, but now also for citizen services like e-voting.  China put a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and has been questioning the use of blockchain with respect to cryptocurrencies, but is more positive about its other, non-currency, use cases.  Japan has sanctioned the use of bitcoin and is looking at the opportunity for its own digital currency while Venezuela recently launched a crytopcurrency in an attempt to circumvent financial blockades.  The U.S. has convened a summit on the subject of blockchain, and the recent approval of the defense spending bill includes provisions for modernizing government technology specifically allowing for the exploration of blockchain.  Tip of the iceberg  These examples, however, are just the beginning.  2018, IBM believes, will be the year blockchain becomes an accepted and appreciated innovation for government, a year when the global public sector begins to look closely at this technology and a year when citizens begin to see its effects on the issues that affect them.  The fact is, blockchain is coming to the public sector.  This is revealed in a survey conducted by the IBM Institute for Business Value of more than 200 regulators in 16 countries focused on building trust in government and reducing bureaucracy. Among those regulators, 14 percent surveyed were already ""explorers"" with blockchain pilots in progress, and a full 90 percent had plans to do so in 2018.  The top use cases that interested regulators most were not around cryptocurrencies. They were interested in using blockchain to increase collaboration and innovation. Top projects included asset management, digital identity services and reducing the costs of regulatory compliance and citizen services like e-voting.  This amplifies the notion of open government initiatives as an area where blockchain is particularly well suited, such as protecting sensitive data while facilitating approved access where needed.  Pressing questions  With the onslaught of government regulators set to initiate blockchain pilots in the coming year, here are three questions they should consider:  1) What type of permission do government blockchain networks require?  Most of the questions on which blockchain technology to use center on a debate of whether they are public or private blockchains. The better question to ask is whether these are permissioned or anonymous blockchain networks. In permissioned networks, members are known and assigned various levels of permission based on their role in the network.  Contrast this to anonymous blockchain networks where participants are unknown and access is completely open. Most governments and other organizations clearly need a permissioned system that requires consent for use of the information on the network.  2) What’s the best way to get started? Don't wait for new policies to be introduced, set the policy through experience with initial pilots. Blockchain is still an emerging technology.  Understand how smart contracts work and the role they can play in helping with regulatory compliance. Explore key participants in the network and how their roles differ. How can regulators, auditors, service providers, the private sector and other agencies engage?  Picking a starting point and pivoting quickly on feedback from participants is essential. This will also build skills in the expanding blockchain ecosystem.  3) How does the circle of trust expand? The value of blockchain networks increases as they expand. A key question for regulators is how that value might expand beyond geographic boundaries. Most commercial networks cannot be constrained by national borders.  Rather than fight for data locality and data sovereignty, are there broader benefits that come from sharing data with others? Addressing critical global issues like refugee aid efforts, tracking data on potential health epidemics, or combating terrorism, would all benefit from international standards and cooperation.  The time is now  Blockchain’s potential to support trust and transparency, data protection and privacy has been well established in 2017. While we've already seen positive benefits from blockchain, the opportunity is even greater when expanded to open government.  IBM believes that one day, just as the internet became the business standard of communication, blockchain will be how all of us share and verify data.  Government can – and should – help lead that revolution.  Disagree? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.

42380136,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCZV,1513256406,Bitcoin Looks Lower In Chase for 'Small Cap' Gains,"Bitcoin is looking heavy today after failing to see a decisive move higher in the last 24 hours.  While bitcoin (BTC) clocked a lifetime high of $17,631.42 just two days ago, it has since retreated to sub-$17,000 levels, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $16,628. As per CoinMarketCap, BTC has depreciated by 2.0 percent in the last 24 hours, though it is still up 8 percent over the last 7 days.  The slow descent in prices is possibly due to alternative currencies garnering more attention from traders and investors. For example, ether has jumped 12 percent in the last 24 hours to a new record high of $747.59. Bitcoin cash and ripple have also appreciated notably – by 24 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  Parallels could be drawn between the action seen in the cryptocurrency over the last few weeks and the behavior in the stock markets.  Major equity indices are usually the first to rally. Once the large-cap valuations look overstretched, investors tend to rotate money out of large caps and into small caps. Investors who missed the bus, also chase the relatively undervalued small-cap stocks. Thus, non-index stocks/small caps begin rising after a rally in the index stocks looks overdone.  On similar lines, the signs of weakness in BTC could be due to investors chasing the small-cap cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin rallied sharply from its Sep. 15 low below $3,000 to the recent record high of $17,631.42. Comments on social media indicate a growing concern among investors over the pace of ascent in BTC prices.  Hence, new buyers could continue to focus on other options in the short-run, leading to a correction in BTC prices. The price chart analysis also points to increased odds of a pullback.  BPI chart  The above chart shows:  Rounding top pattern  Head-and-shoulders breakdown.  Both features indicate a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  As per the measured height method, the head-and-shoulders breakdown has opened the doors for a drop to $15,350 levels.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows a bearish doji reversal (marked by circles) followed by a falling, descending top pattern (as indicated by a falling trend line).  View  As per the 4-hour chart (BTC/USD), the cryptocurrency looks set to test $15,884 (confluence of the ascending 50-moving average and the rising trend line).  On the higher side, only a move above $17,746 would signal a revival of the bull run. In that case, the cryptocurrency could attack $19,697 (Dec. 7 high) and possibly $20,000 levels.

42380119,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCE7,1513253703,Court Approves U.S. Extradition for Alleged BTC-e Operator,"A Greek court has given the green light for the extradition of alleged bitcoin money launderer Alexander Vinnik to the U.S.  Said to be the former operator of defunct bitcoin exchange BTC-e, Vinnik is wanted by authorities in both Russia and the U.S. on different charges. As previously reported by CoinDesk, Vinnik had appealed to the court to be extradited to his native Russia where he faces lesser fraud charges. He has also denied his role as the operator of BTC-e, claiming he had merely worked as a technician at the exchange.  According to Reuters, the Greek supreme court yesterday rejected his appeal that he be returned to Russia. It is now up to the Greek justice minister to make the final decision on the matter, according to the news source.  Russia has previously criticized the decision to comply with the U.S.'s request for extradition. The county's Ministry for Foreign Affairs said at the time that it ""noted with regret"" that the court had opted not to return Vinnik to Russia.  Vinnik was arrested in Greece in late July, accused of laundering billions of dollars in bitcoin through BTC-e.  In July, international law enforcement officials moved to shutter the BTC-e exchange, with U.S. prosecutors later unveiling a number of charges against both BTC-e and Vinnik, while a $110 million fine was handed down from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  By September, the platform had gone back online, and claimed that it would refund users who lost money in the raids. Later that month, its operators launched a new exchange platform called WEX.

The widespread operation is being carried out over suspicions of tax evasion by exchange customers, the Press Trust of India states. The agency visited nine cryptocurrency exchanges in cities including Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi.  According to tax department officials, the surveys – conducted under section 133A of the Indian Income Tax Act – were performed in order to collect the identities of digital currency investors, their transactions, the bank accounts used, emails, and other data.  The survey teams were reportedly armed with an assortment of software tools to capture exchange data, including ""cloning and mirror imaging,"" and identified the accounts of a number of high-net-worth individuals.  A senior official at the department was cited as saying:  ""Out of these, about 8-10 lakh [800,000-1,000,000] entities would be active for transactions. However, the operations are still on and final findings will emerge later.""

42400791,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKh0o,1513242049,Out With the Old? Blockchain Requires a New Regulatory Approach,"Eva A. Kaili is a member of the European Parliament, where she chairs the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) panel aimed at assessing AI, fintech and blockchain.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      The internet is once more in a period of transition.  The ""cloud era"" that served consumers and firms so well so far, little by little, gives its place to the ""era of decentralization,"" or the era wherein the end-users of computers will not only own and manage their hardware in a decentralized way, but also own and manage their own data in a decentralized way.  DLT is the technology that will enable this transition.  Neither an infant nor an adult, the technology is like a teenager who has already shown strong potential and raised great expectations. But, as it happens with all the teenagers, in order to materialize their potential, they need a disciplined framework, some boost of confidence, a feeling of certainty and the wisest possible direction when necessary.  In the case of a technology, this role is played by the enthusiasts who adopt it and those who resist it. Resistance to the technology is not bad or negative. Historical experience has proved that in the course of time resistance was undeniably essential in advancing a technology and making it useful.  In the case of DLTs, we see real enthusiasm, but we also see resistance coming from incumbents and traditional players and business models.  We can see the potential in every sector for the users both in their capacity as consumers, but also as citizens. I will not repeat the benefits of DLTs here. The market has already unveiled a lot of them, and many more are yet to come.  Moreover, it is not necessary to stress the disruptive impact of disintermediation. Emerging business models democratize the value chains, remove transaction costs, optimize the allocation of resources and risks, expand the social inclusion and improve the quality of services and products we receive as customers and as citizens.  We, as ""blockchain evangelists"" contaminate our enthusiasm and faith, while startupers all over the world tirelessly produce fantastic white papers and make radical value propositions and more and more governmental institutions respond to the new challenges, sometimes reluctantly and sometimes bravely.  Level playing field  So far, the European Union has had an enthusiastic approach.  I have the honor to be the rapporteur of the first Blockchain Resolution of the European Parliament, and my task is more or less to propose a framework of rules that can be adopted as the regulatory basis in the EU area.  Moving from the role of the believer to the role of the regulator is really challenging. It is challenging because suddenly my job is not to convey to others the benefits of blockchain, but to create a pathway that will allow us to go there as fast as possible with the least possible frictions and U-turns.  The first requirement is to create a level playing field for both DLT firms and consumers that guarantees legal and institutional certainty.  Without certainty, we cannot have the required scalability for the technology. Moreover, institutional and legal certainty, at a European Union level, has to be harmonized.  Otherwise, a regulatory fragmentation will create frictions that can kill the smaller firms. This is the reason why we need some level of standardization and a flexible but functional policy of EU-passport for blockchain products and services.  Strong foundation  For me, blockchain is not just a beautiful technology. It is an infrastructure. It is capacity building. Thus, standardization is not just a vehicle of cross-border business activity. It is also a prerequisite for infrastructure interoperability.  There are thousands of platform options and nobody knows how many DLT alternatives and business models. The question is: How will this constellation of DLT ecosystems work together?  In my view as a regulator, linking scalability with interoperability is strategically critical.  Standardization can be simple or complicated. I have a proportional attitude toward this issue. Given that we cannot regulate a technology as such, the level of standardization should be proportional to the principle of innovation. This means that we cannot regulate a technology that is still evolving. Let the innovation deliver its fruits first.  A corollary principle is that regulation must be technology neutral. For example, a cryptocurrency should be considered as a means of payment, not a means of exchange.  The third regulatory principle is that the regulator must be business model neutral. For example, in the case of payments, the KYC requirements for a bank cannot be less strict than they would be for a non-bank firm.  No cookie cutter  When we say standardization, we must ask about what we are standardizing.  Well, based on the use-cases that have reached a trustworthy level of maturity, I believe that having an idea of some limited standards about identity, smart contracts, data protection and cybersecurity, would be very useful for both firms and consumers.  Obviously, the aforementioned regulatory principles and approach betray the preference of the regulator to introduce a framework with impact. To have impact, you need to go further than a ""light touch"" approach. We need smart regulation and smart regulation is not necessarily a regulation that parcels new ideas in old regulatory boxes.  New challenges require new definitions, new categorizations and some sort of creativity. Thus, a smart regulation is the regulation that fit the purpose we have in our mind.  To make this statement obvious look at the discussion about ICOs. There is a very interesting debate that tries to resolve the problem of what an ICO is – is it a security or a commodity? The immature U.S. regulator defines it as a security.  In Europe, we believe that this old regulatory box does not fit with what we actually have before us. Why must an ICO be defined as a security or a commodity? An ICO is an ICO, and we need a certain enabling regulation that will help firms to expand their crowdfunding activities and at the same time, the investors to feel comfortable with it.  The regulator must be generous with a new technology, for example through the creation of regulatory sandboxes, and this is my attitude toward DLTs.  Regulatory generosity is critical in the early stages of a technology because it will allow the emerging business models to move fast from a ""proof-of-concept"" mentality to a “delivery of quantitative and qualitative results” stage.  Only then we can see the actual impact of the technology on the markets and society as a whole.  Charting the way  To sum up, EU institutions have taken a positive approach, but this is by necessity a multi-level approach.  Different directorates of the European Commission have different concerns. Other directorates are concerned with the infrastructure dimension of the DLTs, others with the financial impacts and the market structure, others with the social impact on employment and the quality of democracy.  In the European Parliament, I will try to remove any fragmentation and provide a ""global view"" on the subject for the EU.  Blockchain is a highly political subject. It is not economical. It is not about speculators making money, but about reinventing the concept of trust in a period where our societies need trust more than ever to maintain and improve social coherence.  By necessity, blockchain is an exercise of institutional transformation in which no citizen and no politician can stay indifferent.  Blockchain requires our care.

Along with Tsinghua University National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce Technologies and IBM, the four parties have created the Blockchain Food Safety Alliance, which will seek to connect businesses along the food supply chain within the world's most populous country.  The idea, according to statements, is to develop ""a standards-based method of collecting data about the origin, safety and authenticity of food"" among the parties involved, with blockchain serving as a technological basis for recording that information in real time.  For Walmart, the effort represents an expansion of its previous work in the food supply chain area. In October 2016, the retailer unveiled that it was working with Tsinghua and IBM in an effort to track pork products, a process that the company called ""very encouraging"" during a presentation earlier this year.  ""As a global advocate for enhanced food safety, Walmart looks forward to deepening our work with IBM, Tsinghua University, JD and others throughout the food supply chain. Through collaboration, standardization, and adoption of new and innovative technologies, we can effectively improve traceability and transparency and help ensure the global food system remains safe for all,"" Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety and health for Walmart, said of the new group.  The inclusion of JD.com – a business-to-consumer e-commerce platform that claimed more than 200 million users as of September – is a notable one, given its overall footprint in China.  And reports that JD.com intends to import billions of dollars worth of food over the next several years would, in theory, create a large inventory of products to track.  ""Throughout the world, and particularly in China, consumers increasingly want to know how their food is sourced, and JD is dedicated to using technology to promote complete transparency,"" Yongli Yu, president of JD's supply chain research unit, said in a statement.

42400773,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKgo1,1513217124,Plan B? Ethereum Innovators Are Reviving the Fight for Net Neutrality,"A tech meetup at a dimly lit New York City bar – so far, nothing out of the ordinary.  But what's peculiar about this particular meetup is that other locations throughout the East Village are being connected to the bar's Wi-Fi-enabled node, allowing anyone in the area to not only piggyback off all the signals but visit websites only accessible to others on the network.  Called a mesh network, it's a decades-old technology allowing users to surf the internet without using a traditional internet service provider (ISP), and it could be finding new life among blockchain enthusiasts as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gears up to repeal ""net neutrality"" on Thursday.  Net neutrality, or the rules that ensure equal access to the internet, have historically outlawed ISPs from charging internet users more for better service, and its repeal, in many people's eyes, would result in lower quality service for the average internet user.  But, according to those at the event, the FCC decision could indirectly act as a tipping point that jump-starts a new wave of innovation for mesh networks.  Karl Floersch, an ethereum developer and Casper researcher, told CoinDesk:  ""If we get some crazy net neutrality regulation, then they can expect a crazy mesh-network fire-back.""  And it's already started.  After years of grassroots efforts, the donor-supported NYC Mesh network has organically growth to 70 nodes. But a significant number of the 50 meetup attendees were new to the scene and brought with them new ideas about how to incentivize the network's growth.  Ethereum to the rescue  Case in point, Floersch thinks ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain by market size, could be of help.  Floersch supports the idea that if net neutrality is abolished, blockchain technology could be used to disrupt the middlemen who currently provider service — Verizon, AT&T and Comcast, and the likes.  He described an ethereum-based system that runs ""in the background"" of any mobile device. Using an interconnected series of smart contracts, the mobile device could theoretically be turned into a Wi-Fi enabled ""node,"" helping expand the mesh network's reach.  And all this could be incentivized with a blockchain-based ""meshcoin.""  ""Ethereum and mesh networks are a fantastic combination,"" Floersch said, adding:  ""Ethereum will allow for the kind of payment back-end which makes a mesh network scalable.""  While Floersch's interest remains more theoretical, ethereum programmer Hayden Adams, also at the event, said he's actively looking into how the meshcoin concept would operate.  Founder of Ethereum Programming Services LLC, Adams told CoinDesk this is the perfect time for the concept to take off, since off-chain scaling solutions for ethereum are on the cusp, he believes, of making significant breakthroughs.  While Floersch mentioned state channels, Adams added the recently announced Plasma scaling solution to the list of technologies that could help reinvent the NYC Mesh's incentive scheme, as well as those in mesh networks around the world.  Of the countless mesh networks growing around the world, the largest among them, in Catalonia, now lists more than 37,000 active nodes. To pay for all this, most are donor supported, and some have set up foundationshttps://fundacio.guifi.net/Foundation.  For example, NYC Mesh is funded largely through donations, including a $30,000 grant from the non-profit Internet Society. But going forward, Adams believes either an ethereum-based token — or ether itself — could be used to allow users on the mesh network to pay peers for bandwidth.  ""If you wanted to take it to a broader scale, you'd need to add some sustainability to it, and I think that could come through a blockchain system,"" Adams said.  Challenges ahead  In spite of the all the promise though, one of NYC Mesh's most influential advocates remains skeptical about blockchain's usefulness.  Since 2015, software engineer Brian Hall has been helping his neighbors install the hardware required to become a mesh node, and while he's read a handful of white papers detailing blockchain's promise for mesh, he's yet to see any hardware running on blockchain software.  In a blog post  earlier this month, Hall detailed a number of reasons why he believes the meshcoin concept, and seven other projects that are trying to blend blockchain and mesh, are misguided.  He argues all these projects fail to adequately understand two things — first, mesh nodes have to be in geographically close proximity to one another, unlike blockchain nodes, and second, growing these networks requires huge amounts of social capital to gain adopters.  ""Ninety percent of the work is a social problem,"" he said. ""And that's kind of left out of all these meshcoin ideas.""  Yet, Floersch and Adams argue that social component is exactly where crypto-token incentives could help.  Mesh networks date all the way back to the late 1990s when the internet itself was beginning to gain widespread adoption. And since then small, committed communities have formed around the mesh network principles of decentralization and privacy, and even proven their ability to innovate in the face of competition.  It's emergence and rise definitely feels similar to that of cryptocurrency, and Hall agrees, even though skepticism lingers.  ""Practically, all of the tech people interested in mesh have an interest in cryptocurrencies, and I do too,"" he said, concluding with ardent advice:  ""Forget the white papers, make a prototype, get three routers and get something running. We're over the white paper phase of this thing.""
