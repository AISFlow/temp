Saffron fraudulently solicited funds from at least 14 individuals to participate in an investment pool operated by Circle Society, making false claims about his trading expertise and “guaranteeing” gains of up to 300%.  Saffron used those funds – diverted to his own crypto wallet – to pay other participants, “in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.”  The court’s final judgment requires defendants Saffron and Circle Society, jointly and severally, to pay restitution of $14,841,280 to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of $15,815,967, and a civil monetary penalty of $1,484,128.

After two days of losses, bitcoin ended Thursday in the green after markets closed in the U.S.      The gains came amid new signs of growing mainstream adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.      State Street, the second-oldest bank in the U.S. with $3.1 trillion in assets under management, announced it is providing the infrastructure for a new bank-grade trading platform for digital assets set to go live mid-year – and that it might eventually use the system itself.

Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, said on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover"" show that “relatively little” ether (ETH) was bought at prices above $1,850 and even less was bought at $2,000 or above.      “The reason why this is important is because the price that people are willing to buy and hold at tells us the level of demand that there is at that price level,” Gradwell said. “So not a huge amount of demand at that $2,000 price.”      As of April 5, blockchain data showed there was significant ether accumulation at prices around $1,800, Gradwell wrote this week in a newsletter. That price level is likely to provide strong support because the cost of acquisition indicates historical demand for a cryptocurrency at different price levels. The analysis assumes that the buyers are unlikely to sell their crypto asset at prices below their cost of acquisition.      Only about 700,000 ETH were acquired at or above $1,850, costing around $1.4 billion on April 5, three days after ether logged a new all-time high price, Gradwell wrote. By contrast, on March 29 – two weeks after bitcoin's price peaked – 238,000 BTC costing about $14 billion were acquired at or above $57,000.      The latest “all-time high [ether] price of $2,151 was some way above a large level of support, and suggests that the peak was driven by a relatively small amount of demand,” Gradwell wrote. “This is in contrast to bitcoin, which had greater prior demand across high price levels.”      The chart below, from Gradwell’s newsletter on April 1, also shows that 0.1 million bitcoin were acquired at prices higher than the spot price on March 29:    The human bias    The exercise highlights the limits of using blockchain data to analyze market movements: While the data can offer extra transparency, helping investors and traders understand where cryptocurrency is moving on the networks, the data can also be misleading, relying on humans for the interpretation as well as assumptions about investor psychology. .      Gradwell said on CoinDesk TV that his analysis included some potential “downward biases,” which could skew ether’s supporting price level on the lower end.      The analysis didn’t capture the prices of sales and trades made on centralized exchanges.      But Gradwell argued that with the increased shift of ether trading to decentralized finance (DeFi), which is trackable on the blockchain, he is “not worried about such downward bias.”      At the same time, Gradwell’s analysis also flattens the cost curve of entities that acquired ether at different prices, which may skew the supporting price level lower.      “Large entities, such as DeFi contracts, tend to hold lots of ETH acquired at both low and high costs,” he wrote in the newsletter. “For example, 7.4 million ETH with an average cost of acquisition of $1,818 is held in the wrapped ether contracts.”      On the upward bias side, CoinDesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn said on the CoinDesk TV show that Gradwell’s analysis is based on an assumption that people would not sell their ether at a loss. If ether holders are willing to sell their ether at a loss, it means that the $1,800 supporting level may be less strong than expected.      Gradwell said a majority of investors who bought ether at its peak price in 2018 sold their ether at a loss, while more bitcoin holders at the time continued to hold their bitcoin throughout the bear market.      “The persistence of a small, but very bullish, cohort of ether buyers supports my concern that the highest ether prices tend to have a narrow base of support, at least compared to bitcoin,” Gradwell wrote.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/08/ethers-record-run-came-with-less-support-than-bitcoins-blockchain-analysis-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c59c3d39a92491517db1f7d94012634d5af0401-1200x783.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434167,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8afh,1617910674,Meet the 'Meme Manager' Bringing the Legacy Web Into NFTs,"Ben Lashes wants to represent your cat. Or he probably would if your feline companion has gone viral on the web – like Nyan, Grumpy and Keyboard. For over a decade, Lashes has run a meme management business to help creators print money from the happy accident that is going viral. And, of course, he’s getting into NFTs.      Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the latest, buzziest galaxy of the cryptoverse. These unique and digitally signed assets provide a way to make the things that appear online scarce, and therefore valuable. Already topping some $250 million (at last count) in represented value, NFTs could find use for anything from art to mortgages, and event tickets to in-game goods.      NFT technology has found particular use with memes. Beginning with the tokenization and sale of Nyan Cat in late February, a rash of meme creators has looked to monetize their work. An NFT of Overly Attached Girlfriend recently sold for $411,000 while one of Bad Luck Brian brought in $36,000. There have been dozens of others, with many more “drops” planned.      Thought to be the world’s first “meme agent,” Lashes has worked with the artists behind some of the internet’s most recognizable image macros. This includes: Doge, Success Kid, Scumbag Steve, Ermagherd, the Ridiculously Photogenic Guy and others, he said. (Though not, Kyle Craven or Laina Morris, mentioned above.)      He works to build brands around these icons, look for new product opportunities and protect the artists' intellectual property (IP). NFTs were a no-brainer. “We work to make sure we keep it standing and keep it cool. That’s always the number one rule. Keeping it cool,” he said.      See also: Marc Hochstein – How Bananas and Mortgages Can Explain the NFT Craze      In his early-20s, Lashes fronted a band called The Lashes, which was signed to Columbia and Lookout! Records. Tired of an incessant touring schedule, he took a job at an independent music distributor, where he learned the basic skills to manage talent.      When a family friend’s video from 1984 of a cat playing a keyboard started going viral on- and offline, Lashes’ stepped up to manage publicity and commercial opportunities for the meme. “I started managing Keyboard Cat like I would any aspiring musician,” Lashes said. “Being a pop culture fanatic, I realized this was the future of intellectual property.”      There were plush dolls, television appearances and T-shirt deals. But it didn’t become a full-time job for Lashes until he signed Nyan Cat. “I was obsessed,” Lashes said, explaining how he tracked down Chris Torres, the artist behind the galaxy-bending rainbow cat. With two memes to manage, he relocated to Los Angeles from Washington. From there, Lashes’ reputation and “roster” only expanded.    ‘X factor’    “It was in January when I first started seeing NFTs on my radar,” Lashes said, recalling how HashMasks infiltrated his Twitter feed. “I thought at the beginning it would potentially be a cool place for memes to exist.” As it happens, one of Lashes’ clients had the same idea. Nyan Cat creator Torres had already been in discussions with Foundation, a curated NFT marketplace and where he minted the seminal meme token.      With one foot in the door, Lashes began working more closely with the Foundation team to bring the rest of his clientele into Web 3.0. It hasn’t been exactly difficult to convince them. NFTs are reaping rewards for any artist who can capture a crowd. Torres, for instance, was the first artist on Foundation to break $1 million in sales.    It’s the difference between art and commerce.    “With memes, they already locked the key piece of entertainment,” Lashes said. “There’s an ‘X factor’ with art or certain things in the world that when people see it, it evokes a pure reaction that people want to share.” Now, with blockchain, people can own something unique related to these objects that are widely cherished.      But Lashes doesn’t see NFTs as revolutionary. He’s been making money off of this inexplicable “X factor,” for years. He helped sell more than 1 million Grumpy Cat plush dolls. More than 2 million Grumpy Cat books. Aubrey Plaza is voicing Grumpy Cat in a new animated series.      “[NFTs are] just a new way for us to expand the footprint of the meme and get it more legitimized as art,” Lashes said. “Creating revenue and monetizing memes isn't exactly new. Protecting them isn't really new. We all have copyrights and property licencing in order to protect the IP.”      That’s why Lashes doesn’t think it’s contradictory to attempt to make one NFT to represent the millions of variations of a particular meme that exist online. “We never tried to stop anyone from creating memes. It’s the difference between art and commerce. Once you put it on a T-shirt, that’s overstepping the boundaries.”      See also: Daniel Kuhn – The Problem of Authenticity in NFT Art      Over the next two weeks, auctions will open for The Ridiculously Photogenic Guy, Success Kid and Ermagherd. David After Dentist and Clarinet Boy will follow. By then, almost all of Lashes’ clients will have minted their attempts to convert the emotional capital earned in the early consumer web into cryptographic success.      Lashes said he has no doubt the artists will make a lot of money from their auctions, despite the feeling in some quarters that NFT fatigue is setting in – a premise he rejected.      “As far as my clients go, any auction that ends with a sale is a success, no matter the size. This is such new ground being broken, and everyone is appreciative that their works are being collected and respected,” he said.

42434143,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8Vrh,1617907501,Bank of Russia Plans Prototype for Its Digital Ruble Design in December,"The Bank of Russia presented a new concept for the digital ruble, a central bank digital currency the regulator has been contemplating since late last year, at a press conference on Thursday.      A prototype of the digital ruble will be created by this December, said Bank of Russia First Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova. The regulator also published a fresh report on the current state and future plans for the project.      The digital ruble will live in a hybrid technological platform combining distributed ledger technology (DLT) and centralized control by the Bank of Russia. The regulator hasn’t picked any particular DLT platform yet, Skorobogatova said, adding that the Bank of Russia will likely use open-source code to build its own proprietary product.      In 2022, the Bank of Russia will draft the necessary regulatory norms for integrating its version of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) into Russia’s financial system, as well as pilot the prototype with banks and other financial institutions, according to the report.      “We’ve been looking at many projects, and many would like to say they have a ready-to-use product, but [they don't] work for the digital ruble,” Skorobogatova said.      One thing is clear: The Bank of Russia wants smart contracts on its platform to allow users to program settlement of their transactions based on certain conditions, according to the report.      The updated CBDC concept, following the first analytical report published in October, is based on feedback the Bank of Russia received over the autumn and winter of 2020. Most significantly, the regulator chose to give commercial banks a more important place in the CBDC architecture.    Role of banks    In a two-tier model similar to the concept of the digital yuan, the Bank of Russia will open digital wallets for commercial banks and give them digital rubles in exchange for the money they keep on their corresponding accounts with the regulator.      The banks, in turn, will open wallets for their clients. Bank of Russia will provide its own platform for the digital ruble, which the banks will be able to build into their own digital banking apps, the report says.      Unlike bank deposits, digital ruble accounts will not earn interest but there is a security bonus: If a bank goes bankrupt, all digital ruble accounts it opened will still be available to users via other financial institutions participating in the network, the report says.      Read also: Bank of Russia Chair: Digital Ruble Is No Threat to Banks      Another notable point is that person-to-person money transfers in digital rubles will be free of commissions while the payments to vendors of goods and services will incur commission fees. The rules and tariffs will be established by the Bank of Russia, Skorobogatova said.      Previously, the central bank considered a more centralized version of the digital ruble, where the regulator would be managing the entire system itself. That version worried banks that thought they would have to compete against the regulator for people’s deposits. After consultations, the Bank of Russia reconsidered the role of banks in the project.    Offline goals    The Bank of Russia is determined to make digital ruble payments available offline. Although, Skorobogatova claimed, there are currently no known technologies in the world that could support an offline mode for a project like the digital ruble, the Bank of Russia believes a way can be found.      For offline transactions, users will need to open a second digital wallet on their mobile devices and transfer digital rubles from their online wallet to the offline one. Users will be able to transfer funds offline between their devices using technologies like Bluetooth and near-field communication (NFC), the report said.      The Bank of Russia is also planning to allow the restoration of lost funds in offline wallets in case the device gets lost. It’s not yet clear how such a feature for the CBDC will be implemented technologically.      Financial institutions that sent their feedback on the digital ruble concept to the Bank of Russia also supported the idea of an offline mode, Skorobogatova said. However, considering the risks of such a novel idea, the respondents suggested limiting offline transactions in size and time of execution.      Read also: Digital Ruble Can Help Track Government Spending, Bank of Russia Says      One of the key risks of the digital ruble that concerned the banks is a potential outflow of liquidity from banks if people start pulling their money from bank accounts and putting them into digital ruble wallets. The Bank of Russia might need to limit the size of such operations to prevent a shock for the market, said Deputy Chairman Alexei Zabotkin during the press conference.      Skorobogatova said the digital ruble is a “mega-project” for Russia, and the Bank of Russia believes that now is the right time to start the project.

Kava Labs said Thursday the upgrade to its infrastructure, built on the Cosmos SDK, means there are a number of performance improvements for users, allowing them to borrow against multiple cryptocurrency assets and earn staking rewards.      The move comes at a time when DeFi is finding its legs on blockchains beyond its traditional home, Ethereum.      “This upgrade will finalize the transition of Kava as a single application blockchain to an industry-leading DeFi platform complete with interoperable cross-chain tooling, secure price feeds and enterprise-grade reliability that financial institutions can trust,” Kava Labs CEO Brian Kerr told CoinDesk.      Additionally, Kerr told CoinDesk the upgrade will also complete the Hard protocol, the first cross-chain money market built on Kava’s platform that offers lending, borrowing and yield on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, XRP and BNB.    Read more: New Binance-Backed DeFi Site Lets You Earn Yield on Bitcoin, Other Non-Ethereum Assets    The upgrade is aimed squarely at institutional investors and corporate treasuries, according to documents shared with CoinDesk, touting the ability for firms to get 25% APY on their bitcoin without counterparty risk. While the risk of traditional players not fulfilling their lending obligations is obviated, it should be noted that smart-contract risk and other factors certainly remain in play.      “Convincing the institutions that hold Bitcoin to explore DeFi options will be a tall order,” Kava Labs admitted in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FORKS,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/08/kava-labs-launches-protocol-upgrade-with-eye-on-institutional-defi-lending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0800ab6a76eb71cd6f1ee57fd64772a04528ed8e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434137,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8Vnh,1617900196,"China, the Convenient Foil","Is bitcoin a Chinese plot to destroy America?      To Peter Thiel, it might be. Here’s what the tech entrepreneur said yesterday at an event hosted by the Richard Nixon Foundation (as reported by CoinDesk’s Colin Harper).      “Even though I’m a pro-crypto, pro-bitcoin maximalist person, I do wonder whether if, at this point, bitcoin should also be thought of in part as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S. ... It threatens fiat money, but it especially threatens the dollar.”    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    This makes perfect sense, and no sense, simultaneously.      In the no-sense category: China doesn’t control bitcoin and would find it hard to do so, because, you know, decentralization. Although something like three-quarters of the world’s mining is in China, and theoretically Beijing could take that over, other miners could easily set up elsewhere. Bitcoin is adaptable and, so far, has remained impervious to government intervention.      If China, somehow, did manage to control bitcoin, that would probably limit its impact as a global currency anyway. As Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse said in 2018: “How do we know that China won’t intervene [in controlling bitcoin]? How many countries want to use a Chinese-controlled currency? It’s just not going to happen.”      But Thiel is right in a less literal sense.      Bitcoin doesn’t look like it's replacing the dollar as a global reserve currency anytime soon. It’s becoming too valuable as a store of value to be a means of exchange. The asset has millions of holders but, as yet, few spenders.      But it has opened the door on monetary technology, with big geopolitical consequences. Because of bitcoin, we think differently about how to transfer value. Growing numbers of people understand that you don’t need a bank or middleman to do that.      China is adapting this insight to its very state-oriented view of the world. Its plans for a digital yuan allied to an international blockchain services network could obviate the need for companies and individuals to use any form of reserve currency and allow trade to go around the U.S. banking system.      Going forward, we’re likely to hear a lot more comments like Thiel’s, even if they’re a bit confused. (There’s something strange about a bitcoiner worrying about U.S. state power, but nevermind.) China is a convenient foil, as we saw in 2019 when Facebook’s David Marcus conjured up the specter of Chinese monetary innovation to make the case for libra (since renamed and reconfigured as diem).      “The future in five years, if we don’t have a good answer, is basically China re-wiring [the world] with a digital renminbi running on their controlled blockchain,” Marcus told the U.S. Congress. The U.S. could lose the right to make sanctions on other countries and could find itself on the wrong end of them, too, he said.      As China rolls out its blockchain weapons, differences in monetary approach will become starker – privacy versus surveillance, state-run versus private enterprise, “clean” bitcoin versus “dirty” bitcoin – and we’ll see new forms of conflict between long-time rivals. The rest of us will have to choose which side we’re on.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/08/china-the-convenient-foil,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b84d70c0418c83c994508f29969a53dad0512456-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Disclosed to CoinDesk Thursday, the new feature lets artists showcase their NFT merch in a consolidated gallery, making it easy for diehard fans to peruse. The move comes at a time when acts like Kings of Leon and others are rolling out increasingly lavish collectibles for their superfans and the crypto-rich.      To enable the gallery, a user on the site has to stake 100 of the project’s native AUDIO tokens.      The service marks an ever-so-slight departure from Audius’ strategy of playing to a broad audience without banking on crypto. Though it lives atop the Ethereum blockchain as a token-governed network, its founders and backers have found success, and adoption, by keeping the message on music found nowhere else.      Nearly 160,000 listeners logged into Audius Wednesday to stream EDM mixes and underground rap tracks uploaded by the artists themselves. The platform eschews big labels but posts big numbers: 4.5 million unique users this month, according to on-chain data.    Read more: Audius Has Big Numbers by Crypto Standards but Can It Take On SoundCloud?    But founders told CoinDesk the new function should appeal to nocoiners.      “These are people that have no idea what's going on from crypto perspective, but if you add in your NFTs as an artist to your artist profile, now all of a sudden your non-crypto fans can see this art, they can see these collectibles, and they can even potentially bid on them,” said Chief Product Officer Forrest Browning.      He said Audius Collectibles does not intend to act as an NFT bidding platform. Instead, it aggregates NFTs stored on SuperRare, Zora, Catalog, Foundation, OpenSea, Rarible and KnownOrigin. Artists sign transactions with their wallets to prove they own the work, but no gas is involved as the NFT never moves wallets.      Browning and CEO Roneil Rumburg said artists were asking for a way to show off their NFTs, in part because the buzzy digital collectibles offer them a potential revenue source at a time when gigs are hard to come by.      “A lot of our artists right now, for good reason, are interested in NFTs.

42434134,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8Vbh,1617886818,Anchorage Is Supporting DeFi Governance Token TRIBE Despite Its FEI Troubles,"U.S.-regulated cryptocurrency custody firm Anchorage is adding support for TRIBE, the governance token attached to the FEI stablecoin, which tanked terribly after attracting a record $1.2 billion in backing.      Thanks to a lot of hype and speculation, FEI, which employs a novel system of incentives and penalties to hold parity with the dollar, has turned out to be an unstable stablecoin – at least since its explosive launch last week.      The support of Anchorage is intended to help the project find its feet, Anchorage co-founder Diogo Mónica said in an interview with CoinDesk.      “Given this is the most successful launch ever of a stablecoin in terms of liquidity, I think it's very much expected to have some initial volatility,” said Mónica. “I do think it's a very legitimate approach and Anchorage's support will get more institutions on board.”    Read more: $1B Fei Stablecoin’s Rocky Start Is a Wake-Up Call for DeFi Investors    Stablecoins of all stripes are an essential part of crypto. The most successful versions so far tend to have corresponding amounts of U.S. dollars held in custody, with perhaps some auditing provided. But crypto’s true believers want to escape fiat and are exploring a spectrum of possible solutions, from the relatively centralized to more decentralized options that use algorithms to maintain a peg.      The FEI protocol aims to establish a middle ground, having created a decentralized trading protocol on popular decentralized finance (DeFi) trading platform Uniswap while attempting to incentivize users to hold the stablecoin by burning some FEI anytime they sell to the Uniswap pool and giving them a little anytime they buy from it.      However, a rush to get hold of TRIBE governance tokens and bag some gains has meant the FEI penalty mechanism is impacting the supply (selling the coin) but also making demand disappear.      Controversy aside, Anchorage has been committed to supporting early-adoption networks, including tokens like Rally, Radicle and Hegic.      “Our clients are betting on a digital-assets world, but they don't quite know exactly which model is going to win out: fully pegged, fully decentralized or something in between like FEI,” said Mónica, adding:    “From the beginning, we have stablecoins as part of institutionalization of the space, and different types of decentralization, centralization and backing-over-collateralization narratives.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TRADING | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/08/anchorage-is-supporting-defi-governance-token-tribe-despite-its-fei-troubles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51258c76d4b544bf939b8e71747497d2f14fe12e-1600x1068.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434145,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8Vxh,1617881970,This Indicator Suggests Bitcoin Is Overdue for a Big Price Move,"A popular price-chart indicator known as the Bollinger bandwidth suggests bitcoin could soon chart a big move – up or down.      The leading cryptocurrency has spent the better part of the last three weeks trading in the range of $50,000 to $60,000. The consolidation has worsened of late, with bitcoin bulls unwilling to lead the price action above $60,000 and bears struggling to force a break below $55,000.      Due to the persistent lack of clear directional bias, the Bollinger bandwidth, a price volatility gauge, has declined to a four-month low of 0.15. Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed big moves during the 2017 bull run each time the bandwidth fell to 0.15.      The indicator is calculated by dividing the spread between the Bollinger bands by the 20-day average of the cryptocurrency's price. Bollinger bands are volatility lines placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day average of price.      The metric dropped to around 0.15 in February, April and late October 2017, just before price rallies. A similar reading in March, July and September paved the way for market corrections.      The data tells us the impending volatility explosion is agnostic to price direction, meaning the big move can happen on either side.      Bitcoin's ongoing range play looks quite similar to the early December consolidation below $20,000, which ended with a breakout following the Bollinger bandwidth falling to 0.15.      While the seasonality for April is biased bullish, some analysts say the market looks overstretched. ""Everyone who's been in crypto for a while can recognize that things have been getting absolutely ridiculous on every level,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted on Wednesday.      Therefore, the impending big move could be bearish in nature. At press time, bitcoin is trading 1% higher on the day near $56,500, as per CoinDesk 20 data.

State Street later clarified it is ""evaluating"" trading on the new platform, but has not committed to doing so.      State Street, the second-oldest bank in the U.S. with $3.1 trillion in assets under management, is providing the infrastructure for a new bank-grade trading platform for digital assets set to go live mid-year — and could eventually use the system for trading itself.      Announced Thursday, State Street’s Currenex trading technology arm is working with London-based Pure Digital, infrastructure provider to the foreign exchange trading world, to create an institution-focused digital currency trading platform.      The two companies said they plan to further explore the digital currency trading space.      “Currenex is thrilled to leverage our experience and expertise in the FX and digital asset trading marketplace to provide Pure Digital with robust technology and infrastructure for this exciting digital currency trading initiative,” David Newns, the global head of Execution Services for State Street Global Markets, said in a statement.

Bank bull run    Institutions appear to be driving the current crypto bull run, a key difference from the retail-driven expansion of the space back in 2017. Big banks including BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are now making moves, and eyes have been on State Street, as one of the biggest U.S. custody providers and trading operations, to see when/if it would move into crypto.      “The digital currency world needs to grow up and mature,” Campbell Adams, founder of Pure Digital, said in an interview, adding:    “It needs large-balance financial institutions involved in the manufacturing process of price. The primary market doesn't really exist. There's a lot of disparate exchanges out there with different rules of engagement and systems. And this manifests itself in very fragmented market data.”    The plan is to transpose FX infrastructure to the crypto space via a bank-led consortium, and a platform that includes FX-industry standard APIs and best execution, Kiley said.      “State Street has agreed to explore the digital asset space trading space with us, and is also working with us on the tech,” Kiley told CoinDesk in an interview. “We’ve got a couple of banks that have signed with us and several others in the pipeline.”      Unlike a crypto exchange, Pure Digital is building an over-the-counter (OTC) offering with bilateral credit lines and full transparency, so that top-tier banks can see exactly with whom they're dealing and can turn on and off counterparties as they choose, Kiley added.      “All these banks are waking up to crypto and can't ignore it anymore, “ Kiley said. “Either they find a way to get involved and provide services to meet client demand or they will start to lose relevancy over time.”",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/08/state-street-may-start-trading-crypto-on-platform-its-helping-build,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07b265af64f68f198e0efdbcb8c978a1a34c2a8b-1491x746.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
