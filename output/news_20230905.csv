42409718,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOdcd,1693956041,"Sam Bankman-Fried's Laptop Has a New Battery Now, DOJ Says","Once one of the world's most powerful crypto executives, Sam Bankman-Fried is reduced to bickering with prosecutors over his access to a laptop computer.  The jailed founder of the collapsed FTX exchange has access to a laptop seven days a week and three hard drives with defense material at all times, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a letter Tuesday. The prosecutors were responding to a federal judge's order for a report on the conditions Bankman-Fried faces while detained at the Manhattan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York.  Bankman-Fried's defense team has argued that they ""need"" him out of jail to work on his defense, telling Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the case, that poor internet access and battery life are limiting the amount of work he is able to conduct on his own defense ahead of his criminal trial next month.  After a virtual hearing last week, Kaplan ordered the parties to put together a report on these issues. In Tuesday's filing, prosecutors said Bankman-Fried now has access to an air-gapped laptop for 11 hours a day on weekdays and 7.5 hours a day on weekends and holidays. Bankman-Fried also has access to hard drives with defense material at all times.  Twice a week, Bankman-Fried has access to an internet-enabled laptop. Defense attorneys had previously raised issues about the battery life and weak internet connection, but Tuesday's letter said the defense team had provided a new battery that ""has approximately 8 hours battery life,"" and the internet speed over the course of a day ranged from 7.5 megabits per second (mbps) to 34 mbps.  The DOJ said this was ""sufficient for most internet review activities"" in its letter (a number of websites say 5 mbps is sufficient to stream video).  Bankman-Fried has been in jail since mid-August after Judge Kaplan revoked his bail, ruling that the FTX founder had engaged in multiple efforts to tamper with witnesses. His defense team has filed an appeal of the bail revocation, and argued that his detention was interfering with his Sixth Amendment right to work on his own defense.  Those claims were repeated in a further letter by Bankman-Fried's lawyer, Mark Cohen, published around the same time as this article.  ""The Government has not devised a plan that works in practice,"" Cohen wrote, saying that recalls by prison staff had eaten into the time allotted for review. ""Accordingly, we respectfully reiterate our request that the Court order Mr. Bankman-Fried’s temporary release.""  Prosecutors had previously taken issue with the defense team's characterization of the technology issues, saying they were inconvenient but not debilitating.

17160097,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550140,1693954813,"Ethereum Whales Send $486 Million To Coinbase, Time To Exit?","Ethereum has seen the price of its native token ETH drop alongside Bitcoin as the bear market continues to gain group. This has triggered fear among investors, leading to high selling pressure on the digital asset. Even the Ethereum whales are now dancing to the tune of the bear market as they have begun to send large amounts of ETH to centralized exchanges. Ethereum Whales Push Toward Selling A recent Santiment report posted on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has shown that Ethereum whales may be looking to exit stage left at this time. The chart which was posted by the on-chain data tracker shows that whales were moving 300,000 ETH to centralized exchange Coinbase. Related Reading: Why The Shiba Inu Price Cannot Realistically Get To $0.001 The transfer took place across two transactions carrying 150,000 ETH each. At the time, each of the transactions was carrying ETH worth $243 million to the exchange. So in total, both transactions saw a total of $486 million in ETH moved to Coinbase. Whales send 300,000 ETH to Coinbase | Source: Santiment on X Despite being such closely watched transactions, there have been no indications of what the whales intend to do. Usually, coins moving toward centralized exchanges means sell-offs, especially for large investors, who do so to minimize the impact of their selling as much as possible. However, the price of Ethereum is still trading close to where it was on Monday, and if these whales were looking to sell, then such activities would’ve led to a fast plunge in the price of ETH. There is also the fact that once the ETH was transferred to Coinbase’s hot wallet, they would be further broken down into smaller chunks of 4,282 ETH, which were then moved to other wallets. But even this doesn’t paint a clear picture of why the ETH was moved to Coinbase in the first place. Bears Take Over With Negative Sentiment The selling pressure that the Ethereum price has been under recently has not come out of nowhere. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index had moved into the fear territory following the market crash. This meant that investors were more likely to sell their holdings than put new money into the market. Related Reading: On-chain Sleuth Potentially Unveils Shiba Inu Founder With Shocking Affiliates For ETH, it has now become a battle for the bulls given that the bears have successfully dragged the price below the 50-day moving average. This points toward more bearish momentum for the asset in the short term. However, it is not all bad. ETH price maintains $1,600 despite large transactions | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Usually, when indicators have dropped so low, it can often be a bounce-off point for a recovery. So while ETH may be looking toward more bear movement for the near term, the digital asset could be close to another rally, possibly pushing its price above $1,700 once more. ETH’s price is changing hands at $1,624 at the time of this writing. It’s down 0.90% and 1.31% on the daily and weekly charts, respectively.

According to recent announcements, the company aims to enhance the capabilities of traditional payment systems through this pilot program, which is currently in the testing phase. This initiative is expected to improve cross-border settlement speeds and offer a modern option for clients to send and receive funds through Visa’s treasury. In collaboration with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, this expansion reinforces Visa’s commitment to staying at the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation, according to VISA’s head of Crypto, Cuy Sheffield. VISA Expands Stablecoin Settlement Services To Solana Solana, a blockchain platform known for its scalability, has been chosen by VISA to extend its stablecoin settlement capabilities. With Solana’s existing support for Ethereum (ETH), VISA is leveraging the strengths of both platforms to facilitate efficient and secure transactions. Related Reading: Litecoin Price Momentum: Will It Sustain Above The $63 Mark? Per the announcements, VISA aims to enhance cross-border settlement efficiency by leveraging stablecoins such as USDC (USD Coin) and utilizing the global blockchain networks of Solana and Ethereum. This integration allows users to benefit from the advantages of Solana’s blockchain, such as fast transaction speeds and low fees. Furthermore, integrating VISA’s stablecoin settlement services with Solana provides increased utility and credibility to the platform and its native cryptocurrency, contributing to the SOL value surge. Overall, VISA’s decision to expand its stablecoin settlement services to the Solana blockchain signifies the company’s recognition of the potential offered by blockchain technology and digital currencies. VISA’s selection of Solana as a partner underscores its reputation as a scalable and efficient blockchain platform. The positive market response, as evidenced by the surge in SOL’s price, highlights the growing confidence in the potential of both Solana and stablecoin solutions. As VISA continues to explore and embrace digital currency innovations, it reinforces the ongoing transformation of the global financial landscape. Bullish Momentum For SOL The recent announcement of VISA’s expansion into the Solana blockchain has notably impacted the price of SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. Since the news broke, SOL has surged by 5.2% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $20.46. This surge reflects the market’s positive response to VISA embracing Solana’s capabilities. In the immediate term, bullish investors will face a key resistance level of $20.82, which was lost on August 30 after a consolidation period of 15 days following a sharp decline influenced by the overall market trend.

On the downside, if any of these possibilities don’t play out, SOL bulls will need to defend the $19.15 level and strive to consolidate above this crucial point.

The market underestimates the buying pressure of a spot bitcoin ETF, said K33.  Ether (ETH) is poised to outperform bitcoin (BTC) in September and October as it benefits from stronger momentum related to a likely exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing, crypto market analytics firm K33 Research said Tuesday in a report.  The U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission’s (SEC) final deadline to approve or deny the first ether ETF is in mid-October, and the chances are high that the agency will green-light the product.  The development can potentially boost ether’s price, K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde explained, noting bitcoin gained 60% in the three weeks ahead of the launch of its first futures-based ETF two years ago.  “The odds are stacked in favor of ETH,” Lunde said, calling it a “strong relative buy” versus bitcoin. “ETH/BTC trades near 2.5-year range lows, with considerable wiggle room for relative upside.”  Impact of spot bitcoin ETF is under-appreciated  Bitcoin has received a fair share of fanfare with respect to ETFs since asset management giant BlackRock filed for a spot product in June, shortly followed by applications from a slew of other asset managers, Fidelity among them.  Last week, the probability of the SEC approving a spot bitcoin ETF seemingly improved after Grayscale’s victory over the agency in a lawsuit about converting its closed-end Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.  Excitement over the court decision quickly faded, however, and the SEC poured a bit more cold water on sentiment later in the week when it delayed any decision on the June spot product filings by BlackRock and the others. After initially surging to above $28,000 on Grayscale’s court victory, bitcoin quickly gave up any gains and more, slumping to near a six-month low just above $25,000 by last Friday afternoon.  “The market seems to underestimate the potential impact [of a spot bitcoin ETF],” Lunde said. “A spot ETF approval should attract enormous inflows, creating significant buying pressure on BTC. Conversely, if the BTC spot ETFs are rejected, nothing changes.”  September is historically a difficult period for BTC’s price, with the crypto recording negative monthly returns that month in every year since 2016. Crypto asset manager QCP Capital forecasted that the largest crypto asset could sink to as low as $23,000 by the beginning of October.  Still, current price levels – $25,720 at press time – provide a buying opportunity for investors with a longer time horizon, according to Lunde. “This is, by all accounts, a buyer’s market, and it’s reckless not to aggressively accumulate BTC at current levels,” he said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/05/buy-ether-instead-of-bitcoin-to-ride-etf-momentum-crypto-research-firm-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09413e578a77818dda039c61709169887e1ad8e9-1074x598.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to data from CoinGecko, the token’s price declined by nearly 25% a few hours after the sell-off. On Tuesday, 5th of August, Synapse Labs announced – via a post on X (formerly Twitter) – that one of the liquidity providers sold their SYN tokens and removed liquidity from the Synapse protocol. Lookonchain reported a whale dumping 9 million SYN tokens an hour after this disclosure. According to the on-chain analytics platform, the whale sold the tokens for roughly 2.35 million USDC in two separate transactions at $0.26. Additionally, Lookonchain revealed that the whale received these offloaded funds from the “Synapse: Executor 2” wallet, establishing a link with Synapse Labs’ recent announcement. Meanwhile, Colin Wu’s report corroborated this on-chain discovery while adding that $37.537 million in stablecoin liquidity was removed from the Synapse protocol. Related Reading: Worst Behind For BTC Price? Whales Accumulate Bitcoin, But It’s Not BlackRock Crypto Community Points Finger At Nima Capital Various reports have emerged in the last few hours, speculating on the identity of the liquidity provider responsible for the 9 million token sell-off and liquidity removal. Crypto researcher Wazz claims that Nima Capital is the LP behind these actions and has broken its liquidity-provisioning agreement eight months early. In March, Nima Capital, a crypto venture capital firm, was designated Synapse’s first liquidity provider. According to the proposal, the firm committed to providing $40 million in actively managed stablecoin liquidity over twelve months while receiving 33% of bridge and swap fees. Nima Capital appears to have limited its digital presence. As of this writing, the company’s website is offline and inaccessible to the public. Meanwhile, access to the firm’s X account has been restricted and is only available to confirmed followers. It is worth noting that Synapse Labs didn’t reveal the identity of the liquidity provider in its announcement, and the team has yet to provide any further updates on the situation. The liquidity removal and token sell-off have also impacted Synapse’s total value locked (TVL). According to DefiLlama data, the cross-chain protocol’s TVL has dipped by nearly 20% in the past day. SYN Succumbs To Selling Pressure, Price Dips By 25% As noted earlier, the value of SYN suffered an almost 25% decline after the liquidity provider dumped its holdings. The token’s price crashed from $0.401 to $0.309 in hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stealth Rally: Expert Forecasts Monumental Surge, Ignoring $25,800 Standstill SYN has since been showing glimpses of recovery, as it now trades above $0.35. According to CoinGecko data, the token is valued at 0.356092, with a 0.5% price increase in the past hour. A broader look at its price performance shows that the SYN token has struggled in the last few months. After notching a yearly high of $1.59 in late February, the cryptocurrency has reversed all its gains, trading 77% beneath the 2023 peak.

Grayscale added a swipe at the SEC's track record for rejecting spot bitcoin ETF applications, saying that if there was any difference between these and futures-based product, ""it would have surfaced by now in one of the 15 Commission orders that rejected spot bitcoin Rule 19b-4 filings even after bitcoin futures ETPs began trading.""

42409712,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOdM6,1693946056,Coinbase Creates New Crypto Lending Service Geared Toward Large Investors,"Coinbase (COIN) has created a new crypto lending service in the U.S. for institutional clients, helping fill the void left by the blowups of firms like Genesis and BlockFi.  The platform was quietly revealed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Sept. 1, which showed $57 million had already been raised for the program.  According to a person familiar with the matter, clients can lend Coinbase money – predominantly crypto assets – and get collateral exceeding the value of the loan. Such overcollateralization acts as a safeguard from disaster.  Coinbase can then turn around and make secured loans to institutional trading clients – akin to the prime brokerage service banks provide in traditional finance, the person familiar said.  Genesis and BlockFi provided similar lending services in the U.S., but suffered massive losses last year that drove them, fully or in part, into bankruptcy court.  The new service differs from the controversial Lend program that Coinbase canceled in 2021. That was pitched at retail customers, and SEC officials objected. This latest lending service is instead geared toward institutions, which means regulation is less onerous – on the presumption large investors have the sophistication to handle it.  ""With this service, institutions can choose to lend digital assets to Coinbase under standardized terms in a product that qualifies for a Regulation D exemption,"" a Coinbase spokesperson said in a statement. ""Coinbase is working to update the financial system that was built over 100 years ago, leveraging crypto to provide people with more economic freedom and opportunity.

42409713,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOdPP,1693945111,Explaining Ethereum's 'Risk Free' Rate of Return,"One sliver of the crypto market seems to be rebounding: staking. Despite the doom and gloom cast over the entire blockchain industry after the cascading crisis that was 2022 and the fact that the global economy is in uncharted territory, as noted by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole, proof-of-stake (PoS) revenue generation has almost rebounded to all-time highs.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  As Bloomberg’s Sidhartha Shukla noted in a recent article, the total value locked, or TVL, for liquid staking protocols has surged 292% to $20 billion over the past year and some months. That’s just shy of the $21 billion locked in leading decentralized staking protocols Lido and Rocket Pool in April of 2022, right before the TerraUSD stablecoin death spiral.  To some extent, a rebound in Ethereum staking valuations makes sense – even at a time of general disinterest in decentralized finance (DeFi).  If you remember, Ethereum went officially live with staking on Sept. 15 in an event forever commemorated as “the Merge.” That date shifted the narrative on crypto, at least somewhat, after Ethereum nullified the longstanding criticism of crypto’s carbon footprint by ditching energy intensive miners. (Bitcoin being Bitcoin, it still has its eco critics — but perhaps not for long.)  While it took a few weeks for the withdrawal/unstaking fervor to die down, staking has so far served Ethereum users well – paying out an annualized rate between 3%-4% to anyone with the spare 32 ether (ETH) needed to stake to become a validator. And lest we forget that staking exists in part to shield the World Computer from attacks, it hasn’t failed yet.  Liquid staking – or a democratized form of staking that allows smaller holders to pledge ETH to companies or smart contracts that collate funds and pay out staking rewards commensurately to people otherwise priced out – is such an attractive proposition that many have begun calling it “the on-chain equivalent of government bonds.”  The lingo actually used is “crypto’s risk free rate of return,” but Bloomberg being Bloomberg there’s no way an editor would let a comparison to three-month U.S. Treasury bonds fly — even if the whole concept of a “risk free” rate is an economic impossibility (and essentially a marketing term for U.S. government debt).  Useful fiction or not, staking on Ethereum is comparatively safer than pledging funds to say a DeFi lender. Or worse, a centralized lender like Gemini Earn, BlockFi or Celsius (all defunct). And in a year where liquidity is hard to source and DeFi hacks keep on happening, staking is the obvious choice for many who want to put their capital to work.  Protocols like Lido even give out a proxy token to stakers (i.e. stETH, or staked ETH), which can be used across DeFi while staking rewards roll in.  See also: DeFi Died and We Didn't Even Notice | Opinion  None of this is to suggest that staking is by any means riskless. Lido’s dominance of the sector in particular is a massive red flag for many, who are concerned about any vector of attack that could put Ethereum security at risk. But given the hardware and capital requirements to become an Ethereum validator, it’s unlikely the trend will reverse and people will choose to spin up nodes the old-fashioned way.  To some extent, staking is where the crypto industry was skating even before Ethereum’s embrace. Investor favorites like Cardano and Solana beat Ethereum to the punch in rolling out their at one time “experimental” staking systems while pre-existing chains like Dogecoin and Zcash are studying how to make the shift. Most if not all blockchains built to run crypto-powered apps launched in the recent market upcycle, like Sui and Aptos, launched with some version of proof-of-stake in place.  So staking may simply have become an expectation, something that cryptocurrencies are supposed to do. To me, this seems like a positive trend. It offers cryptocurrencies a touchpoint with dividend-paying stocks, and helps reduce the immateriality of crypto. For many, crypto is entirely untethered from reality – prices fluctuate randomly, and most people never encounter blockchains while going about their lives. In fact, one of the most popular complaints of crypto is the supposed lack of intrinsic value to any of these assets.  Ethereum’s staking reward isn’t actually a measurement of cash flows and it certainly isn’t without its risks, but it does do a lot to ground the cryptocurrency in something familiar.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | RPL,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/05/explaining-ethereums-risk-free-rate-of-return,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca103213826d769c69bbaf63562e1bc345cba452-1988x1118.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum Percentage Of Holders In Loss Has Surged Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the percentage of ETH investors in loss has grown sharply since early July. The relevant indicator here is the firm’s “Historical In/Out of the Money,” which tells us about the percentage of Ethereum investors in profits and losses and those that are just breaking even. The metric determines whether an investor is in profit or loss by looking at their address history to check for the average price at which they acquired their coins. Naturally, if the asset’s current spot price is less than a holder’s cost basis, then that particular holder is carrying their coins at a net profit. Similarly, the cost basis being equal to and less than the spot price would imply that the investor is breaking even on their investment and holding at a loss, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchanges See Three Straight Months Of Withdrawals For First Time Ever Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Historical In/Out of the Money indicator for Ethereum over the past few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent weeks | Source: IntoTheBlock on X IntoTheBlock has only listed the data for the Ethereum investors in losses, as this is the number of interest in the current discussion. The combined percentage of the investors breaking even and carrying profits can also be deduced from this value, as the total percentage must add up to 100%. In early July, Ethereum holders underwater were at about 27%. It’s visible in the graph, however, that the indicator has observed a notable uplift since then, as the price of the cryptocurrency has registered a drawdown. Today, the indicator’s value is at 44.2%, meaning that almost half of the Ethereum user base is holding their coins at losses. Generally, the more the investors get into profits, the more likely they become to sell to harvest those gains. Due to this reason, corrections in the asset become more probable to form whenever an extreme majority of the market is enjoying profits. A large percentage of the holders being in losses instead, however, can have the opposite effect on the price since they can lead towards bottoms as profit sellers become exhausted. Related Reading: This Could Be The Metric To Watch For A Bitcoin Bounce: Santiment Since the start of the bear market last year, the highest the metric’s value has gone is 50%, implying that exactly half of the investors had been in losses back then. This value isn’t too far off from the current one, suggesting that Ethereum may be close to forming a bottom. If a similar loss percentage is hit with the bottom this time, ETH would first suffer from some more downtrend so that enough investors drop underwater.

42409729,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOe9h,1693942881,‘Ethereum Supreme Court’ Mooted by Blockchain Executive as Alternative to ‘Code Is Law’,"There’s an oft-repeated mantra in blockchain ideology that “code is law” – the idea that a network’s underlying programming should be sacrosanct, providing the ultimate authority to settle disputes even when serious emergencies or existential threats arise.  Now, a top executive in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem is explicitly embracing the idea that, in certain extreme scenarios, humans rather than hard-coding might be the superior arbiters of justice.  Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs, the developer of a top layer 2 network on Ethereum, has floated the idea of an “Ethereum Supreme Court” to arbitrate disputes that escalate to the point of threatening the main blockchain’s integrity.  The system, which Gluchowski described on X (formerly Twitter) as “a hierarchical system of on-chain courts similar to the real-world judiciary,” would allow apps built atop Ethereum to appeal for a chain “fork” in the event that they are hacked or face some other sort of security crisis.  “Code is law, bug = death,” Gluchowski wrote in a follow-up comment to his Sept. 2 post.  Today, when apps on Ethereum are hacked and money is siphoned away from victims, the only real recourse is typically a fork of the blockchain – where a majority of the chain’s users and operators move to a new version of the chain that rolls back its history.  The DAO hack of 2016 – where hackers ran away with a massive chunk of all circulating ETH – famously led to one of these forks. Ethereum’s key stakeholders came to a “social consensus” that a new version of the chain, where the hack never happened, would become the “canonical chain.” (The old Ethereum chain, “ETH Classic,” still exists today but has relatively few users).  Chain forks are extremely rare. On a political and practical level, forking a chain means achieving social consensus – convincing a majority of the chain’s operators that the chain requires a fork, and then rallying them all to update their software.  Forks also come with philosophical issues – the idea that a blockchain’s state is “permanent” is one of the main reasons people are willing to imbue it with value. If a chain is forked over and over again, people may come to trust and value it less.  Overcoming these hurdles is a difficult feat, meaning that even as billions of dollars have been stolen from Ethereum users over the past few years, a fork hasn’t been used to remedy things since the DAO hack.  Gluchowski’s proposal would formalize the use of Ethereum’s “social consensus layer” to secure platforms like DeFi apps and so-called layer-2 networks known as “rollups.” These apps could secure billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency yet can’t fork Ethereum themselves if things go catastrophically wrong (as they sometimes do).  Under Gluchowski’s proposed system, if an Ethereum-based platform is exploited (for example), the community behind it would be able to work its case through a smart contract-based court system.  “Each court will also have to specify a higher court where any decision can be appealed – until at some point we reach the Ethereum Supreme Court,” Gluchowski wrote in his post. “The decision of this smart contract can only be determined by a (technically soft) fork of the L1.”  The Matter Labs CEO caveats that the system should be extremely expensive to use, adding that “only truly extraordinary cases” will be brought before the Supreme Court.  “Think of a bug in Uniswap, a major L2, a Defi protocol with a systemic risk, etc.,” he wrote.  Judging by the comments beneath Gluchowski’s original tweet, he has a lot of convincing to do if he hopes to bring his idea to fruition. As Gluchowski himself noted in the proposal, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned explicitly against overburdening Ethereum’s “social consensus layer,” and Gluchowski’s court system would undoubtedly put more pressure on Ethereum’s community to monitor and respond to hiccups.  “I am openly challenging it,” Gluchowski wrote of Buterin’s May 2023 blog post on the topic.  Gluchowski’s proposal does underscore how security has become top-of-mind for Ethereum app developers. Layer 2 apps like zkSync, the rollup platform developed by Matter Labs, hold billions of dollars in user funds – value that could be completely lost in the event of bugs and hacks. As these platforms become larger and more systemically important, Gluchowski doesn’t think that status quo solutions – like security councils and time-locked upgrades – will be sufficient for protecting users.  “The most important function of such a system will be to protect protocols against political inference from the outside,” Glukowski wrote. “It will serve as a great deterrence mechanism, and will elevate the role of Ethereum as a powerful network state.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | UNI | FORKS,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/05/ethereum-supreme-court-mooted-by-blockchain-executive-as-alternative-to-code-is-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b77c32591f94504d2e34d2fef599daa8412e778-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Many community members are currently keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency, and hoping for a significant price increase. One crypto analyst, in particular, has predicted a massive run for the altcoin that could see its price hit triple-digits. XRP Predicted To Reach $130 In Next Bull Run Following its partial victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July after Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple labs, XRP, the native token of Ripple, has fluctuated heavily despite the positive sentiment surrounding it. Nevertheless, an analyst sees a potential bull run for the altcoin. Related Reading: Can Ripple Control The XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In Crypto analyst and XRP influencer, XRP Captain, has predicted a significant price jump for the XRP token on an X (formerly Twitter) post.

In 2017, the cryptocurrency broke out of a similar symmetrical triangle pattern which pushed the token to new all-time highs. As for when this will happen, the analyst points toward the expected 2024 bull run. Can You Imagine The Magnitude When This Breakout Happens💥💥??

This development comes amidst the token poor price performance in the said month. XRP Dominates Altcoin Market In Trade Volume Amidst Price Downtrend According to the latest Data Debrief by Kaiko on September 4, the market research firm notes that XRP recorded an average daily trade volume of $462.8 million in August, representing the highest value of that metric in the altcoin market. Solana (SOL) followed in second place, with a trade volume of $128.4 million. Other altcoins that also experienced a significant average daily trade volume in August included Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC), among others. Source: Kaiko As earlier stated, XRP’s surge in trading volume was accompanied by underwhelming market performance. Kaiko notes that the altcoin experienced a 25% price decline in August. This negative price performance was in much contrast to July, during which XRP had recorded lofty gains following Ripple’s partial victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Gain Upper Hand With Escalating Sell-Off: Impact On ETH Price Why Is The XRP Price Struggling? To explain the contrast between XRP’s negative price performance and its surging trade volume, Kaiko has provided some interesting, in-depth analysis. According to the research firm, the court ruling in July led to a large demand for XRP by US traders, as was seen in the token’s price movement. Kaiko noted that the XRP average trade size on Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange, experienced a significant boost, surpassing all top ten altcoins. However, this massive XRP demand was only present in the US. Kaiko states there was high selling pressure on foreign exchanges, indicating that most investors sold off their tokens to capitalize on XRP’s gains from its court victory. In particular, Kaiko reported that the South Korean exchanges Upbit and OKX recorded the strongest XRP selling pressure for August. Related Reading: Worst Behind For BTC Price? Whales Accumulate Bitcoin, But It’s Not BlackRock Kaiko notes that the XRP’s trading volume is higher on foreign markets than on US exchanges. The research firm reported: Overall, the share of XRP traded on U.S. markets remains lower than on offshore exchanges. XRP is only the sixth most traded altcoin in the U.S. by cumulative trade volume, while it tops the list on offshore markets. Therefore, the high demand for XRP in the US was overwhelmed by higher selling pressure on the global market, which explains why the XRP market price took a nosedive in August. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $0.503, having gone up by 0.17% in the last day based on data from CoinMarketCap. However, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency is still in the red zone and is down by 2.28% and 19.70% on the weekly and monthly charts.

Bitcoin 6 Months To 3 Years Old Investors Have $33,700 As Cost Basis In a new post on X, Ali, an analyst, has shared a chart that could shed light on the path that BTC may end up taking. The relevant indicator here is the “realized price,” which tells us about the price at which the average investor in the Bitcoin market acquired their coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchanges See Three Straight Months Of Withdrawals For First Time Ever When the spot price of the asset exceeds this line, it means that the holders as a whole are currently carrying a net amount of profit on their coins. On the other hand, BTC being below the level suggests the average investor is underwater right now. In the context of the current discussion, the cost basis of the entire market isn’t of relevance, but of only a specific segment: the holders who acquired their coins at least six months and at most three years ago. Here is a chart that shows how the cost basis of these Bitcoin investors has changed over the years: Looks like the price is below this line at the moment | Source: @ali_charts on X The six months to three years old investors are actually a part of the larger “long-term holder” (LTH) group. And the LTHs are simply the investors who bought their coins at least six months ago. In the chart, the analyst has also attached the data for the cost basis of the entire LTH group and it’s visible that this metric currently has a value of about $20,300, meaning that the spot price is currently a decent distance above this line. The realized price of the six months to three years old holders, however, is above the spot price right now, as it’s valued at about $33,755. Naturally, this means that this segment of the LTHs is currently firmly in the red. From the graph, it’s also apparent that the Bitcoin price has not touched this level since early 2022, when the bear market first kicked off. If the cryptocurrency can surge towards the level and finally make a retest of it, then its fate might change for the better. This is because, as Ali has pointed out, BTC has observed a significant rally whenever the asset has crossed this mark and these HODLers have gotten back into profits. Related Reading: This Could Be The Metric To Watch For A Bitcoin Bounce: Santiment Three instances of this pattern are clearly visible in the chart. The 2017 bull run, the April 2019 rally, and the 2021 bull run all emerged from successful breaks of the cost basis of the six months to three years old LTHs. If this historical pattern holds any weight at all, then a Bitcoin break above the $33,700 level in the near future could become the starting point of the next major bull run. BTC Price At present, Bitcoin is quite a bit below the cost basis of these LTHs, as its price is trading just under the $25,800 level.

42409715,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOdZK,1693931717,Stop Thinking About 'Wins' or 'Losses' in the Bitcoin ETF Debate,"Despite a multi-year market slowdown, there are signs working in favor of the Web3 industry. Long-held claims about regulatory uncertainty have been validated and a major political win came in the form of a scathing rebuke of how the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is approaching crypto.  Historically it is rare for a federal judge to use such bombastic language as calling an administrative agency's reasoning ""arbitrary and capricious"" when rejecting Grayscale's proposal to convert a bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). With an equal amount of gusto a panel of judges for the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals said “[t]he Commission’s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets falls short of the standard for reasoned decision making.” [Emphasis added.]  David Ackerman is the chief compliance officer and data protection officer for Mobilecoin.  Despite the strong wording of the decision, what happens now is for the original application to go back to the SEC for review all over again. The SEC has already immediately delayed deciding on all open or refiled spot market bitcoin ETF applications until at least October. In doing so, the SEC has options.  What happens next is where opportunities for the entire crypto industry lie. Opportunities for the Web3 community, for the SEC and for the United States to potentially pivot toward a more collaborative, innovation-friendly future.  See also: U.S. Regulatory Uncertainty Overshadows Crypto Market: Bank of America  Should the SEC wish to challenge the federal judge's conclusions in the Grayscale decision, the company's application could simply be denied again for a different (or even an analogous) reason. That course of action becomes problematic quickly. The last thing any lawyer wants to do is upset a federal judge. That is a terrible idea, if the aim to quash the U.S. spot bitcoin ETF market before it begins.  If the SEC denies the Grayscale application a second time, then another federal judge will review it to determine:  If the denial is essentially similar;  Did the commission address the previous concerns raised, and  How does the denial either protect investors or otherwise support the SEC mandate  Based on the answers to the aforementioned questions, if a judge perceives SEC actions as more of an attack on an industry and less about protecting investors or market integrity, judges can flex their muscle.  It is difficult for a member of the judiciary to force an administrative action, but they can add language to their decisions that opens the door to future litigation. This could include another reversal but with added commentary suggesting if plaintiffs decide to sue civilly, they would probably be entitled to damages.  Judges could also suggest that individuals may be personally liable. This is not as far-fetched a possibility as it may initially sound. In recent memory, current members of the judiciary have shown a willingness to rebuke administrative agencies. There are already concerns about a brain drain of experienced professionals in government, it is difficult to imagine how that may get exasperated in the event personal liability for administrative decisions becomes even a fleeting possibility.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler is far smarter than that. Furthermore, the SEC staff is a large group of dedicated public servants who are brilliant, mission-driven and motivated to ensure U.S. markets are some of the most stable in the world.  An SEC win is very much a possibility, too. However, the political capital needed to further prevent innovation in this space without clear and convincing evidence that those actions support investor protection is simply not worth it.  See also: Grayscale Victory Against SEC Clears Path for Spot Bitcoin ETF  The United States has a storied history of balancing innovation with investor protection. We have proven both are concurrently attainable time and time again across every sector.

This has been reflected in digital asset investment products. However, new data shows that while outflows from digital investment products have dominated for another week, Bitcoin has shown some resilience to record a weekly inflow of $3.8 million. Bitcoin Trading Volume 90% Above The YTD Average In its latest report on digital asset investment products, Coinshares has shown Bitcoin investment products received net inflows despite the whole market seeing minor outflows. During the same time period, trading volumes spiked to more than 90% above the YTD average. Related Reading: Expert Market Analysts Agree A Spot Bitcoin ETF Is A Matter Of When, Not If Regulatory issues have bombarded BTC in the past week, and the asset has shown uncertainty about what’s next to come. In particular, August concluded with a Bitcoin setback as the SEC announced a decision to delay its ruling on some Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) applications. As a result, the price of BTC dropped from $28,000 to $25,400 in the space of 48 hours. But despite this decrease, digital asset investment products trading volume reached $2.8 billion. Outflows in digital asset funds have been consistent for the past seven weeks, totaling $342 million. Last week, chains like Polygon and Ethereum saw outflows of $8.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively, contributing to a total net outflow of $11.2 million across all assets. On the other hand, Bitcoin registered net inflows of $3.8 million. Solana also registered net inflows of $0.7 million, bringing its inflow streak to nine consecutive weeks. However, total assets under management (AuM) have fallen 48% from this year’s peak. BTC price loses $26,000 support | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Is A Shift Toward Positive Sentiment Imminent? The uptick in activity and investment is a good sign for the market and hints at growing mainstream interest in Bitcoin. However, this could end up being short-lived. Considering BTC is just like any other asset, sentiment is mostly based on news surrounding the crypto industry. So a consecutive weekly inflow to Bitcoin digital asset funds would suggest a change in sentiment. Related Reading: Here’s What Bitcoin Price The Bull Market Will Start According To This Analyst The outlook for BTC and the broader crypto market for the rest of 2023 is still cautiously optimistic. Experts from JP Morgan have predicted that the SEC will be forced to greenlight several spot Bitcoin ETFs, and former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton, has also called the approval inevitable. Nevertheless, the past 24 hours have seen the trading volume of Bitcoin increase by more than 11% to reach $10.87 billion. Of course, higher trade volumes don’t necessarily mean prices will skyrocket. But they show more people are buying and selling BTC, indicating stronger sentiment and momentum.

It was one week ago at this time that bitcoin surged to above $28,000 on Grayscale's court victory in its suit against the SEC over that agency's rejection of converting the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot bitcoin ETF.  The excitement about an imminent approval quickly died down though, and the SEC further cooled passions later in the week when it delayed decisions on a large handful of other spot bitcoin ETF applications, including from the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity.  The level of $25,000 is roughly the lowest print for bitcoin since mid-March (the price was on the way up then).  ""This is exactly what apathy looks like,"" said well-followed analyst Will Clemente over the weekend. He noted crypto's total trading volume is the weakest since 2020, Google search trends at multi-year lows and realized volatility and weekly Bollinger Bands all near record lows.  Macro news suggests continued pressure on prices  In separate announcements on Monday morning, Saudi Arabia and Russia surprised markets, each saying they would extend oil production cuts for another three months until December. The news sent the price of WTI crude oil up by more than 1% to $86.74, its strongest level since November 2022.  At the margin, higher oil prices lead to higher prices at the pump, which lead to higher inflation readings and thus higher interest rates. To the extent that interest rate instruments compete with risk assets for capital, the news on oil in the short term could be considered bearish for bitcoin prices, i.e. Why buy bitcoin when 30-day T-bills offer 5% interest?

The wallet in question, created just four hours before the airdrop for NEXT went live, was able to filter more than 200 claims to itself through multiple wallets. The airdrop was restricted to one claim per wallet. This strategy, known as a sybil attack, involves creating numerous wallets that are eligible to claim the airdrop before instantly selling the tokens for profit.  According to Debank, the wallet has been steadily converted NEXT tokens into tether (USDT) and ether (ETH), racking up around $38,000 in profit shortly after the airdrop went live.

Despite several attempts to break above the $70 resistance level, bulls seem to be running low on aggressiveness. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, LTC is trading at $62.99, reflecting a 1.8% decline over the past 24 hours and a seven-day slump of 3.1%. In recent weeks, LTC bulls have diligently defended the August 2022 range-high of $63, preventing a drop below this crucial support level. However, their efforts to push the price beyond $70 have proved futile. Related Reading: Stellar Tough Spot: Will XLM Prices See A Dip Amid Mid-Range Struggles? Litecoin Bulls Defend Key Levels But Face Technical Challenges A closer look at the technical indicators reveals that the H12 bearish order book and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are posing significant challenges for the bulls. Analysts believe that Litecoin could continue its consolidation above the $63 range-high in the coming hours or days. Still, the prevailing bearish pressure could hinder any substantial upward movement in the near term. LTC’s Struggle Amid Growing On-Chain Activity Surprisingly, despite Litecoin’s price consolidation, its on-chain data has shown increased activity in its ecosystem. According to a separate report, over the past four months, the share of Litecoin in global cryptocurrency payments has surged by an impressive 21%. This suggests that despite the stagnant price, Litecoin remains a popular choice for transactions. Litecoin market cap currently at $4.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Sell Limit Orders And Bearish Sentiments To complicate matters further for LTC, order flow tracking platform Mobchart cited in an analysis significant sell limit orders at $66 (3.11k LTC) and $70 (3.26k LTC) on Binance Exchange’s spot market. These levels are strategically positioned between the H4 50-EMA and the H12 bearish order book, effectively forming a formidable barrier for Litecoin’s price to overcome. This adds to the growing challenges faced by LTC bulls in their quest to push the price higher. LTC seven-day price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, sentiment around Litecoin has been increasingly bearish in recent times, as indicated by a separate report revealing that LTC bears have strengthened by 19% in the past week. This surge in bearish sentiment has likely contributed to the current downward pressure on LTC’s price. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Presents Compelling Reversal Indicators – Could This Be It?

The San Francisco-based firm has expanded its stablecoin settlement capabilities with Circle’s USDC stablecoin to the Solana (SOL) blockchain, designed to offer high-speed performance, Visa said in a statement Tuesday.  Visa said it’s one of the first major financial institutions to use the Solana network at scale for settlements.  SOL is up nearly 2% on the news, while bitcoin (BTC) and the broad-market CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) have slid lower.  Visa also has started pilot programs with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, which process debit and credit card payments for businesses globally, according to the statement. Their clients now may choose USDC stablecoin settlement instead of receiving fiat currencies.  The payments company first started testing USDC for treasury operations in 2021. The company ran a pilot program with crypto exchange Crypto.com, using the Ethereum blockchain for settling cross-border payments made with Crypto.com Visa cards.  “By leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we're helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa’s treasury,” Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said in a statement.  The development is another milestone for traditional financial institutions leveraging blockchain technology. The stablecoin market can potentially grow to $2.8 trillion in the next five years as global financial and consumer platforms tap the tokens on public blockchains to power value exchange on their platforms, research firm Bernstein has said.

17135801,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550067,1693922435,New Shibarium Update Sets The Stage For Shiba Inu To Reach All-Time High,"The burning of SHIB tokens has become an important part of the Shiba Inu community. Each week, tokens are sent to a ‘burn’ address by community members as they try to reduce the supply of the token. This is why the introduction of a burn mechanism for the Shibarium Layer 2 network is a welcome development for the community. Lead Dev Says Shiba Inu Burn Portal Is Coming In a tweet shared on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, Shiba Inu lead marketer LUCIE shared a much-anticipated announcement with the community. Lucie revealed in a screenshot of an exchange with the developer that a Shiba Inu burn portal for Shibarium was being developed. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Begin Accumulation As Shibarium Grows This comes after a long stretch of calls for the team to introduce an automatic burn for SHIB as the Shibarium blockchain grows. However, contrary to the belief that the burn portal is exactly what is needed, the developer emphasized that “BURNS WILL NOT AND ARE NOT THE END ALL BE ALL.” Instead, the developer says that the focus should shift toward the adoption of the blockchain rather than being on just burns. So to confirm that ADOPTION is the right way🌝$SHIB Burns x Shytoshi answered pic.twitter.com/BizkLZ0V83 — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 | Summer of Shibarium (@LucieSHIB) September 4, 2023 The developer’s words echo an earlier post made by the lead marketer on X. According to Lucie, the only way that SHIB would be burned is if the blockchain is being used. Token burns are dependent on fees generated from transactions. So this is why the emphasis should be placed on adoption rather than straight burns. “The more you use Shibarium, the higher the traffic, which drives up gas fees,” Lucie explained in the tweet. WE NEED TO USE #Shibarium It won’t burn $SHIB if you don’t use it! Onboarding millions of people to Shibarium will take time and community effort. More information about burns will be revealed in the upcoming documentation. BUT it has been clearly explained in… pic.twitter.com/xjo27NlPP8 — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 | Summer of Shibarium (@LucieSHIB) September 4, 2023 Lucie pointed out in a follow-up tweet that the Shiba Inu price had been able to hit its previous all-time high without any burn mechanism in place. “$SHIB will be a governance token with global adoption – the next ATH could be interesting,” she concluded. Will A Shibarium Burn Portal Lead To New ATH? The emphasis being placed on a burn mechanism by the community comes as a result of an expectation that lower supply leads to higher prices. While this is true for digital assets, there are other factors that contribute to a token reaching a new all-time high price. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Sends Important Message To SHIB Holders For one, the current crypto market trend has to be considered. With a bear market still raging on, it is safe to say that tokens are not hitting ATHs anytime soon. So even if a Shiba Inu burn portal was introduced today, it would not automatically guarantee a new ATH. However, it could lead to a surge in price, even if briefly. Hence, working toward adoption rather than just burns presents a more long-lasting value addition. SHIB’s price is currently sitting at $0.000007549 after falling 2.40% in the last day and 6.91% in the last week. It is the 16th-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $4.44 billion.

17133514,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550098,1693918845,"Analyst Calls ADA Amazon Of The Crypto World, Forecasts Bright Future Ahead","Amid increased price fluctuations in the crypto market, Crypto Capital Venture founder Dan Gambardello is bullish about Cardano’s (ADA) future. In his latest YouTube video, Gambardello compared Amazon’s stock price trajectory to Cardano’s, highlighting striking similarities between both companies. While he acknowledged ADA’s two-year-long bearish market conditions, the analyst believes that, like Amazon, Cardano has the potential for long-term growth. Since both entities’ technology differs with varying achievements, he compared the underlying principles and price action. Cardano’s (ADA) Current Market Condition Is Similar To Amazon’s Early Years Gambardello highlighted Amazon’s historical price performance between 1999 and 2001. According to him, Amazon stock nosedived from a $5.25 all-time high price to 30 cents between this timeframe. Related Reading: Worst Behind For BTC Price? Whales Accumulate Bitcoin, But It’s Not BlackRock Similarly, ADA’s value, which rose above $3 during the bull market in September 2021, has now plummeted to 25 cents. Therefore, the analyst likened buying ADA in 2023 and acquiring Amazon stocks in 2001. This is particularly true given Cardano’s growth potential in the financial market. Moreover, Gambardello forecasted that Cardano (ADA) could become the world’s number one financial operating system. In addition, he mentioned that currently, ADA’s market cap is approximately $8.9 billion. That is even 90% higher than Amazon’s market cap of $2.2 billion after a similar crash in 2001. The crypto analyst cited a letter from Jeff Bezos to Amazon shareholders during the downturn. In the letter, Bezos stressed that Amazon stood stronger despite the massive stock price drop. In his comparison, Gambardello drew similarities between ADA’s current position and Amazon’s during the downturn. He noted that Cardano Blockchain is more robust and better than before, citing improved smart contracts, scalability, and staking utility. Cardano Has Potential For Long-term Success Like Amazon Gambardello also likened ADA to the stock market, quoting a prominent crypto investor, Benjamin Graham. He said: “The stock market is a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long term.” Also, he noted that, like Amazon, Cardano’s fundamentals are strong enough to sustain it even in harsh economic conditions. The crypto analyst emphasized that Cardano is in the initial stages of user adoption, with several developers building on its network. It is similar to Amazon’s commitment to enhancing customer experience, which fueled its long-term growth. Again, Gambardello shifted focus to Cardano’s security and decentralization. He explained that Cardano’s robust security and decentralization give it an edge over other blockchain networks like Solana. He further mentioned that several startups have adopted Cardano as of September 2023. For instance, World Mobile utilized Cardano’s infrastructure to connect the unbanked and financially underserved people. According to Gambardello, this real-world use case is a game changer and starting point for Cardano’s success. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Presents Compelling Reversal Indicators – Could This Be It? In conclusion, the analyst said Cardano has numerous unexplored potentials with striking similarities to Amazon’s early days. Therefore, he is confident that Cardano has a high potential for long-term success and could offer massive returns to investors bullish enough to see it.

42409749,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOnNi,1693915384,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Treads Water Below $26K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin continued its subdued start to the week, having traded below $26,000 for the past 24 hours. BTC held between $25,500 and $25,750 during the Asian trading session today. The enthusiasm following last week’s ruling that the SEC must review its rejection of Grayscale Investments’ application to turn its bitcoin trust into an ETF has subsided, with other applications still kept waiting by the U.S. regulator. The broader crypto market remains in a similarly sideways trend, with the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) down 0.42% in 24 hours.  Crypto derivatives platform Deribit saw trading volume increase 17% to $42 billion in August even as global activity declined by 12% to around $1.6 trillion. The driving force behind the increase was Deribit’s options segment, with ETH options recording their highest volumes since March, Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk. Bitcoin experienced significant price swings between $25,000 and $30,000, triggering massive liquidations in futures and options on the platform and boosting hedging demand for options contracts. Deribit controls nearly 90% of global crypto options activity.  A survey by trade association the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) reflected a divided attitude toward offering crypto-related products and services. As part of a study of cryptocurrency trading infrastructure, the WFE surveyed its member exchanges, with 12 of the 29 respondents (41%) saying they are already offering crypto-related products or services. A further seven plan to offer them in the future, with 10 saying they have no such plans. The survey was conducted between May and July 2022, some months before FTX’s collapse, which may have damped attitudes to crypto further since.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily changes in the number of MKR held in wallets tied to centralized exchanges since November 2022.  On Monday, the so-called exchange balance fell by 14,140 MKR to 65,000 MKR, the lowest since June 21.  Dwindling exchange balance is often taken to represent investor bias for long-term holding strategy.

17130846,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550033,1693915257,Ethereum Bears Gain Upper Hand With Escalating Sell-Off: Impact On ETH Price,"The Ethereum (ETH) market has been gripped by escalating bearish sentiment as the taker buy-sell ratio, a critical indicator of market dynamics, plunged to a yearly low. This downward trajectory has sparked concerns among investors and traders, highlighting the prevailing pessimism in the Ethereum futures market. ETH’s taker buy-sell ratio, as revealed by a recent report from the anonymous CryptoQuant analyst Greatest_Trader, has been on a consistent decline over the past few months. The ratio reached its nadir at the end of the previous month, signaling a growing dominance of bears in Ethereum’s trading arena. Related Reading: Pepe Coin September Challenge: Can It Reach $0.000001 Again? Greatest_Trader said: “This consistent behavior underscores the dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders participating in Ethereum’s market.” The dwindling taker buy-sell ratio is indicative of increased sell orders, reflecting a lack of confidence in the coin’s short-term prospects. Source: CryptoQuant Google Trends Reflect A Loss Of Interest In Ethereum Adding to Ethereum’s woes is the declining interest of mainstream internet users. Google Trends data indicates that the number of searches for Ethereum (ETH) has plummeted to levels not witnessed since November 2020. Even more strikingly, searches for “DeFi” have dipped to four-year lows. Source: Google Trends In the last seven days, the metric for “Ethereum” plummeted to a dismal 8/100, a level last seen during the crypto euphoria of 2021, where internet users were searching for Ethereum 12 times more frequently. This decline in interest signals a significant loss of confidence in Ethereum’s prospects among retail investors. ETH Futures Open Interest Hits Yearly Low The pessimism surrounding Ethereum is further underscored by an examination of its futures open interest. Currently standing at $4.67 billion, ETH’s open interest has reached its lowest point this year, marking a 36% decline since its peak on April 19. This drop in open interest reveals that institutional and retail traders are increasingly skeptical about the cryptocurrency’s short-term potential. As of now, Ethereum’s price hovers at $1,622.75, with a 0.6% decline in the last 24 hours and a 1.9% loss over the past seven days, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,620. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Stellar Tough Spot: Will XLM Prices See A Dip Amid Mid-Range Struggles? Ethereum’s once-promising outlook is facing headwinds as bearish sentiment prevails in its futures market. The declining taker buy-sell ratio, coupled with a lack of interest from retail users, paints a somber picture for the cryptocurrency. Moreover, the dwindling open interest in Ethereum’s futures suggests that traders are hedging their bets amid growing uncertainty. Ethereum’s journey in the coming months will undoubtedly be a challenging one, and investors and enthusiasts alike will be keenly watching to see if it can weather this storm and regain its bullish momentum.

Crypto Analysts Weigh In,"The XRP token has attracted much attention, especially because of Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This has led to speculations on whether Ripple is able to control the XRP price or not. So crypto analysts have chimed in to share their opinions. No Ripple Effect On XRP? Pro-XRP influencer Crypto Eri stated in a tweet that she doesn’t rely on the “efforts of Ripple” to increase XRP’s value. She suggested that the crypto company hasn’t done much to grow the token as it accounts for a “single digit impact on volume.” Related Reading: Pro-XRP Legal Expert Takes The Spotlight With Daring Ripple Vs SEC Settlement Theory Unlike DAI, I don’t rely on the efforts of Ripple to build up the price of XRP. Never have, never will. Especially with accounting for single digit impact on volume. It’s surprising after surviving the SEC attack, anyone would subscribe to this reliance. https://t.co/XG2bA6qsva — 🌸Crypto Eri 🪝Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) September 4, 2023 There is a common belief that token issuers should be able to control and drive up the price of their tokens, whether through their marketing efforts, a deflationary mechanism, or simply increasing the use cases of their tokens to send a bullish signal to the crypto community. In Ripple’s case, Eri believes holders shouldn’t rely on the company, especially after “surviving” the SEC attack. While her stance is unclear, many may argue that Ripple’s effort in its case against the SEC shows its commitment to building the ecosystem and promoting mass adoption of its token. Eri’s tweet came in reply to another pro-XRP influencer, Digital Asset Investor, who tweeted about why he was bullish on XRP. In contrast to Eri’s view, this influencer believes that Ripple’s efforts will greatly affect XRP’s value as Ripple promises to disrupt the global financial system, so he is bullish on the token. Some would think these were things said by influencers to hype XRP. They were actually said by Ripple. This is why I’m here. I believe them.🏆🏆🏆In It To Win It!🏆🏆🏆 -XRP Could Help In A Systemic Risk Situation In another financial crisis -XRP will be like a supranational… — Digital Asset Investor.XRP (@digitalassetbuy) September 2, 2023 Has Ripple Had Any Effect On XRP? It is worth mentioning that the XRP price experienced significant gains on the back of Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in favor of Ripple. The token surged over 23% within hours of the decision and rose to as high as $0.9 due to the ruling. Furthermore, XRP became the fourth-largest token by market cap following the decision (although it has dropped to 5th since then). However, there is no denying the potential for Ripple to go head-to-head with the foremost cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Related Reading: New Job Listing Indicates What Ripple Is Focusing On Next Interestingly, there was a significant increase in daily transactions conducted on the XRP ledger, with more transactions conducted on the blockchain at the beginning of last month than leading blockchains Ethereum and Bitcoin. Ripple has also not rested on its efforts to develop the XRP ecosystem despite the SEC’s lawsuit against it. The crypto company is looking to expand into the tokenized assets industry by enabling trading of these asset classes on the XRP Ledger. There are also plans to release an upgrade for the XRP Ledger, with a notable amendment being the introduction of a novel automated market maker (AMM). This update could see XRPL become a major player in the DeFi space and increase XRP’s utility, which could trigger an increase in its value.

Meanwhile, recent on-chain data suggests that Bitcoin whales are accumulating, but contrary to popular rumors, BlackRock isn’t among them. Meanwhile, analysts are divided on whether the worst is behind for Bitcoin’s price. Whales Accumulate Bitcoin, But It’s Not BlackRock On-chain analyst James V. Straten recently highlighted a trend in the accumulation score by cohort chart. He remarked, “Seems like peak Bitcoin distribution is behind us, as we can see a slight tick-up in accumulation. This is the most aggressive accumulation since June/July for whales that have over 10k BTC.” However, the waters are muddied by rumors surrounding BlackRock’s involvement. Speculation has been rife that BlackRock has been suppressing Bitcoin prices to buy cheap. But these claims are unfounded. “Many individuals don’t realize that BlackRock would require actual Bitcoin to back their Spot ETF. They might have already purchased their Bitcoin months ago when prices were lower,” is a statement that’s been debunked. The reality is that BlackRock, being a financial behemoth managing people’s money, undergoes audits every three months. This means they can’t hide Bitcoin purchases from auditors. If they were to invest in Bitcoin, it would be through an exchange-traded fund. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction For September 2023: What To Expect In fact, BlackRock has already shown interest in the space by investing in Bitcoin mining stocks and MicroStrategy as a proxy. Remarkably, BlackRock is a major shareholder in 4 out of the 5 largest Bitcoin mining companies. Is The Worst Behind For BTC Price? The Bitcoin price trajectory remains a topic of intense debate among analysts. Will Clemente, a prominent figure in the space, shared the chart below and commented, “From a high-time-frame valuation perspective, Bitcoin’s position is intricate. While it’s not overheated relative to historical values, there’s a tangible risk of retesting the lows akin to Q1 2020.” He further emphasized the prevailing market apathy, pointing to the lowest aggregated trading volume since 2020, the dwindling Google search trends for Bitcoin at multi year lows and realized volatility, implied volatility, weekly Bollinger Bands all near record lows. Joe Burnett of Blockware Solutions chimed in with a compelling observation, “A staggering 94.6% of all Bitcoin remained stationary in the last 30 days. We set a record high at August’s end, and this might soon be surpassed. Historically, bear markets conclude when supply dries up. A mere spark of demand could ignite the next explosive bull market.” Related Reading: How Bitcoin And Crypto Are Impacted By The Fed’s Growing War Chest: Report Crypto traders, too, are closely monitoring key levels. @DaanCrypto remarked the significance of the $26K-26.1K range as it marks the daily, weekly and monthly open, high volume node and weekly VWAP. Therefore, for bulls, it’s the line of action, and for bears, it’s the fortress to defend. Rekt Capital, a well-regarded crypto analyst, has been closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price action, especially in relation to its volume dynamics. He also highlights the significance of the $26,000 support level on the weekly chart, pointing out that Bitcoin’s price has been hovering around this mark even after retracing most of its gains from the previous Grayscale rally. However, the simultaneous decline in both buy-side and sell-side volumes is a cause for concern, suggesting a market that’s currently directionless. “The declining sell-side volume coupled with a lackluster buyer volume is concerning. Without a volume breakout, neither from sellers nor buyers, the market lacks momentum,” the analyst states. On the topic of the double top, a traditionally bearish pattern, Rekt Capital indicated that a breach below the $26,000 mark on the weekly chart could potentially send BTC tumbling towards $22,000. However, he also hinted at a silver lining: an inverse head and shoulders pattern observed earlier this year. If Bitcoin approaches the $24,000 mark, which serves as the neckline for this pattern, it could act as a robust support and possibly signal a bullish turnaround. At press time, BTC traded at $25,734.

As part of a study of cryptocurrency trading infrastructure the WFE surveyed its member exchanges, with 12 of the 29 respondents (41%) saying are already offering crypto-related products or services. A further seven plan to offer them in the future. More than a third said they had no such plans, according to the survey.  The WFE also found that there is generally greater retail demand for crypto products than institutional demand. There is also disparity in the types of products requested, with retail investors more interested in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and stablecoins, while institutional investors are more likely to demand security tokens and custody services.  Only around a quarter (26%) of the respondents said they expect crypto assets to become mainstream within the next five years.  The survey was carried out between May and July 2022, several months before the dramatic collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which sent shockwaves through the industry and heightened existing concerns around cryptocurrency with regard to opaque business practices and lack of regulatory clarity.

Deribit's derivatives market volume rose to $42 billion in August, a 17% increase versus July, bucking the global downtrend that saw worldwide derivatives volumes decline 12.1% to around $1.6 trillion, the exchange said in the monthly review shared with CoinDesk. Volume figures represent total activity in options, futures and perpetual futures segments.  ""The resilience can be attributed to the strong performance of our options segment. Notably, ETH options recorded their highest volumes since March of this year. Meanwhile, BTC continues to show strength, initially buoyed by its use as a banking system hedge in March and now further invigorated by the upcoming ETF decision,"" Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call option offers the right to buy and a put gives the right to sell. Deribit controls nearly 90% of the global crypto options activity.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest crypto asset by market value, experienced violent price swings between $25,000 and $30,000, triggering massive liquidations in futures and options on Deribit and boosting hedging demand for call and puts. Deribit's bitcoin implied volatility index (BTC DVOL) and similar ETH-focused gauge surged to 53% and 50%, respectively from their respective historic lows in a sign of renewed demand for options.  More than 5.6 million ether (ETH) option contracts, worth $9 billion at the ETH's current market price of $1,624, changed hands last month. That's the highest single-month tally since March.

The SHIB community had reason to celebrate with the successful relaunch of the Shibarium Layer 2 solution, akin to a tech company unveiling a highly anticipated software update. This event not only breathed new life into the ecosystem but also injected a sense of optimism among SHIB holders. The Shibarium relaunch has elevated SHIB beyond its meme coin status, adding a layer of credibility and utility. Related Reading: Stellar Tough Spot: Will XLM Prices See A Dip Amid Mid-Range Struggles? SHIB Price Analysis Indicates Hope Over the past weeks, SHIB has seen a decline in its price, accompanied by a decrease in trading volume. However, recent price analysis hints at a potential change in the trend. The descending trading volume, coupled with the declining price, often serves as a signal that the downward momentum might be losing its steam. It appears that the market may be running out of compelling reasons to continue pushing the asset lower, providing a glimmer of hope for SHIB enthusiasts. Surprising Popularity Among American Investors In a surprising turn of events, Shiba Inu emerged as the sixth most popular cryptocurrency asset among American investors, according to a recent survey conducted by ConsenSys. Interestingly, 17% of respondents had allocated their funds to this $4.5 billion market-capped asset, placing SHIB ahead of larger and more established cryptocurrencies like Tether and Cardano. Source: ConsenSys The survey also unveiled a prevailing sentiment among respondents regarding the cryptocurrency landscape. Many felt that this asset class needed “heavy regulation” to protect investors due to the prevailing uncertainty. While Bitcoin and Ethereum still held the top positions in terms of popularity among American investors, SHIB’s unexpected rise in popularity signifies a growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. SHIB market cap currently at $4.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Current State Of SHIB As of now, SHIB is trading at $0.00000745, according to CoinGecko. Over the past 24 hours, the asset has experienced a 3.3% decline, while the seven-day performance shows a 9.3% slump. These figures reflect the ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market but also underline the potential for a turnaround as SHIB aims to regain its footing. Related Reading: Pepe Coin September Challenge: Can It Reach $0.000001 Again?

42409740,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOmnL,1693901942,The Relationship Between Bitcoin and Interest Rates Is Breaking Down: Arthur Hayes,"KOREA BLOCKCHAIN WEEK, SEOUL – By all accounts, the United States should be heading into a recession, and risk assets like bitcoin, or tech stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), should be nowhere near their current values, thanks to the steepest Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hike cycle in decades. But the opposite is happening. Economists have increasingly course corrected on their recession forecasts, bitcoin has doubled since crypto exchange FTX’s multibillion collapse, and Nvidia shares are soaring.  “It's different than what's happened before. The standard playbook is starting to break down,” Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX and current Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom, said during a keynote at Korea Blockchain Week attended by CoinDesk.  Hayes argued that the Federal Reserve's moves to raise interest rates to combat inflation have had unintended consequences on the broader economy.  Rising financial asset prices can boost capital gains taxes and government revenue, but when the Fed raises interest rates, these prices can stagnate, reducing tax revenue, Hayes opined.  “All the while, this, coupled with the political hostility of austerity, increases deficits, leading the U.S. Treasury to issue more bonds. The resulting interest payments to the wealthy stimulate spending and nominal GDP growth, creating a paradox where the Fed's rate hikes inadvertently fuel economic growth,"" Hayes said.  ""Whether the Fed raises or cuts, we're in a good position as a cryptocurrency industry,"" Hayes added.  A.I Mania  In a follow-up interview with CoinDesk, Hayes gave a preview of his speech he’s set to give later this month at Token 2049 in Singapore.  Hayes argued that AI companies, due to their significant cash reserves and robust revenue streams, are less reliant on banks for loans or credit than traditional businesses.  “I believe that the global government bond market is basically going to be the one that defaults unless the global central banks print more money,"" he said, pointing out that this would significantly strain the banking system.  “I don't want to own regular businesses because regular businesses need credit. And central banks are paying rates that are incredibly expensive, and the banking system is broke. But AI companies don't need banks,"" he continued. ""If I have extra cash, I'm not going to invest in General Motors, I'm gonna invest in Nvidia.""  Filecoin (FIL), in Hayes’ opinion, is a big beneficiary of this AI-crypto crossover.  Filecoin, which has already experienced a massive hype cycle and saw a significant drop from its peak, is positioned to grow due to the increasing amount of computational power (PetaFLOPS) being added to its network, Hayes argued.  However, Hayes warns that investing in AI now might not yield immediate returns.  Hayes argues that many companies in the space are overvalued, have a lengthy timeline to an IPO or a long token lockup period, and might just have a poor product-market fit with a high number of users but a low number of paying subscribers, meaning that many retail investors might not see a return for a long time if ever.  But this mania might come crashing down. The convergence of three manias—AI, crypto, and money printing—will lead to a significant asset bubble.  ""These three manias together are going to produce the 80-year biggest asset bubble that we've had since the Great Depression in the 1930s,"" Hayes noted.",NEUTRAL,FIL,BTC | BUSINESS | FIL | MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/05/the-relationship-between-bitcoin-and-interest-rates-is-breaking-down-arthur-hayes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1e19fea6516e0d2982a4f8b19325d1f78411ff1-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stochastic indicator, developed by George C. Lane in the 1950s, recently turned down from above 80, indicating a loss of upward momentum. The indicator oscillates between 0 and 100 with readings above 80 implying overbought conditions. Readings below 20 suggest the opposite. A turn lower from overbought levels represents a so-called overbought downturn, which indicates a weakening of upward momentum.  ""At the end of August, bitcoin confirmed an overbought downturn in its monthly stochastics in a setback,"" Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies' founder and managing partner, said in a note to clients on Monday. ""The downturn suggests the basing process may be drawn out, especially given the overhang of the monthly cloud model, which enhances resistance (~$31.9K) from the weekly cloud model.""  The comment refers to bitcoin's repeated failure to scale the so-called ""cloud resistance"" at $31,900 in the past few months and points to a long, drawn-out basing or bottoming process. That's ""a setback toward a long-term turnaround,"" Stockton wrote.  Previous overbought downturns in early 2021 and December 2017 marked major price tops.  The monthly MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, is flatlined near zero, indicating neutral long-term bias.  Crossovers above zero indicate a bullish shift in momentum, while a drop below zero represents a bearish trend change. While the indicator bottomed out a year ago and has yet to turn positive ""suggesting a sustainable uptrend is not yet in force,"" Stockton noted.  Bitcoin changed hands at $25,700 at press time. According to Stockton, the immediate support is seen at $25,200 while the 50-day simple moving average at $28,200 is key resistance.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/05/bitcoin-bulls-face-setback-as-monthly-stochastic-indicator-turns-lower-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0154407289eb15198fc5347434f5d39d53550e0a-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The FSB, a global standard setter, and the global economic agency IMF are presenting the paper at this weekend’s G20 Summit. The paper includes a roadmap on the implementation of policy frameworks for crypto including global coordination, cooperation and information sharing.  The paper was requested by India, which holds the G20 presidency until December. It is a response to a need for “a comprehensive policy response” to the risks crypto presents. Events including the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX and collapse of the terraUSD stablecoin highlight the “vulnerabilities” that crypto faces, which require close monitoring given the growing linkages between crypto and the wider financial system, the letter said.  “The risks of crypto-assets are not confined to financial stability, but can also include macroeconomic risks relating to monetary sovereignty, capital flow volatility and fiscal policy,” Knot wrote.  The paper will highlight the amplified macrofinancial risks that emerging markets and developed economies might face, which could raise the need for targeted measures.  CoinDesk reported in August that G20 nations were asking for the paper to include a call for global collaboration and that India was pushing for concerns around macrofinancial implications and risks specific to emerging markets and developing economies to be included.

17117422,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550021,1693897219,Altcoin Watchlist: Analyst Shares What’s Hot In Crypto This Week,"The crypto market is always in flux, with new narratives and trends emerging each week. Renowned crypto analyst Miles Deutscher recently took to Twitter to share his insights on the altcoin space, shedding light on the tokens that are catching his attention. Crypto Watchlist For This Week Starting with UNIBOT, Deutscher highlighted its recent performance, noting that it’s down significantly (-60%) from its highs. He attributed this decline to a combination of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) and a decrease in key metrics. However, he remains optimistic, suggesting that the accelerated selling might be slowing down. “I used the dip as an opportunity to add to my position. I don’t think there’s a rush – but if you believe in the narrative you’re now getting another chance to accumulate in the double digits,” he shared, indicating a belief in the token’s long-term potential. Related Reading: How Bitcoin And Crypto Are Impacted By The Fed’s Growing War Chest: Report KAVA is another token on Deutscher’s radar. He pointed out several positive developments, including its addition to Fireblocks, a platform that serves as a gateway for institutions. Furthermore, the involvement of DWF Labs and Kava’s role as a gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem for Tether are promising signs. The recent launch of their first perpetual decentralized exchange (perp dex) further underscores Kava’s growing momentum in the market. “Recently added to my accumulation list + I’m watching the chart closely,” Deutscher stated. However, not all tokens are receiving a positive nod. The analyst expressed concerns about GALA, citing internal disputes between its founders. “The situation over there is crazy, with both founders suing each other,” he remarked. This ongoing legal battle could potentially hinder the token’s performance and future developments. Deutscher also raised concerns about GALA’s centralization because of the fact that both the founders own 7,000 nodes and 50,000 nodes respectively, a revelation that emerged from recent documents. In the gaming altcoin space, PYR stands out. Following the turbulence surrounding GALA, liquidity seems to be moving towards other gaming tokens, with PYR emerging as a strong contender and probably the closest counterpart. Deutscher praised its resilience and positive accumulation phase, hinting at its potential for growth. “Upon checking the PYR chart, we rarely see a token in such an extended/positive accumulation phase”, Deutcher remarked. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Cryptos Poised For Final Surge Before US Recession, Here’s Why Another altcoin to watch is Maker (MKR). Currently, the community is abuzz with the news of their “End Game” initiative. Deutscher highlighted the project’s ambitious plans, including the proposal to launch their own native chain and move away from Ethereum. This move, however, has not been without controversy. “Vitalik obviously didn’t like it, as he sold his remaining MKR,” Deutscher mentioned, pointing to the Ethereum founder’s recent actions. Sui Network (SUI) is another token that’s been performing well, with a 70% increase in its Total Value Locked (TVL) over the past month. Deutscher sees potential in SUI, hinting at its explosive growth when it gains momentum: “When SUI pumps, it pumps hard. Definitely not one I’m fading when it wakes up (from a price perspective).” Short Solana (SOL)? Lastly, Deutscher touched upon Solana (SOL), a high-performance blockchain platform, which has recently been the subject of much discussion and speculation in the crypto community. The analyst pointed out that there’s been “negative noise” building around Solana, particularly in relation to the upcoming FTX liquidations. These liquidations have raised eyebrows due to the potential impact they could have on the token’s price. While some in the community believe that the effects of these unlocks and the eventual “forced selling” are already priced in, Deutscher suggests that the current lack of liquidity in the market might amplify the price fluctuations more than many expect. The situation is further complicated by the involvement of Galaxy, who are responsible for handling the funds. They are scheduled to appear in court on September 13th to present a liquidation plan. The figures being discussed are significant, with potential liquidations of up to “$100m weekly, and up to $200m for select tokens.” Despite these challenges, Deutscher remains strategically optimistic about Solana’s long-term prospects. He hinted at the possibility of adding to his long-term positions if a price correction occurs. However, he also noted that the current environment might present “interesting short opportunities” for those with a keen eye and a willingness to navigate the risks. At press time, SOL traded at $19,22. After falling below the 50% Fibonacci level ($20.22), a deeper retracement to $17.33 could be on the cards.

42409739,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOmk2,1693892584,Multibillion Dollar Oracle Tool Chronicle to Expand Outside of MakerDAO Ecosystem,"Chronicle, the second largest oracle provider that safeguards over $5 billion for MakerDAO and its ecosystem, said Tuesday it is expanding outside of the MakerDAO ecosystem with a new protocol that makes oracles available on various networks.  The Chronicle Protocol will soon launch first on Polygon zkEVM to service the fast-growing ecosystem and lay the foundation for integrating another of Chronicle’s key partners, Spark Protocol.  The service will use an estimated 60% less gas fees compared to other providers. Low fees are essential for driving platform usage as oracles are currently one of the largest cost centers for blockchains and DeFi protocols, developers said.  Oracles are blockchain-based services that fetch data from outside a blockchain. Blockchains, by design, are immutable stores of data but can’t verify the authenticity of inputted information. This is where oracle networks help – they refer to multiple sources of information to provide reliable data to blockchain-based services and products for users.  Chronicle will feature a dashboard that users can access to track the origin of any required data - which developers say will ensure on-chain data transparency. It will run on data supplied by over 22 node operators, such as Infura, Etherscan, Gnosis, Gitcoin, Argent, MakerDAO and dYdX.  “Verifiable Oracles at scale are a critical innovation to ensure the integrity of DeFi,” said Chronicle founder Niklas Kunkel in an email to CoinDesk. Kunkel co-developed the first oracle on Ethereum in 2017 to facilitate the creation of SAI, the predecessor to U.S.-dollar-pegged DAI stablecoins.  ""Our commitment to delivering secure, cost-efficient, and verifiable Oracles has driven the development of this market-leading release, uniquely positioning Chronicle and providing a much-needed challenger in a space dominated by a single provider,"" Kunkel added.",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MKR | DAI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/05/multibillion-dollar-oracle-tool-chronicle-to-expand-outside-of-makerdao-ecosystem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba99eff639fa825a9265e4587dd2d17181ecc644-5296x3300.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $220 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair.

On the upside, it is facing resistance near the $216.5 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $235 swing high to the $211 low. Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com A clear move above the $217 zone could send the price further higher. The next major resistance is near $225 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $235 swing high to the $211 low, above which the price might rise toward $235. A close above the $235 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance. Another Decline in BNB? If BNB fails to clear the $217 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $211 level. The next major support is near the $210 level.

17098685,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550001,1693872052,"Bitcoin Stealth Rally: Expert Forecasts Monumental Surge, Ignoring $25,800 Standstill","Renowned crypto expert and market analyst, Doctor Profit, has made bold predictions around Bitcoin (BTC), asserting that the cryptocurrency is poised for a significant bullish rally in the coming months. Despite recent market uncertainties, Doctor Profit remains confident in BTC’s long-term potential, emphasizing the importance of zooming out and considering broader market trends. Bitcoin Surge To $90,000? Bitcoin is currently trading at $25,800, displaying a stagnant pattern within a narrow range of $25,700 to $26,200. The cryptocurrency’s recent attempt to consolidate above $27,000 and surpass its strongest resistance at $28,000 proved unsuccessful. Related Reading: XRP Summer Showdown: Trading Hype Versus Price Reality, What Lies Ahead? Furthermore, the BTC market has exhibited signs of fear and outflows in recent weeks, characterized by low volatility and trading volume. As a result, Bitcoin has lost its previous bullish momentum, awaiting a catalyst that could reignite its upward trajectory. On this matter, while acknowledging the possibility of further market manipulations, pump-and-dump schemes, and the dissemination of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), Doctor Profit advises investors to maintain resilience and navigate through these challenging conditions. According to Doctor Profit, two crucial factors will drive Bitcoin’s surge to new heights. Firstly, the upcoming halving event, a phenomenon occurring every four years that historically triggers a bull cycle in BTC with remarkable accuracy. Secondly, the anticipated approval of a BlackRock exchange-traded fund (ETF), which could attract institutional investors and fuel the BTC frenzy. Doctor Profit points out an interesting correlation between the BlackRock ETF approval and the BTC halving. The deadline for the BlackRock ETF falls in March, just one month before the anticipated halving. This synchronicity, in Doctor Profit’s view, sets the stage for the “ETF, Institution, BTC FOMO” bull market, potentially igniting a period of significant upward momentum. Based on his analysis and historical trends, Doctor Profit forecasts a sudden BTC pump above $30,000, with initial targets ranging from $40,000 to $45,000 in 2023. He further predicts a consolidation period followed by a surge in July or June 2024, projecting conservative targets of $90,000 and optimistic targets exceeding $150,000. BTC’s Price Set For Sideways Consolidation In the short term, Doctor Profit anticipates a sideways consolidation in Bitcoin’s price until the following week. With lower trading volume and fewer data releases, the market is expected to remain calm. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Begin Accumulation As Shibarium Grows He identifies two liquidity pools around the $28,500 region, aligned with the daily MA50 and MA100, as critical levels to monitor. Additionally, he points out a liquidity pool at around $25,200 that could be utilized for quick profit-taking through short-term long scalps. Drawing upon historical data, Doctor Profit highlights September’s reputation as a challenging month for both stocks and Bitcoin. He warns against disregarding this historical trend, cautioning investors against assuming that the current market conditions are different. The chart patterns, liquidity dynamics, psychological factors, and Bitcoin’s cycle all point towards a downward trajectory, suggesting the need for caution and preparedness.
