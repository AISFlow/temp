18421991,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554301,1696546823,"This Trader Thinks Bitcoin Is Undervalued Below $30,000: Time To Buy More BTC?","On X, one trader going by the handle “CryptoJelleNL” is convinced that accumulating Bitcoin below $30,000 can be rewarding. The trader expects prices to not only expand towards all-time highs printed in 2021 at around $69,000 but break above $100,000 in the coming sessions. Although the analyst didn’t give timelines, the “game plan remains the same,” acknowledging that it will be a “tough mental battle” before exiting the market when BTC soars above $100,000, nearly 4X at spot rates. It is not immediately clear precisely at what price the analyst entered. Responding to a tweet, CryptoJelleNL said the strategy is not to buy between $30,000 and around $70,000 because doing so will only increase the average “entry-level.” This strategy was proposed by an X user who preferred dollar cost averaging (DCA) using lower capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Price Won’t Go Down Quietly – Risk of Bounce Grows In DCA, an investor makes periodic purchases of a target asset at low costs to dampen the effect of volatility and reduce the overall entry price. This system can be effective for HODLers, like in the case of CryptoJelleNL, and for traders who can’t time the market. Will Bitcoin Break Above $30,000? Even so, time will tell whether Bitcoin will eventually recover from spot rates, soaring above $30,000 and July 2023 highs. Looking at price charts, bulls have a chance, at least in the short to medium term. Prices remain tight, trading above the $25,200 primary support and $28,000 and $30,000 resistance zone. Moreover, trading volumes are lower, suggesting that activity is generally low, with most market participants not keen to engage at spot levels.

Bitcoin will halve miner rewards in 2024.

18420398,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554292,1696543212,Binance Faces Scrutiny Over Alleged ICO Missteps And Token Distribution Discrepancies,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is currently grappling with challenges that have raised concerns about its credibility and market performance. Recent reports by Forbes shed light on Binance’s initial coin offering (ICO) and the subsequent distribution of its native cryptocurrency, Binance Coin (BNB). Behind The Curtain The investigation reveals allegations of undisclosed token retention, discrepancies in the ICO process, and the accumulation of a significant token reserve by Binance. Related Reading: This Ethereum Metric Is Retesting The Bear-Bull Junction, Will Break Happen? Per the report, in June 2017, Binance initiated its ICO, aiming to raise $15 million by selling 100 million BNB tokens. However, the Forbes investigation, conducted with the assistance of crypto forensic firms, suggests that only around 10.78 million BNB tokens were transferred to investors during the ICO. An additional 20 million tokens were “quietly” allocated to angel investors, doubling their initial allocation to 40 million tokens. Consequently, according to Forbes, Binance likely raised less than $5 million during the ICO, contrary to the $15 million claimed by founder Changpeng Zhao. The Forbes report indicates that Binance’s white paper did not disclose the company’s plans for unsold tokens in the event of an undersold ICO. While it is not illegal for issuers to retain unsold tokens, transparency is crucial in such cases, Forbes alleges. Binance founders and insiders reportedly ended up with 145 million BNB tokens instead of the originally planned 80 million. These tokens, initially valued at less than $10 million, are now estimated to be worth approximately $14 billion. Furthermore, Binance implemented a token buyback and burn program to reduce the total supply of BNB tokens over time. According to Binance’s website, approximately 48 million tokens have been burned as of August 31, 2023. However, Forbes suggests that Binance controls nearly 117 million tokens, accounting for 76% of the total outstanding supply. The analysis combines disclosed tokens issued to the founding team with a proprietary probabilistic analysis that identifies previously undisclosed wallets holding customer funds and serving other corporate purposes. Forbes concludes discrepancies and lack of transparency surrounding Binance’s ICO and token distribution raise questions about the integrity of reported trading volumes and the adequacy of consumer protections. Binance CEO Maintains Silence Amid Ongoing Forbes Allegations Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the Chief Executive Officer of Binance, has remained silent in the face of recent allegations and ongoing investigations brought forth by Forbes. The prolonged exchange of statements between the cryptocurrency firm and the renowned news outlet has endured for a significant period. Binance had taken legal action against Forbes in 2020, filing a defamation lawsuit in the US District Court in New Jersey. The lawsuit stemmed from Forbes’ publication of “false statements” that Binance allegedly used deceptive practices to deceive regulators and participated in money laundering activities. Forbes published a series of articles that made damaging claims about Binance’s corporate structure, asserting that it was deliberately designed to deceive regulators and engaged in activities characteristic of money laundering. Binance vehemently denied these allegations, deeming them false and highly defamatory. Binance’s attorney, Charles J. Harder, has emphasized the harm caused to Binance’s reputation by Forbes’ misleading story. Binance had requested a retraction or correction from Forbes, which was refused, leading to the necessity of the defamation lawsuit.

42392376,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6C0P,1696542775,A Better Way to Distribute Crypto Ecosystem Grants,"The blockchain ecosystem today stands at a crossroads. It's an industry built on the backs of those who work relentlessly to create the future of finance, identity and more. However, it's also a space where recent financial constraints have pushed many stakeholders and businesses to exit prematurely.  Tim Haldorsson is the founder and CEO of Lunar Strategy.  The long-term sustainability of this ecosystem may depend on one crucial lifeline: crypto grants. These initiatives already play a pivotal role in providing the necessary resources to Web3 builders, especially during bear markets when liquidity is scarce.  However, while the idea of non-dilutive funding is noble, things are rarely so black-and-white in practice. There are points of friction affecting the smooth facilitation of crypto grants, and potential ways to improve this crucial flow of capital.  The capital crunch in Web3  To understand the urgency of fair crypto grant distribution, we must first acknowledge the liquidity crunch currently affecting the blockchain ecosystem. Numbers don't lie, there is a significant financial squeeze pressing on the crypto space, affecting how firms plan to grow, hire and invest.  Over $500 million was pulled from crypto asset funds this summer, a resounding blow to the available capital for Web3 startups that has sent ripples of uncertainty throughout the industry. What's more, venture capitalist involvement in the blockchain space has been on a decline for seven consecutive quarters since its peak in Q4 2021.  See also: AI Is Killing Crypto Venture Capital Interest  The result? Layoffs and downsizing have become increasingly commonplace as Web3 projects struggle to navigate the choppy waters of a bear market with limited resources.  Crypto grants: the lifeline builders need  In the face of these difficulties, one ray of hope has emerged: crypto grants. Organizations like Dfinity (ICP), 1inch, Uniswap Foundation, Near, Aave, the Solana Foundation and others have recognized the importance of supporting builders in the Web3 space even in the face of harsh market conditions.  These grant programs act as a buffer against the economic constraints that have caused many crypto startups to fold. They offer a level of financial security that can make all the difference for promising projects, enabling them to continually thrive, innovate and contribute to the ecosystem.  In essence, crypto grants provide an invaluable lifeline for Web3 builders, helping to ensure job security for the professionals in the space who keep the wheels turning behind the scenes.  Challenges in grant distribution  However, it's not all smooth sailing in the world of crypto grants. A major challenge lies in the politics that sometimes affect the grant-awarding process. It’s not unheard of for insiders or well-connected individuals to be favoured over a purely merit-based system. This directly results in a less-than-optimal distribution of resources and, in some cases, negative consequences for stakeholders.  When insiders hold sway in the distribution of crypto grants, it can lead to situations where projects with immense potential falter. The native tokens of these projects might be dumped in the process of backdoor dealings, leading to a loss of value for investors and contributors. This opacity can also lead to promising products and services meeting an untimely end to their life cycles.  Suffice to say, it’s an unsavoury situation that not only affects the immediate stakeholders but also erodes trust in the entire grant ecosystem. So, what is the way forward?  Transparency and fairness  In order to ensure the sustained growth and inclusivity of the Web3 ecosystem, it's imperative that we address these challenges. Grant appraisal and awarding processes should be well-documented, transparent and subject to rigorous oversight to ensure legal compliance at every stage.  A commitment to transparency is paramount to creating a level playing field and safeguarding against any unethical practices that can impact the ecosystem negatively.  The significance of fair distribution of funds and other resources cannot be overstated. When crypto grants are awarded based on merit, rather than favouritism, the entire industry wins, rather than a select group of players.  Fair distribution also attracts more talent and discerning investment to the crypto space. Consequently, innovation becomes more robust, there is more room for diversity and the likelihood of breakthrough projects emerging increases.  Globalisation of crypto grant funding  In our quest for fairness, it's also important to look beyond borders. The globalisation of crypto grant funding can have a profound impact on the Web3 ecosystem. Supporting projects across multiple regions globally is not just an act of goodwill; it's a strategic move that aids the uniform development of the Web3 ecosystem.  See also: Creating a Sustainable Blockchain Ecosystem with Public Goods and Staking  By providing support at both localized and regional levels, we can make a substantial impact in underserved areas with tremendous growth potential. This can effectively bridge the gap between developed and emerging markets while encouraging a diverse range of voices and perspectives to contribute to the Web3 narrative, ensuring that no one is left behind.  Regaining confidence  Crypto grant programs give builders the security and confidence to keep plodding ahead despite the financial turmoil of a bear market. However, to truly unlock their potential, we must prioritize fairness, transparency and global cooperation.  By addressing inconsistencies in grant distribution, emphasizing merit-based awards, and providing support on a global scale, we can ensure that the Web3 ecosystem continues to evolve, thrive and ultimately fulfil its promise of a more decentralized and inclusive future for all.  Crypto grants should not be a privilege reserved for a select few but a resource accessible to all. The time has come to embrace these principles wholeheartedly and work together to distribute crypto ecosystem grants fairly, for the benefit of builders, stakeholders and the entire Web3 community.",NEUTRAL,ICP,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ICP,Tim Haldorsson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/05/a-better-way-to-distribute-crypto-ecosystem-grants,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3645399eda3b1ff252ecde2d02350afa2a0a81d-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Through Blackbird, which is built on Coinbase's Layer-2 Base blockchain, customers tap their phone on a near field communication (NFC) reader (the devices which allow smartphones to connect to payment readers) and create a non-fungible token (NFT) membership. The NFT is then minted when users “tap in” to the restaurant.  Blackbird memberships unlock rewards and insider perks such as off menu items and SMS concierge, said a press release.  The project has garnered mainstream attention partly because its CEO is Ben Leventhal, a co-founder of the dining network Resy; the New York Times published a feature this week about Blackbird without mentioning the word ""crypto"" once.  Flypaper and $FLY tokens  But behind the scenes is a blockchain-based infrastructure and a decentralized ethos. Diners can also earn fungible $FLY tokens, and Blackbird's website links to a ""Flypaper"" that lays out some of the mechanics.  ""Blackbird will be the first decentralized platform built especially for the hospitality industry,"" the paper reads. ""Unlike legacy rewards marketplaces which maroon and lock earned points, the Blackbird protocol will eventually allow users to take the points they earn anywhere they go on public blockchains.""  Blackbird has partnered with Privy so that users do not need to have a crypto wallet prior to joining; they just have to sign in with their phone number which automatically grants them access to a self-custodial wallet.  Blackbird launched a few months ago and has signed up around 80 restaurants in New York City.  “Web3 enables a powerful, new way for restaurants and guests to connect, making each dining experience unique and more meaningful,” said Arianna Simpson, general partner at a16z crypto.

42392394,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6DKT,1696540018,3 Times Bankman-Fried Allegedly Lied Before He Was Famous,"Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, the biggest financial fraud case since Bernie Madoff, is well underway. A 12-person jury has been selected, and the outlines of arguments from both U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors and SBF’s defense team at Cohen & Gresser have been laid out. Opening arguments were heard yesterday. One of the most pivotal decisions of the trial has yet been made: whether the founder of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX and hedge fund Alameda Research will take the stand.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  As several legal onlookers have already said, SBF on the stand may make or break his case. Prosecutors would likely love the chance to try to ensnare the sometimes-disorganized former crypto mogul in a logical trap, and so SBF’s expert defense lawyers may caution him against it. But SBF loves the spotlight and seems to relish opportunities to explain himself — ultimately, testifying is a decision District Judge Lewis Kaplan has said SBF and SBF alone can make.  When it doesn’t go off the rails, taking the stand can help humanize the accused — on occasion leading to hung juries or reduced sentences.  But should we believe anything Sam Bankman-Fried says, anyway? In court, SBF must pledge to tell the truth under oath and threat of committing perjury. But any penalty will likely pale in comparison to the 100+ years in prison SBF already faces. And either way, there’s something paradoxical about believing the testimony of someone who is charged with multiple counts of fraud.  As Mintz & Gold partner Ira Lee Sorkin, famed lawyer who made a reputation defending Madoff, said on CoinDesk TV: this case circles around “fraud, misrepresentation and lies.”  It turns out alleged lies have been at the center of the Sam Bankman-Fried saga from the start. That’s true from the early days when SBF decided to name his hedge fund Alameda Research (rather than something more fitting like Alameda Capital or Alameda Trading, to stand a better chance of getting a bank account) to the last days at FTX, when SBF regrettably tweeted his exchange was solvent in a failed bid to regain trust amid a run on customer assets.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried’s Two Multimillion-Dollar Jets May Be Forfeit, DOJ Says  Here are three other anecdotes from SBF’s past that shed light on his personality.  Clean break?  Reportedly, when Bankman-Fried quit Jane Street, the quant trading firm on Wall St. that serves as a halfway house for many a high-achieving graduate of MIT and Stanford University, he was not immediately escorted off the premises. Despite the firm being as secretive as they come — it makes its money often on the razor’s edge of proprietary information it doesn’t want to get out — SBF was allowed to stay at the firm after announcing his intention to quit. This is because, as Bloomberg’s Annie Massa, Hannah Miller and Max Chafkin noted in their “Spellcaster” podcast, SBF said he was leaving to pursue work in the non-profit sector.  Instead, Bankman-Fried, already committed to the semi-utilitarian philosophy of Effective Altruism, which says to maximize the good you can do in the world you must maximize your profit, was beginning to secretly build Alameda Research. He would go on to recruit about 20 likeminded effective altruists who all but Caroline Ellison, the one day co-CEO of Alameda and future girlfriend of SBF, lacked trading experience. Bankman-Fried worked at Jane Street for three years, and reportedly applied many of the firm’s arbitrage principles to crypto trading.  Kimchi, dried up  Alameda, founded in 2017, made early profits with a version of the “kimchi premium,” a known strategy that arbitraged the price difference between bitcoin in the U.S. and South Korea, where capital controls and regulations make bitcoin more expensive. Alameda saw a similar opportunity in Japan, and tapped wealthy EA members Luke Ding and Jaan Tallinn for the $50-$100 million seed funding to get the trade going. While the this regulatory and jurisdictional arbitrage reportedly made Alameda several millions of dollars per day at its height, several early Alameda employees have gone the record saying SBF’s other bets were money losers, including failed bets on ETH and XRP, and over-the-counter trading on “sh*tcoins.”  Eventually, the arbitrage window closed, and Alameda’s consistent source of profits dried up. Although during the heady days of 2021-22 Bankman-Fried would recount the trade as a legendary period, it’s likely that the firm actually blew through any accumulated profits, which is why it sought outside funding for venture capitalists. In fact, Alameda co-founder Tara MacAulay led an attempted mutiny to oust SBF, after his accumulated losses began to add up, discredited his commitments to the EA cause. SBF reportedly rejected the $1 million buyout offered him, so many of Alameda’s earliest employees including MacAulay left to start their own firm called Pharos Capital.  See also: Bitcoin 'Kimchi Premium' Fades  Writer Eric Falkenstein speculated, “Alameda had virtually zero accumulated profits at the end of 2018, after the Kimchi trade that most think funded FTX.” Which is why SBF turned his attention to raise VC dollars.  The first VC  Ding and Tallinn, who were essentially Alameda’s first investors, eventually demanded their money back, but not before he tapped Alexander Pack, who claims to be Alameda’s first venture capitalist backer. Although their “high-level agreement to become Alameda's first investor” ultimately fell through, Pack’s telling of his attempts to do due diligence are illuminating. Midway through the investment process, Pack learned that Alameda began losing money because SBF turned his focus to building the exchange FTX rather than trading.  “This is a big conflict of interest: in 2018, Sam tried to use our investment in Alameda to start FTX, an entity that we neither knew of nor owned,” Pack wrote on the microblogging site then known as Twitter.  Of course, the bigger conflict of interest is the idea of an exchange owner also owning a trading firm that could trade against the exchange’s customers. And despite SBF’s claims that the two firms were separated by a firewall, it now seems that was pretty porous. FTX and Alameda shared offices, shared employees and it would seem shared capital — the reason SBF is in court today.  While the above anecdotes are still just allegations, if true it shows that SBF has always been the type of person willing to lie to get ahead.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/05/3-times-bankman-fried-allegedly-lied-before-he-was-famous,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29befffc701838582217d0cdaa64a2585534eca8-2328x1228.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18418757,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554296,1696539622,"Justin Sun Unstakes 20,000 Ethereum (ETH) From Lido Finance, What’s Going On?","A crypto wallet associated with Justin Sun, the co-founder of Tron, a smart contract platform, has moved 20,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth roughly $32.4 million from Lido Finance, a liquidity staking platform. Funds were transferred to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, trading volume and client count. The transaction, executed in a single batch, was captured by The Data Nerd, an analysis platform, and shared on X on October 5. As it is, Ethereum (ETH) is under pressure, looking at the performance in the daily chart. Ethereum Drops 4%, Are Bears Flowing Back? Trackers show that the coin is down roughly 4% in three days, confirming sellers of October 2. Notably, the daily chart has a double bar formation with the bear candlestick of October 2, completely reversing buyers of October 1. This arrangement suggests that bears could be in control, especially considering the draw-down of the past few trading days and the level of participation on October 2 when the coin slipped. Related Reading: Analyst Who Put Bitcoin Price At $130,000 Says You Should Buy BTC Now, Here’s Why In technical analysis, losses at the back of increasing volumes often point to high participation. If prices are rising, then the coin in question could rally. Conversely, a sell-off could worsen if the bar had high trading volumes. It is also unclear whether Justin Sun plans to sell ETH after transferring coins to exchanges. Crypto transfers to centralized exchanges, which support many stablecoins like USDT and others, are often associated with sell-offs. Market participants may interpret such movements as bearish, fueling the sell-off, subsequently heaping more pressure on prices. ETH is now at a one-week low. Justin Sun Shuffling ETH In 2023 The Data Nerd observes that prices fell the last time the wallet moved ETH to Huobi, which has since rebranded to HTX. In August, the wallet moved 5,000 ETH to HTX. The deposit came a week before ETH prices crashed 12%. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices fell sharply in mid-August, causing a “cascade liquidation” that spooked investors. ETH bulls have since failed to reverse those losses. Considering the relatively low trading volumes in the last two months, prices are still boxed within the August 17 trade range, a bearish signal. Related Reading: XRP, Polygon See Month-High Volumes As Investors Show FOMO In late February 2023, Justin Sun staked 150,000 ETH, worth roughly $240 million, to Lido Finance. The transfer remains the largest single-stay transaction, forcing the liquidity staking provider to activate the Staking Rate Limit feature, capping the amount of coins one can stake at 150,000 ETH. Lido Finance said the feature is more of a “safety valve” that “addresses possible side-effects such as rewards dilution, without needing to pause stake deposits explicitly.” Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/justin-sun-unstakes-20000-ethereum-lido-finance/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

It is important to note that Bitcoin is presently trading below the $30,000 mark. Hence the popular YouTuber may have to wait a few years before leaving the market for good. Crypto YouTuber Sets Price For Bitcoin Exit A crypto investor and YouTuber, ‘InvestAnswers’ recently published a YouTube video that featured a question-and-answer session with his subscribers. In the video, the YouTuber discussed various topics including AI, Meta, Google, and others. Related Reading: Pro-Bitcoin Presidential Candidate Wants To Save BTC From The White House Focusing on crypto, he described his Bitcoin exit plan in detail, stating his desire to leave the cryptocurrency once it has attained a hefty market value of $142,000. The digital asset investor explained that he had high hopes for BTC’s price and was expecting the cryptocurrency to reach a price value of at least $89,000. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is approximately $27,693, miles below the price cap InvestAnswers has set for an exit. The cryptocurrency has also experienced a significant amount of losses this year due to unfavorable market conditions and volatility. Bitcoin also had a minor price slip-up last week, declining to about $27,500 after reports revealed a significant inflow of BTC in Kraken. According to reports, Bitcoin’s September performance this year has been one of the strongest since 2012. InvestAnswers has stated a few of the market metrics and developments including Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF have influenced the recent positive trend in Bitcoin. Analysts Relay Positive Outlook On BTC’s Price With the Bitcoin spot ETF potentially launching in the crypto space and other major innovative crypto developments advancing the ecosystems, many investors believe that BTC is on the verge of a bull run. Several analysts have made compelling predictions for the price of BTC in the last few months, stating that the cryptocurrency could enter a bullish position once it pushes past the $30,000 mark. These predictions match up with InvestAnswers’ hopes for Bitcoin’s price rise to fuel his exit plans. The crypto investor has stated plans to sell out his equity to invest in several cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash To $10,000?

BTC is in a bull market for defies market rout in equity and U.S. Treasury bond trading, ByteTree CIO says.  Bitcoin (BTC) briefly surged above $28,000 during Thursday U.S. morning hours, then dropped to as low as $27,300 as traders took the opportunity to sell the rally.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at $27,500 recently, flat over the past 24 hours, but still outperforming the wider crypto market. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which features a broad basket of digital assets, was down 0.3%, while ether (ETH) slid 1.8% over the same period.  “In the near term, I expect the market to sell into this rally,” John Glover, chief investment officer of Ledn, told CoinDesk in an email. “In the absence of new capital flowing into digital assets, I believe that this is what this rally will be: short-lived.”  Glover expects a more durable appreciation will materialize later this year and early next year as bitcoin appears to be finished with its corrective move. “I do believe that BTC prices will be higher in three months than they are today as technically we’ve completed the sell off and I now look for a sustained rally into Q2 2024,"" he said.  Bitcoin as safe haven from surging rates  Investment research firm ByteTree upgraded its BTC market signal from neutral to bull in a report on Thursday. The crypto’s recent price action has defied a rough period for traditional financial markets, offering a safe haven from a rout in equity and bond trading.  “Bitcoin futures look good, especially when you compare them to the crisis in the bond market,” Charlie Morris, chief investment officer of ByteTree, said in the report. “[It] is the true safe haven from Uncle Sam’s bonds.”  He pointed out that BTC is beating the U.S. stock market at a time when surging bond yields wreak havoc on traditional markets. When interest rates peak and the bond sell-off ends, BTC will be “off to the races,” he said.  Morris noted that during BTC’s latest corrective move, the crypto held above the key $25,000 level, which capped the price between May 2022 and March 2023.” If we can hold that [$25,000 level], which we probably will, BTC is very much in a bull market, albeit a quiet one,” he said.  Even if BTC is shaking off rising yields, it has remained “trapped in its $26,000 to $30,000 cage,” according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst of the Americas at forex trading firm Oanda.  “What is also preventing crypto investors from becoming more optimistic is that the bond market sell-off refuses to end and that will cripple many crypto startups,” he added.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/05/bitcoin-enters-quiet-bull-market-as-safe-haven-from-bond-market-turmoil-analyst-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce3f2cad856b339403a7b8751eddbd24763ccd7d-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18415677,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554287,1696532443,Massive Redistribution: Sui Foundation Retrieves 117 Million SUI Tokens From Market Makers,"The Sui (SUI) Foundation has announced its latest initiative to strengthen its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, reclaiming 117 million SUI tokens worth $51.3 million from external market makers. The tokens will be redirected into various channels to support the growth of the Sui Network. This Layer 1 blockchain has gained recognition for its scalability since its mainnet launch in May. Per the announcement, the reallocation of these tokens will not impact the circulating supply of SUI, as they were previously released. In addition, the Sui Foundation has already earmarked 25 million SUI tokens to award winners of its liquid staking hackathon, which was announced earlier this week. Sui Foundation To Support Developers With Repatriated Resources According to the Sui Foundation, the influx of resources from this initiative is expected to support Sui’s community of builders, developers, and ecosystem participants, fostering growth in the coming months for the protocol. Related Reading: Good Bitcoin News: Supply Keeps Falling To Lowest Since 2018 As Whales Keep Buying The newly repatriated resources will be channeled towards several key areas, including offering grants to developers for building decentralized applications, supporting Sui’s state-of-the-art DeepBook CLOB, automated market makers, and liquid staking and lending protocols. Sui’s DeFi ecosystem, which, according to the announcement, has demonstrated strong adoption, will be a primary beneficiary of these new allocations. The network recently achieved its highest Total Value Locked (TVL) at approximately $38 million, marking a growth of over 100% in the past two months, according to DefiLlama, a leading DeFi TVL aggregator. Furthermore, the Sui Foundation team believes these recent achievements have been remarkable, especially considering the short time since its mainnet launch. The network set an industry record by executing 65.8 million transactions daily, surpassing all other blockchains. Per the announcement, Sui’s scalability remained intact despite the concentrated traffic, with the cost per transaction unaffected. Within just over four months, the network has attracted over 6 million active wallets. Additionally, Sui introduced zkLogin, a unique native feature that enhances privacy and security by enabling users to access decentralized applications through their existing Web 2 social accounts. A Bright Future For The Network? Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation, expressed optimism about the network’s future growth, emphasizing that the milestones achieved thus far are only a fraction of what the network aims to accomplish. Siourounis stated: The milestones reached by Sui and its community in its first five months have been remarkable, but they represent only a fraction of what this network was built to achieve. Today’s reallocation represents a key influx of resources that will provide a new tailwind for Sui’s community of builders, developers, and ecosystem participants and fuel Sui’s ecosystem growth in the coming months and beyond.

Data Reveals Shocking Numbers As of the current writing, the native token of the protocol, SUI, is trading at $0.4389, reflecting a 2% increase over the past 7 days.

The Swan and Blockstream tie-up will enable users to retain ultimate control of their bitcoin (BTC) while knowing that it is stored in a secure way offline, the two firms announced Thursday.  Collaborative custody, in this instance, refers to a multi-signature wallet scheme combined with third-party assistance for things like backup and transfer, thereby enhancing the user experience of bitcoin storage, the firms said.  Crypto platforms often face the challenge of offering users the peace of mind their assets are secure without having users keep personal responsibility of their financial safety, through managing their own keys and so on.  However, the collapse and capitulation of several centralized crypto platforms — most notably crypto exchange FTX in November 2022 — reminded many unfortunate users who lost access to funds of the adage ""not your keys, not your coins.""  There is a natural demand for services that can offer both greater security of assets and a straightforward user experience simultaneously.

42392392,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6DFL,1696529391,Michael Lewis Was Charmed by Sam Bankman-Fried – But So Was Everyone Else,"Many crypto insiders hate Sam Bankman-Fried. Now, they have turned their wrath on the author Michael Lewis, who on 60 minutes referred to FTX as “a great real business.”  “If no one had ever cast aspersions on the business, if there hadn't been a run on customer deposits, they'd still be sitting there making tons of money,” Lewis continued, sparking an uproar on crypto Twitter. Because even if the former FTX CEO didn’t have malicious intent, he’s still associated with the disappearance of billions of dollars and regulators’ growing disdain of crypto. So why does Lewis appear to be on his side?  Emily Parker is CoinDesk's executive director of global content.  This question wouldn’t matter so much if Lewis’s book, “Going Infinite,” hadn’t come out on the first day of Bankman-Fried’s trial, and if Lewis himself hadn’t described his book as “a letter to the jury.” And even if Lewis doesn’t convince the jury, his fame and accessible writing style could certainly sway mainstream public opinion.  To be fair, Lewis’s book is more nuanced than his media sound bites. He does not paint a particularly flattering picture of either FTX or its sister company Alameda Research, which was allegedly gambling away FTX customers’ money. “It was never clear where Alameda Research stopped and FTX started,” Lewis writes. He refers to a document that describes how “more than $10 billion that was meant to be custodied by FTX somehow had ended up inside Sam’s private trading fund.”  But the bigger question is: Why did this all happen? Overall, Lewis does seem to view Sam as an agent of chaos rather than someone with criminal intent, which is essentially what Sam’s defense is saying. The basic argument is that billions of dollars is a lot of money and it can be quite tedious to keep track of it all. Sam was messy, inconsiderate and a nightmare of a manager, Lewis seems to believe, but not a thief. (For some counterarguments, see David Z. Morris’ scathing CoinDesk article, “FTX’s Collapse Was a Crime, not an Accident.”)  Nor does Lewis portray Sam as a particularly nice guy. Despite his commitment to “effective altruism,” he seems to have little to no empathy for other human beings. But, Lewis says, “with him it was never personal. If he stood you up, it was never on a whim, or the result of thoughtlessness. It was because he’d done some math in his head that proved that you weren’t worth the time.”  In another passage, Lewis describes how one of Sam’s colleagues rationalized his behavior: “She could never be upset with him for the mess he left for her to clean up, because she knew that he never intended to make a mess.” In other words, Sam might have caused a lot of damage, but it wasn’t on purpose. Lewis even goes as far to say, “he set out to establish FTX as the world’s most regulated, most law-abiding, most rule-following crypto exchange.” We all know how that turned out.  Much of the research for the book was written before the fall of FTX and the revelations that followed it, which means that some observations did not age well. “His mom and dad were law professors at Stanford who had basically zero interest in money and were bewildered by what had become of their son,” Lewis hears from Sam. The world has since learned that Sam’s father wanted to earn a $1 million salary from FTX, and enlisted his wife to help with this cause.  CZ contrast  The book’s relatively sympathetic treatment of Sam becomes more striking in contrast to depictions of his adversaries, such as Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Before the book was published, a letter from Creative Artists Agency circulating in Hollywood said Lewis likened Sam and CZ “to the Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader of crypto.” Traces of this characterization still made it into the finished book. “Binance was the class bully, FTX the class nerd, and each took pleasure in using its special powers to torment the other,” Lewis wrote. He also said, “Sam thought about the size of the pie, while CZ cared more about the size of his piece.” There’s also some gratuitous shade, such as, “If CZ ever had an original thought he never expressed it.”  Another extremely unfavorable portrayal is of John J. Ray III, the restructuring lawyer who took over FTX after Sam resigned, and who famously said he had never seen “such an utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization.” Lewis portrays Ray as stubborn and clueless.  The industry’s fury at Sam might seem like progress, but I’m not sure that it is  Then there is Lewis’s narrative of FTX’s precipitous downfall, and in particular of the role of CoinDesk, the company where I work. On November 2, 2022, CoinDesk published an article showing that Alameda’s balance sheet was largely made up of FTT, a token Sam minted out of thin air. This raised questions not only about Alameda’s viability, but also about its relationship with FTX. CZ then tweeted that Binance was liquidating its FTT. Not long after that, FTX was finished.  My colleague Ian Allison’s article is widely credited with sparking FTX’s collapse and has won several major awards. But it is not loyalty to CoinDesk that makes me think that Lewis plays down the article’s revelation in a rather curious way. He waves it off with “in and of itself the article struck people inside of FTX as of no more than prurient interest.” Despite the huge amount of attention the article got at the time, the book only cites one sole reaction: another crypto journalist’s snarky “congratulations on knowing something we knew two years ago.” In a footnote, no less. The larger issue is that Lewis portrays the Alameda balance sheet as a relatively trivial matter that was already known. But it wasn’t. The balance sheet was a big deal, and for good reason. It was the first time any serious doubt was cast on FTX’s once untouchable empire.  Lewis fully admits that he initially fell for Sam’s charms. He even told a friend something like, “Go for it! Swap shares with Sam Bankman-Fried! Do whatever he wants to do!” But really, can you blame him? Sam had pretty much everyone under his spell. Celebrities. Politicians. Venture capitalists. Even the fashion industry. FTX’s marketing crew apparently sounded out Louis Vuitton about “creating a red-carpet worthy version of Sam’s T-shirt and cargo shorts look.” And while much of the crypto world reviles Sam now, there were almost no dissenting voices when FTX was flying high.  The bottom line is that one company should never have had so much power, especially in an industry that is supposed to be about decentralization. The industry’s fury at Sam might seem like progress, but I’m not sure that it is. This is not just a “bad apple” problem. If crypto was working as it should, one person would never have been able to do this much damage.  Therein lies one of the sharpest insights in Lewis’s book. Blockchain technology is supposed to remove the intermediary and thus the need for trusting human beings. Instead, too many people put an absurd amount of trust in Sam’s ability to lead an opaque web of companies and later to be the savior of a troubled industry. The crypto world is still reeling from the consequences.  As Lewis writes, “In crypto finance, founded on a principle of mistrust, people trusted total strangers with vast sums of money.”",NEGATIVE,FTT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH | BNB | FTT,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/05/michael-lewis-was-charmed-by-sam-bankman-fried-but-so-was-everyone-else,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f704d6eab62bbe2bae44e6cd9cd1c82a7f5f7cb8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18414027,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554270,1696528803,"This Ethereum Metric Is Retesting The Bear-Bull Junction, Will Break Happen?","On-chain data shows the Ethereum MVRV ratio is currently testing a level that has historically served as the boundary between bear and bull markets. Ethereum MVRV Ratio Is Retesting Its 180-Day SMA Right Now The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Ethereum market cap and realized cap. The former is naturally just the total supply valuation at its spot price. At the same time, the latter is an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the value differently. The realized cap assumes that the real value of any coin in circulation isn’t the spot price (which the market cap refers to) but the price at which it was last bought/transferred on the blockchain. One way to look at the realized cap is that it represents the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency, as it considers each holder’s cost basis or buying price. Related Reading: Here’s The Level Bitcoin Must Conquer If Rally Has To Return Since the MVRV ratio compares these two capitalization models, it can tell us whether the investors hold more or less value than they initially invested in Ethereum. The indicator’s usefulness is that it may serve as a way to determine whether the asset’s price is fair or not right now. When the investors hold a value significantly more than they put in (that is, they are in high profits), they would be more tempted to sell, and hence, the spot price could face a correction. Similarly, the holders as a whole being in deep losses can instead be a signal that the bottom might be near for the cryptocurrency, as it’s becoming quite underpriced. Now, here is a chart shared by analyst Ali on X, which shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV ratio, as well as its 180-day simple moving average (SMA), over the past few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X The 180-day SMA of the ETH MVRV ratio has interestingly held significance for the cryptocurrency. According to Ali, “Ethereum market cycles transition from bearish to bullish when the MVRV (blue line) breaks strongly above the MVRV 180-day SMA (red line).” During the bear market last year, the ratio had been below the 180-day SMA line, but with the rally that began this year in January, the metric had managed to break above the level, and bullish winds supported the asset once more. During the recent struggle for the asset, however, the MVRV has again slipped under the level. Related Reading: These Are The Altcoins To Keep An Eye On: Santiment Nonetheless, in the past few days, the ETH MVRV has been trending up a bit and approaching another retest of this historical junction between bearish and bullish trends. It remains to be seen whether a retest will happen in the coming days for Ethereum and if a break towards the bullish territory can be found.

The analyst is back again with another prediction and this time around, he is telling investors to get into the market with reasons to back it up. Last Chance To Buy BTC In a recent post on Tradingview, crypto analyst Tolberti sounded a warning alarm that this is the last chance for investors to buy Bitcoin. The reason for this, according to Tolberti, is that the Bitcoin price is headed toward a massive rally. Related Reading: How Have Ethereum Futures ETFs Fared So Far? Data Reveals Shocking Numbers Tolberti points to bulls having successfully broken through a major descending trend line which he points out on the BTC 12-hour chat. The analyst explains that this is the last chance to buy Bitcoin at this low price given that “This trendline has been destroyed by the bulls, and we also had a successful retest of it!” As for where the Bitcoin price is headed, Tolberti believes that it will hit $39,000 toward the end of 2023. However, he warns that this is not going to be smooth sailing with resistance already at $29,167 where the 0.618 Fibonacci has been established in the previous wave. BTC price chart to $39,000 | Source: Tradingview.com On the longer time frame, using the Elliot Wave pattern, the analyst puts a “strong nest (1-2-1-2) or an expanding leading diagonal wedge (1-2-3-4-5).” at the $24,900-$28,500 range. “Both of them are bullish patterns and support the start of the bull market!” Tolberti explained further. However, the analyst expects the Bitcoin price to perform poorly at the start of 2024. “I am prepared for the bull market that is coming in the next few weeks until January,” Tolberti said. “Expect January to be a bearish month.” Where Is Bitcoin Price Headed? Tolbert’s most recent Bitcoin price prediction focuses more on the short term for the last three months of the year. But his previous predictions give a more clear view of where he expects the price to reach, especially during a bull market. Related Reading: Pro-Bitcoin Presidential Candidate Wants To Save BTC From The White House In September, the crypto analyst posted an analysis in which he put the Bitcoin price as high as $130,000 by 2025.

Sometimes, though, all it takes is luck.  A trader on Taiwan’s MaiCoin Max crypto exchange is 10 Million NTD ($310,000) richer, not because of trading profit but rather a monthly lottery involving tax receipts.  This particular trader didn’t dive deep into some small-cap token that went to the moon, but rather has his fortune because MaiCoin pays its taxes.  Taiwan enforces tax compliance on retailers through something it calls the “Uniform Invoice Lottery.” Retailers that make over a certain amount in revenue are required to give the customer an official receipt, and an electronic copy of the receipt is sent to tax authorities.  This receipt doubles as a lottery ticket number, and every month, the authorities run a draw for a series of cash prizes, starting with the grand prize of 10 million NTD ($310,000).  For MaiCoin, every time a trade is made on its platform, the profit on the spread it makes and the service fees it collects are a taxable event; therefore, its top traders might have dozens, if not hundreds, of these virtual receipts.  The scheme was first introduced in Taiwan in the 1950s as a way to incentivize tax compliance by downloading the enforcement to the consumer. People making trivial daily purchases, such as newspapers or snacks, sometimes find themselves much richer after the monthly draw.  While tax authorities around the world struggle with how to capture tax revenue from crypto, Taiwan might have found a solution in a decades-old scheme.

XRP, Polygon See Volume Spike Similar To Bitcoin’s Surge A Few Days Back According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, XRP & MATIC have seen high volumes recently. The “trading volume” here refers to the total amount of any cryptocurrency that’s being transacted on the different exchanges in the sector every day. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the asset in question is being moved around a lot on the exchanges. Such a trend implies that traders are actively participating in the market right now. On the other hand, low values suggest the interest in the cryptocurrency may be low at the moment as not much trading activity related to it is happening on the platforms. Related Reading: Here’s The Level Bitcoin Must Conquer If Rally Has To Return Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator for XRP, Polygon, and Bitcoin over the past month or so: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin trading volume had become pretty high a few days back when the asset’s price had surged toward the $28,500 mark. This spike in the volume had come with a delay, however, as its peak had occurred after the cryptocurrency had already started on its pullback. This could be a sign that once investors saw the rally, they felt like they had to FOMO in, so they quickly made some trades, but many of these investors had arrived late to the scene, hence why the spike had come later. The volume would have also been fueled by the panic sellers who bought at the top but sold as soon as they saw that the rally was already starting to cool down. During the past couple of days, XRP and Polygon have also seen some recovery surges (although the rises haven’t been anything too impressive) and the trading volume has also shown similar spikes for these cryptocurrencies as well. At the peak of this latest surge, the volume of these cryptocurrencies had managed to hit its highest level in about a month. “FOMO is high right now,” notes Santiment. Related Reading: These Are The Altcoins To Keep An Eye On: Santiment It would appear that just like with BTC, investors had started jumping on these cryptocurrencies once they saw the rally. Those falling for FOMO, however, would have once again faced disappointment, as both XRP and MATIC have already retraced their latest recovery attempts. If the trading volume continues to stay high even after the pullback, though, then it would be a positive sign for the prices of these altcoins, as it would mean that there is still significant demand for them at these lower price levels.

42392393,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6DPb,1696521594,"Sam Bankman-Fried, Other FTX Execs Committed Financial Crimes, Co-Founder Wang Testifies","NEW YORK – FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried committed financial crimes, co-founder Gary Wang said after taking the stand late Thursday.  Wang, the fourth witness called by the U.S. Department of Justice in Bankman-Fried’s trial, said he committed wire fraud, securities fraud and commodities fraud alongside Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, who ran Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research hedge fund, and former FTX executive Nishad Singh. (Wang, Ellison and Singh all pleaded guilty to charges shortly after Bankman-Fried was arrested.)  “We gave special privileges to Alameda Research to allow it to withdraw unlimited funds [from FTX] and lied about it,” Wang said.  Bankman-Fried faces fraud and conspiracy charges stemming from the collapse of his crypto empire, which prosecutors said was a “house of cards” during opening arguments on Tuesday.  Alameda had the authorization to withdraw large amounts of funds as well as a large line of credit that was “essentially without any limit,” and could place orders slightly faster than other market makers, Wang said.  Wang followed Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang, who testified about his company’s past investments in FTX. The company invested around $278 million or so across different rounds in FTX and FTX U.S., he said. Asked how Paradigm currently values the FTX equity it holds, he said: “we marked it to zero [dollars].”  Software bug  A software bug that resulted from the unusual way FTX handled customer deposits overstated how much its sister company Alameda owed the exchange’s customers by $8 billion, another witness said earlier Wednesday.  A key piece of the relationship was banking. In FTX's early days, customers deposited fiat by wiring money to Alameda rather than FTX directly, former FTX developer Adam Yedidia told the court. This unusual relationship complicated how the companies tracked debts owed to customers. Yedidia said there was a bug in the accounting software that by June 2022 showed Alameda owed far more money than it actually did.  Prosecutors zoomed in on a conversation Yedidia and Bankman-Fried had on a tennis court. Yedidia had just patched the accounting bug in mid-June, he said, which incorrectly said Alameda owed FTX customers $16 billion. In doing so, he discovered there was still an $8 billion debt, and “was concerned.” Bankman-Fried told him, “we were bulletproof last year, but we’re not bulletproof this year.”  The bug fix occurred shortly after Bankman-Fried met with Singh, Wang and Ellison to discuss getting a full accounting of FTX and Alameda, said Yedidia, who was testifying under a grant of immunity.  Yedidia told the jury he resigned from FTX after learning Alameda was using customer funds to repay creditors.  “I learned that Alameda Research had used customer ... FTX customer deposits to pay back its loan to creditors,” he said. Asked what he did then, Yedidia responded: “I resigned.”  The defense began cross-examining Yedidia in the late morning before breaking for lunch. The judge admonished defense attorney Christian Everdell for repeating the same questions too many times.  Inside the Courtroom  Bankman-Fried walked in just before 9:30 a.m. nodding at people in the gallery, seemingly greeting them with a shy smile before searching for his parents, who were seated on the right side in the second row.  He fidgeted during the testimony, though he worked on his laptop for much of the trial as he has in previous days.  Joseph Bankman, Bankman-Fried’s father, took notes the entire time, passing them to Bankman-Fried’s mother, Barbara Fried. Fried held a pen in her hand but seemed more focused on listening to the testimony.  One juror fell asleep while Yedidia explained how deposits at FTX worked.  Read all of CoinDesk's coverage here.

42392386,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6Cph,1696520700,Crypto for Advisors: Waiting for the Next Crypto Bull Market?  It’s Already Here.,"When crypto prices were hitting new highs in 2021, we frequently received texts from friends such as, “Wow, look at <insert favorite token here>!” When we asked if they owned said token, responses were often, “Only a little, and now it’s too late” or “I missed it - again.”  Why is it so hard to catch the “bull” before it goes stampeding past?  Famed investor John Templeton said, ""Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die in euphoria.” In other words, bull markets start from the lows of the bear, when risks are prominent and sentiment is poor.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  2023 is a great example.  Crypto markets limped into this year having survived one of the worst market environments ever in 2022. Bitcoin fell 64%, while many other tokens fell 80 to 90%. Crypto firms FTX, Celsius and others went bankrupt, and regulators made it clear they were going to hold the industry accountable. Meanwhile, the Fed was raising rates at the fastest pace in its history while simultaneously shrinking its balance sheet. As we started 2023, regulatory and macro risks loomed large; the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a gauge of crypto market sentiment, indicated “Extreme Fear.”  Against this gloomy backdrop, January 2023 was one of crypto’s best months ever. Bitcoin was up 40% and Ethereum up 33%; 7 of the top 100 tokens were up over 100%.  Were risks overblown? We don’t think so. The Fed has indeed continued to raise rates four times in 2023 and shrunk its balance sheet by over $500 billion. In June, the SEC sued both Binance and Coinbase, the two largest crypto exchanges, alleging they failed to properly register. Many other enforcement actions followed.  In our view, the risks facing crypto at the end of 2022 were very real but more than adequately reflected in prices. Extreme pessimism set the stage for the beginning of a new bull market.  Today, risks have changed significantly. The Fed’s interest rate increases are much closer to an end than a beginning. While rate cuts may still be 9-12 months away, the market often anticipates the Federal Reserve’s actions months before they happen. The SEC continues its prosecution of crypto, but the U.S. courts have handed the industry some major wins in the Ripple and Grayscale cases. At the margin, macro and regulatory risks are still significant but declining.  We think we’re entering the “skepticism” phase of this bull market. Despite 2023’s fast start, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index was showing “Neutral” as of Wednesday. Spot trading on centralized crypto exchanges fell to $475 billion in August, the lowest in 3 years. While Bitcoin is up +66% YTD, at $27,525 it is trading -60% below its all time high of $69,045.  Major companies continue to announce crypto initiatives. Google is actively investing in blockchain and Web3 capabilities. Paypal recently announced it would be the first major U.S. financial institution to launch its own stablecoin.  And Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager and one of the most admired global brands, has filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF:  We think a Blackrock-branded Bitcoin ETF will do more to accelerate mainstream adoption of digital assets than anything that’s happened in the history of crypto. There are still regulatory hurdles to clear, but we think it is a matter of when, not if.  Still skeptical? Templeton might call that bullish.  – Jennifer Murphy, CEO, Runa Digital Assets  Ask an Advisor: How Blockchain is Transforming Traditional Finance  With a spot ETF possibly coming, is now the time to buy BTC?  Two parts to this answer. First, If you have an investment thesis you like, you go with it. You also need to make sure you’re not looking at this as a gamble, and you’ve determined your appropriate allocation, risk, etc. Whether you’re playing short-term trade or long-term hold, you need to have a plan.  Second, if you think (as I do) that a spot BTC ETF will be approved soon, this might be a good time to make an allocation. An approval would likely send the price of BTC and ETH much higher. At that point, you can determine if you want to re-allocate, or just hold your crypto for a longer period.  How do my clients not get burned in the next bull run?  First, let them know you understand and can help with an allocation to crypto. Next, do some of your own due diligence, and have a strategy for those that want to allocate to crypto. Choose the on-ramp, custodian, and services you’ll offer. Then, have the conversations with your clients about their investment theses, risk profile, and allocation.  If your clients understand their investment thesis, how crypto fits their portfolio and how to keep it safe, they’re less likely to get burned.  As we keep saying…have an investment thesis and plan.  – Adam Blumberg, Interaxis  Keep Reading  America’s long awaited trial of Sam Bankman-Fried started this week..

18409572,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554244,1696518030,"2024 Crypto Cliffhanger: VC Firm Co-Founder Warns of Bitcoin, Ethereum Collapse","In a recent post, investor Chris Burniske expressed the belief that a bottom is looming for the top cryptocurrencies. Burniske predicts that Bitcoin and Ethereum could dip as low as $20,000 and $1,000, respectively, with top altcoins, except Solana (SOL), hitting new lows. Notably, BTC retraced from $28,000 to slightly above $27,600, with ETH seeing a similar decline in the past few days. Crypto Analysts Predicts Market Bottom Ahead Of Bull Run According to the founder of Placeholder Capital, Chris Burniske, a bull market will likely begin soon. However, the analyst believes the upcoming bull run will be preceded by a bottom cycle in the present financial quarter (Q4 2023). Furthermore, Burniske believes that this bottom will lead to declining crypto prices. According to his analysis, fear is high but only temporarily, as sellers are exhausted. Burniske believes the predicted lows for the top cryptocurrencies will present attractive buying opportunities in preparation for the upcoming bull market. Fear is high, but temporally and price-wise, selling exhaustion is near imo. Sure $BTC could go to low $20Ks & $ETH to low $1Ks & most everything long-tail (except $SOL) can hit new lows, but when we look back on Q4 2023 & Q1 2024 it’ll be clear it was a good time to be a buyer. https://t.co/I6hpKCw1Q8 — Chris Burniske (@cburniske) October 4, 2023 The crypto analyst supported his predictions with Linear charts, stating that it is easy to spot tops and bottoms with such charts. For context, Linear charts show the change in the price of an asset. Burniske believes it is up to traders to choose their accumulation style with patience and persistence. What Lies Ahead For Bitcoin And Ethereum? Bitcoin trades at $27,697, with a 0.56% price increase in the last 24 hours. Ethereum’s, on the other hand, is $1,639, with a 0.45% 24-hour decline. Meanwhile, BTC has encountered stiff resistance at $28,000, leading to a decline to $27,000 in the last few days. The asset formed a bottom on the daily chart on September 11 before the buyers forced a price recovery. Although BTC recovered slightly, the sellers have continued to re-enforce the $28,000 resistance. If the selling pressure increases, a decline to the $25,141 support level is possible in the coming days. Moreover, the green MACD Histogram bars have faded, confirming a drop in buying pressure as sellers reclaim dominion. Also, the RSI is dropping from the buy zone and displays a value of 61.54. If the RSI drops below 50, BTC may resume the downtrend in the coming days. If Bitcoin drops further, a bottom cycle will likely begin in the crypto market. The potential decline to the $25,142 support level could facilitate a bull cycle. The reason is that it presents an attractive entry level for the accumulation phase. Ethereum To Follow Similar Trend As Bitcoin Also, ETH displays a similar price trend to Bitcoin, with a prominent dip likely to occur in the coming weeks. ETH is in a downtrend on the daily chart, forming lower lows as sellers continue to dominate the market. Based on its historical data, it formed a bottom on September 11, after a similar decline before rallying on September 12. Therefore, ETH will likely return to the $1551 support level to form a double-bottom pattern before another rally. Also, its Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) shows a weak buy signal with fading bullish histogram bars. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator displays a value of 49 and will likely drop to the oversold region. Based on ETH’s past price action, traders should expect further decline in the coming weeks before a recovery.

42392395,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6DUj,1696518000,Blockticity Mints Hemp and Cannabis Certifications on Avalanche,"Blockticity, a startup that focuses on providing certificates of authenticity for possessions through blockchain, has minted certifications for $275 million in products on layer 1 Avalanche, according to a press release. The first round of minting includes hemp, psychedelic mushrooms and kratom.  The minting is done through its Certificate of Analysis (COA) as a non-fungible token (NFT) verification system. The first minting includes hemp, psychedelic mushrooms and kratom for U.S. hemp and cannabis lab, ACS Laboratory. The hemp, cannabis, mushroom and Kratom industry faces supply chain transparency challenges according to the company’s website. ACS tests for potency, assurance of no chemicals or pesticides in the products.  The aim of minting the certifications is to allow users to trace the COAs back to the original laboratory, access product’s test results and avoid fraudsters from exploiting the COAs through QR code tampering or data alterations, the press release read.  Sundie Seefried, CEO and president of Safe Harbor Financial, previously said in an interview with CoinDesk that a regulator expressed to her that crypto and cannabis could be a good match because blockchain technology provides a good traceability factor for funds derived from cannabis plants.  The way that the process works is Blockticity prints a QR code on the products and the QR code then links to a COA minted as an Avalanche NFT. So far, ACS Labratory has used Blockticty to mint over 35,000 COAs which accounts to a value of around $275 million.  Through minting a COA onto blockchain that is coming from the lab, Blockticity authenticates the report from the lab. Companies can then look up a COA and use the QR code to find that report owned by the firm who paid to perform the test, according to a previous statement.  ACS Laboratory’s next 120,000 scheduled COAs are for cannabis, according to the press release.  “We’re pleased to join forces with Blockticity once again, harnessing this avant-garde technology for our esteemed clients,” said Roger Brown, president of ACS Laboratory. “This technological leap allows any COA viewer to trace its origins and detect any discrepancies.”  ACS Laboratory and Blockticity previously collaborated in November 2021 to launch its first national hemp COA as an NFT on the NFT platform Moonwalk.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/05/blockticity-mints-hemp-and-cannabis-certifications-on-avalanche,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d768b6bcc7707afabcae2adec888b79837d5e294-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The current trading environment remains uncertain as sideways price action persists, but new data points to potential gains. Related Reading: Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit $750,000, Here’s When As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $27,700 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. On higher timeframes, the cryptocurrency records profits; the previous week, BTC experienced a 4.4% rally, according to data from Coingecko. Bitcoin News And Data Point To Favorable Price Action? A report from Bitfinex Alpha indicates that the current Bitcoin supply on exchanges has been dropping since May 2023. This metric stands at its lowest in five years, or since 2018, when the price of Bitcoin was in the early stages of a new investment cycle. The report indicates around 2.03 million BTC on crypto trading venues, as seen in the image below. The decline of BTC supply in the market represents good Bitcoin news due to its potential to ignite another bull market. The report claims: As the bull market began to take off, reserves on exchanges dropped, as crypto prices soared. This seemed to imply that as investors moved their Bitcoin off exchanges, its scarcity on the platform might have driven its price up. The chart above also shows that the cryptocurrency’s price reacts to spikes in BTC supply on crypto exchanges. Each bull market has its peculiarities, but they all need a decline in supply to enter price discovery. Moreover, the report points out that a minority of long-term investors capitulated during this crypto winter. These investors continue to hold their coins and exert a more significant influence on the supply/demand dynamics as short-term investors get shaken off the market. Less Selling Pressure For Bitcoin The status quo in the Bitcoin market continues to evolve, and recent data points to a potential change in short-term holders. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, used to measure supply/demand dynamics, indicates that both long-term and short-term holders are more inclined to hold “their Bitcoin holdings for longer periods of time.” Related Reading: XRP Battle With Resistance: Could A Crucial Update Propel The Altcoin Forward? Furthermore, the new market dynamics hint at the formation of the early stages of a bull market. The report stated: The 12-18 month supply holders are now in a position to make a profit on some of their holdings. While this is normal for early bull markets, it is key to note that long term holder supply remains inactive and even short-term holder supply that has been acquired mostly during the bear market at sub $20,000 price or even early 2023 at slightly higher prices remains inactive.

42392384,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6CaJ,1696514400,Banks Would Have to Disclose Crypto Holdings Under New BIS Plan,"Banks will have to disclose cryptocurrency holdings under new plans floated Thursday, as international regulators partly blamed banking collapses on the sudden popularity of crypto.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which sets norms for lenders in traditional finance (TradFi), has already said banks should issue potentially prohibitive capital for their holdings of unbacked crypto such as bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH).  After a turbulent year that saw the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, as well as digitally focused lenders Signature and Silicon Valley Banks, the standard-setter now wants to see lenders reveal their exposure as it seeks to cut contagion.  A consultation paper to be published soon will propose “a set of disclosure requirements related to banks’ crypto asset exposures,” complementing existing capital requirements for digital assets that were finalized in December, the Committee said in a statement.  The Basel grouping, which includes bank supervisors from 28 global jurisdictions including the U.S., U.K. and European Union, had previously said it will monitor crypto norms and modify them if needed, but does not appear to have previously flagged the idea of separate disclosure rules.  In a report published Thursday, the Committee set out some thoughts on what it called the “most significant system-wide banking stress” since the 2008 financial crisis – with crypto in the firing line.  The sudden popularity of crypto was also badged as one of three structural trends indirectly responsible for the March TradFi turmoil, alongside the growth of non-bank financial intermediation and faster digital payment systems that let depositors withdraw quickly.  Signature Bank, the New York financial institution that shuttered on March 12, “failed to understand the risk of its association with and reliance on crypto industry deposits,” and executives didn’t acknowledge that fears over crypto instability might also encourage other customers to withdraw funds, the report said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/05/embargo-banks-must-disclose-crypto-holdings-as-regulators-rake-over-signature-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edde49346e18546cfbfd8f4ac62494edd86c8f82-799x533.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Data Reveals Shocking Numbers,"Apart from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum Futures ETFs have been the talk of the crypto industry for months as investors look toward a catalyst for the next bull run. However, data has shown the highly anticipated ETFs have had underwhelming results in trading volume. Although the crypto market has witnessed some gains in the past few days, this hasn’t flowed into Ethereum Futures ETFs as investors seem hesitant to adopt these new Ethereum investment vehicles. How Have Ethereum Futures ETFs Fared So Far? Ethereum futures ETFs provide indirect exposure to the price of ETH through futures contracts and Nine Ethereum Futures ETFs were introduced to the market on Monday, October 2nd. These include ETFs by ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, and other financial firms following a year of anticipation. Related Reading: Pro-Bitcoin Presidential Candidate Wants To Save BTC From The White House As the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, many expected the ETFs to take off quickly and piggyback on the early success of Bitcoin Futures ETFs. However, data shows the trading volume for these new products has remained relatively low so far. According to a report by Bloomberg, these nine futures ETFs attracted $1.92 million in the 24 hours after launch. Most of this trading occurred in the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF which contributed over 45% of trading volume. Pretty meh volume for the Ether Futures ETFs as a group, a little under $2m, about normal for a new ETF but vs $BITO (which did $200m in first 15min) it is low.

At the moment, the inflows are being led by the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), which has $8.27 million, followed by the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which has $5.96 million. Ether futures ETFs starting see some flows, not a ton, but it’s something, +$15.6m with VanEck in an early lead over ProShares.. pic.twitter.com/e0bu7T0ZLT — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 4, 2023 In comparison, Bitcoin Futures ETFs registered $1 billion in trading volume within the first 24 hours after launch. But it’s important to note that the market sentiment during these two periods wasn’t the same. Bitcoin futures ETFs were launched during the peak of the 2021 crypto bull market, and cryptocurrencies have had major pullbacks since then. Future Outlook Of ETH While Ethereum futures ETFs provide a new way to gain exposure to Ethereum, low trading volume shows they have yet to gain major mainstream interest. These ETFs were supposed to be a sustained catalyst for the price of Ethereum, but this has not been the case. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash To $10,000? Bloomberg Expert Reveals When Ethereum Spot ETFs have also been in the talks, with ARK Invest filing the first application in early September. If granted approval, spot ETFs are more likely to have a better performance than futures ETFs.

42392390,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6D55,1696508341,Friend.Tech Targeted SIM Swaps Worsen as Users Lose More Ether,"Even more Friend.Tech users are claiming that they have fallen victim to SIM swap attacks with an estimated $385,000 worth of ether lost to such exploits since the start of this week.  The Friend.Tech code itself was not exploited. No users are at immediate risk. The application lets holders buy ""shares"" of people who hold an account on X which grants buyers certain privileges.  CoinDesk reported earlier this week that Friend.Tech users were starting to seemingly get targeted in SIM swap exploits.  The attacks have since continued and worsened: In the past 24 hours, three influential accounts from social app X, formerly Twitter, claimed they had been exploited, with the attacker making away with ether held by those accounts.  SIM Swap attacks are a common occurrence and happen when criminals take over control of a mobile phone by tricking service providers to connect that phone number to a SIM card in the hacker’s possession. Swapped phones can then be used for fraudulent activity.  “Been trying to debug and tried every possible email I could've used, can not recover the account anyhow,” X user @SalsaTekila said. “Lost all the ETH there, then on top people trading my worthless keys. Support doesn't help, regurgitates the same automated response.”  Friend.Tech developers today seemed to take steps to mitigate attack vectors by introducing a feature that lets users change their login methods – which could help prevent attackers from gaining access to accounts merely by SIM swapping.  Security experts speak  Social application Friend.Tech has become one of the most popular crypto platforms this year, despite the bear market, generating steady revenues and profits for its creators. The application amassed over 100,000 users in under two weeks after going live.  However, security risks remain a large cause of concern for any crypto platform. Hackers may employ techniques from smart contract manipulation or flash loan attacks, to using a traditional method to exploit wealthy users.  Players of the mobile industry-focused crypto project told CoinDesk in a message that while such SIM swap-based risks remain, there is a small window wherein a potential exploit can be mitigated.  ""When a hacker attempts a SIM swap, defending against it can be straightforward: initiate full re-authentication, encompassing both email and ID, as though it were a new account setup,"" shared Micky Watkins, founder of World Mobile Group, in a message to CoinDesk. ""A challenge arises when a number port is involved. An attacker could visit a mobile store, impersonate the account holder using a business card, and then request to port in their mobile number.""  ""The porting process has a tight window, and during this period, the genuine user might miss crucial warning signs. Once the attacker successfully ports the number, they can intercept two-factor mobile-based authentications. Hence, a robust defence mechanism involves using dual –BOTH– authentication methods: email and phone number for any new device, or better yet, implementing two-factor APP-based authentication,"" Watkins added.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/05/friendtech-targeted-sim-swaps-worsen-as-users-lose-more-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47cdc2633ad1fdf25ddd37d576c6f55697676b7d-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s entire crypto empire was a “house of cards,” which was “built on a lie,” the U.S. Department of Justice said in its opening statement at the FTX founder’s trial. Bankman-Fried’s defense team countered that the former FTX head acted in good faith – even as his businesses grew too quickly and collapsed dramatically through no fault of his own, his lawyers said. They assigned some of the blame to his former paramour and employee, Caroline Ellison, and said she failed to install safeguards. Ellison has already pleaded guilty and will testify during the trial.  The crypto winter hit fundraising in Q3, which fell to its lowest lowest level in three years, blockchain intelligence firm Messari found. The amount raised by crypto firms in Q3 totaled just under $2.1 billion across 297 deals, the lowest on both counts since Q4 2020, according to Messari's latest State of Crypto Fundraising report. From a peak of nearly $17.5 billion across over 900 deals in Q1 2022, the returns diminished throughout the year as conditions in the crypto industry worsened, coming to a head with the sudden collapse of exchange FTX in November.  Some of FTX's employees in the U.S. knew about the backdoor in the exchange that allowed Alameda Research to withdraw billions in customer funds, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday. The employees flagged their discovery to FTX's director of engineering Nishad Singh but the problem never got fixed, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The team, who worked for LedgerX, the crypto derivatives exchange bought by FTX in 2021, was examining whether the code for FTX's main exchange could be used in the U.S when they made the discovery. LedgerX's chief risk officer Julie Schoening raised the concerns to her boss Zach Dexter, who then discussed it with Nishad Singh, one of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's closest deputies.

18404843,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554211,1696507227,Solana Price On Fire: October Red-Hot Prediction – $30 Within Reach?,"Solana (SOL) kicked off the month with a remarkable price surge, surging by more than 10% and decisively breaking through the local resistance level of $22. This substantial move has left traders and investors wondering if SOL has what it takes to sustain this bullish momentum and embark on a sustained recovery. The breakout from the $22 resistance, bolstered by a notable increase in trading volume, suggests a heightened level of confidence among buyers. It’s a clear signal that they are poised for further gains, but the question that looms large is whether this momentum is robust enough to support a prolonged upward trajectory for SOL. As SOL’s price demonstrates its ability to maintain levels above the $22 mark, a price analysis is eyeing an 11% potential gain, which could see the cryptocurrency challenging the $25 threshold. However, a broader perspective reveals that the ongoing recovery in SOL’s price is well within the confines of a channel pattern. Related Reading: Is XRP Growth Real Or Just Smoke And Mirrors? Here’s What Liquidation Data Shows Solana’s Strong Start: Breaking The Resistance Barrier The ascending trajectory of SOL’s price is expected to follow the upper trend line of this channel pattern. A breakout from either of these trendlines could serve as a catalyst for a directional rally, potentially amplifying the ongoing surge. However, the resurgence in supply pressure, coupled with Bitcoin’s recent reversion from the $28,000 level, has introduced a level of uncertainty into SOL’s price action. Analysis emphasizes that this intensified supply pressure materialized around the $24 mark, leading to a minor pullback. This pullback is seen as a valuable opportunity to assess the support strength of the recently breached level. SOL market cap nearing the $10 billion region.

Source: Coingecko The recent price surge has propelled Solana into the limelight, catapulting it to the position of the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Charting SOL’s Course This past week has been especially robust for SOL, marking its strongest performance since mid-July and recording a staggering 38% increase from its September low. However, it’s worth noting that these figures remain a considerable distance from the peak levels seen during the bull market. Solana seven-day price movement.

LedgerX's chief risk officer Julie Schoening raised the concerns to her boss Zach Dexter, who then discussed it with Nishad Singh.  Schoening was fired in August 2022, amid suggestions she had irritated her bosses over highlighting the problems.  Some of FTX's employees in the U.S. knew about the backdoor in the exchange that allowed Alameda Research to withdraw billions in customer funds, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday.  The employees flagged their discovery to FTX's director of engineering Nishad Singh but the problem never got fixed, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  The team, who worked for LedgerX, the crypto derivatives exchange that FTX acquired in 2021, was examining whether the code for FTX's main exchange could be used in the U.S when they made the discovery.  LedgerX's chief risk officer Julie Schoening raised the concerns to her boss Zach Dexter, who then discussed it with Nishad Singh, one of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's closest deputies.  Schoening was fired in August 2022, amid suggestions she had irritated her bosses over highlighting the problems.  “Following a thorough internal investigation, LedgerX has found no evidence that any of its employees were aware of any reported code enabling Alameda to take FTX customer assets, and firmly denies any contrary allegation,"" Miami International Holdings, LedgerX's new owners, said in a statement to the WSJ.  The news emerges at the start of Bankman-Fried's trial in New York where he faces charges of wire fraud. He has pled not guilty to all charges. Singh, who pleaded guilty, is expected to testify against his former boss.  Neither FTX nor LedgerX immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

18403382,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554213,1696504055,XRP Price Breakout: This Resistance Level Holds The Key,"Egrag Crypto, a renowned crypto analyst, delved deep into the XRP price trajectory in a recent tweet, highlighting the significance of the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) in analyzing potential resistance levels and charting out future price possibilities. Using the VPVR metric, Egrag pointed out the Value Area High (VAH) and Low-Value Area (VAL) which demarcate the highest and lowest prices within the 70% total value area, respectively. He noted, “To me, it’s crystal clear: XRP has broken out of a multi-month trend line and has successfully retested the breakout.” XRP Price Faces Stiff Resistance This breakout, as Egrag emphasized, positions the XRP price for a notable surge. However, for XRP to chart a stable long-term trajectory, “Establishing a strong foundation above VAH is crucial.” He further highlighted the significance of XRP crossing the $1 threshold, describing it as both a “structural milestone” and a “psychological barrier.” The VPVR, illustrated in Egrag’s chart, is an essential tool for traders. This histogram (on the right) captures volume traded at varying price points over a specific timeframe. It’s particularly adept at revealing the most actively traded price ranges, making it a robust tool for pinpointing support and resistance levels. Related Reading: XRP Derivatives Volume Soars by Over 200%, Could This Signal A Price Breakout? Egrag’s data suggests a VAL for XRP at around $0.16, a point of control (POC) at roughly $0.20226, and the pivotal VAH at $0.55. On the potential of the XRP price moving past the VAH, Egrag commented, “closing above the VAH $0.55 (in the weekly chart) will be an open high & FOMO will kick in and it could push XRP price to rocket-like levels.” However, it’s crucial to consider that XRP needs to cultivate a fresh volume profile above $0.55. Presently, trading volume above this mark is scanty, which might necessitate an initial pause in the range between $0.55 and $1. Egrag’s second chart reinforces this VPVR analysis. If bulls can conquer the $0.55 resistance, Egrag projects an XRP rally towards the $1 mark, a level last touched in mid-June post the Ripple summary judgment in the case against the SEC. Related Reading: Will XRP Price Defy A 50% Stock Market Crash? Analysts Share Predictions This previous brush with the $1 mark didn’t translate into a sustained surge, indicating the challenges of this threshold. Yet, with patience, Egrag envisions XRP marching towards the “next macro resistance” pegged at a lofty $4.5. 4-Hour Chart XRP/USD On the shorter timeframes, specifically the 4-hour chart, XRP bulls have suffered a setback today. The XRP price fell below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.5273, which could threaten a fall toward the 200 EMA ($0.5168). This thesis could be invalidated if XRP recovers the 20 EMA at $0.5242.

The recent surge in XRP’s price has propelled it into this crucial resistance range, where it has made three unsuccessful attempts to breach in the past seven days. This repeated testing of the $0.54 mark underscores its significance as a formidable barrier for XRP. Despite these challenges, a price analysis suggests that XRP retains the potential to attract strong demand if certain conditions align in its favor. Over the last three weeks, there has been noticeable accumulation of XRP, indicating growing interest from investors. Related Reading: Is XRP Growth Real Or Just Smoke And Mirrors? Here’s What Liquidation Data Shows This accumulation coincided with a previous rally that was sparked by a demand surge following a legal victory for Ripple. However, it remains to be seen whether XRP can find the catalyst it needs to break through its current resistance zone. Ripple’s Singapore License Sparks Hope For XRP Ripple, the company behind XRP, recently made a significant announcement. Its Singapore subsidiary, Ripple Markets APAC Pte Ltd, has successfully secured a Major Payments Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). With this coveted license in hand, Ripple is now authorized to offer regulated digital payment token services in Singapore. This development is noteworthy as more than 90% of Ripple’s business is conducted outside of the United States, with the Asia Pacific region experiencing rapid growth in demand for its crypto-enabled payment solutions. Ripple has made it clear that it intends to prioritize the Asia Pacific region for the adoption of its offerings. XRP market cap at nearly $28 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com However, despite these positive developments and promising signs of accumulation, XRP’s price has struggled to break free from its current resistance line. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.530038, reflecting a 0.9% decline over the past 24 hours. On a more positive note, it has recorded a 6.0% rise over the past week. While the cryptocurrency has managed to surpass the $0.52 resistance level and is currently trading above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), caution is warranted. XRP seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Analyzing XRP’s Current Price And Outlook Market conditions can shift rapidly, and XRP’s future performance hinges on various factors.

42392381,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6CQ3,1696500000,Unpacking the First Day of Sam Bankman-Fried's Actual Trial,"A Parisian cocoa trader told Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial jury that pricey ads and FTX’s confident CEO helped convince him the crypto exchange was a safe place to deposit over $100,000 so he could trade cryptocurrencies – but he never expected that anyone but him would touch his funds.  The federal government began its prosecution of Bankman-Fried in earnest Wednesday afternoon with a customer-turned-witness who introduced the jury to crypto trading, the FTX exchange, and the allegedly illegal loans that felled crypto’s fastest-growing company last November.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Marc-Antoine Julliard, a commodities trader who lives in London, said he only intended to “spot trade” cryptocurrencies on FTX – which is to say, buy and sell tokens like bitcoin. Critically, he said he never agreed to loan his assets out. The finance professional said he avoided FTX’s more lucrative “margin lend” feature because he wanted to have full control over his assets.  “Did you ever consider the possibility that FTX was borrowing your money,” asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Kudla, a prosecuting attorney. Julliard responded: “No.”  More than 100 reporters and onlookers gathered in one of Manhattan’s largest, wood-paneled federal courthouses to catch a glimpse of Bankman-Fried, the 31-year-old who prosecutors say defrauded his crypto customers, investors and lenders of billions of dollars.  In their opening argument, prosecutors cast Bankman-Fried as a calculating villain who told few in his empire about the alleged illegal activity that they said ruined his companies and ravaged investors. They bolstered this image of a secret conspiracy with their second witness, Adam Yedidia, a college friend of Bankman-Fried who followed him to the crypto hedge fund Alameda Research and then on to FTX.  During questioning from AUSA Danielle Sasson, Yedidia said he resigned from FTX the week of its bankruptcy “when I learned that Alameda Research had used customer deposits to pay back lenders.”  The legality of the loans are central to the case against Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors allege Alameda backstopped its bad bets on the crypto market with FTX customers' dollars plus their crypto deposits. Defense attorneys said the relationship between those two companies was neither secret nor illegal.  Bankman-Fried and his companies were “building the plane in flight,” Mark Cohen, who anchors the defense, said in his opening statement. He told the jury his client, a “math nerd,” did nothing illegal but perhaps unwise, like never hiring a chief risk officer to watch the health of his “innovative” crypto exchange. And he began casting blame at former Alameda Research CEO Caorline Ellison, Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend and a key witness, saying that the defendant told her to hedge the trading firm’s risk on multiple occasions but she didn’t.  Day one of witness testimony gave both sides a taste of Judge Lewis Kaplan’s hold on the courtroom. The 78-year old Clinton appointee cracked the rare joke and on occasion lightly tussled with trial teams for asking what he found to be leading or irrelevant questions. In one of the stranger back-and-forths of the day, he challenged prosecutors’ attempts to show the jury a zoomed-in version of the first witnesses’ FTX wallet.  When the DOJ was showing various advertisements, he asked “just so we’re all complete, who’s Tom Brady?” to get an answer on the record. (“He's a professional football player,” Yedidia said.)  He ended the day at 4:25 pm before prosecutors finished questioning Yedidia. That will resume on Thursday. Prosecutors said they hope to call at least two more witnesses this week, including Matt Huang of Paradigm, a venture firm that invested heavily in FTX equity; and Gary Wang, a member of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle.  After the jury left the room on Wednesday, Bankman-Fried’s trial team asked Kaplan to make accommodations for the defendant's adderall prescription. He is not getting the four doses he needs to stay focused throughout the day, they said.  Kaplan deferred on taking immediate action and told them to take the issue up with an official in the Bureau of Prisons.  “I’m not a medical professional,” Kaplan said.  For his part, Bankman-Fried himself was glued to his laptop throughout the day, where he appeared to be typing up notes.  Courtroom Color:  Today we got to rewatch the infamous Larry David Super Bowl ad. One of the male jurors visibly chuckled at the $20 million production, but most of the others looked rather bored. Sam’s mother Barbara Fried whispered something to his father Joe Bankman when Joe’s cameo scene (in Philadelphia’s Independence Hall) played.  What we're expecting  Former FTX developer Adam Yedidia will complete his testimony Thursday, but the anticipated names are more likely to be Paradigm’s Matt Huang and former FTX executive Gary Wang. Huang’s name was first mentioned on Tuesday, and confirmed by prosecutors on Wednesday.  The DOJ’s case so far seems to be focused on casting FTX as a troubled company and Bankman-Fried as the face and director of those troubles. Early testimony was light on the specifics of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Marc-Antoine Julliard, the London-based French commodities trader and FTX customer, briefly told the jury what cryptocurrencies are, saying he invested in coins like bitcoin and dogecoin.  Prosecutors had Yedidia take this description a step further, mentioning that they’re decentralized currencies but not delving too deeply into what that means. It is a tactic seemingly geared toward easing a jury composed of laypersons into what promises to be a complex case stemming from the digital asset ecosystem.  The first set of witnesses is also revealing – no law enforcement officials are expected to take the stand just yet and we’re barely scratching the surface of the technical details about what blockchains are or how FTX actually operated. Instead we’re hearing from people immediately affected – a trader who lost north of $100,000 and still hasn’t gotten it back – and deeply involved in the companies’ operation.  Paradigm was part of a massive fundraising round for FTX US, the U.S. branch of the global crypto empire which raised $400 million in January 2022. Huang being the next witness suggests the DOJ will continue to pursue a witness schedule aimed at expressing the idea that FTX seemed like a safe, “good” place to store funds – but in reality, wasn’t.

In a late Wednesday filing, a forfeiture bill issued by the Department of Justice listed two aircraft, a Bombardier Global and Embraer Legacy, as part of assets belonging to Bankman-Fried that could potentially be seized from him.  Bankman-Fried is currently undergoing criminal trial in New York on fraud and conspiracy charges linked to the collapse of his crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. He has pleaded not guilty.  Data from airplane trackers shows both jets listed as having “private” owners. The two aircraft are the subject of an ownership dispute between the DOJ and FTX, according to a Sept. 21 court filing made as part of bankruptcy proceedings for Bankman-Fried’s former company, which is seeking to recoup funds for the benefit of creditors.  “The Government has taken the position that both aircraft are subject to forfeiture as property purchased with the proceeds of fraud,” while FTX claims ownership on the basis that alleged loans used to purchase the planes were not documented, said the filing by Island Air Capital (IAC).  IAC wants to know who will foot the bill for ongoing repairs and inspections while that dispute is settled, and said that in practice nobody associated with FTX ever flew on either plane as they were still being upgraded when the company filed for bankruptcy.  The Embraer was originally bought by IAC for $12.5 million and the Bombardier for $15.9 million using “financing provided from FTX,” the filing said, detailing an unsecured, no-interest loan agreed to in a ""handshake deal"" between Bankman-Fried and IAC's owner, Paul Aranha.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE,"Shaurya Malwa, Jack Schickler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/05/sam-bankman-frieds-two-multimillion-dollar-jets-may-be-forfeit-doj-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f584d6e027c0e1cdf91b5a710499c296aa685e5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18399899,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554167,1696496418,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit $750,000, Here’s When","In an interview with Tom Bilyeu, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, shared an insightful analysis of the future dynamics he believes will shape the Bitcoin price. At the heart of Hayes’ argument is a complex interplay of global financial mechanisms. Bitcoin Price May Reach $750,000 Hayes began by setting the stage for Bitcoin’s near-term movement, stating, “My working model is that we are going to continue chopping around $25,000 to $30,000 this year.” This forecast draws its foundation from the anticipation of impending financial disturbances and Hayes alluded to the consequences of negative real rates. When nominal rates, driven by government policies, hover between 6% to 10%, he expects a wave of diversification in investment strategies. Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, stand to gain significantly from such a shift. “As we get to some kind of financial disturbance and people realize that real rates are negative, if governments are growing nominal at 10%, 5%, 6%, though it’s high, people at the market will start buying other stuff. Crypto is one of those things,” Hayes remarked. Delving deeper into the dynamics, Hayes extrapolated his prediction into 2024. He mentioned, “Either we face a financial crisis where rates plummet to zero, or we experience a slower increase in rates compared to government expenditure.” In both scenarios, Hayes anticipates a bullish outcome for Bitcoin, seeing it touch around the $70,000 mark by the end of 2024. Related Reading: Will October Be Bitcoin’s Golden Month Again? A Dive Into A Decade Of Bullish Trends Key drivers, in his opinion, would be the Bitcoin halving event, an algorithmic reduction in Bitcoin rewards that traditionally impacts its price, and potential Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) launches by significant asset management giants in strategic global financial hubs, including the US, Europe, China (through Hong Kong). The longer-term prediction, however, is where Hayes’ vision becomes even more expansive. He articulated, “This is where the real fun starts. In my mental model we can go somewhere between $750,000 to $1,000,000 per Bitcoin in the 2026 timeframe. Whatever the number is, it’s going to be a round number, just like Bitcoin hit $69,999. Then it is going down and gets crashed. 75% or 80%, it doesn’t matter.” Hayes firmly believes that such an evolution will come amidst an unparalleled financial boom. Moreover, Hayes’ analysis is not confined to Bitcoin. Drawing parallels, he suggests that this monumental financial growth will cascade across other major assets. Indicators such as the NASDAQ and S&P, he suggests, will also see record-shattering performances. “I think it will be the biggest boom in financial markets we have ever seen in human history. Bitcoin will have a ridiculous price, Nasdaq will have a ridiculous price, S&P will have a ridiculous price. Pick your stock industry. Not just in crypto,” Hayes predicts. Money Printer To Go “Brrrr” Soon? On a separate note, Hayes expressed his thoughts on the broader macroeconomic climate, specifically pointing toward the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy in a series of tweets on Wednesday. He conveyed a belief that if the Fed were to return to its aggressive money printing strategies, it could become a significant catalyst for Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Related Reading: Historical Bitcoin Fractal Pattern Hints At Crash Below $20,000 One of Hayes’ core focuses was on an emergent phenomenon in the bond market called the “bear steepener.” This scenario, wherein long-term bond interest rates rise faster than their short-term counterparts, often serves as a bearish indicator for stocks and riskier assets. Hayes, diving into the complexities of this pattern, remarked in one of his tweets, “Why do I love these markets right now when yields are screaming higher? Bank models have no concept of a bear steepener occurring.” Expanding on potential outcomes of a rapid bear steepener evolution, Hayes highlighted the risks. “The faster this bear steepener rises, the faster someone goes belly up, the faster everyone recognizes there is no way out other than money printing to save government bond markets,” he pointed out, suggesting a potential domino effect that could send Bitcoin, crypto and all financial markets soaring.

42392402,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6Oa1,1696495829,"Bitcoin Holds Steady at $27.6K; Why Are XRP, AVAX Prices Pumping?","Bitcoin held steady above the $27,600 level Thursday as ether (ETH) stabilized from a multi day drop, while XRP and Avalanche’s AVAX jumped.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value gained just over 0.6% in the past 24 hours, seemingly stabilizing above the $27,600 level after losing support at $28,000 earlier this week. Ether fell 0.5%, Solana’s SOL fell 1.4%, while Cardano’s ADA and BNB Chain’s BNB traded flat.  XRP tokens gave back some gains after a 5% jump on Wednesday, following two key developments for payments company Ripple. The firm’s Asian arm was awarded a Singapore license to offer its payment services to users in the region, while the U.S. entity gained a win as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lost a bid to appeal in the Ripple case.  “It's fantastic to see Ripple bat away the SEC's legal action. This further underscores the urgent need for clear and well-defined regulations,” said David Janczewski, CEO of blockchain protection company CoinCover.  “The surge in XRP shows that regulatory clarity is a catalyst for market confidence and will create the responsible growth that policymakers want to see,” Janczewski added.  Ripple has historically maintained a distance from XRP, the token that powers some of its products and the XRP Ledger network. But any progress in Ripple’s court cases, or licenses, clearly has an impact on XRP prices as traders consider the two related.  Why AVAX Saw a Boost?  Avalanche tokens seemed to get a boost as demand increased after popular accounts on social app X, formerly Twitter, seemed to promote an application built on the blockchain.  Stars Arena as it is called, is similar to Friend.Tech, a viral app that allows Ethereum users to buy “shares” of X accounts in return for certain privileges. The platform recorded over 600,000 transactions since Monday, DappRadar data shows.  AVAX prices jumped as much as 6% on Wednesday before retreating, while on-chain data showed a nearly 40% increase in transactions since the start of this week.  Meanwhile, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, told CoinDesk in an email that crypto prices could see an upswing only if developers took steps to become more compliant with regulatory expectations.  “Positive internal factors in the crypto world will lead to capital inflow, such as broader adoption, growing institutional interest, more jurisdictions with transparent regulation, and better technologies,” Lienkha said.  The trader opined spot bitcoin ETFs could also aid a rally in the broader crypto market, with prices expected to touch at least $40,000, considering current developments.  “As of now, the SEC has fewer arguments to reject spot ETFs, so we expect the first approval of spot BTC ETFs will happen in Q4 or at the beginning of 2024,” Leinkha said. “In the case of stock index tranquility, BTC price will increase by the end of the year to the zone of $35,000-$40,000.”",POSITIVE,AVAX | BTC | XRP,AVAX | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/05/bitcoin-holds-steady-at-276k-why-are-xrp-avax-prices-pumping,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c3c5aa37d6e1583db3e7ab22e546bb9be69b2a2-4500x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Dutch central bank (DNB) went beyond legal powers in charging companies to register for anti-money laundering purposes, a Rotterdam court said in two judgments issued on Wednesday.  “The way in which DNB assesses registration requests is contrary to the scope of the registration obligation for crypto service providers” set out in European Union anti-money laundering laws, the court said, adding that under current crypto regulations “it is not possible to lawfully charge supervisory costs for the year 2021 to crypto service providers.”  The legislation is still consistent with general norms of good governance, and the companies should still be regarded as under supervision, the judges said. The ruling has no bearing on costs for 2020, judges said, and a separate legal case is still ongoing for 2022 fees.  The Netherlands, which will shortly have to apply the EU’s tough Markets in Crypto Assets licensing regime, has taken a tough line on crypto firms, imposing millions of euros of fines on Coinbase and Binance for failing to register. Crypto exchange Gemini recently announced it’s quitting the country due to DNB strictures, and Binance transferred its Dutch customers to Coinmerce as it did likewise.  Patrick van der Meijde, president of the United Bitcoin Companies of the Netherlands (VBNL), the industry grouping which coordinated the complaint, said his organization was “pleased that the court has found that the registration obligation as resulting from [EU anti-money laundering legislation] has been violated in the Netherlands.""  “The great costs of this should not have been passed on, because they fall outside DNB's mandate,” van der Meijde added.  A spokesperson for the DNB told CoinDesk it had taken note of the ruling and would consult further with the finance ministry on the issue.  The central bank had complied with Dutch laws and regulations, the DNB spokesperson said, adding that the ruling “confirms our mandate to provide adequate money-laundering supervision of the crypto sector” as well as for other financial institutions.  Financial regulators in Europe are generally not taxpayer-funded, and charge operational costs to supervised entities in proportion to their size. Total crypto supervisory fees in 2022 were 2.2 million euros ($2.3 million), a number which increases each year, van der Meijde said.

The statue will be unveiled on Nov. 2 in Sakura, Japan, on Kabosu’s birthday in collaboration with the City of Sakura, community members told CoinDesk. It is planned to be placed in Sakura Furusato Square, where Kabosu’s parent often takes her on walks.  Fans of Kabosu, the Japanese Shiba Inu dog who inspired the Doge meme and Dogecoin, last year raised money to build the statue – and even want to place it on the moon one day.  “We've been operating for over two years, bringing Doge to places she's never been, including Hollywood, EDM bangers and space (The Doge NFT going on a SpaceX mission to moon),” tridog of PleasrDAO, the community that owns the NFT, told CoinDesk in an email.  “Our goal is to become THE Doge gathering place online for all of the Doge and meme community,” they added.  The community plans to hold interactive events to celebrate the occasion. Attendees will also get to meet the Sato, as well as be rewarded certain privileges based on their NFT holdings.  PleasrDAO, a set of NFT collectors who buy high-priced NFTs and build communities, including Own The Doge, regard DOGE as a short form of ‘Do Only Good Everyday.’ They donate to meaningful charities across the world, with Own The Doge listed as the top crypto giver to Save The Children.  Own The Doge is also working on a doge documentary featuring Kabosu’s life and the meme’s rise.  The doge meme came to life when Atsuko Sato clicked a picture of Kabosu for her blog in 2010. It went viral when John Monarch, the poster who shared that photo from Atsuko's blog, first christened her with the name ""doge"" on Reddit.  That has since become a part of internet culture and was among the first memes. It later spurred the creation of dogecoin in 2013 – and other dog-themed tokens in the years following – with such tokens commanding a market capitalization of tens of billions of dollars at peak popularity.

18397177,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554170,1696490505,Pro-Bitcoin Presidential Candidate Wants To Save BTC From The White House,"Pro-Bitcoin Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has, at different times, jumped to the defense of the flagship cryptocurrency, BTC. This time, he promises to protect it if elected as President during the Presidential elections next year. What Kennedy Wants To Do For Bitcoin In an interview, the Presidential Candidate mentioned that he intends to end the “current White House war on Bitcoin.” This statement is in reference to the anti-crypto stance that the government seems to have taken against Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash To $10,000? Bloomberg Expert Reveals When It is believed that, instead of implementing policies to promote cryptocurrencies, the government has clamped down on the industry and its stakeholders. However, Kennedy plans to change that as he mentioned that he will ensure that people can keep their wallets (self-custody) and that transactions are protected, which could foster the use of Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. Interestingly, Kennedy not only happens to be a Bitcoin proponent but is also heavily invested in the token, as he has up to $250,000 in BTC holdings. He is also ensuring that others get in on the foremost cryptocurrency, as he mentioned in July that he had bought two BTC each for his seven children. Meanwhile, aside from ending the White House war on Bitcoin, the Presidential Candidate wants Bitcoin (and possibly other cryptocurrencies) to be treated as a currency rather than a commodity. That way, Bitcoin isn’t subjected to capital gains. This is because cryptocurrencies are majorly considered property or investment, and owners are usually expected to pay tax on gains from a sale. This isn’t the first time Kennedy has made such an assertion. In July, he mentioned that he planned to back the US dollar with BTC and make the conversion of BTC to the US dollar free from capital gains taxes under his administration. Crypto And Politics Cryptocurrencies have taken center stage ahead of the upcoming Presidential election next year. Noteworthy is the fact that Kennedy isn’t the only candidate who has mentioned plans to stop the “war” on Bitcoin. Republican Presidential Candidate Ron DeSantis has also vowed to protect people’s right to own cryptocurrencies and end “Biden’s war on Bitcoin” if elected. He suggested that the current administration wasn’t so welcoming to cryptocurrencies because it poses a “threat” to them due to its decentralized nature. Related Reading: Crypto Is On The Brink Of Explosion As 9-Year DXY Formation Returns While these candidates continue to cozy up to the rising pro-crypto US voters, many are wary that they may simply be trying to do everything possible to get this particular group of voters in their corner and may not have plans to implement any crypto-friendly policies. However, a former SEC attorney has alluded to the fact that crypto regulation in the country may indeed be political and that there is a higher chance of enjoying a crypto-friendly regulatory atmosphere if a Republican candidate gets elected next year.

42392405,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6Ozf,1696489200,Prediction Market 'Zeitgeist' to Use CoinDesk Indices for Broad Crypto Bets,"Zeitgeist, a prediction market platform on the Polkadot blockchain network, agreed to use CoinDesk Indices' benchmarks as the subject of bets on the performance of two categories of cryptocurrencies.  Traders will be able to bet on the direction of the CoinDesk DeFi Select Index and CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Index, the companies said Thursday. CoinDesk Indices is part of the same company that publishes this website.  ""Utilizing CoinDesk Indices' expertise allows us to offer unparalleled prediction markets on one of the leading crypto index platforms in the world,” said Logan Saether, CEO of Zeitgeist, in a press release.  The DeFi index tracks a basket of decentralized finance tokens: the Aave protocol's eponymous token, Curve DAO's (CRV), Maker's MKR, Lido DAO's LDO, Synthetix's SNX and Uniswap's UNI. The other index measures the performance of the native currencies of multi-purpose blockchains: Avalanche's AVAX, Cardano's ADA, Cosmos' ATOM, Ethereum's ETH, Polkadot's DOT, Polygon's MATIC and Solana's SOL.  “The DeFi and Smart Contract Platform select indices ... provide users with easy access to intuitive segments and key themes of the digital asset space,” said Andy Baehr, managing director at CoinDesk Indices.  Prediction markets let pariticpants bet on the outcome of real-world events, from the highly consequential (the war in Ukraine) to the rather silly (Mark Zuckerberg's fight with Elon Musk). Proponents argue these markets are a superior alternative source of expert opinion. Unlike cable news pundits without skin in the game, in prediction markets, the thinking goes, bettors stand to lose money if their predictions turn out wrong, giving them an incentive to express what they really believe. The more liquid and lucrative prediction markets become, the bigger the attraction for real ""experts"" who know what they are talking about.  However, like crypto, prediction markets face an inhospitable regulatory environment in the U.S., limiting participation.  Polymarket, the leading crypto-based prediction market, is forbidden to let U.S. persons trade on its platform under a January 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). More recently, the agency barred Kalshi, which settles bets in U.S. dollars, from letting users wager on which party would control the chambers of Congress. And PredictIt, which is also dollar-based and for years operated by the grace of a no-action letter from the CFTC, had to take the regulator to court to stay in business.  James Preston, a Zeitgeist spokesman, said the service is unavailable in the U.S.  Zeitgeist was built on Kusama, part of the Polkadot family of blockchains designed for interoperability, but now runs on Polkadot proper, Preston said. It is a small player in this niche. Cumulative volume on all Zeitgeist markets totaled $19,410 as of Wednesday evening, according to the platform's website. compared to $5 million worth of bets on Polymarket's most popular market.

18388359,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554150,1696471225,Celsius Commits To Massive Crypto Repayment: $2 Billion To Creditors By 2023’s End,"Celsius Network, a bankrupt digital asset lender, has revealed plans to begin repaying creditors using billions of dollars in crypto assets before the year’s end. The company presented a restructuring plan, outlined in a recent filing to a US bankruptcy court, which aims to generate funds for a new corporate spinoff known as “NewCo” and facilitate customer repayments. Celsius Vows To Clear $2 Billion Debt According to the filing, the plan outlines a distribution of at least $2.03 billion in cryptocurrency to creditors, with the actual amount subject to fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: FTX’s FTT Price Skyrockets 20%: Here’s Why the Rally Has Just Begun This distribution will occur as soon as reasonably practicable after the plan becomes effective, either through the NewCo transaction or an orderly wind down. The NewCo transaction, sponsored by the Fahrenheit Group, is a key component of the plan. It involves the creation of a new cryptocurrency company owned by customers, focusing on Bitcoin mining and staking. NewCo, which aims to maximize liquidity by listing on NASDAQ, will be managed by experienced crypto-native operators from Fahrenheit. The group has committed to injecting up to $50 million as an equity stake in NewCo, aligning the interests of Fahrenheit and creditors who will own shares in the new company. In the event that the NewCo transaction cannot be completed, the plan includes an orderly wind-down option that would provide creditors with better recoveries compared to a Chapter 7 liquidation. Celsius’s legal representative, Christopher S. Koenig, also revealed that the restructured company, expected to emerge from Chapter 11, will receive $450 million in capital and financial backing. However, the focus remains on the successful execution of the NewCo transaction, which would mark a significant milestone as the first revival of a failed crypto platform under Chapter 11, following the industry’s wave of insolvencies last year. While the approval of Celsius’s plan is under deliberation by Judge Martin Glenn, some customers who have been unable to access their funds have expressed opposition. Additionally, an affiliate of Lantern Ventures owed approximately $82 million, has challenged the plan, claiming overvaluation of the new business by Celsius’s advisors. Clearance from securities regulators will also be necessary for the new venture. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash To $10,000? Bloomberg Expert Reveals When It is important to note that if the new company were to fail, liquidation could become a possibility, potentially resulting in lower repayments for customers. Nonetheless, Celsius Network’s proposed plan represents a significant effort to repay creditors and potentially revitalize the company, providing hope for both the cryptocurrency industry and affected stakeholders. At present, the native token of the company, CEL, is trading at $0.1535, reflecting a 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours. However, it is noteworthy that the token has experienced a notable upward trend in the last 30 days, exhibiting a substantial surge of over 21% during this period.

However, according to one technical analyst on X, this is about to change, especially considering the candlestick arrangement of the SOLETH chart on the weekly chart. Will SOL Outperform ETH In 2024 And 2025? Sharing a screen grab, the analyst who goes by the handle “CryptoGodJohn” on X is optimistic, saying at spot rates, this can be the “right” time for traders to swap their ETH for SOL before the next leg up that will push SOL higher in the next two years. However, whether this will pan out remains to be seen. What’s evident is that the path of least resistance appears northwards, looking at price charts. At the time of writing, SOL is up 71% versus ETH from June. Moreover, zooming in closer, SOLETH prices are teetering around critical resistance levels. Although trading volumes are relatively light and cannot be compared with those of late Q2 2023, sentiment is beginning to shift and favors SOL bulls. The sharp expansion in the year’s second half could be a statement. Related Reading: Is XRP Growth Real Or Just Smoke And Mirrors? Here’s What Liquidation Data Shows The SOLETH is at 0.0134 ETH level, a liquidation level that was last retested in July and January 2023. If buyers push harder, lifting the coin above the 0.0162 ETH level at the back of rising trading volumes, bulls of mid-July will be confirmed. In that case, SOL might stretch gains towards the 0.0265 ETH level and return to the September 2022 zone. Even so, although traders are optimistic, it is not immediately clear how prices will react at spot levels. As it is, the SOLETH in the weekly chart is facing rejection. The present bar has a long upper wick, pointing to a possible sell-off in lower time frames. Will Solana Bulls Reverse The Post-FTX Collapse Free-Fall Of Q4 2022? Additionally, SOLETH prices are still defined by the early November 2022 bear candlestick. The bear candlestick is wide-ranging and has high trading volumes, pointing to the rapid conversion of SOL to ETH in a moment of fear. Around this time, FTX, a once-popular cryptocurrency exchange, collapsed. In 2021, FTX and Alameda Research, the trading wing linked to Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of FTX, invested $100 million in the Solana Foundation. Related Reading: FTX’s FTT Price Skyrockets 20%: Here’s Why the Rally Has Just Begun It is said that FTX and Alameda Research controlled over 50 million SOL. The community feared that with FTX filing for bankruptcy, the over 50 million SOL would likely be sold to repay creditors. In the sessions ahead, whether SOL will reverse the post-FTX collapse drop remains to be seen. Should it happen, SOL gains at least 50% versus ETH.

A Dive Into A Decade Of Bullish Trends,"Bitcoin, the leading digital currency, has often seen its fortunes rise with October’s arrival, and historical data points towards the possibility of a similar trend this year. Over the past decade, Bitcoin’s October performance has been notably bullish, leaving many investors hopeful for a turnaround after recent challenging months.

Analyst Predicts A Decade Of October Gains For Bitcoin Influencer Crypto Tony recently shed light on Bitcoin’s historically positive performance in October. Sharing a decade-long chart of Bitcoin’s track record, Tony highlighted that eight of the past ten years have seen Bitcoin close October with commendable gains. 8/10 OUT OF 10 OCTOBERS HAVE BEEN BULLISH FOR THE MARKETS We are still only 4 days in, plenty of time to see a nice bounce in the month and close green pic.twitter.com/xM4EhD7Jrs — Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) October 4, 2023 The data speaks for itself; in 2021, Bitcoin soared by 39.93% in October, while 2020 saw an increase of 27.7%. In 2017, October ended with a bullish surge of 47.81%, and a 60.79% leap in 2013 is the most significant October gain yet. It is worth noting that this analysis offers more than just numbers. It paints a picture of optimism for many in the crypto community, fostering hope that this October would again be favorable for Bitcoin. Tony, bullish in his perspective, remarked that although Bitcoin’s current price may not seem overly promising, it’s worth remembering we are in the early days of October. Thus, there’s ample opportunity for the market to rebound. Past Performance Vs. Future Predictability However, some in the community advise caution, as with any trend analysis. Relying purely on historical data to forecast future market movement can be a precarious strategy. An anonymous user on platform X (formerly known as Twitter) voiced such concerns, arguing that while the future often exhibits patterns reminiscent of the past, it doesn’t necessarily mirror it. “Skeptical about predicting the future based solely on past results. The future often rhymes with the past but isn’t an exact repeat,” they commented. Notably, despite these reservations, investors often consider the historical positivity Bitcoin showcased in October. Whether or not the crypto will adhere to its previous patterns remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown quite an upward trajectory over the past week.
