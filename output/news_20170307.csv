42379276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82aw7,1488928163,SEC Expected to Decide Bitcoin ETF's Fate By Friday,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission's decision on the much-anticipated bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is expected by Friday, according to a source with knowledge of the agency’s deliberations.  The SEC has an 11th March deadline to make a decision regarding the proposed rule change that would clear the way for the ETF, which would be the first of its kind. Yet because the 11th falls on a Saturday, that decision will come before that date – potentially before Friday, the source said.  The decision, regardless of the outcome, will cap a more than three-year period since investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss first filed with the SEC in mid-2013.  Should the fund receive approval, some analysts have speculated that bitcoin markets could rise as a result. That expected approval appears to be baked into some quarters of the market already, driving the price to new all-time highs in recent days.  The digital currency's price continually neared $1,300 in recent sessions, reaching $1,293.47 on 3rd March, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures show. However, bitcoin prices kept falling back during their climb toward $1,300, eventually experiencing a sharp drop on 7th March, during which markets plunged below $1,200 for a brief period.  On the other hand, analysts have argued that, should the SEC reject the rule change that would allow the Bats Global Exchange to list the ETF, bitcoin's price could be negatively affected.  Phil Bak, who was previously a New York Stock Exchange managing director and currently serves as CEO for ETF issuer ACSI Funds, told CoinDesk that, generally, the SEC seeks to avoid the appearance of ""publicly rejecting an ETF"". He went on to argue that, if the agency didn't plan on approving one of these funds, it would likely ask for the filing to be pulled ahead of any final decision.  Yet according to Bak, the lack of such a pullback so close to the deadline could be driven by other factors specific to the bitcoin ETF.  Bak explained:  ""In this case, the government agency may want to show the world it is unsure about bitcoin. Alternatively, it could also be that the advocates want to support it to the end and let this proposed fund get its day in court, rejection or not.""  'A coin toss'  In the absence of a definitive statement from the SEC, it's perhaps easy to see why a common refrain of uncertainty has emerged the week of the decision.  As Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of exchange platform BitMEX, explained:  ""I have heard good arguments for and against the ETF being approved. At this point it is a coin toss.""  Hayes' exchange is home to an ETF-tied prediction market, where traders can essentially bet on the outcome of the decision, and that has seen significant fluctuations over the past month. At times, traders have given the fund estimated chances of between 2% and 70%, depending on the day. At press time, the prediction market shows a roughly 50% estimated chance of approval.  Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, offered similar sentiment, stating that the fund's odds of receiving approval are ""more than likely plucked out of the air on this one"".  Those close to the industry aren't the only ones comparing the SEC decision to a coin flip.  For example, Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Eric Balchunas recently argued that the ETF has about a 50-50 chance of receiving approval.  The waiting game  For now, at least, those standing by for the SEC's decision can only watch and wait as the 11th March deadline grows nearer.  Yet, as argued by one analyst, those hoping for a conclusion to the years-long process might not get an answer until after that date.  Jeff Bishop, ETF expert and co-founder of investor message board platform RagingBull.com, speculated that, in the end, the SEC could punt its decision further past the 11th – particularly in light of recent price gains.  ""I have the feeling they will find a way to delay this even more though. With bitcoin at all-time highs and the SEC having a terrible record for allowing new ETFs to come to market at absolute tops, they will likely push back on this until things cool a bit,"" he said.  That said, Bishop said he believes the ETF should be approved.  ""It should be up to investors to decide the true price of bitcoin. The more liquidity and options [there are] to trade it, the more transparent and accurate the pricing will be,"" Bishop told CoinDesk, concluding:  ""It should not be up to a government agency to withhold something like this from the public.""

42379275,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82atb,1488909631,Russian PM Orders Research on Public Sector Blockchain Use,"Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has asked two government ministries and a state-owned development bank to investigate public sector blockchain applications.  According to a transcript of a 6th March speech, Medvedev discussed blockchain and other topics before an audience of Russian government officials. After providing a brief overview of the tech, Medvedev said that he has asked the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Economic Development to research the use of the tech in the public space. Further, the Russian Development Bank – a state-backed financial services firm – has also been tasked with the research.  Medvedev went on to say (according to a translation):  ""I gave instructions to relevant ministries - the Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Economic Development - to consider the application of these technologies in the preparation of the program ""Digital Economy'.""  An order  published alongside the comments states that the ministries in question should examine how blockchain could be leveraged ""in the system of public administration and the economy of the Russian Federation"". According to the order, the ministries have a deadline of 11th May to develop their initial response.  Medvedev's remarks come just over a week after he appeared during an investor event in Sochi, during which he said that blockchain ""may thus decisively change our lives"".  The news signals that the Russian national government is aligning itself with efforts undertaken by both the country's private sector as well as its central bank, the Bank of Russia.  The central bank has spearheaded a new fintech-focused working group, led by blockchain-friendly firm Qiwi. The Bank of Russia, too, has pursued research into areas like digital currencies, a process that saw it develop a distributed ledger platform dubbed ""Masterchain"".

42379274,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82asL,1488907249,Local Government in South Korea Taps Blockchain for Community Vote,"A South Korean provincial government recently tapped technology developed by blockchain startup Blocko for a vote on community funding.  The province of Gyeonggi-do – South Korea's most populous – utilized Blocko's Coinstack platform to vote on community aid projects as part of the Ddabok program. Through that program, local residents can propose ideas for aid, after which the provincial government can opt to award budgets to fund those projects.  Yet in the past, that process has largely been conducted behind closed doors by officials in Gyeonggi-do, as the scale of holding a vote using traditional means has proved to be an onerous one.  But in partnering with Blocko, Gyeonggi-do officials held a vote earlier this month as part of an effort to seek alternative methods for approving projects Residents submitted 9,000 votes, in both online and offline settings, resulting in the selection of more than 500 community aid projects.  As Blocko CEO Won Beom Kim explained:  ""We used blockchain and Lua based smart-contracts on our blockchain platform (and) Coinstack to create a dynamic voting process to solve this problem. In this process, offline voters, online voters, and professional representatives all contributed to a fair and deterministic result which resulted in the selection of 527 community projects.""  In statements, officials from the provincial government celebrated the tech's use for the community vote and indicated that blockchain could be leveraged as part of votes in the future.  ""We can complement the limits of representative democracy with some direct democracy systems by using blockchains, the technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"" said Nam Kyung-pil, Gyeonggi-do's governor.  The community vote isn't the first time that authorities in South Korea have tapped Blocko's tech.  The Korea Exchange (KRX), South Korea's sole security exchange operator, hired Blocko to develop a smart contract for authenticating and verifying documents by cross-referencing current bank databases in the country. That private service was first launched last November.

42379265,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82afl,1488895209,MIT Expo Spotlights Bitcoin Tech Concerns,"""We don't have a set foundation to build on yet.""  That's how Neha Narula, director of research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), characterized her institution's outlook on progress (or lack thereof) in the blockchain industry at the fourth annual MIT Bitcoin Expo this week.  Hosted by the student-run MIT Bitcoin Club, the two-day event served to highlight both the scope of the ongoing work at the university, and the difficulties and challenges being faced by the global developer groups seeking to popularize the technology for wider use.  Narula told the audience:  ""[Blockchain technology] has the potential to affect billions of people ... but we also think we are at the very early stages of figuring out what is going on. We are still doing the groundwork. We are defining the layers of the tech stack, and as a consequence, the protocols are still shifting and changing.""  Some of those changes were visible at the conference, where several discussions focused on the all-too-familiar themes of how to scale the bitcoin blockchain while keeping the protocol secure.  So far, the question of how to increase bitcoin's throughput (right now digital currency only handles around seven transactions per second) has divided the community. Some want to scale bitcoin by increasing the block size limit, while others prefer to prioritize off-chain solutions.  Then, there is the question of who gets to make those decisions anyway. Some argue consensus is best left to the protocol's nodes and transaction validators (miners). But here, too, the issue quickly becomes complex.  While all miners are full nodes by default, developers are concerned too few people are maintaining full copies of the blockchain altruistically.  To that end, David Vorick, co-founder of the decentralized cloud storage platform Sia, urged more people to spin up full nodes for the benefit of the network.  Full nodes enforce the consensus rules, so the argument is that if not enough enthusiasts run this component of the network, important decision making will fall into the hands of miners, who may be incentivized differently.  Vorick warned:  ""If you are not running a full node, your opinion on whether or not you like a hard fork is less relevant.""  Reducing bloat  Today, most of the nodes on the bitcoin network are lightweight, simplified, payment verification (SPV) nodes that rely on the records kept by other full nodes. But, the problem with running full nodes, developers argue, is they incur costs, such as 125GB of hard-drive space.  Some developers feel that growing storage requirement is just one more thing causing node operators to drop out of the network.  Consider that a year ago, there were 5,700 reachable bitcoin nodes. That number has now dropped to around 4,900, according to Bitnodes, a website that tracks the size of the bitcoin node network.  Vorick wasn't the only one to focus on bitcoin's health in this area.  As part of an effort to reduce the size of a full node, bitcoin core developer Peter Todd presented a proposal for TXO commitments. Todd feels bitcoin's UTXO (unspent transaction output) database is becoming too bloated, making it more difficult for bitcoin users to run a full node.  Todd told CoinDesk:  ""TXO [proposal] is a change in how you store and transmit that data. It doesn't change the consensus itself. We previously thought it did, but you can actually skip that part.""  Elsewhere, Todd was vocal about wanting to keep the bitcoin block size at 1MB. He feels Bitcoin Unlimited (a proposal for raising the block size limit) would make node ownership too onerous, leading to further centralization and creating a security risk for the network.  Off-chain focus  Other speakers at the event kept the focus away from controversial development ideas. Though one could argue, in doing so, they have simply prioritized one set of solutions for the scaling debate.  Similar to other recent technical conferences, like Scaling Bitcoin Milan, the MIT event saw discussion of so-called top-level or 'layer 2' bitcoin solutions that many argue will require the much-debated Segregated Witness upgrade.  Tadge Dryja, who recently joined the DCI as a researcher, presented a proposal for Lightning Network, which he co-created, in which he made the case for SegWit's benefits to projects like his own. Lightning, which uses off-chain payments for processing transactions, is viewed by many as one of the most promising options for scaling bitcoin without the increase in block size.  Dryja indicated he is currently working on a Lightning wallet software. But unless the network adopts Segregated Witness, which solves the transaction malleability problem, he'll have a lot more work ahead, he said.  He told the audience:  ""This gets really hard when you have transaction malleability. There are ways to do it without Segwit, but it is really annoying, and I have to recode everything.""  Videos of day 1 and day 2 of the event are available on Youtube.

42379251,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82Xbn,1488893982,PBoC Official: China's Bitcoin Exchanges Need Strict Supervision,"The People's Bank of China (PBoC) should continue keeping a close eye on domestic bitcoin exchanges, a central bank official said this week.  According to local news sources, Zhou Xuedong, director of the PBoC's Business Administration unit, advocated for the potential use of blacklists against exchanges that violate the central bank's directives. He also suggested that the PBoC should explore regulating exchanges at the national level and require bitcoin exchanges obtain some form of licensure.  Xuedong reportedly noted:  ""There is a significant risk, one is the risk of customer funds security, the second is the risk of money laundering, the third is the risk of leveraged transactions.""  On the other hand, Xuedong reportedly suggested that the PBoC undertake an ""observation period"" while, at the same time, moving to define so-called ""bottom lines"" to which exchanges need to adhere. He also called for deeper research – something that would likely occur in tandem with the PBoC's experimentation with a central bank-issued digital currency.  The comments come just over two months after it was revealed that officials had met with representatives from China’s bitcoin exchange ecosystem. Those meetings ultimately led to the end of no-fee trading in China and the end of margin trading at those markets.  Xuedong’s reported advocacy for continued observation seems to confirm stated plans by the PBoC to keep a watchful eye, while at the same time requiring changes to existing AML practices in the industry. In February, statements from the PBoC indicated that the central bank would consider closing non-compliant exchanges.

42379247,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XWl,1488891616,State Street Wants to Monetize Blockchain With Artificial Intelligence,"What if you couldn’t fact check the investment data you wanted to buy, but the data was verified by a cryptographically proven, immutable blockchain?  Would you still pay?  One major bank that is solely responsible for managing an estimated 11% of all the world’s financial assets is exploring just such a possibility.  Following a State Street report published last week on the long-term value of blockchain and other technologies, the bank’s executive vice president of global exchange, Lou Maiuri, elaborated on how his group is experimenting with new ways to capitalize on blockchain tech.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Maiuri explained how combining artificial intelligence and blockchain could lead to new revenue streams derived from valuable client data.  He said:  ""Anyone who’s not looking at these pools of data will be arbitraged, will lose out.""  For example, instead of the ""labor intensive"" process of receiving permission from the bank’s clients to physically take possession their transaction data to create current indices, an algorithm could be designed to seek out patterns in the data, yet maintaining privacy with the blockchain’s cryptographic barrier.  While the data itself would remain secure, the trends behind it could be sold.  ""You, in theory, can now put all that data on a blockchain,"" Maiuri said. ""I can never take possession of it, but I can ask questions of the data.""  Faster and cheaper  According to Maiuri, his group is currently exploring how an index might be built using data from State Street clients that is broken down by sector, country, client type and global movement of funds – all without revealing the clients’ identity or even what holdings they own.  In practice, such an index would, say, let clients search out the percentage of mutual funds or other assets being bought and sold in a particular geographic location compared to other investment opportunities or other regions.  Already, State Street has compiled a series of bench marks and indices that it sells to clients, including the State Street Investor Confidence Index, the GX Private Equity Index and the Liquid Private Equity Investable Index.  While a blockchain-based index would still likely require client permission, it would be faster and more affordable to create than the existing method, he said, adding:  ""I don’t see what [the data] is, I don’t have the holdings. That to me is a very interesting way we can create new data sets and help clients monetize, or help your shareholders monetize it.""  Investing with feeling  However, in the current way most people imagine blockchain data, those investment decisions would be restricted to structured data such as transactions records, typically associated with distributed ledgers.  To bring more advanced analysis to investment decisions, State Street is also exploring how to bridge blockchain with textual data revealing how people actually feel about corporate stocks or other investment opportunities.  For the past several months, the bank has been scouring online data to learn how the world feels about its clients’ investments.  Separate from it’s blockchain research, State Street launched a project called MediaStats in September. The initiative harnesses artificial intelligence – or as Maiuri calls it, ""augmented"" intelligence – to read unstructured data collected from 30,000 curated sources and other Big Data outlets serving up news articles, media reports and other textual information.  By detecting changes in the online attitude towards new and existing companies, State Street is already using the service to provide actionable investment opportunities for its clients.  According to Maiuri, though, it might be possible to provide structure to the sentiment data – as is already being done by a number of firms – and set it into a smart contract along with information such as pricing, valuation and risk characteristics to create new types of investment advice.  For example, say an investor owns several hundred shares in retail stocks in a State Bank holding, he said: ""You now have a sentiment signal that’s been an unstructured thing turned into a structured thing.""  Long-term value  As part of its effort to provide long-term value to clients based on a range of technologies, State Street published a report titled ""Finance Remained"" last week.  Citing data from another report sponsored by State Street, the bank said 64% of wealth and asset managers polled expected their firms to adopt blockchain in the next five years. Further, 50% of firms said they expect to adopt predictive analysis within five years and 49% expect to employ artificial intelligence tech.  State Street isn’t alone in identifying this sweet spot of innovation where blockchain, artificial intelligence and predictive analysis meet. Last April, CoinDesk reported that IBM was conducting related experiments, and just months later the firm opened a new Watson artificial intelligence center aimed specifically at blockchain.  And, in January, the head of State Street’s emerging technology center, which also works with artificial intelligence, told CoinDesk it had 10 blockchain proofs-of-concept in the works.  According to Maiuri, State Street is already using at least one of those applications for internal purposes, and is now looking for other ways to increase revenues, and provide better value for clients, by substituting blockchain for a wide range of intermediaries.  Maiuri concluded:  ""We don’t need that third party in the distributed ledger world. This is where I think there can be disruption, or efficiencies brought to the global market trading world.""

42379249,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XZH,1488888007,Will the Internet of Things Need Its Own Blockchain?,"To some, a machine-to-machine economy is inevitable.  Given the increasing trend toward automation, proponents reason, it's only natural that connected devices will become better coordinated into smart, adaptive networks. And with the advent of blockchain, the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) industry has found a new tool to make its vision into reality.  But a key question remains: are existing blockchain designs sufficient to meet the needs of the IoT industry? Or are specialized designs needed to mitigate use case-specific issues?  Innogy Consulting, an innovation and consulting group based in Berlin, for example, believes dedicated technology is needed.  The firm's technology lead, Carsten Stöcker, told CoinDesk that he believes unique blockchain use cases will be adopted by industries, and to that end Innogy has partnered with a project called IOTA.  Stöcker said:  ""In general we believe in the concept of 'special purpose blockchains'. These platforms are designed to meet industry standards and requirements, and to integrate different assets.""  It's the high transaction throughput provided by IOTA's network, an improvement over current cryptocurrencies, that attracted Innogy to partner with the initiative.  Stöcker predicted that, in future, distributed ledger tech like IOTA's will be necessary for smart meters, communication devices, telematics boxes, objects tags, 3D printers, digital assets or media content.  Such dedicated platforms will be a ""key technology enabler for entire new business economics and business models"", he said.  IOTA's play  Stöcker suggested the machine economy will primarily use blockchain tech for micropayments – fractions of pennies paid by machines to other machines to compensate them for performing tasks.  And to date, major public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum haven't successfully proven that they can deliver micropayments at volume due to how they compensate the parties that process and settle payments.  The two main issues are fees and scalability. Specifically, high fees and slow verification disincentivize users from adopting a network.  ""Imagine having to pay an 80-cent fee on each data packet,"" IOTA founder David Sonstebo said.  The IoT has a need for a scalable, robust digital currency network, and a standard protocol that allows many machines to participate via Wi-Fi, LTE cellular networks or peer-to-peer mesh networks.  IOTA – which was first proposed in 2015 and is run by the IOTA Foundation – seeks to sidestep one of the issues by removing fees for using its network altogether.  With its current architecture, the IOTA protocol makes users and validators the same entity – eliminating the need to charge for transactions. In Sonstebo's view, this makes the IOTA network entirely self-regulated and voluntary.  The incentive for machines to join the network is the presence of other machines.  Further, IOTA's main innovation isn't a blockchain in the strict sense, but a cryptocurrency network it calls the 'Tangle' – a ""directed acyclic graph"" architecture allowing, it claims, for thousands of transactions per second.  Sonstebo said:  ""The real beauty of the Tangle is that the incentive is built in, you don't have to pay some other party to secure the network: everyone is equally securing the network. Entirely self-regulated. The incentive is simply to be able to use the protocol.""  The current IOTA ecosystem is reminiscent of many other cryptocurrencies. There are 12 developers working on its tech worldwide, a forum, a Slack community with an over-the-counter trading community for the currency and a web wallet.    The project has also released a white paper detailing the platform's technical details and aspects.  Talking phones  One use case for IOTA's technology was recently showcased at the 2017 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  In conjunction with Canonical, the promotions arm of the Ubuntu operating system, IOTA unveiled a telecom billing solution.  Currently, it is difficult for cellular providers to offer new services to customers because of the high fixed costs associated with creating new billing systems. IOTA provides a solution whereby individual phones can transact with each other by settling transactions using IOTA's network.  Stöcker believes IOTA for telecoms is only the beginning, and that other use cases for the tech will crop up across other industry sectors.  ""We expect that many cyber physical systems, such as supply chains, mobility systems, smart cities or healthcare systems, will emerge and be built upon automated bots and artificial intelligence or machine learning,"" he said.  Already, there are signs suggesting this process has got underway.  During a recent interview with CoinDesk, Maarten Ectors, vice president of Canonical's IoT efforts, confirmed a deal with IOTA.  According to Ectors, the project's technology will be used for a proof-of-concept project with German conglomerate Energie RWE AG starting later this year.
