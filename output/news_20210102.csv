42385490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2473,1609624256,Bitcoin Worth $1B Leaves Coinbase as Institutions 'FOMO' Buy: Analyst,"On-chain data shows big money continues to chase bitcoin amid the frantic bull run. That's a sign of institutions catching the ""FOMO"" bug, according to one analyst.    Institution-focused Coinbase Pro exchange registered an outflow of over 35,000 bitcoin worth more than $1 billion early Saturday, according to data source CryptoQuant.  The large outflow comes a day after 12,063 coins left the exchange and represents institutional FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying, according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of the Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.  Massive outflows from Coinbase Pro usually end in Coinbase's cold wallets for custody, which is directly integrated with the exchange's over-the-counter (OTC) desk. Institutions typically transact over-the-counter in a bid to avoid influencing the spot market price, as discussed in December.  Bitcoin's rally from October lows near $10,000 has been mainly fueled by institutional demand. The ascent has gone ballistic over the past four weeks, with prices rising from $19,000 to over $30,000.  While Ju's claim that institutions are now buying on fear of missing out can be challenged, there is evidence that persistent demand from big players is creating a supply squeeze, allowing for a continued price rally.  For instance, at least 47,000 bitcoins have left Coinbase Pro in the first two days of the year, while miners have minted just over 1,700 bitcoin. Bitcoin rose from $29,800 to new record highs over $33,000 early today and was last seen changing hands near $31,600.  The cryptocurrency is already up 10% this year, having scored a 300% gain last year, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

42385498,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB24IN,1609603238,"More Aussies Back Bitcoin, the Underdog","In January this year, the world watched in horror as sky-high fires tore through 44 million hectares of Australian bushland, engulfing property, wildlife and humanity. Then, just as victims were emerging from the ashes, COVID-19 arrived and the local economy went into lockdown. Gross domestic product shrank 7% in the three months through June, unemployment rose as high as 7.5% and Australia entered its first recession in 30 years.      Beyond the bleak news headlines and broader economic downturn, I have uncovered evidence to suggest that a sizable chunk of the Aussie population see bitcoin as a ray of hope.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Adrian Przelozny is CEO of Independent Reserve, a cryptocurrency exchange.    In November 2020, we conducted the annual Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index (IRCI) where we surveyed over 1,100 ordinary Australians to get a gauge on their current feelings about crypto. Crucially, we didn’t seek out existing crypto users, nor did we sample the users of our own exchange. We wanted to hear from everyday Australians from all walks of life and made our survey representative of Australian demographics.      The data revealed their confidence and trust in digital currencies had significantly improved. Almost one in five Australians now owns crypto, and, at 91.4%, nearly everyone had heard about it. But what is perhaps more poignant was the big change in how many people were inclined to think bitcoin is a scam – only 17.3$ are wary about it now, down from 21.3% in 2019. Instead, Australians are now more likely to view the world’s dominant crypto as a store of value, an investment vehicle or money.      We witnessed that growing confidence on our exchange, too, as we welcomed new traders in droves. Our worst month for account registrations in 2020 counted 50% more new signups than our best month in 2019. These are some of the most extraordinary growth numbers we’ve seen since Independent Reserve began in 2013.      To me, this proves that Aussies are getting behind crypto like never before, which isn’t surprising when you know how we love to back the underdog. That old story – one of willful perseverance and stoic resilience in the face of adversity – is baked into our national psyche. We love to see the little guy taking on the system.      In 2020, bitcoin is that underdog. Antithetical to the old and duly established world of centralized banking and governance, the nascent technology has attracted its fair share of haters. In particular, JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon has relished every opportunity to call bitcoin a fraud and compare its meteoric price rise with the tulip bulb bubble. He even attacked bitcoin holders themselves, telling them they’ll “pay the price for it one day” if they’re “stupid enough to buy it.”      The last three years of crypto winter have been bitterly cold and painfully long and it's true that bitcoin dipped close to rock bottom. But those who truly believed in its ideology never lost hope.      And then, bitcoin bounces back with breathtaking gusto, silencing its naysayers to break its previous all-time high and set an impressive new personal best. In the process, it’s also won many new fans such as MassMutual, the 169-year-old insurance giant that never previously identified as a bitcoin believer but just bought US$100 million worth of bitcoin to diversify its own treasury. This has caught the world’s attention with Elon Musk now considering diversifying some of Tesla’s balance sheet,.      Even Jamie’s crew are warming up to it, with strategists at JP Morgan admitting that purchases like MassMutual’s are a clear signal for increasing institutional demand for bitcoin and, critically, a significant milestone as we edge ever closer toward mainstream adoption.    Like bitcoin, we’ll hang on.    All this is mere validation for those who were already betting on bitcoin for their future. At Independent Reserve, we have over 8,000 self-managed super funds (SMSF) established by individuals who are going so long on crypto they’ve put their retirement savings into it. The first was created in 2016 when one savvy punter put AUD $41,000 into bitcoin. Today, that account is valued over 1.2 million AUD. That’s an annualized return of nearly 100% year on year.    Comparably, Australia’s leading “aggressive growth” industry superannuation funds returned 9% year on yearhttps://www.businessinsider.com.au/best-worst-super-funds-australia-comparison-rankings-2020-9 over a five-year period.    So it’s not hard to imagine why 13% of IRCI survey respondents are pushing for their super fund to start investing in digital assets. That number is even higher if you ask the under-34 age group; almost 30% are keen on the idea and a further 25% said they were likely to set up an SMSF and do it themselves, should they have to wait any longer.      This is a critical insight when the Australian population is aging fast. Most pension funds are in outflow and struggling to demonstrate their relevance to the next generation. This could be the disrupt-or-be-disrupted story to define an era.      This lack of trust and confidence in institutions has been brewing for a while. This year, as big-league investors such as Paul Tudor Jones told the world they bought crypto as a hedge against central bank and government actions, and the money printer go brrr meme spread through Twitter like a virus, almost a third of under-45-year-olds told us they, too, were worried about the process of quantitative easing (QE) devaluing their wealth.      As such, each newspaper headline about a crypto bubble about to pop or some talking head dismissing it as a scam is probably doing more to assist adoption than they realize. They forget our nation's positive bias for the one that isn’t meant to win but is fighting anyway. The one who was told to go home but is still here. That’s the little guy that we’ll keep cheering to the end.      See also: Michael Casey – Money Reimagined: Memes Mean Money      In the year ahead, I expect we will see plenty of hardship thanks to the flow-on effects of QE as well as the unpredicted and unintended consequences of many COVID-19 policies. But I suspect this will only serve to strengthen Australia’s conviction. To the general public, bitcoin is still the up-and-comer, shunned by the traditional set and struggling to be recognized on the main stage. Honestly, that’s what makes it so likable. And with 7.7% of IRCI respondents admitting they planned to buy crypto in 2020 but didn’t due to COVID-related economic pressures, I can only assume they’ll enter the market as soon as they hit greener pastures.      To me, this is a classic example of that iconic Aussie resilience that binds us together during times of fear, uncertainty and doubt. We may fall on hard times but we never stop working toward our goals and our optimism for the future is unwavering. We’re still willing to take a punt, we’re still keen to have a go and we choose to see the upside where others focus only on the risk. Like bitcoin, we’ll hang on. Because we love to believe that anything is possible.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Adrian Przelozny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/02/more-aussies-back-bitcoin-the-underdog,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/329483b6f1952c3fb79cc3717bd9e5660e73dcff-1200x598.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385504,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB24Pv,1609599650,Why Impact Investing and Crypto Are Mutually Beneficial,"This year has been like no other. A global health pandemic, multiple stock market shocks, the destabilizing of the workforce and many sectors of the economy. After a year of living with COVID-19, consumer and investor behavior has taken on new characteristics as digital and sustainable business and finance have taken off in parallel.      At a moment like this, emerging technologies such as tokenization and blockchain technology are more relevant than ever – and have been presented with a profound opportunity. As traditional markets are in crisis, investors are seeking refuge in cryptographically sound currencies, propelling bitcoin to new all-time price highs. Meanwhile, alternative asset classes such as ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) investments have gained ground amongst investors, crossing $1 trillion in funds for the first time on record.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Mohammad Raafi Hossain is co-founder and CEO of Fasset, a crypto exchange in the Middle East.    As we continue to witness new highs in the digital asset and ESG markets, it is time to consider whether these two growing sectors have the potential to benefit and support one another.      As impact investments and ESG-friendly funds increase in popularity, the cryptocurrency community has an opportunity to capture some of this momentum through the use of tokenization technology. By leveraging investor appetite for these asset classes, it may be possible to accelerate the maturation of the digital assets sector, along with the acceptance of asset-backed tokens and other digital assets in more traditional financial circles.    Impact investing    Arguably one of the fastest-growing asset classes, ESG investments are expected to reach half of all investor portfolios by 2025, totaling $35 trillion. This is partially the result of more investors recognizing ESG-friendly assets as an effective hedge against volatility and downside risk – with some 69% of investors crediting them as such, according to a State Street survey.      While ESG funds saw record flows in 2019, investor activity has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This effect has been compounded by climate crises, socioeconomic seachanges and protest movements across numerous major economies, leading to greater attention to the ways in which companies are doing business and where capital is being placed.      The newfound appetite for ESG investments is good news for society at large. As the world faces widening socioeconomic gaps and unemployment across the world, impact investing could play a prominent role in mitigating these challenges. Investments into transportation infrastructure, for example, can create over 21,000 jobs with every $1 billion invested. Considering these sizable socioeconomic externalities, this asset class could play a vital role in shaping the recovery and future of the global economy.    An uphill battle    Unlocking these potential benefits does not come without challenges. On average, there is an annual need for investments of $6.9 trillion into sustainable infrastructure between 2016 to 2030 to meet the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As public bodies and governments struggle to fund this development, the funding gap for these projects is expected to hit $15 trillion by 2040. This means that private capital will be increasingly required to plug the gap.      However, where private investments are concerned, there are numerous barriers to entry to the sustainable development investment market from low levels of liquidity, large ticket sizes and a lack of optionality, to high overhead and entry costs and limited transparency. Faced with these significant market imperfections, investors could benefit from the deployment of digital assets and tokenization as promising solutions to the ESG sector’s problems.    The world faces widening socioeconomic gaps and unemployment and impact investing could play a prominent role in mitigating these challenges.    Spanning the physical, financial and digital worlds, tokenized ESG investments, such as wind or solar farms, could provide sustainable infrastructure asset owners with new avenues for capital accumulation to fund developments of such projects. Similarly, through the tokenization of ESG-friendly investments, issues surrounding market access, lack of liquidity and prohibitively high costs and fees for investors would be overcome seamlessly.      As these assets become more liquid, accessible and tradable. Investors seeking to diversify their portfolios with low-risk, highly-resilient assets would be drawn to the digital assets space, potentially converting traditional financial actors to cryptocurrency market participants.    A mutual benefit    Currently, decentralized finance (DeFi) is the fastest-growing pocket within the crypto space, creating tremendous incentives and traction among retail and institutional investors. While DeFi has often been characterized by innovative on-chain solutions, some critics have pointed out there has been limited “real-world value” generated as a result of ongoing experimentation.      While tokenization technologies stand to substantially benefit the ESG community, they could also serve the purpose of bringing real, off-chain, substantive value to the digital assets market in the form of tokenized sustainable infrastructure. As ESG-friendly investments increase in popularity and prove extremely appealing to traditional finance, tokenized impact investments could serve as a vehicle for greater crypto adoption and digital assets’ acceptance in institutional and political circles.      See also: Firm Uses Ethereum to Tokenize Sustainable Infrastructure in Fight Against Climate Change      Right now, we are faced with a profound opportunity to bring digital assets to mainstream financial actors. There is an opportunity for the crypto sector to leverage the rise of ESG to its advantage, adding value to both the ESG sector and accelerating the maturation of the crypto space.      Looking ahead, there is no denying that the digital assets and impact investing spaces will play roles in shaping jobs, industries and the economy post-pandemic. But whether or not both industries can help foster mutual growth is yet to be seen.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Mohammad Raafi Hossain,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/02/why-impact-investing-and-crypto-are-mutually-beneficial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5079f7260c1954c9b40d6de73e4fa6468b25e540-2400x1589.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424635,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy3Njfh,1609590528,"Bitcoin Blasts Past $34K for First Time, Hours After Blowing Through $30K","The price of bitcoin (BTC) surged past $34,000 for the first time ever early Sunday morning, extending a record-setting holiday rally and adding an immediate exclamation point to the Bitcoin Network's 12 year anniversary.    Bitcoin was trading hands around $34,400 early Sunday. Hours earlier, the leading cryptocurrency had sliced through $30,000 like a light saber through gossamer, a torrid start to the year.  Once the price of the leading cryptocurrency crossed the $30,000 mark for the first time – something it had struggled to do for the last couple of days – it exploded upwards like a ball released under water, reaching a new all-time high of $33,136.92 and then continuing the push, breaching $34,000 hours later.  ""Bitcoin makes TSLA (Tesla) look like it is standing still,"" tweeted Jim Bianco, well-known macro strategist, shortly after the cryptocurrency broke $30,000.  The latest gains come two days after bitcoin closed out a year in which the cryptocurrency rose more than 300%, with an almost 50% gain in December alone, sort of like a boulder gaining speed downhill, only in the opposite direction. On Nov. 30, bitcoin breached a nearly three-year-old high of $19,793. By the close of Dec. 31, the cryptocurrency had risen about $10,000.  Propelling the record-setting run is a growing narrative that bitcoin represents a form of ""digital gold,"" along with a flood of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency: Among them: Anthony Scaramucci’s Skybridge Capital ($182 million in December); MassMutual ($100 million in December); and Guggenheim (up to 10% of its $5 billion macro fund).  “Bitcoin price is being driven by institutional money and there is not enough supply,"" Laurent Kssis, managing director at 21Shares, told CoinDesk. ""The number of family offices asking to invest in our ETP is just staggering. I’ve never seen this before. In 2017 it was just retail knocking at the door now it’s only institutional.”  Kssis' statements are borne out by the fact that the number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 bitcoin – rose to a new record high of 1,994 this past Wednesday.  The metric increased by over 16% in 2020 and 7.3% in Q4 alone.  “The final land grab has started, and by this time next year, accumulating >1,000 Bitcoin will be nearly impossible for most people,” Jehan Chu, CEO at Hong Kong-based trading firm Keneti Capital, told CoinDesk.  HODLers also have the U.S. Federal Reserve to thank for the cryptocurrency's rise, as it, along with other central banks, has been printing money with abandon, trying to stave off the worst economic effects of the pandemic. This is viewed by many as a potential catalyst for inflation and bad for the U.S. dollar, both of which could be positive for bitcoin.  ""Many corporations are parking [U.S. dollars] in BTC because they are losing money in conventional banking so it makes total sense,"" 21Shares' Kssis said.  Growing global macro uncertainty may also be playing a factor in the recent surge. A peaceful transition of power in the U.S. is no longer the iron clad guarantee it used to be as 11 GOP Senators say they'll vote to reject the electors from certain states. While it's still almost certain President-elect Joe Biden will assume office later this month, the need for a qualifier is a new event.  That plus a mutated strain of COVID 19, a lagging world economy, and concerns over the effects of the now-completed Brexit, may not be helping the zeitgeist, but could be aiding bitcoin which some see as insurance against global chaos.  Bitcoin may also be benefiting from money being moved out of the XRP token and so-called privacy coins which are facing legal and regulatory challenges.  With a market value now of over $595 billion, bitcoin is more valuable than all but nine publicly traded companies, sitting between Alibaba at $648.3 billion and Berkshire Hathaway at $543.7 billion.  Bitcoin enthusiasts will likely find some joy in that last bit, an event that occurred last week, as the Berkshire's CEO, legendary investor Warren Buffett, once famously derided bitcoin as ""probably rat poison squared.""  The cryptocurrency has also rose up the ranks of the world's most valuable currencies, overtaking the Saudi Riyal into 17th place, just behind the Mexican Peso.
