42425996,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhp7h,1409589664,New 'Sound Wallet' Stores Your Private Keys on Vinyl,"For digital currency users looking to secure their e-fortune, one project is offering a new way to store private keys: on vinyl.  Sound Wallet  promises to store users' private keys as encrypted audio files across a range of products – including CDs and 7-inch vinyl disks.  Theodore Goodman, the brains behind the project, said he used the iconic format as it is the ""ultimate archive medium"".  Records, tapes and digital audio  According to the product's website, Sound Wallets can be used to store any cryptocurrency, not just bitcoin.  To construct the wallet, a user's BIP38-encrypted private key is first converted into a sound file. Between 30 and 60 seconds long, this file will simply sound like noise to prying ears.  However, using a simple spectroscope app like AndroSpectro on their phone, the user can decipher their code hidden in the static. Alternatively, any high-resolution spectroscope should do.  The same approach can be used with different media, including CDs and magnetic tapes. This also means that a user's wallet file could be broadcast, at least in theory.  Vinyl as an archive medium  While Sound Wallet may not appeal to mainstream users, this security-minded product may prove popular with technophiles and audiophiles.  Goodman argues that cold storage is the safest way to secure cryptocurrencies, pointing out some advantages vinyl has over other physical wallets.  He adds that records can outlive memory cards, paper wallets or CDs, which degrade over time. Recent research found that CDs dating from the 1990s are already rotting away in certain conditions.  On the project's previous Startjoin campaign, Goodman added:  “Records are the ultimate archive format. You could add the record to your record crate, put it in a frame and hang it on your wall, or store it in your safe.”  Of course, recording vinyl is more demanding than burning a CD or DVD. It requires specialised hardware such as a record lathe, blanks and a turntable (in this case the legendary Technics SL-1200 was employed).  Although the project did not reach its initial crowdfunding target of €8,000, it appears that the wallets are now in production.  For the time being, Sound Wallet offers two products, a CD wallet and a vinyl wallet, priced at 0.02BTC and 0.09BTC respectively.

42425993,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhp5h,1409574899,Antonopoulos Leaves Blockchain Security Role to Become Board Advisor,"Popular bitcoin wallet and information services company Blockchain announced today that its Chief Security Officer, Andreas M Antonopoulos, is advancing to become an advisor to its board.  Antonopoulos is considered a key authority on bitcoin and one of its most active advocates.  He has been a staple presenter on the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast since its genesis in April 2013 and a search for his name on YouTube yields over 47,000 results, many of them presentations and lectures.  Changing roles  Blockchain announced the change on its blog, stating:  ""During his time as CSO, Andreas has provided expert guidance and a seasoned perspective on security, infrastructure, hiring, operations and public communications. Andreas’ keen insights, leadership and hands-on attitude have allowed Blockchain to improve risk management and security from infrastructure to operations.""  As CSO at Blockchain, Antonopoulos was responsible for improving security practices and risk management as the company grew from a one-man startup to a multinational with a team of over 20 in just over a year.  The company's rapid growth (it now has over 2 million individual wallet accounts) has meant that its security operations now require a full-time engineering team, rather than one man who already wears multiple hats.  Blockchain's  founder and CTO, UK-based Ben Reeves, will retain the responsibility for security operations that he kept even during Antonopoulos' time.  Blockchain's transition  As well as its original explorer and data provision hub, blockchain.info, the company also maintains blockchain.com, a more consumer-friendly site with links to its web and mobile bitcoin wallets.  In June it launched Bitcoin.com, an information portal aimed more at bitcoin beginners with information on the various services available, even outside the company's product line.  Blockchain also acquired the bitcoin data/statistics site and mobile app developer ZeroBlock in a bitcoin-only deal last December, when it still served 'only' one million wallets.

42425995,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhp9h,1409567776,CRXzone Launches as Singapore's First Bitcoin and Litecoin Exchange,"Singapore's latest exchange, CRXzone, has become the first platform to offer both litecoin and bitcoin trading in the country.  Like others in the Asian region, the exchange aims to attract an international customer base by offering additional bitcoin services beyond trading.  CEO Pawan Kumar spoke to CoinDesk about the exchange's unique funding and payment options, the advantages of Singapore as a base for bitcoin businesses and the future viability of alternate digital currencies in general, particularly litecoin.  Funding options and payment networks  One of CRXzone's key strategies to attract a wide customer base is its range of account funding and withdrawal options. As well as the usual bank transfers, the exchange offers international payment processor options like OKPAY, Egopay, and PerfectMoney.  Kumar tends to refer to other payment networks as 'digital currencies' too, blurring the line somewhat between cryptocurrencies and widely-used international payment networks.  This is probably due to his 25-year experience in the IT industry, experience with online businesses and involvement in digital payment networks ""since the time of E-gold”.  While all offer speed and cost advantages over traditional currencies, Kumar said that bitcoin's decentralized nature made it an attractive option.  ""I personally feel [...] bitcoin will slowly takeover all other digital currencies and remain a useful tool for digital payments which are growing day by day.""  One of CRXzone's selling points is its litecoin trading option, despite the popular altcoin's image taking a battering following its recent price slump to $5 and lower.  ""We still believe that litecoin will survive the current downward trend. It is well known and widely used crypto after the bitcoin [sic]. Leverage trading seems to be a reason for the current price slump, as per my personal judgement.""  CRXzone features  CRXzone's selection of different payment options means there are various fees involved when moving funds in and out of the exchange. OKPAY's rate is 1%, while others may charge up to 3%. Meanwhile, international bank transfers are likely to be the least economical option for users.  The exchange itself, however, does not charge any of its own fees in addition to these, regardless of the country or currency. ""Not even a miners' fee,"" Kumar pointed out.  CRXzone itself offers a clear layout with order books and live charts. There are multiple trading-oriented reports with trend indicators for each pair, plus volumes, lowest/highest market prices and trade history. Access to the trading API is also available.  Security and auditing  CRXzone keeps only 2-3% of customer funds in 'hot wallets' and the rest exist in offline cold storage. Deposits are automated but withdrawals are processed by human operators as an additional check.  There are also plans for half-yearly or even quarterly audits of bitcoin reserves similar to those recently performed at mainland Chinese exchanges, alongside Kraken and Bitfinex a few months earlier.  CRXzone is also working on a ""full solution"" merchant gateway for businesses wishing to accept bitcoin, which should be operational ""within a few months"", according to the CEO.  Kumar said CRXzone's trading volumes and sign-ups were ""steadily going up"", and the company was trying to bring in more market makers to boost this further.  The company is owned by a 50:50 partnership who self-funded the business, and it was not seeking additional funding at this stage.  Bitcoin still strong in Singapore  With its financial services-driven economy and reputation as an IT startup hub, Singapore looked to be an early leader in bitcoin space. Indeed, it is punching above its weight with eight bitcoin ATMs, a homegrown manufacturer, a couple of payment processors and a new digital currency industry group, ACCESS.  The country's relatively liberal attitude to financial regulation may have assisted this, though some businesses are showing a preference for US headquarters in order to serve a still US-heavy bitcoin market.  CRXzone has a team of six working on the technical backend, business development and compliance. Kumar said he has complete confidence operating in the jurisdiction.  ""The government here has given very clear guidelines on taxation and regulation so far, and we expect the same in future. We do not anticipate any problem in near future regarding the bitcoin businesses in Singapore.""  CRXzone's office is in Singapore's central business district, and Kumar added that customers are welcome to visit the office at any time.  The company adheres to the standard set of know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) ID policies, requiring photo ID and proof of address to customer in any country. It is also a member of ACCESS.
