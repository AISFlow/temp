42422616,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0naTh,1659396642,First Mover Asia: Was the Metaverse All Just a Dream?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin falls for fourth straight day as traditional markets struggle. Declining volatility in the cryptocurrency's price shows how far digital-asset markets have come since the nervy days of mid-June. (Wells Fargo's still a long-term believer, for what it's worth.)  Insights: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg acknowledges that the metaverse could be a long time in the making. Metaverse-related cryptocurrencies are undergoing their own reality check, having lost $10.9 billion of their market capitalization in the second quarter.  Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $23,179 −0.8%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,630 −2.8%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,118.63 −0.3%      ●Gold: $1,770 per troy ounce +0.4%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.61% −0.04       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin has fallen for four straight days. But as market volatility ebbs, the price slide doesn't look like much to worry about.  By Bradley Keoun  Bitcoin (BTC) was lower for a fourth straight day, but there wasn't much to panic about because the price drops have been pretty modest by the standards of usually-volatile cryptocurrency markets: Over the four-day slide the cumulative price drop is less than 4%.  That's pretty harmless for an asset whose price has been known to fall 16% in a single day.  The listlessness might be a sign that the Northern Hemisphere is entering the dog days of summer, during a (largely) post-coronavirus pandemic stretch when many people really are taking vacations for the first time in years.  Or it might be a sign of just how little there is in the way of any firm direction in markets, torn between the angst of wondering if the U.S. economy meets the definition of a recession and if the Federal Reserve must still keep ratcheting monetary policy tighter to wring out inflation trending at its fastest in four decades.  Trading volume is light.  One sign of hope for the bulls: Despite this year's crash in crypto markets, traditional financial firms are still keenly interested in the long-term prospects: ""We believe digital assets are a transformative innovation on par with the internet, cars and electricity,"" analysts for the U.S. bank Wells Fargo (WFC) wrote on Monday. They were quick to add: ""At such an early stage of investment development, many investment risks remain.""  There's less carnage in the news these days and what appears to be a return to development: The crypto exchange Huobi says it's now able to operate in Australia, and July marked the strongest month of digital-asset fund inflows this year. Coinbase Prime added Ethereum staking for U.S. institutional clients.  What's missing from the markets is any sense of energy or excitement.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA +18.8% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA +13.5% Entertainment Decentraland MANA +3.5% Entertainment  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polkadot DOT −5.0% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum ETH −2.5% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −2.2% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Tens of Billions of Investor Dollars Are Flowing Away From the Metaverse  By Sam Reynolds  Investors are souring on the dream of the metaverse, regardless whether its Meta's (FB) superset of virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet – or crypto's cocktail of virtual reality, augmented reality and blockchain.  “We hope to basically get to around a billion people in the metaverse, each doing hundreds of dollars of commerce buying digital goods, digital content, different things to express themselves, so whether that’s clothing for their avatar or different digital goods for their virtual home or things to decorate their virtual conference room, utilities to be able to be more productive in virtual and augmented reality and across the metaverse overall,” is how Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg described the dream on CNBC’s ""Mad Money"" with Jim Cramer.  But this vision isn’t at odds with reality. In recent earnings, Meta reported a $2.8 billion loss on its Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, home to the augmented and virtual reality operations.  According to 13F filings (a form institutional investors must file quarterly with the Securities and Exchange Commission) aggregated by Whale Wisdom, $21.5 billion in institutional capital flowed out of Meta during the last quarter.  The crypto metaverse isn’t doing much better. Facing a user base that seems to refuse to materialize, and intense market headwinds because of the broader crypto decline, most of the major metaverse tokens saw their market caps dip by over a third as valuations of cryptocurrencies dropped.  Quarterly Market Cap Loss  Name Asset Market Cap April 1 Market Cap June 30 DACS Sector Ape Coin APE $3,549,560,544 $1,383,166,399 Metaverse Platform Decentraland MANA $4,876,331,721 $1,625,894,880 Metaverse Platform The Sandbox SAND $4,068,070,380 $1,408,111,263 Metaverse Platform Axie Infinity AXS $4,035,647,503 $1,198,723,507 Gaming  All in all, $10.9 billion departed from the metaverse majors as their market cap deflated. As of late afternoon Asia time on Aug. 1, Decentraland had 803 total online users whereas Steam, an online gaming community, had just under 20 million.  Mark Zuckerberg admits that the current engagement ratio to profitability is a problem. Meta’s virtual world, Horizon Worlds, is said to have 300,000 sign-ups but there’s no publicly available count on active players.  “This is obviously a very expensive undertaking over the next several years,” Zuckerberg said during a recent analysts call. “But as the metaverse becomes more important in every part of how we live, I’m confident that we’re going to be glad we played an important role in building this.”  For a point of comparison, Facebook gained its first million users in less than a year at a per-user acquisition cost that’s infinitely smaller than the company’s pivot to the metaverse. Eight years later, it hit its billionth user.  Zuckerberg’s Meta and the crypto metaverse majors are nowhere near to following this trajectory. Is this really the future of virtual interaction?

For the first time in a year, the percentage of Ethereum holders who had been in profit had declined to below half, causing intense sell pressure in the market.

Jeremy McAlpine, 26, and Zachary Matar, 29, founded Dropil Inc. in 2017 and ran the company until March 2020. Dropil purported to be an investment management service and trading program.  Investors were encouraged to purchase Dropil’s native token, DROP, during the company’s initial coin offering in 2018. Through the purchase of DROP, investors were promised access to an automated trading bot called “Dex” that would generate annual returns of up to 63% in DROP and distribute them every 15 days.  According to investigators, however, Dex never operated or generated any profits. McAlpine and Matar lied to both investors and the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission about Dex’s functionality, creating fake profitability reports in response to subpoenas and providing false sworn testimony about the number of investors in the project and amount of money raised during the ICO.  McAlpine and Matar pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud each in August 2021. On Monday, they were sentenced to federal prison. McAlpine faces a three-year sentence, while Matar faces a two-and-a-half-year sentence.

Unlike Celsius clients who deposited funds in the company’s high-yield Earn product, custody clients didn't collect interest. They used Celsius for storage, not to put their money to work. The groups also differ in that the Earn users appear to have signed away the title to their crypto assets, according to the firm’s terms of service, whereas with custody clients, the title of the assets remains with the wallet holder.  The now-underway bankruptcy hearings of Celsius, which froze customer accounts in June because of a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet, invites a contest among specific claimant types, including regular customers, major institutional creditors and equity holders.  The custody wallet holders were the first to form an ad hoc group in the case. These creditors are worried that Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm hired on Celsius’ behalf, may be telling them what they want to hear without doing much to support them, according to Thomas Braziel, the founder of bankruptcy claims specialist 507 Capital. For example, Kirkland could have filed a motion to return their money in fiat currency, as was done for another bankrupt crypto lender, Voyager Digital, where assets were held by a bank.  Instead, “Kirkland said they were going to file a ‘declaratory judgment’ for the court to decide what to do, rather than file a motion to return the assets,” Braziel said in an interview. “The word going round is that this is lip service to claimants. It’s not 100% clear that the assets are held in custody. Celsius says they hold it for you, but the language in the terms and conditions is very squishy. And so [Kirkland’s] position is ‘why give it to them if we don’t have to?'”  Neither Celsius nor Ortiz nor Kirkland immediately responded to requests for comment.

These critics are actively working to undermine our viability.  The market cap of the cryptocurrency sector has dropped from over $2.4 trillion in May 2021 to, as we write, $1.09 trillion. More than half.  Adelle Nazarian is the chief executive officer of the American Blockchain PAC, and Alex Allaire is the chief executive officer of the American Blockchain Initiative.  The sector's adversaries do not deserve all the credit, or blame, for crypto's price implosion. Yet they aren’t the first to wage political war on the market capitalization of a rival economic sector.  They are delightedly using the price implosion cap as an opportunity to double down on their attacks.  Make no mistake. The crypto sector's adversaries are formidable.  To steal a meme: The Empire strikes back. Time for the return of the Jedi!  We must stand up for crypto in the public relations and policy arenas. We, the authors, are actively making, and call on others to make, the case for crypto. The case for crypto is immense, one of innovation and growing productivity – and the rising tide of equitable prosperity that accompanies that.  We must not and will not allow the enemies of progress to crush this historic wave of innovation.  Meanwhile, they try.  26 experts  In an acidly critical piece in The Los Angeles Times Michael Hiltzik recently observed:  ""In an open letter earlier this month, a group of 26 experts urged congressional leaders to take steps to protect the public from these ""risky, flawed, and unproven digital instruments."" Their letter ultimately attracted signatures from 1,700 scientists and technologists, according to Stephen Diehl, a British engineer who is one of the organizers. The writers said, ""We strongly disagree with the narrative – peddled by those with a financial stake in the crypto-asset industry – that these technologies represent a positive financial innovation.""  Meanwhile, Ben Schreckinger, at Politico, recently headlined ""Bankers Revel in Crypto's Crash"":  ""Yesterday, when the Bank for International Settlements released its 115-page page annual economic report, it devoted the final third to a detailed takedown of crypto and decentralized finance. The BIS is the most institutional of institutional players – an international organization that acts as a bank for central banks and is also owned by central banks. ... In recent years, papers published under the bank's aegis have gone from dismissive to defensive in their treatment of crypto.""  And consider the attacks by the likes of Bill Gates, Jr., who admitted in his book ""The Road Ahead,"" that lost the web for Microsoft (MSFT) by believing that ""the technology for 'killer applications' was inadequate to lure consumers to the Internet …""  Gates, driving in his chronic blind spot, recently accused crypto of being based in ""the greater fool theory."" Notoriously, Gates's bridge partner, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, called crypto ""probably rat poison squared.""  These attacks drew a blistering riposte from the never-bashful Peter Thiel against the ""finance gerontocracy,"" calling Buffett the ""sociopathic grandpa from Omaha.""  That said, one blistering insult does not a crusade make.  Read More: The Case for Investing in Bitcoin During Crypto Winter  No disrespect to Thiel: The best defense is a good offense. There's another perspective, one which seizes the moral high ground from crypto's critics. Consider the perspective of crypto's creators as well as its destroyers.  Ethereum’s co-inventor: Vitalik Buterin and his dad ""Dima,” also a member of the cryptocenti, provided a very constructive perspective. Speaking with Fortune:  ""Vitalik: I think, in general, the luna [cryptocurrency] collapse is in some ways one of these important, kind of healthy moments in crypto reminding people that downsides are real. You can't just build a system and magically pretend that the negative case is never going to happen.  So, what’s really going on? Capitalism.  Capitalism was characterized by Joseph Schumpeter, one of its greatest theorists, as ""creative destruction."" Per economist Ricardo J.

Over the long run, the process of creative destruction accounts for over 50% of productivity growth.""

The cryptocurrency is down 51% year to date.  The coin’s dominance, a metric that measures the market cap of BTC relative to the rest of the cryptocurrency market, sits at 42%, compared with 40% on Jan. 1 and 41.8% on April 1.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  In traditional markets, the S&P 500 declined 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.4% lower on the day.  Business software company and large BTC holder MicroStrategy is set to report its fiscal second-quarter results on Tuesday. Analysts on average project a loss of $7.27 a share, following a loss of $11.58 a share in the company's fiscal first quarter ended June 30.  The 30-day correlation between BTC and MicroStrategy’s stock is 0.85, implying that the price of the shares is tied heavily to BTC. The correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0, with higher ratings indicating a stronger relationship between assets.  Ether’s (ETH) price declined 4.5% on Monday, following a 9% increase last week.  Altcoins fell on Monday, as well, with Polkadot (DOT) down 8.5% and Cosmos (ATOM) down 7%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin takes a step back  Following last week’s price movement, it makes sense to take a look at open interest in the bitcoin options market, relative to the strike price. Open interest by strike indicates the volume of option orders to buy (calls) or sell (puts) or both at various strike prices, and can provide insight into traders’ views on the fair value of BTC.  The most notable change in this metric from this column's previous look last week is an increase in puts purchased at $23,000. Because puts represent the option but not the obligation to sell (in this case at $23,000), they can be interpreted as traders buying downside protection should prices surpass $23,000.  Call option (i.e. the right but not the obligation to buy) open interest remains heaviest at $25,000, which can be inferred as where bullish investors are willing to purchase BTC.  The chart above can be viewed in context with on-chain data indicating bitcoin’s current “realized price.” Realized price is bitcoin’s realized market capitalization divided by the current bitcoin supply; the realized market capitalization is based on the price of coins where they last traded.  BTC’s current realized price is $21,000. The crypto has moved above the realized price, after falling below that level in June. Surpassing the realized price implies that more BTC investors have moved into a profitable range. The more investors are in the green, the more the price level tends to serve as additional support.  Bitcoin prices remain underpinned by a supply of coins that lie dormant  The number of BTC coins that haven’t changed hands in over 10 years continues to increase. Some of those coins might have been lost outright, but some investors appear to have no intentions of selling.  For context, the 2.5 million coins that lie dormant in cold storage exceeds the 2.4 million BTC now held across all exchanges.  On the macroeconomic front, things will be relatively quiet to start the week, although on Monday the Institute of Supply Management released a survey showing that manufacturing in the U.S. slowed down in June. Construction spending declined by 1.1% in June from May, missing estimates. The purchasing managers index, however, exceeded estimates with a reading of 52.8. A reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing is expanding, and a reading below 50 indicates that manufacturing is contracting.

42395116,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASX3FB,1659385635,Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?,"At the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, the Ethereum blockchain’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, shared what he expects for Ethereum in a post-Merge era. Buterin closed the conference by sharing that after the Merge, Ethereum will only be about 55% complete.  The Merge refers to when the current proof-of-work (PoW) Ethereum mainnet protocol will ""merge"" with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain system and continue as PoS.  So where does that leave Ethereum in a post-Merge world? Many have looked at the Merge as the grand finale for the network. But now, according to Buterin, Ethereum will be tackling “the Surge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.”  Read More: What Is the Ethereum Merge?  The anniversary of Ethereum’s mainnet, or live version, launch was July 30. So it seems like a good time to look at what to expect for Ethereum after the Merge.  Ethereum scaling via the Surge  The ""Surge"" refers to Ethereum introducing systems that will make the network more expandable (scalable) by enabling the creation of layer 2, or companion, products, including sharding and rollups, and therefore making it easier for users to operate on the Ethereum network.  Sharding  During this phase, the introduction of sharding is expected on Ethereum. Sharding would split Ethereum's entire network into smaller pieces, known as “shards,” which is intended to increase the network’s scalability. It does this by breaking up data within the same blockchain, in essence creating multiple mini-blockchains. This becomes a lot easier to do once the protocol moves to proof-of-stake. Ethereum then will aim to create a physically sharded system of 64 linked databases.  Read more: The Risks and Rewards of Sharding  Sharding is a concept in computer science that scales applications so they can support more data. If sharding can be implemented on Ethereum, each user could store part of the change to the database, instead of the entire thing.  Danksharding has also seen increasing interest in a post-Merge world. While Buterin didn’t specifically mention the concept in Paris, Ethereum aficionados have turned to this prototype as a way of making Ethereum more scalable. Danksharding applies the same concept of splitting the network into shards, but instead of using the shards to increase transactions it uses them to increase space for groups of data. This allows for Ethereum to process larger quantities of data.  While the press coming out of Paris has started to draw attention to Ethereum exploring sharding, sharding has been an idea since Ethereum emerged in 2013. The implementation is expected to begin sometime in 2023.  Read more: Scaling Ethereum Beyond the Merge: Danksharding  Ethereum developers are also looking to expand its scaling potential with the introduction of rollups. Rollups perform transactions outside of Ethereum’s base layer (layer 1) and then post the transaction data onto the layer 1 blockchain, allowing it to take advantage of the main Ethereum security chain. Many have said that rollups are still a while away but the introduction of some newer projects, including zkSync and Polygon zkEVM, shows that the next phase of Ethereum is closer than expected.  There are currently two types of rollups: Optimistic rollups, which assume transactions are valid for a default period and run on layer 2 networks before being passed back to the base layer, and Zero-Knowledge rollups (ZK rollups), which run the transactions off-chain and submit the proof of validity to the layer 1 network. Overall, ZK rollups hold some computational advantages over Optimistic rollups, given that they will have to provide proof that the transaction is valid instead of having a time period to accept or reject the transaction.  For a while, Optimistic rollups seemed like the ideal solution to scaling the Ethereum network, but with ZK rollups on the way and the sharding process starting sometime in 2023, there is a lot of room to make Ethereum more scalable.  Read more: Sell the Ethereum Merge  The Verge  The next phase will introduce Verkle trees, which will also tackle the issue of scalability. Verkle trees are a “powerful upgrade to Merkle proofs that allow for much smaller proof sizes,” according to Buterin. The so-called Verge will optimize storage and reduce node sizes. Ultimately, this will make Ethereum more scalable.  For context, Merkle trees aim at creating reliable encryption by converting blocks of information into long strands of code. The newest blocks of information, or leaves, are grouped together to form branches. This then traces a string of numbers, known as the Merkle root, that contains all the previous information. This method was first explored on the Bitcoin blockchain and later adapted for Ethereum.  So essentially, Verkle trees will allow for you to store a large amount of data by showing a short proof of any piece of that data, which in turn will be verified by someone who only has a root of the tree. This process will then make proofs much more efficient.  Verkle trees are still a new idea and are still not as widely known or used as other cryptographic solutions. So while the Surge will deal with sharding and rollups, that phase will then affect how the network deals with scalability and proofs for Ethereum.  The Purge + Splurge  The Purge aims at reducing, or “purging,” spare historical data. Reducing the amount of historical data will make the process of validating the blockchain more efficient for validators under the new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This should minimize network congestion and allow many more transactions to be processed on the blockchain. Buterin said that by the end of this phase, Ethereum should be able to process 100,000 transactions per second.  Once all these previous parts come together, Buterin has described the next part, the Splurge, as “the fun stuff.” It aims at making sure that the network continues to run smoothly and that the updates to the protocol in the previous sections do not cause any issues. The tough work of making Ethereum more scalable will have been completed.  This ultimate stage is still in the distant future; as in all tech development, there are bound to be hiccups along the way. Given that the Merge has taken much longer than expected, the Splurge – when it finally arrives – will mark a much deserved celebratory phase for the Ethereum network.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/01/ethereum-after-the-merge-what-comes-next,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1e23ee75ec0c5377aa58c497cab3cd5b74766d1-3946x2959.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411411,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNduR,1659377012,"Why DeFi Giants Aave, Curve May Want Their Own Stablecoins","There’s an old media saying that you need three examples to make a trend. Well, at least two prominent Ethereum-based platforms are designing new stablecoins – a situation that speaks to the importance of those assets and the innovation that competition drives within crypto. At the very least, it’s more than a fad.  On Sunday, Aave community members voted overwhelmingly in support of the development of a native stablecoin, called GHO, for the decentralized lending platform. That came about a week after Michael Egorov, founder of the open access Curve protocol, more or less confirmed his team was working on its own fiat-pegged asset.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Stablecoins are a type of blockchain-based token that deploy various means to maintain parity with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro. Typically, in decentralized finance (DeFi), the realm that Aave and Curve play in, these tokens are balanced with overcollateralized amounts of crypto (i.e., there’s more crypto put into the protocol than the stablecoin is worth).  Stablecoins are also unmistakably one of crypto’s most important innovations and historically one of its fastest growing sub-economies. Today, there’s over $150 billion worth of stablecoins in circulation, according to data provider CoinGecko. Two dollar-pegged assets from competing centralized companies/consortia, tether and USDC, account for over two-thirds of that market.  DeFi already has a host of stablecoins, which serve as an essential part of this permissionless economy. They are used in trading pairs, as a way to protect capital from price fluctuations and to earn yield through lending. MakerDAO’s DAI token is the largest and oldest “DeFi native” stablecoin.  See also: Making MakerDAO Matter Again | The Node  While all blockchain-based stablecoins allow peers to transact without intermediaries, truly decentralized stablecoins that are run by algorithms rather than by formal businesses align more with the crypto ethos of programmable financial inclusion. Tether and Circle sometimes block transactions or blacklist addresses, for instance.  Making business sense  But it seems like pure business sense for Aave or Curve to get into the stablecoin game. Neither of the protocols’ tokens has been built yet, but both will likely drive revenues for and attract users to the platform.  Aave plans to charge interest on loans taken out in GHO, with that yield going toward that platform’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Borrowers will also be able to earn interest on the collateral they post to mint the token.  Proposed by Aave Cos. as a protocol improvement, 99.9% of voters supported the idea and pledged half a million AAVE tokens. Meanwhile, Curve’s users largely back a native stablecoin for the protocol known as the site of the so-called “stablecoin wars,” though it hasn’t yet been put to a formal vote.  As the DeFi trade publication The Defiant put it:  “It stands to reason that the basic mechanism for a Curve stablecoin would be to mint it against liquidity provider (LP) positions. At a high level, this would be similar to MakerDAO’s collateralized debt position model.  Aave’s community, which had the earlier stablecoin proposal, was seemingly spurred to put GHO to a vote after Curve’s developer team began speaking publicly about its plans. Being first can have its advantages. The whole stablecoin wars are essentially a fight within DeFi about which token can attract the most users and maintain the most liquidity to ensure its price stability.  That said, Aave has been criticized in the past for expanding into a wide array of unrelated markets – like social media. While a stablecoin could drive profits and provide users with discounts, it also waters down its brand. “What does Aave do again?” you might rhetorically ask.  See also: Curve DAO Contemplates Its Intellectual Property | The Node  The situation, while not yet a trend, is a little reminiscent of DeFi Summer in 2020, when every other protocol launched a governance token. It would be interesting to see what happens to the market for undercollateralized stablecoins (or these assets’ security guarantees) if more protocols get into the game, especially at a time when capital and users are exiting.  It’s also worth remembering how ugly that summer was at times, with protocols launching specifically to suck users away from others through “vampire attacks” and attractive token subsidies. It’s not my place to say whether users or DeFi as a whole would be better served if Maker was less prominent – or if every decentralized exchange had a native stablecoin a la binance coin.  But the entire promise of DeFi is that open markets drive innovation, even if there are increased risks. And it’s probably too early to call the market oversaturated until Sushi decides to mint its own stablecoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/01/why-defi-giants-aave-curve-may-want-their-own-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/281e012badad8694201e021170cacebe466a491e-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 24-hour trading volume of Chiliz is $270 Million, indicating a hike of 97%. Past Performance of CHZ As predicted in our last analysis, the CHZ prices reversed from the overhead resistance of $0.12 with higher price rejection candles to retest the rising channel breakout. The post-retest reversal successfully propelled the prices by 26% to breach the psychological mark of $0.15, leading to a bullish engulfing candle.

The bullish influence over the 50 and 100day SMA grows as the market value approaches the 200 Day SMA. Therefore if the market value breaks and sustains about the 200-day SMA, the possibility of a crossover between the 50 and 100-day SMA will increase significantly.

The move will be effective on Aug. 15.  In its suit, the SEC named nine digital assets it claims are securities. Of those nine tokens, only AMP is listed on the Binance.US platform, according to Binance.US.  Binance.US said the trading of AMP may resume in the future on its platform, but noted that “we are taking this step now until more clarity exists around the classification of AMP.”  The price of AMP was down 2.4% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.

That&apos;s down from a peak of $1.72B in October 2021, just a month prior to the heights of major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD). As a reminder, bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners generate earnings by verifying a new block of BTC transactions. Moreover, the miners receive rewards in BTC after producing those blocks in which they solve a complex math problem. The slump in earnings comes as energy costs soar globally amid Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine as well as a lack of U.S. infrastructure to support oil production. Keep in mind that BTC mining profitability is impacted greatly by the costs of electricity and equipment. Some miners are also selling their bitcoin (BTC-USD) holdings and rigs in a bid to better manage costs amid a broad market downturn. The two most widely used rigs among miners are graphics processing units (&apos;GPU&apos;) and application-specific integrated circuits (&apos;ASIC&apos;). &apos;The glut of idle ASICs can&apos;t be overlooked as a cause for higher hosting rates,&apos; Compass Mining Multimedia Director William Foxley wrote in a release dated July 30. &apos;Many publicly listed miners have thousands of machines offline.&apos;While miners kept losing money in July, bitcoin (BTC-USD) HODLers enjoyed the past m...",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | COMMODITY | ETH | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3863800-bitcoin-miners-revenues-fall-14-in-july-as-rising-electricity-costs-dent-profitability?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/786244.jpeg

Currently, the bulls are relentlessly pushing the price closer to SOL&apos;s resistance level. The bulls are putting in tremendous efforts to punch in a breach or else the bears will consolidate and ruin their efforts to register a breakout. With the low price, it&apos;s now a huge wall to breach for the bulls waiting for that breakout.

SOL currently has a trading volume reaching 1.8 billion, registering traction or an increase of 0.64%, and a total market capitalization of 15 billion seen overnight. Currently, SOL is moving up in both the daily and hourly price charts. This proves the point that the bulls are dominating the scene. MACD and other technical indicators show a negative trend but now with SOL&apos;s bullish movement, the MACD line glides up and over the MACD signal line.

While some countries such as the U.S. are drafting legislation to impose stricter oversight of cryptos like bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD), Honduras has not yet taken legal action to support the use of them. &apos;Crypto assets do not have backing, so they are not regulated nor is their use guaranteed, therefore, they do not enjoy the protection granted by national laws,&apos; the CBH said in a statement translated by Seeking Alpha dated July 29. The central bank added that cryptos can lose their value within a short period of time. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), for example, has lost over 60% of its market value since its peak in November 2021. The world&apos;s largest digital token by market cap is changing hands at $23.45K as of around 11:00 a.m. ET, down from its all-time high of $68.9K less than a year ago.

It finished July with an impressive recovery to the $24,000 threshold. The months of June and July 2022 on the cryptocurrency market were heated downtrends. Some investors lost their faith in these months due to a painful deleveraging process brought on by a liquidity problem in the crypto lending industry in 2022.

Levels reached this weekend were the highest since mid-June.  Market Moves: Ether continues to be the hot topic among investors ahead of the Merge, with ETH open interest on the Deribit options exchange surpassing bitcoin's open interest for the first time.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was down 2% on the day after a weekend that saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value hit its highest levels since mid-June.  BTC reached $24,593 on Sunday, according to CoinDesk data.  Ether (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was down 3% at $1,649 on Monday.  In traditional markets, U.S. futures dipped alongside the dollar and oil. Contracts on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were lower Monday after major indexes finished July with their best month since 2020.  The rest of the crypto market was also down, apart from decentralized data storage network Filecoin's FIL token, which was up 12% on the day.  In the news, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said in a policy document that investment in crypto assets should be capped, with consumers warned that they could lose all their money.  Bank of America said in a report the Ethereum blockchain needs to make scalability improvements in order to hold its market position. The report said blockchains Binance Smart Chain, Tron, Avalanche and Solana have taken market share from Ethereum due to their proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms, lower transaction fees and greater scalability.  The decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Aave’s proposal to launch a native crypto-based stablecoin GHO was passed over the weekend with 99% votes in favor of the proposal, its governance page shows.  An interest piece I read over the weekend was Andres Angler’s piece on two football teams transferring a South American player using USDC. The exchange was carried out by Latin America’s Bitso, with a player from Argentina’s team Banfield to São Paulo, one of Brazil's teams. Read the full story here.  CoinDesk research analyst George Kaloudis wrote an in-depth article on the hot topic of cryptos being securities and whether it matters. You can read it here.

Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled.  Currently, ether options are mainly call options, with a put/call ratio of 0.26. The call options period is mainly concentrated on September 30 and December 30 contracts, with 1.2 billion and 1.8 billion respectively.  “The upcoming Merge is a massive driver of price right now,” said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform.  He said that about 40% of ether’s price movement today is because of the Merge, or Ethereum's shift from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake protocol. The Merge is set to take place on Sept. 19.  Head of Europe at Hashdex, Laurent Kssis, said that he suspects many investors have already taken decent positions at cheaper ETH levels to account for the potential rally.  “All will be down to the Ethereum Merge in September,” said Kssis. “This is an example of position building.”  Latest Headlines  BofA Says Ethereum Needs Scalability Improvements to Hold Its Market Position: Binance Smart Chain, Tron, Avalanche and Solana have taken market share from Ethereum.

Muse, a 2014-born band, has received numerous awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2011 and 2016, the NME Award for Best British Band in 2007, 2010, and 2011, the MTV Europe Music Award for Best World Stage Performance in 2019, and many more. Serenade To Use Layer-2 Solution Polygon According to the company&apos;s website, the layer-2 solution Polygon is used by Serenade to mint NFTs. Polygon&apos;s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism is described as being &apos;much more efficient&apos; than Ethereum&apos;s existing Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus process. One standout feature of Serenade is that users may buy NFTs using debit and credit cards on the website without first having to build a cryptocurrency wallet. Users can also use their already-established Coinbase-linked Bitcoin or Ethereum wallets. The Guardian reports that the future NFT release from Muse will be available in both an NFT and a limited-edition format, with a global maximum of 1,000 copies.

42395115,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASX3EC,1659356833,Ether Flips Bitcoin in Options Market for the First Time,"Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, has overtaken industry leader bitcoin (BTC) in the options market for the first time on record.  As of writing, the cumulative dollar value of ether options contracts opens on dominant exchange Deribit was $5.7 billion, or 32% higher, than $4.3 billion locked in open bitcoin options trades. Deribit is the world's largest crypto-options exchange, accounting for more than 90% of the global total trading volume and open interest.  Open-options trades or open interest refers to the number of options contracts (call and put) traded but not squared off with an offsetting position. The notional open interest is calculated by multiplying the number of contracts open with the going spot market price of the underlying asset.  Ether's historic first lead over bitcoin in the options market comes as traders pile into ETH calls or bullish bets in the hope that Ethereum's impending merge would cause a 90% reduction in ETH issuance and bring a store of value appeal to the cryptocurrency. Merge, likely to happen in September, will combine Ethereum's current proof-of-work blockchain with a proof-of-stake blockchain called the Beacon Chain, which has been running since 2020.  The increased demand for calls is evident from the sliding put-call open interest ratio, a measure of the number of open put positions relative to open call positions. Call options offer insurance against bullish moves, while put options provide protection against price drops.  ""While some may be uncertain of the outcome of the Merge, at Deribit, we see a lot of post-Merge options open interest being created. Overall, put-call ratio is at a year low, indicating bullish momentum,"" Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk.  ""BTC put-call ratio is at 0.5, while ETH put-call ratio is half of that at 0.26, and year-end expiry even again 50% lower at 0.12. The biggest ETH open interest is created in the December expiry call option at $3,000 strike."" Strijers added.  Activity in the ether spot market has picked up too, with the cryptocurrency recently toppling bitcoin as the most traded coin on the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). While the ether trading volume accounted for 33.4% of the total turnover registered in the week ended July 29, the bitcoin trading volume accounted for 32%, with SOL in distant third place.  ""Investors have looked to buy BTC as it hasn't kept pace with ETH and the broader complex. Additionally, we have seen renewed interest in SOL, MATIC, and AVAX,"" according to Coinbase's weekly market commentary published Friday.  That said, in terms of market valuation, ether, at $199 billion, is still half the size of bitcoin, whose market cap stood at $443 billion at press time. Some observers are confident that ether will soon replace bitcoin as the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value.  Further, ether continues to play second-fiddle to bitcoin in terms of daily trading volume in futures and options markets and open interest in the futures market. Per data provided by Skew, the notional open interest in ether futures was around $6 billion as of this writing. That's half the $12 billion in bitcoin futures.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/01/ether-flips-bitcoin-in-options-market-for-the-first-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2c7c0175dcbd801a07f14e0a034fc69570084c7-600x371.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Peter McCormack: Wright Put Forward 'False Evidence,' Will Receive Damages of One British Pound","U.K. High Court Judge Martin Chamberlain has ruled that Craig Wright, the Australian scientist who claims to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, advanced false evidence in his defamation case against Peter McCormack.  Though finding that comments made by McCormack caused ""serious harm"" to Wright's reputation, the judge awarded Wright only nominal damages of one British pound (US$1.23) — barely enough to buy a candy bar.  The legal battle concerned a 2019 discussion – later broadcast on YouTube – in which McCormack said Wright ""is not Satoshi"" and called him a liar and a fraud. Wright's case against McCormack centered on his claim that such comments caused him financial damage after he was disinvited to speak at various events and conferences.  Chamberlain, however, concluded that Wright had ""advanced a deliberately false case as to the dis-invitations from academic conferences."" Thus, the judge said, there would be ""no injustice"" in awarding just the one pound.  In a statement distributed by his lawyers, Wright said, ""I intend to appeal the adverse findings of the judgment in which my evidence was clearly misunderstood.""  Craig Wright has been involved in a number of legal battles emanating from his claims to be the inventor of the Bitcoin system.  Nobody knows the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, who published the Bitcoin white paper in 2008 and released the first version of its software the following year. He faded from the community in subsequent years, leaving the trail of his true identity to run cold.  Read more: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?

More than 44% of the hash rate on the network is under MINEXMR&apos;s control. However, this has sparked debate on many forums and social media sites among the Monero community about whether or not it would endanger decentralization. Similar complaints have been made on the r/monero subreddit, which is dedicated to Monero. Community members on this subreddit stressed that the pool is &apos;too close to 51 %&apos; and trended &apos;boycott MINEXMR.&apos; A miner can take over the entire network by controlling most of the hash power in a 51% attack. In addition to extensive blockchain reorganizations, such attacks may result in problems with double-spending on the internet.

The next in line is Nanopool, contributing 21.82% of the global hash rate for XMR. Like the third line, Supportxmr controls 14.85% of the total hash rate for XMR.

42395096,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASX30Q,1659351678,BofA Says Ethereum Needs Scalability Improvements to Hold Its Market Position,"The Ethereum blockchain’s transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS) seems imminent, with an Ethereum Foundation member saying recently that the switch is provisionally expected in mid-September, Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report last week.  The Merge, the first of five planned updates for the blockchain, will combine Ethereum’s existing execution layer with the Beacon Chain, a PoS consensus layer, the report said.  “PoS decreases Ethereum’s energy consumption by over 99%, lowers barriers to entry for investors to generate yield as network validators and alters ETH’s supply/demand dynamics,” the bank said, referring to the system’s ether token.  The transition also acts as a precursor for the “Surge,” the second of the planned upgrades, the note said. That will aim to improve Ethereum’s throughput from around 15 transactions per second (TPS) to about 100,000 TPS while reducing transaction fees, it added.  Without the scalability improvements, Ethereum is unlikely to remain as the dominant blockchain operating system, the bank said.  Bank of America notes that newer blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Tron, Avalanche and Solana have taken market share from Ethereum because of their PoS consensus mechanisms, greater scalability and lower transaction fees. The bank added these features will “likely be key as the Web 3 ecosystem of decentralized applications emerges.”  Web3 represents the next generation of the internet, one that focuses on shifting power from big tech companies to individual users.

Reuters recently published several investigation articles about Binance and its connection to illegal activities. According to the news service, Binance has turned into a hotbed for illicit activity, and it disregarded multiple money-laundering warning signs. Binance User Base&apos;s Links With Hydra According to Reuters, Binance&apos;s user base has strong ties to Hydra, a Russian-language darknet market, and the exchange has enabled $780 million in payments tied to Hydra since 2017. Former investigators of the American Internal Revenue Service&apos;s cybercrime unit, Tigran Gambaryan, and Matthew Price, now head Binance&apos;s compliance team. Major darknet markets, including Silk Road, AlphaBay, and Hydra, were taken down by Gambaryan and Price. The exchange hired Chagri Poyraz, a former HSBC sanctions expert, as its global head of sanctions compliance.

42395114,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASX3BF,1659350204,"UK Crypto Investors Should Limit Holdings, Financial Regulator Says","Investment in crypto assets should be capped, with consumers warned that they could lose all their money, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said in a policy document published Monday.  There will be a ban on offering bonuses to clients who refer friends, the financial-services regulator said as it prepares for new laws that will extend its powers to cover digital assets including cryptocurrencies.  In April, then-Finance Minister Rishi Sunak said he wanted to make the country a crypto asset hub. But the recent market crash, which saw a fall in the price of bitcoin (BTC) and the collapse of assets such as the terraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, has made the regulator only more determined to act against what it sees as unduly risky behavior.  “We want people to be able to invest with confidence, understand the risks involved and get the investments that are right for them which reflect their appetite for risk,” Sarah Pritchard, the FCA’s executive director of markets, said in a statement.  “Where we see products being marketed that don’t contain the right risk warnings or are unclear, unfair or misleading, we will act,” she said, following a consultation published in January.  The FCA said that “we still consider crypto assets, when used as a speculative investment, to be high risk,” in spite of its lack of current powers to directly regulate the market.  Warning  Under the plans, potential crypto buyers must be given a “clearer and more prominent” warning that they could lose all their money and won’t be protected if something goes wrong. While the new rules in principle apply only to risky non-crypto products, the FCA is waiting for lawmakers to pass promised legislation that would extend them to innovative digital assets.  The regulator has tentatively said crypto would fall under an intermediate category of “restricted mass-market investments.” Marketing to retail investors wouldn’t be banned, but there are more limits than would apply to assets deemed safer, such as listed stocks.  Qualifying crypto assets “are only likely to be appropriate for consumers as a small part of a diversified portfolio,” and “should only be accessed when consumers understand the risks involved,” the document said, adding that exposure should be limited to 10% of net assets.  Sunak resigned in July, and is now vying with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister.

The fresh funding will give the firm a higher valuation than the $1.5 billion it commanded in June 2021, according to the report citing people familiar with the talks.  Ledger's plans suggest that despite the onset of depressed conditions in the crypto market in recent months, there are areas of the industry for which the immediate outlook looks positive, such as in hardware wallets.  With crypto firms such as exchanges beset by liquidity problems causing them to take steps such as suspending customer withdrawals, more users could be looking to store their crypto themselves on a hardware wallet. ""Not your keys, not your coins,"" is a common warning fired at those who keep their crypto on an exchange.  Ledger told CoinDesk it has 5 million customers.

42395118,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASX3DD,1659345715,"Bitcoin Trades Cautiously Even as Real Yield, Dollar Support Bullish Stance","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading tentatively even as intermarket factors favor an extension of July's double-digit gain.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at $23,300 at press time, down 1.3% on a 24-hour basis, having failed to keep gains above $24,000 over the weekend. Futures tied to the S&P 500 nursed a 0.15% decline.  What appears to be a chart-driven pullback could be fleeting considering the declining real, or inflation-adjusted, bond yield in the U.S. In two weeks, the yield on the 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed security has dropped 46 basis points to 0.20%, the lowest point since May 31, reviving the case for investing in risk assets. Historically, bitcoin has moved in the opposite direction to the real yield. The 90-day correlation coefficient between the two stood at -90% at press time, indicating a strong inverse relationship.  ""Since the [U.S. Federal Reserve] meeting last week, real yields have been falling across the curve. Here we can see both five- and two-year real yields falling back into negative territory, while 10-year real yields are dancing right above 0,"" Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at NewEdge Wealth, said in a Twitter thread, adding that the decline in real rates contributed to the recent rally in growth stocks.  A positive real yield means the payout from investing in bonds exceeds market-based measures of inflation. The higher the real yield, the lower the incentive to hold risky investments and vice versa. Real yields collapsed below zero after the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020, sparking an unprecedented bull run in risk assets, including bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's bull market ended in November 2021 as the yield on the 10-year inflation-indexed security bottomed at -1.17%.  Bitcoin's biggest nemesis, the dollar index (DXY), also traded weak early Monday, offering positive cues to the cryptocurrency. The DXY hovered around 105.70, down 0.7%, hinting at an extension of the slide from the 20-day high of 109.29 reached on July 14.  If the real yield and the dollar continue to lose ground, that could add to demand for bitcoin. A recently released Bank of America (BAC) survey of fund managers, conducted July 8-15, showed dire levels of pessimism and increased cash holdings – potentially adding to buying pressure.  ""There's a lot of pent-up buying pressure in risk assets, including crypto,"" analysts at crypto options platform Genesis Volatility wrote in Sunday's edition of the market analytics note. ""Stock FANG charts look like they could explode higher and crypto could do the same,"" they wrote, referring to Facebook (now Meta), Apple, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet).  While the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the upside, the week ahead could bring plenty of volatility as a raft of manufacturing data is scheduled for release across the globe. On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department will release July jobs data, known as the nonfarm payrolls report, detailing the employment picture in the world's second-largest economy.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/01/bitcoin-trades-cautiously-even-as-real-yield-dollar-support-bullish-stance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c6b95bb4980de9e5e9faeca60bc8d2aa59dc77d-1672x1254.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the latest round of funding, the project received support from six angel investors, including former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, Ryan Rodenbaugh of TrueFi, and David Post of Chainlink Labs. DeFi Universes and Debt DAO According to Dragonfly Capital general partner Haseeb Qureshi, debt is now one of the major missing parts of the DeFi world, and Debt DAO is one of the finest teams in this sector attacking that challenge. Revenue-generating DAOs won&apos;t need to sell their native tokens for working capital as on-chain organizations and cash flows grow. The debt DAO will advance the DAO financial ecosystem as a whole. In May, Dragonfly Capital closed its third venture fund with a $650 million oversubscription. DeFi, DAOs, NFTs, and scaling smart contracts were highlighted as some of its key priority areas in a statement.The post Dragonfly Capital Leads $3.5 Million Seed Round for Debt DAO appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LINK,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/dragonfly-capital-leads-3-5-million-seed-round-for-debt-dao/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dragonfly-capital-leads-3-5-million-seed-round-for-debt-dao,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

The DAO&apos;s support for the Snapshot vote, which concluded today at 6:00 a.m. EDT, was nearly unanimous. According to the voting website, the proposal was supported by DAO members holding 501,000 AAVE tokens. This equated to 99.99% of the votes cast during the three-day election. After the voting, a new Aave enhancement protocol will be used to implement the formation of the GHO stablecoin (AIP). After the stablecoin is created, management of it will be under the control of the DAO. Aave Users Can Submit Crypto Tokens Users of Aave who want to mint GHO can submit any of the crypto tokens accepted on the site as collateral. These deposits will not only serve as collateral but also generate a yield for Aave. Borrowers who take out GHO stablecoin loans will be charged interest according to the protocol. As with MakerDAO&apos;s DAI, Aave intends for GHO to act as an overcollateralized stablecoin. This indicates that more GHO tokens will be created than the value of the deposited coin. Stani Kulechov, the founder of Aave, previously stated that the project would try to promote organic acceptance for GHO on Layer 2 of Ethereum. Aave will join a small group of MakerDAO and DeFi stablecoin issuers by launching a stablecoin.

The proposal was intended to improve on the features of Aave's lending platform, as previously reported. Some 501,000 aave (AAVE) tokens were used to cast votes in support, with just 12 tokens in opposition. Address 0x5B3bFfC0bcF8D4cAEC873fDcF719F60725767c98 exerted the largest weight on votes, putting up 183,000 AAVE in support of the proposal.  Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that locks over $6.8 billion worth of various cryptocurrencies on supported networks, data from DeFiLlama shows. DeFi refers to lending, borrowing and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without third-party support. Aave is a lending and borrowing platform that allows users to earn yields on their pledged tokens.  GHO would soon be offered to Aave users and allow them to mint the token against their supplied collaterals. The token can be minted by users against a diversified set of crypto assets. GHO holders will continue to earn interest on the supplied collateral, just like other lending transactions on Aave.  The token would work similarly to existing algorithmic stablecoins, which mint exactly $1 worth of tokens when users provide $1 worth of cryptocurrency. In GHO’s case, a user must supply collateral (at a specific collateral ratio) to be able to mint GHO. If a user repays a borrow position (or is liquidated), the GHO protocol burns that user’s GHO, the proposal explained.  As per the proposal, the interest payments on the stablecoin will be sent to the protocol's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), generating revenue for the community and allowing the DAO to bolster its treasury for funding future products or tools.  All decisions relating to GHO will be in the hands of the Aave community.",POSITIVE,AAVE,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/01/aave-passes-proposal-for-yield-generating-stablecoin-gho,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfa9129660d4d98600f636688e5537cc394023ff-3085x2314.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Key Technical Points: The BTC prices have been down by 1.62% in the last 24 hours. The price action displays an increase in the number of higher price rejection candles. The 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin is $23.31 billion, indicating a drop of 15.92%. Past Performance of BTC The Bitcoin (BTC) prices take a bullish turnaround from the psychological mark of $20,000, leading to a Morning Star pattern after the Feds increased interest rates. The bullish reversal inflated the market price by 15% within three days to reach the 24,500 level. However, the ascending resistance trend knocks the prices below, leading to multiple higher price rejection candles. Hence the current market condition shows an increased level of fear among investors that may lead to a retest of the $21,875 breakout. Source - Tradingview BTC Technical Analysis The bearish influence of the resistance trendline affects the Bitcoin (BTC) market price negatively as it has led to a 5% retracement in the last three days. Hence traders can find opportunities to short sell at the current market price as selling pressure increases. The bullish turnaround takes over the 50-day SMA, but the retracement possibility might soon retest it. The RSI slope attempts to take support at the 14-day SMA above the halfway line to keep the trend in motion.

42421149,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWUX,1659314534,Binance Investigations Officer: AML Cost Exchange ‘Billions in Revenue’,"UPDATE (Aug. 1, 17:11 UTC): Clarifies headline and fixes transcript to reflect that it was not the addition of know-your-customer (KYC) identity checks, but rather the anti-money-laundering (AML) measure of removing sanctioned accounts in part because they hadn't gone through KYC, that cost Binance billions in revenue. Also corrects name of the executives' department (investigations, which reports to compliance but is separate).  Three leading members of Binance’s investigations team opened up about what it takes to deal with fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and bad press for the world’s largest crypto exchange.  Reuters recently published a series of investigative reports on Binance and its association with illicit activity. The news service claimed that Binance has become a hub for criminal activity and that it overlooked several money-laundering red flags. Reuters claimed also that Hydra, a Russian-language darknet market, has links deeply entrenched within Binance’s user base, stating that the exchange facilitated $780 million in payments related to Hydra since 2017.  Binance’s investigations team is now led by Tigran Gambaryan and Matthew Price, former investigators at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service’s cybercrime unit. Both men played roles in taking down prominent darknet markets AlphaBay, Silk Road and Hydra.  The exchange, which operates in numerous jurisdictions despite not having a formally registered headquarters, also recruited ex-HSBC sanctions expert Chagri Poyraz as its new global head of sanctions compliance.  CoinDesk reached out to Binance to verify Reuters’ claims and ended up having two long conversations with Gambaryan, Price and Poyraz. They disputed a number of the claims, including allegations that Binance disproportionately facilitates more money-laundering than other exchanges and Binance has become a hotbed for criminality.  At times, the executives sounded like pub patrons venting to a bartender, occasionally using pejoratives to describe journalists, and such comments should be taken with a pinch of salt.  Nevertheless, they spoke with surprising candor on how the criminal underworld remains firmly ingrained within the crypto industry, despite their best efforts, In the process they offered a rare window into how they tracked down some of the world’s most notorious cybercriminals, all while trying to keep the lid on illicit funds being siphoned through Binance.  What do you make of the claims connecting Binance to Hydra?  Matthew Price: Yes, Hydra was humongous and yes, it did business in Russia, so it’s like saying that Bank of America supports money laundering for drug cartels. It really paints this picture that “Binance knew this market was operating, so they must support it.”  Tigran Gambaryan: You can’t control the money that’s going in. You cannot control deposits. You can control what you do afterward. When Indian scammers ask people to get Apple gift cards, does that mean Apple is now laundering hundreds of millions of dollars? No. The criminals go for the easiest and cheapest way possible. If Binance was the cheapest, why wouldn’t they use it?  MP: A good example, we identified HitBTC accounts that processed transactions [referring to two Canadian citizens who were charged with stealing $220,000 while posing as employees of a Hong Kong-based exchange]. We only had the email address. With that email address we [while working at the IRS] could obtain search warrants and we could see the content of those. We could see that the user was paying himself with gift cards. I was able to link it through email accounts, so I never got to a KYC (know your customer) crypto account until quite far down the investigation, but I already knew who that was and what they were doing.  MP: The only part KYC played was where he needed to get his fiat out. Coinbase, Circle and Kraken picked up on the transaction piece that came from the Helix mixer and kicked him off the platform. So he went off the exchange and started using initially LocalBitcoins, then face-to-face meetups. The exchanges are not where the dirty money happens. It’s offline because these guys know this [that activity is traced]. They don’t want to use exchanges. If [the criminal] tried to use Binance, the transaction would get picked up with transaction monitoring.  TG: Even in 2019, I was able to identify those two knuckleheads who were related to the Twitter VIP scam. That was Mason Sheppard in the U.K. That was all done through Binance.  How does Binance compare to other exchanges in terms of illicit activity?  TG: We did a study. If you take into consideration illicit funds going in against the total volume of the exchange, yes, there’s illegal money going in, but there’s a lot of money going in. Binance is better or the same as most exchanges. Our stuff was drastically better than Kraken, better than Coinbase in some areas and worse in some areas. But there’s not a single outlier.  We operate in different jurisdictions. It makes our job challenging. That’s why we have to focus more on those jurisdictions [France, Italy, Dubai]. But us working in those jurisdictions allows law enforcement agencies to take action.  We are doing a lot of incredible work. I can’t comment on what happened in the past as none of us were here. The whole industry was [messed] up – the whole thing was just kind of developing. They all went through this period when [bad things] happened.  Reuters claimed that users can evade sanctions and skirt the law by using VPNs (virtual private networks). What is your take on that?  TG: Here’s the thing about VPNs. No exchange blocks VPNs, for the record. No crypto exchange blocks VPN activity. VPN activity is not an indication of criminal activity. It is not by itself an indication that someone is a criminal. Using a VPN is not illegal and it is not something that exchanges block. With that being said, without getting into specifics, VPN activity can be useful [for investigations]. Because there are certain players that have patterns of using this – and that, in conjunction with other things, will then tell us who these people might be. VPN was never something that stopped me from identifying someone.  I’ve never once been stung by a VPN.  (Poyraz, who spoke to CoinDesk from Davos, Switzerland, where he was meeting 30 industry leaders, added that the exchange continues to serve Iranian customers outside of Iran because doing so isn’t a breach of U.S. sanctions. Reuters alleged that several Iranian traders had accessed Binance from 2019 to 2021 before the exchange tightened its KYC process. This week, The New York Times reported that rival exchange Kraken will likely face fines from the Treasury Department on suspicions that the exchange allowed Iranian users to use the platform.)  Chagri Poyraz: From a sanctions point of view, Iranian citizens living outside Iran is not even an issue for OFAC [Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. agency that enforces sanctions]. … If it’s North Korea or Syria, those are U.N. sanctions. They are applicable anywhere that U.N. sanctions are recognized. But if it's U.S. sanctions, which is Iran and Cuba, it’s only applicable according to U.S. legislation and enforcement. And by the way, they will never go after Iranian citizens living abroad. It is illegal to do that.  TG: In European countries, it’s illegal for companies to comply with U.S. sanctions against Iran. [Sanctions rules between Europe and the U.S. are vague and contradictory, according to a Financial Times report].  CP: The reason Binance hires people like Tigran and me is to build sophistication around the sanctions program. I actually enabled an Iranian refugee in the U.K. to get a Binance account. Even that was not allowed before [Binance improved its controls to make a distinction between a resident and national of a sanctioned country], which was a wrong thing to do.  TG: It is illegal to comply with U.S. sanctions in the EU. This shows again the complicated fact that we are not a U.S. entity. We take a very conservative approach that is putting us at risk in non-U.S. jurisdictions. But we are complying with [U.S. sanctions]. Our compliance with them is putting us technically in an illegal position in other jurisdictions as my understanding is that it goes against EU law.  CP: Just to expand, please ask any bank if they open accounts for Iranian accounts for people residing in their country or the United States. The answer will be yes. … If you want to talk about Iranians living in Iran, we take every single measure. Yes, there is always evasion, but when there is evasion, we find it and upgrade our controls.  Reuters reported that Telegram messages suggested that Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao ignored calls from compliance officers over a loose KYC and anti-money-laundering (AML) policy. What is your view on CZ?  TG: CZ has been incredibly supportive.  CP: I have been a compliance officer for 17-plus years now. The main job is to explain to the business, including the CEO, what the risk and the problem is and to make a risk-based decision. You never ask them to do something illegal, but if there is something in a gray area, make a risk based decision. The CZ I know – and I’ve been here long enough – when you explain something to him, I have never seen him hesitate [to act properly]. He will never do the wrong thing.  TG: He did not have the same caliber of people around him that he does now. This was a small company. They grew, and look at the people they have now. I can’t defend anything that happened before. We are here fixing those issues. I know for a fact that CZ has made decisions that have cost [Binance] a ton of money. We out-platformed accounts that had millions of users on it because of those risk-based decisions. Because it was the right thing to do. It cost billions of dollars, but he did it.  In July 2021, Binance decided to lower the controversial 2-BTC withdrawal limit for non-KYC accounts to 0.06 BTC. Was there a notable decline in illicit activity after this change?  TG: We did. We actually commissioned a study. If you want to go on LinkedIn and see a colorful exchange between me and someone who is on the January 6 commission who used to be at the [U.S. Department of Justice], Amanda Wick, I was having an argument because she is steering a narrative. It’s kind of weird having someone from the DOJ come in and comment on something an exchange put out.  TG: But anyway, I’ve commissioned something for the investigations team to do: What is the effect of 2021 and when this thing started compared to the past 6-8 months? There is a huge difference [in amount of illicit activity], not only in deposits, if you look at a total percentage of transactions. Binance is exponentially larger than its competitors.  If you use real math, the numbers [of illicit activity] are the same industry-wide. Better than some, worse than others. But again, this is largely based on the jurisdiction we operate which puts extra strain on those [Binance staff working in] jurisdictions to make sure the numbers are cleaner. But there is no single outlier.  There is nothing that screams that Binance is a den of criminal activity, and that’s what I wanted. I wanted to kind of put something out there that [supports] this.  CP: We should be demonstrating it more, but us demonstrating it is tipping off other criminals. We cannot do it every day because it will tip them off. One example, I respect your domain and that you will do your own fact checks. Check when we exited [stopped doing business with] Garantex [an Estonia-based exchange that was sanctioned by the U.S. for laundering over $100 million of illicit funds]. Almost a month before it was designated by OFAC. We can take that call as CZ lets us take that call. All I know is that I exited a month before because we are empowered to do so.  TG: There are other exchanges that continue to do business with them. I think we lost 90% of customers [of one entity that a Binance spokesperson says represented a sliver of exchange volume] from that user because not everybody came in to get KYC, and this cost us billions of dollars in revenue.  Why does Binance have no physical headquarters?  Jessica Lung (Binance spokesperson): Yes, so we have registration in Italy, France, Abu Dhabi and now Spain.  (Binance would not disclose where the main headquarters is located or where it will be located.)  TG: I was just in Paris. I met with law enforcement in Paris – it’s not a secret. We have offices everywhere. So we’re actively expanding into Europe, APAC (Asian Pacific) and Latin America. There is ongoing licensing in place.  JL: If you look at the requirements for the France registration, it’s super stringent and the due diligence and requirements are a very high bar. So if you look at that, you can see what our actual process is like.  TG: I hope I could one day give you access to our law enforcement intake to see how much we’re working on and providing for the world. Binance staff in Brazil did a weeklong class with federal police out there. We’re in France [where licenses are hard to get]. So it’s crazy for me to know what’s going on [at Binance that the Reuters story missed]. I guess I’m just upset. Ignore me. I hate wasting my time with those [journalists].",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/01/binance-compliance-officer-kyc-cost-exchange-billions-in-revenue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edbcac1e1ded846c8e4e559bf731c4da4ebec714-4771x3578.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
