42398058,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFW42,1418243433,Uncertainty Builds as Alpha Technology Misses Another Shipping Deadline,"British mining equipment maker Alpha Technology has been investigated by police in Manchester, following complaints lodged against it with the national fraud and cybercrime centre, ActionFraud.  The centre, which is run by the City of London Police, said it has received 20 reports against Manchester-based Alpha Technology. Those reports were assessed by the national fraud intelligence unit and passed on to Greater Manchester Police (GMP).  The Economic Crime Unit there told CoinDesk it has looked into Alpha Technology and that its investigations are now complete. The GMP did not elaborate on what actions were taken during the investigation.  ""We have previously looked into the company,"" a Manchester police press officer said. ""GMP's investigations are now complete in respect of this matter. If further information comes to light that would require our attention then we could and may well have a further look at the operations of the company.""  ActionFraud  recommended that anyone suspecting they were a victim of fraud, should make a complaint to the GMP.  Alpha says no contact with police  According to Mohammed Akram, Alpha Technology's chief executive and founder, no one at his company has been contacted by the police or the fraud intelligence unit.  Akram defended his company, which took deposits for its miners in January, but has missed all its delivery deadlines so far.  He said:  ""Any investigation would show a full paper trail where everything is as clean as a whistle. Any delays were out of our control due to many technical and market reasons.""  He claimed that Alpha has received more than £200,000 in refunds for value-added tax (VAT) paid from the UK's tax authority. He pointed to this as evidence that his firm is engaged in a legitimate enterprise because the refunds are only issued after checks by the tax authority.  Companies registered to charge VAT in the UK are eligible for a refund on the tax for business purchases. Claims for refunds are then submitted to automated checks, which can lead to an investigation by VAT operations staff. A check with the VAT Information Exchange maintained by the European Commission shows that Alpha Technology is VAT-registered in the UK.  It's unclear how much money Alpha has received in pre-orders, although the amount could reach into the millions of pounds.  A crowd-sourced list of deposits paid to Alpha shows that the firm took £496,560 in pre-payments for 482 units. But Akram said that his firm received orders for ""over a thousand units"".  Alpha charged a 30% deposit of £405 or £1,635 for the two types of miners it sells, meaning it could have received deposits worth more than £1.63m.  The two Viper units were available in five or 25 megahashes-per-second speeds. Alpha later announced it was improving its units so they would ship 10 times faster.  History of broken promises  Alpha Technology began taking pre-orders for its miners in January, promising delivery in July. Delivery was postponed to September because the company had problems accessing customer funds on PayPal, Akram said.  In September, Akram said that delivery would be delayed by a month, citing quality-control tests as the reason for the delay.  When October ended without a delivery, he updated his company's blog to say that a new shipping date would be announced soon. In an email to CoinDesk at the end of November, he said the new shipping date would be in December.  He wrote:  ""We anticipate to deliver by December, work is still being done.""  Alpha's miners are being developed by a firm called Dexcel Designs, which has offices in India and Singapore. Dexcel's chief executive, Amit Sinha, said they are still involved in developing Alpha's products.  Sinha said in mid-November that the 'Viper' chip, which is meant to power Alpha's miners, was ""working fine"". He said ""testing and characterisation"" of the silicon was underway. Characterisation of silicon is the process of determining the electrical and other properties of a given chip. Sinha did not respond to a request for videos or images of the testing process.  After that process was complete, Dexcel would begin developing prototypes and embark on mass production, Sinha said.  Akram has posted photographs claiming to show the Viper chip in development on the Alpha Technology blog.  Use the interactive timeline below to view Alpha Technology's delivery delays.  Legal action in the offing?  Despite Akram's latest assurances, further action against Alpha Technology may be coming. An attorney who is gathering material for a class action against Swedish firm KnCMiner, Charlotte Lin, said her firm is also launching an investigation against Alpha. She did not provide further details on the investigation.  A law firm in the UK, Selachii LLP, said it had received ""many enquiries"" on taking legal action against Alpha, but none of the enquirers have engaged the firm, said Richard Howlett, a partner at Selachii.  Howlett said:  ""We have had many inquiries from prospective clients but none have wished to proceed to taking action against [Alpha Technology]. We do feel that all people who have paid monies to Alpha have a claim as it appears that something untoward has occurred.""  Customers who have been waiting nearly a year for their miners from Alpha are unlikely to find succour in Akram's latest assurances. Many customers appear to be still actively pursuing a refund or delivery from the firm.  A messageboard called 'Fight Alpha Technology Scam' has been set up, filled with posts containing advice on how to take action against Alpha, including instructions on how to report the firm to UK authorities. Some posters there say they have received refunds for payments made to Alpha by PayPal.  Another missed deadline  Other customers have taken to visiting Alpha's registered address at 66 Dickenson Road in Manchester. Staff at the Bicycle Doctor, which is located two doors away, say they have been surprised to see people driving up to photograph the exterior of Alpha's premises. The photo accompanying this post, of Alpha's office showing metal shutters rolled shut over its entrance, was taken on 10th December.  Bicycle Doctor staff also say they have received several phone calls from Alpha customers seeking information on their neighbour. The cycle shop has been at its Dickenson Road location for 30 years.  ""There was coming and going by a handful of young-looking lads,"" said a staffer at the cycle shop, who didn't wish to be named. ""They did seem to set up in the premises that is just next door to us. The front room wasn't occupied by the looks of it. There hasn't been coming and going for awhile, a few months.""  The man at the heart of the matter has been elusive. Akram responded to several emails and agreed to a phone interview with CoinDesk scheduled for 8th December. As the date drew near however, he did not respond to requests for a time and phone number to call. The appointed date came and went with no word from Akram despite repeated requests.  In one of his earlier email responses to CoinDesk, Akram continued to defend his company's missed shipping deadlines.  He wrote:  ""Shipping late due to factors out of our control does not mean we are a fraud. Fraud is a huge accusation.""

42398056,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFW15,1418234424,LocalBitcoins 'Exploring Options' After Service Halt in Germany,"New details have emerged from the LocalBitcoins management team following its announcement this week that it would abruptly halt services in Germany.  The peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace is one of the older and more popular bitcoin startups, having launched in July 2012, though its users have faced legal troubles in some jurisdictions. Adding fuel to speculation was the original announcement from LocalBitcoins that it would shutdown its services due to ""regulatory reasons"".    http://t.co/byGAoG3WSI won't be available in Germany anymore due to regulatory reasons. We hope this is temporary. Press enquiries via email      — LocalBitcoins.com (@LocalBitcoins) December 8, 2014      Speaking to CoinDesk, LocalBitcoins vice president Nikolaus Kangas reported that the company has been contacted by Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), the country's financial service and securities regulator.  Kangas explained:  ""Practically, there is a possibility that our business model requires some kind of license in Germany, and we do not currently have such a license.""  In the face of this information, LocalBicoins indicated that its lawyers advised the company to close the service temporarily as it searches for a solution.  However, BaFin was less clear, according to Kangas, about the kind of license LocalBitcoins will need to secure in order to restore its services in Germany or who it would need to speak to about such preparations.  ""We do not know any exact details regarding that yet,"" Kangas said. ""Right now, we are trying to find answers to these questions.""  LocalBitcoins estimated that it had more than 8,000 active users in Germany at the time the service was closed.  Paths forward  Kangas acknowledged that the news could lead LocalBitcoins to exit the German market, though he suggested that such speculation is preliminary.  As for now, he indicated that it is researching the cost of licensure, as well as how much work it would need to conduct to procure such documentation.  ""We are trying to research what kind of options we have regarding licensure, but of course our intention is to continue offering services in Germany as soon as possible,"" he said.  Kangas further apologised to customers who were affected by the move, stating that it was ""really disappointing"" that the company needed to make the decision.  ""The roots of this service are actually partly in Germany, so it is kind of ironic and sad that we cannot offer the service there anymore,"" he added.  Favorable jurisdiction  The announcement may have come as a surprise to many in the community given that Germany has long been perceived as a friendly jurisdiction for bitcoin companies due to its August 2013 decision to recognize bitcoin as a form of 'private money'.  Such classification stands in contrast to jurisdictions like in US, where bitcoin is considered property, and therefore subject to additional tax reporting requirements when used in the sale of goods and services and as an investment tool.  Further, Germany is the home of Fidor Bank, the Internet direct bank that has been one of the most vocal and visible proponents of bitcoin in the traditional financial space, a factor its partner Kraken attributes to the country's regulatory environment.  Kangas suggested that Germany's actual rules, however, may not be as accommodating to LocalBicoins. ""Bitcoins are not considered as money but as a 'unit of account',"" he said.  However, at this point, Kangas indicated its too early to draw any conclusions about how past statements from BaFin might help them move forward.  ""We are not sure whether that is relevant regarding our case or not,"" Kangas added.

42398055,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFW06,1418227346,Amex Veteran Launches White-Label Bitcoin Debit Card Platform,"A new platform for payments processing is looking to capitalize on nascent demand for bitcoin-powered debit card solutions.  Founded in February, Blade Financial is pitching its service to digital currency companies that want to offer debit card services to customers but lack the resources or capabilities to actually launch a product. Such offerings have proved problematic for some startups, and for Blade, this uneven track record is a big business opportunity.  CoinDesk spoke with CEO Ed Boyle, who has previously served as general manager for American Express' prepaid cards unit. Boyle said that the Blade team has decades of experience launching similar products and hopes to leverage this expertise to provide debit cards to an industry he described as very interested in such a solution.  Boyle noted that for many digital currency companies, the act of issuing a debit card is fraught of complications, most notably the cross-jurisdictional legal and compliance hurdles that arise during the process.  He explained:  “To deploy a card against that is extremely difficult. You have to figure out the bank partner, and the laws, for every single country. It just doesn’t seem to make sense to us if there are 20 or 30 companies that want to do this separately trying to figure this out.”  Boyle boasts that his team has the capability to solve that challenge, arguing their expertise in payments solutions and card products puts them in a position to sidestep the hurdles involved.  A middleman solution  While the project is still taking shape, the system Boyle described effectively creates a data transaction layer between a bitcoin company and a card issuer by way of a custom API.  According to Boyle, the process of selecting card networks is still underway and conversations with potential customers remain in progress.  ""The reality of that process is that the banks work directly with the payment networks and really we’re, at our core, a technology company that provides connectivity between banks and bitcoin companies,"" he said.  Boyle explained that the Blade system provides a means for banks to understand transaction data denominated in bitcoin. This means providing connectivity, processing trading requests, settlement instructions and other mechanisms that enable bitcoin to be spent through a credit card network built for fiat currency.  He said that Blade is taking a global approach to building its customer base, arguing that there are bitcoin companies looking to establish either regional or worldwide audiences.  'Great interest' in debit cards  When asked about the bitcoin industry's past efforts to provide debit card solutions, Boyle was optimistic that his company’s approach can solve problems and capitalize on existing demand for such services.  Drawing an example from the wider banking system, Boyle explained that debit cards have increasingly become a facilitator for both storing and exchanging value, making them a commonly understood tool for both putting bitcoin in people’s hands as well as spreading broader adoption.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We have the classic chicken-and-the-egg problem of there’s not a lot of users because there aren’t a lot of merchants, and there aren't a lot of merchants because there aren’t a lot of users. We just simply want to take half that equation away and say 'No, we’ve got ubiquitous spending opportunities.'""  Boyle said that a significant number of bitcoin companies that Blade has spoken with are planning a debit card solution, and for the most part want to avoid an in-house development process. He called discussions with bitcoin companies “overwhelmingly positive” thus far.  Blade is hoping to begin servicing B2B customers in the bitcoin space in early 2015, with alpha testing already underway on both the payments processing infrastructure and debit cards themselves.  If all goes according to plan, he said, Blade will begin announcing its first partners sometime in the first quarter of next year.

42398060,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFW51,1418212537,New Blockchain Startup Brings Contracts into the Digital Age,"One of the most notable features of blockchain-based technology is the ability to provide substantial public proof of information.  Now a startup called SmartContract is harnessing this aspect of the technology to create contractual agreements that can be used by both experts and newcomers alike.  SmartContract  CEO Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk:  “We want to be the secure web layer that gives people access to infrastructure that they can use to create valuable trust.”  These trust-based agreements can utilize the ever-growing amounts of available data on the web – such as currency prices, web search figures or even GPS signals – as a burden of proof, which has helped SmartContract to launch its first three products.  Nazarov and his SmartContracts team have been working on trustless systems for some time, having launched something called Secure Asset Exchange built off of the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange NXT last year.  “We have been thinking about smart contracts since the beginning of this year,” said Nazarov, who added that a four-person team was assembled to develop the SmartContract platform over the summer.  The SmartContracts effort is being backed by Data Collective, an investment group based in San Francisco. Data Collective has invested in other financial technology companies such as Standard Treasury and TradeBlock.  Simple, logic-based contracts  So how does SmartContract work?  “We create a substantial amount of trust by putting the documents in hashing form, by tracking external trustworthy data sources and by providing a front end where everybody can see what’s going on,"" Nazarov explained.  SmartContract's front-end is designed to make it easy for the average person to understand the logical statements and data sources from which these contracts are derived.  In addition to this user interface, more advanced users of this platform can find the code version of the contract in a downloadable JSON format for further extensibility.  SmartContract prides itself on having products people can use today, and intends to iterate fast. “We’re very early, but we’re working as fast as we can, “ Nazarov said.    download our research report.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/10/new-blockchain-startup-brings-contracts-into-the-digital-age,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bdf0e521fc9d6121653a03de0eed3e8e7116db76-1500x879.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398043,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVoI,1418209179,The Future of a Commodity: Bitcoin Regulation and the CFTC,"Mark Wetjen, a commissioner at the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has made it known loud and clear recently that bitcoin fits the legal definition of a commodity and that the CFTC has authority to regulate the digital currency.  So what would the CFTC's regulation of bitcoin actually look like? For the average bitcoin user and business, probably not anything dramatic. For people who buy and sell bitcoins daily, though, there might be a new sheriff in town.  The history of futures trading  For starters, the CFTC is called the Commodities Futures Trading Commission for a reason. That’s because the CFTC’s core power is not to regulate commodities themselves, but to regulate commodities futures – though the CFTC might not be limited to this role, as we’ll see below. Prices for traditional commodities like wheat and corn fluctuate widely – not unlike bitcoin prices – so buyers and sellers long ago sought a way to lock in a good rate before harvest time.  This is the origin of commodities futures, which are standardized, tradable contracts to buy or sell commodities at a later date for a fixed price. As futures contracts grew in sophistication, so did traders . . . and cheaters. The CFTC (and its predecessors) were created to ensure the integrity of these futures markets in the US.  So the heaviest CFTC regulation of bitcoin would likely concern not the cryptocurrency itself, but derivative bitcoin hedging contracts. Issuers involved with bitcoin futures might have to register with the CFTC and consequently jump though a number of regulatory hoops.  The special case of bitcoin markets  In truth, that future is already partly here: Commissioner Wetjen’s comments on bitcoin coincided with the CFTC’s approval of the first swap pegged to the price of a bitcoin. Although a swap isn’t actually a futures contract (a futures contract contemplates purchase and delivery of a commodity; a swap only involves payments of money based on price movements), it serves a similar economic function.  But there’s also a way that the CFTC can do more than just regulate hedging contracts; it could regulate bitcoin directly through its power to police “market manipulation”.  In fact, if Commissioner Wetjen is right that bitcoin actually is a commodity, then people who manipulate its markets can even be sent to jail. So now we’re not just talking about regulating bitcoin futures or swaps, but regulating the trading of bitcoins themselves.  What constitutes market manipulation? There’s no universal agreement on this question, and some judges have opted for an “I know it when I see it” approach.  Generally, though, market manipulation usually involves making fraudulent or deceptive trades aimed at moving a commodity price away from its true value. Here’s a simplified example: one person sets up several separate accounts, and then makes numerous, large volume public trades to himself, each time making it look like someone paid well above the prevailing market price. Soon, others think that the market price for the commodity has genuinely risen, and the manipulator then sells his holdings to others at that higher artificial price.  Regulation to protect from fraud  The potential for fraud in the bitcoin markets only hurts uptake and investment. Some might conclude, then, that it might not be such a bad thing if the CFTC does deem bitcoin trading to fall under its jurisdiction.  Under this view, policing market manipulation is not the kind of full-fledged, invasive regulation that many fear squelches innovation. Instead, the function that the CFTC would serve would be to watch, investigate when things look fishy, and hopefully weed out fraud.  Rather than tinkering with fundamental concepts in bitcoin use, this regulation would presumably be aimed at making sure that people can buy or sell bitcoins without being ripped off. Ideally, the CFTC’s enforcement power would increase the public’s trust in the soundness of the market for bitcoins.  Of course, as a lawyer who represents people investigated for regulatory violations, I know that even the best-intentioned regulations can ensnare well-meaning individuals and businesses. It's also possible that the CFTC could take an overly-intrusive approach to enforcement, or require unreasonable amounts of information from market participants.  No matter what your view on this situation, if you’re a frequent bitcoin buyer and seller you’d be wise to keep a close eye on the new sheriff in town, and to have a plan in place to avoid becoming ensnared in costly regulatory disputes.

Bitcoin Talk member 'johoe', an account 1.5 years old but with only 21 posts, had always stated that he or she was taking the funds for safekeeping and would return them, writing on the forum:  ""There were a large bunch of new broken addresses today (several 100s in one day). I took the liberty of saving some funds before they got swiped by others. If you can convince me that they belong to you (signing a message with the address is obviously not enough; the private key is already known), I will send the funds back.""  Johoe then posted a page of 1,019 addresses said to be compromised, and invited users to check if theirs was one of them. Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary confirmed to CoinDesk that the funds had been received.  Even before the funds were returned, Blockchain had admitted it was at fault and promised to reimburse any users who had lost money.  Random number flaw  The problem that led to the vulnerability was reportedly wallets generated with previously used 'R-values' in formulas that generate random numbers, meaning a hacker could use the public address to calculate its private keys. If R-values are unique, this should be impossible.  For the technically-inclined, Blockchain CTO Ben Reeves has pointed out the mistake in code on Blockchain's GitHub page here.  Blockchain posted in a statement that the issue affected web wallet users who had created a new wallet address or sent funds from an existing address during the period the vulnerability was live.  According to johoe  , Reeves sent an email asking him to send the funds to this address, which johoe duly did, posting a photo of a Trezor wallet sending the transaction.  Still solving the problem  Customers on Bitcoin Talk and Reddit, while relieved their funds were swept by someone with good intentions, are now contacting Blockchain to prove their losses and have them returned.  At this stage, however, it is not 100% confirmed that all funds removed from Blockchain wallets were under johoe's control. At least one user has claimed that nearly 100 BTC missing from his wallet have gone elsewhere.  Blockchain is in the process of examining ""thousands"" of customer claims and support tickets for authenticity before reimbursing.  Trezor wallet image via johoe/bitcointalk.org.

The firm's CEO Mario Gomez-Lozada told CoinDesk that the investors, who have chosen to remain publicly unnamed for now, include ""hedge funds principals, major payment aggregators and top FX traders in Japan"", along with executives of financial institutions.  Quoine  plans to use the additional funds on product development and global expansion.  Quiet growth so far  Quoine's management team explained that the company has operated in ""stealth mode"" since opening in June, with a fairly basic trading interface aimed primarily at mobile device users.  The Singapore-registered exchange initially targeted the Japanese market and, as the country's first open-order book exchange since the demise of Mt Gox, quickly became its largest bitcoin exchange in terms of volume.  Japan is still by far Quoine's biggest market, though its English-language version targets professional traders in Asian financial centers like Singapore.  The firm also recently launched an Indonesian site, hoping to tap into the potential of the world's fourth-largest country with its population of 252.1 million and second fastest-growing economy in the G20 after China.  Trading is currently available in JPY, SGD, USD, EUR, Indonesian rupiah (IDR) and AUD, while bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency offered.  New trading features  At the same time as its funding announcement, Quoine also officially announced its new margin trading and lending system, and an updated user interface.  Users are able to trade with up to 25% leverage, while non-traders may lend their own stored bitcoins to margin traders at interest rates they choose themselves.  The firm's API is available for outside developers to access, and the new trading dashboard will look more familiar to desktop users than the previous mobile-oriented site.  Quoine's 'matching engine' technology ""has been stress-tested and is capable of providing one million transactions per second of raw power"", Gomez-Lozada said. This puts the speed on par with traditional financial exchanges for stocks and forex.  He added:  ""In terms of technology capacity and feature set, we are well ahead of any bitcoin exchange globally by a very significant stretch.""  Built by finance professionals  In a scenario that would no doubt please FirstMark Capital managing director Lawrence Lenihan, Quoine's exchange was built from scratch by a group of former banking professionals with decades of combined experience in relevant FinTech fields such as trading systems, low latency, pricing and risk management.  The team includes two former C-level IT executives and top developers from major banks such as Merrill Lynch/Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Standard Chartered and Citi.  Quoine's fee structure charges 0.5% per trade for market 'takers' who buy and sell at the current market price, and no fees for any traders who sets their own preferred price (market 'makers').  'Aggressive' expansion  Quoine currently offers connections to local banks for deposits and withdrawals in Japan, Singapore and Indonesia. Its next expansion is planned to bring banking services to Hong Kong, Australia, Philippines, India and Europe.  Gomez-Lozada described the next expansion drive as ""aggressive"".  ""So far our focus has been on perfecting our services in Japan. Now we have a very solid product and we will kick off a massive global expansion.""  Also on Quoine's agenda over the coming weeks is the launch of derivatives trading, starting with a futures platform that has already been undergoing tests for ""some time"".
