42378716,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lflt,1465588689,US Government Awards $600k in Grants for Blockchain Projects,"The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded as much as $600,000 in grants to six companies working on blockchain applications for the government.  According to a press release from earlier this week, the department’s Science and Technology Directorate has parceled out $3.1m in grants to 29 small businesses based in the US in areas focused on data analytics, connected devices and blockchain. Each company received about $100,000, the government said.  The funds came from the agency's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, following a solicitation period that began in December.  For the ""applicability of blockchain technology to identity management and privacy protection"", grants were awarded to four companies: Digital Bazaar, Inc., Respect Network Corporation, Narf Industries LLC and Celerity Government Solutions LLC.  Two additional grants, for ""blockchain applications for homeland security analytics"", were given to BlockCypher and RAM Laboratories LLC.  The grants come as governments worldwide, including the US government, look at the idea applying blockchain-based solutions to various areas.  Government interest grows  In April  , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced that it was seeking a “secure messaging system” using a “decentralized ledger” for broadcasting encrypted communications.  Military alliance NATO has also indicated interest in this area, announcing a technology innovation contest in May. At the time, the agency said that this system would hypothetically see battlefield applications, as well as broader use for functions within the Department of Defense.  Other governmental organizations globally have pursued similar projects.  Last month, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the executive arm of the 53-member Commonwealth of Nations, unveiled a messaging app designed for law enforcement applications that uses the technology for establishing identity.

42378714,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lfgr,1465586231,One of Japan's Largest Banks is Downplaying its Rumored Digital Currency Plans,"Is a major Japanese financial institution developing its own digital currency?  First asserted in a report by The Asahi Shimbun in February, a number of reports are now speculating that Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), one of Japan’s largest banks by total assets, is working on its own digital currency, named MUFG coin.  As reported by The Asahi Shimbun today, MUFG coin is expected to become available in late 2017, a release that would allow users to withdraw digital currency from its ATM network onto a mobile device.  The news source wrote:  ""Under the planned system, users can withdraw money from their bank accounts into an app on their smartphones. The money will be converted into MUFG coins at a rate of one MUFG coin to 1 yen.""  Yet in statements to CoinDesk, representatives of MUFG have long distanced themselves from the idea that the company is seeking to issue a digital currency.  In February, representatives from MUFG said that the MUFG coin project as described in the original Asahi Shimbun report did not exist.  While not as clear in comments made today, a spokesperson suggested that MUFG is still weighing how it might move its blockchain technology experiments forward.  The spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “What MUFG coin will be, or [whether it] will it be released, has yet to be decided.”  Nonetheless, the digital currency rumors come at a time when MUFG is exploring blockchain technology applications to its business needs. In April, MUFG revealed it was working on a proof-of-concept centered on the delivery of promissory notes.  The partnership with blockchain startup Chain followed MUFG’s decision to join distributed ledger consortium R3 in September 2015.

42378721,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lfoP,1465582001,Why Singularity University’s CEO Believes Blockchain Has Gone 'Exponential',"Based in NASA's Research Park, Singularity University has been preparing its students to challenge traditional concepts of technology growth since it was founded by Google’s director of engineering eight years ago.  A storied Silicon Valley think tank, Singularity University has an established history of tracking growth rates, and its analysis of new technologies carries significant weight with market observers and businesses. The organization also has a record of accuracy in its predictions, even those that may seem outlandish at first.  Based on the organization's methodologies, Google's Ray Kurzweil was able to accurately predict both that a computer would beat a world chess champion by 1998 (it happened in 1997), and that by the 2010s, real-time translation would occur, something both Skype Translate and Google Translate can now do.  Through its work, Singularity University also applies definitions to technologies that help communicate their value and potential to the wider public. Of note, is that Singularity University now considers blockchain an exponential technology, placing it in a category along with artificial intelligence, network sensors and robotics.  Far from a bubble, the CEO of Singularity University, Rob Nail, argues that the technology's current growth rate will only accelerate.  In a conversation with CoinDesk, Nail spoke about what it means that after more than a thousand years of double-entry bookkeeping, this rudimentary concept has now evolved into an entirely new way of tracking value.  Nail said:  ""The reason things go exponential is because you have an increasing number of people participating and playing with that technology and adding to the future breakthroughs.""  In other words, Nail's thesis is that when analog technologies make the jump to digital, they can actually improve their own growth rate.  While traditional growth rates of a technology’s capacity, size or performance are described as increasing at set, linear rates, when this happens, it can trigger an exponential increase.  Working with blockchain  In the case of blockchain, Nail considers it an exponential technology because, since the invention of double-entry bookkeeping in the seventh century, innovation in accounting was limited by the tedious process of reconciling ledgers.  But with the advent of blockchain’s distributed ledger system, the action of reconciling, along with many other processes categorized as ""post-trade"", has been rendered largely redundant, he argued.  According to Nail, the explosion of innovation in the blockchain industry will result in growth from ""hundreds of companies"" today to ""thousands, tens of thousands of applications"" extending to ""every possible different type of transaction"", even those ""we haven’t even thought of yet"".  Nail added:  ""That’s what’s going to propel the exponential curve.""  Predicting the future  Currently, Singularity University counts among its faculty members Ralph Merkle, inventor of the Merkle tree, a basic component of blockchain design that Ethereum inventor Vitalk Buterin described as a ""fundamental part of what makes blockchains tick.""  One project already in the works is Network Society Research, an independent non-profit organization established in 2014 to identify ""bottlenecks"" in exponential technology development and help ensure the transition to an increasingly decentralized society results in positive side-effects.  ""The mathematical invention of the blockchain could have come sooner or later,"" said Network Society founder, David Orban in conversation with CoinDesk. ""But being able to implement bitcoin or Ethereum or other blockcahins can only happen in a special social context which is ours.""  In February of this year Blockchain Capital founder Brock Pierce and Electronic Frontier Foundation board member Brad Templeton spoke about exponential finance at Singularity University's India Summit. Yet the university hasn't delved into the concept of blockchain more formally, at least yet.  Nail concluded:  ""We don’t have a course or anything yet. But there’s been conversations about doing something.""

42426935,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxeth,1465569965,NFL Star Accuses Ex-Manager of Stealing $3 Million for Bitcoin Mine,"A player for a professional American football team has filed a lawsuit against his former business manager, alleging that he squandered money on bad investments including a $3m bitcoin mine.  Court documents filed in an Arkansas federal court and publishedhttp://posting.arktimes.com/media/pdf/mcfadden.pdf by the Arkansas Times allege that Michael Vick spent as much as $15m belonging to Darren McFadden, a running back for the Dallas Cowboys, on a series of fraudulent investments.  McFadden has accused Vick of lying to him about the success of those investments, while at the same time using those funds to pay for a luxurious lifestyle and failed business ventures.  Vick allegedly used $3m to build the operation, which court documents say was aimed at ""creating and manufacturing bitcoins"". McFadden further said that Vick guaranteed a profit on the mine, stating that he would ""not lose any money”.  However, Vick would allegedly go on to keep the profits from the mine for himself, court documents assert.  The complaint states:  ""...Defendant Vick used plaintiffs funds to start this bitcoin 'business', including using all of plaintiffs monies to purchase all the necessary infrastructure and materials, only to retain all the revenues generated or derived from the 'business' along with all the corresponding business assets purchased with plaintiffs money.”  McFadden accused Vick of fabricating financial documents to conceal the health and nature of the investments he was making in the player’s name, and for a time Vick held power of attorney. He further said in court documents that he ended the relationship after Vick tried selling him a property purchased using the player’s own money.  In an interview with The Dallas Morning News, McFadden said that he began working with Vick in 2008, and that the man was “an old family friend” whom he trusted.  ""It's just one of those deals with me as a young guy I wasn't on top of my finances like I should have been and I trusted somebody to take care of everything for me and I don't feel like at the time he had my best interest,” he told the publication.  Vick declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press, earlier this week, saying that he hadn’t yet seen the lawsuit.
