42431698,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5XDh,1586380566,Top Cryptos Edge Up as Derivatives Data Suggests Newfound Risk Aversion Among Traders,"Bitcoin and ether climbed modestly late Wednesday as lighter crypto derivatives volumes signaled uncharacteristic caution among the market’s traders.       Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin (BTC) was up 2.8 percent Wednesday afternoon New York time and ether (ETH) was in the green 4.3 percent.      Bitcoin offshoots were among big winners on CoinDesk’s big board, including bitcoin gold (BTG) up a whopping 18 percent, bitcoin sv (BSV) climbing 16 percent and bitcoin cash (BCH) in the green 6 percent. BCH had its first halving of mining rewards Wednesday and BSV is expected to reach that milestone Friday. All 24-hour price changes are as of 20:50 UTC (4:50 PM EST) Wednesday.      In the traditional markets, Asia’s Nikkei 225 index closed up 2 percent. This continues a week in Japan where unprecedented stimulus amid the declaration of a state of emergency has not stopped markets from going up.      Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day down slightly, at 0.28 percent. This erased two days of gains as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains in intensive care for coronavirus-related health concerns.      Read more: Bitcoin Cash Undergoes ‘Halving’ Event, Casting Shadow on Miner Profitability      In the U.S., the S&P 500 closed New York’s trading day up an ebullient 3.4 percent. The Federal Reserve released minutes of its meeting Wednesday indicating the central bank will keep interest rates near zero in the face of long-term economic uncertainty.      After a drop Tuesday to the $7,000 level right after the U.S. markets closed almost flat, bitcoin jumped to a $7,100 level and is staying steady in a $7,100-$7,400 range.      Gold was down very slightly Wednesday, in the red 0.04 percent - but has been mostly flat the past few days. That sideways performance has traders doubting a breakout will come for gold as they expect for bitcoin.      “Bitcoin in general is much more volatile than gold so if we do get a breakout to the upside, it will outpace gold quickly,” said Siddhartha Jha, a former Wall Street analyst now focused on blockchain at startup Arbol.      Read more: How Imposters Scam Entrepreneurs Out of Their Crypto      As cryptocurrency’s bellwether asset, bitcoin is liable to move out of tight ranges pretty quickly - and a look at the derivatives market shows one intriguing trend.      Bitcoin/USD perpetual swap contract volume on derivatives exchange BitMEX, for example, has been trending lower.      However, bitcoin’s price has continued to rise since taking it on the chin almost a month ago.      “Volume has been in a methodical downtrend,” said Vishal Shah, a crypto options trader now building a derivatives platform called Alpha5. “This is while price has been inching higher. To me that says the market isn't sure what will happen and wants to be covered in either event. This is unusually responsible in this space.”      Of course, this risk-aversion might well have something to do with BitMEX’s March 12 bloodcurdling $700 million liquidation dump, which caused a furious amount of activity to subside.      It’s possible, though, that fewer, less-leveraged bets in derivatives could ease downward pressure on spot prices.      “Such prudential positioning likely favors sideways-to-higher markets, corroborating our view that the lows are in,” Shah added.",NEUTRAL,BCH | BTG,BCH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BTG,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/08/top-cryptos-edge-up-as-derivatives-data-suggests-newfound-risk-aversion-among-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a53301d0bd3cd8cdaccee9d923b269e64a6232d-2163x1276.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431701,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5XHh,1586378700,How Imposters Scam Entrepreneurs Out of Their Crypto,"On Jan. 31, a Telegram user calling himself ""Danny Nelson"" contacted Karla Vilhelem, a public relations professional, with an unseemly proposal.      Pretending to be the CoinDesk reporter of the same name, he said he would publish a post about her client but wanted $600 for his trouble, a small sum for exposure on the crypto site of record.      Vilhelem was wary. After three years in the industry, she was used to scammers impersonating major players in the crypto ecosystem and, more frustratingly, so-called journalists asking for cash. She advised clients never to pay for coverage, and the proposition made her suspicious of this so-called Danny Nelson.      ""I knew CoinDesk doesn't take money,"" she said.      Another tell-tale sign was her interlocutor's atrocious grammar, and mispunctuation of the brand name, which is spelled with a capital D.      “I’ll get the vital informations [sic] needed to write and publish your project article review on your website or whitepaper,” the faux Danny Nelson wrote. “It cost [sic] $600 to write and publish your project article on Coindesk because I’ll have to pay for some logistics.”      Still, Vilhelem was curious. When would she have to pay?      “You have to pay Before [sic] I can proceed with the work because I’ll have to pay for some logistics,” he said.      Whatever the ""logistics"" involved, Vilhelem refused his offer after checking the real Danny Nelson’s Twitter profile and seeing his real Telegram handle. She contacted the CoinDesk team to report the imposter and sent along images of their Telegram exchange. (You can look for real contacts for CoinDesk reporters on our masthead.)      This impersonator never made off with Vilhelem’s money. Others weren’t so lucky.      At least three startup founders have been scammed in similar situations, CoinDesk has found. We explored two of these scams to better understand how they worked.      Working with blockchain investigations company Coinfirm, we wanted to see where the money was going and if we could learn anything about the perpetrators. The ultimate goal: to prevent it from happening to anyone else.    The grift    This scam is as old as journalism. Someone pretending to represent a major media company will approach a small business offering to write about them… for a price.      In the days before the internet, corrupt public relations professionals and fake reporters would offer pay-for-play articles in newspapers. Now, online imposters request products like computers, laptops and cameras from companies, offering to ""review"" them on major news sites. Thanks to anonymous payments, scammers can ask for cash in exchange for ink.      What makes this particular scam unique are the lengths the perpetrators will go to appear legitimate. Many create fake Telegram accounts – the hacker who tried to scam Vilhelem used @danielnelson – and then approach entrepreneurs in chat rooms on the internet. The exchange usually is straightforward unless the victim asks for more proof.      To maintain the facade, the scammers use a few other tricks, including spoofing email addresses. For example, some mail clients let you hide the source of emails, but in many cases, even the email headers are insufficient in identifying real or fake emails.      In Gmail, users can click on ""Show Original"" from the top right:      Yes, the header often can look very confusing to someone who's never seen one. But here's the most important part: The first thing to look for in the header is an email address that is not part of the email conversation. That's clearly a sign of misdirection and something to bring up with a sender.      Here's a rough example (for illustrative purposes only, as headers are subject to change depending on email and anti-spam providers):      Remy Eisenstein, victimized by a fake CoinDesk reporter, was so frustrated by past scams he created a system to prevent email spoofing. Called SafePost, he said it uses a blockchain to confirm emailers are sending from a verified address. So how did he, of all people, get hoodwinked?      Eisenstein noticed his scammer (posing as CoinDesk's Ian Allison) had a strong-looking LinkedIn profile, another tool scammers use to fool victims.      “I told myself, ‘Okay, let's imagine you have just 10 contacts on your Linkedin the page. I can imagine this is a fake’,” he said. “But in this case I saw more than 500.”      In another case we saw, the scammers created a real-looking LinkedIn profile for a CoinDesk writer and then immediately deleted it after the victim checked him out, erasing the evidence.      Almost all the scammers are stuck in the digital realm, although one sent a faked passport for CoinDesk Executive Editor Marc Hochstein, complete with a date of birth that made him seem older than he is. The constant know-your-customer (KYC) information requests of many exchanges seem to have trained scammers to forge official-looking documents.      All these tricks are often enough to fool busy entrepreneurs who will happily send payment in exchange for coverage. Then the whole thing unravels.      Once the scammers receive payment, said Pawel Kuskowski, CEO of Coinfirm, they usually transfer it to an exchange where they could, in theory, be tracked but in reality, rarely are. That’s where the trail ends because they never reply to the victim again.      “Working with CoinDesk to highlight these cases shines a light on how industry players need to further work with security platforms so they don’t facilitate these scams,” said Kuskowski.    The breakdown    To understand more about the scammers and where they were sending their ill-gotten gains, we worked with Coinfirm to trace payments made by two victims who contacted us only after falling for our impersonators.      First, we traced more than $2,000 worth of bitcoin (BTC) that one entrepreneur sent to a scammer in exchange for a post.      The scammer asked the victim to send the 0.23 BTC to an address he controlled, 19BkZZKsQPv14QAP2MJr8fNdwBBTRQxHvT. The victim paid on March 4 and within hours the scammer sent the funds to another address he may also have controlled, 1GJDn7MezDZjvt8ECD6yDYxPdYPjLDNqai.      The chain of transactions suggests the scammer has a verified account on Paxful. For one thing, the second address received a number of deposits from addresses Coinfirm identifies as belonging to Paxful based on regular patterns, or clusters, of transactions.      And if we zoom out the lens, we see that on March 9, five days after ripping off our known victim, the scammer's wallet received 0.37 BTC from another party, and deposited it straight into Paxful:      Coinfirm researched another victim's transaction and was able to track its path through the Ethereum blockchain.      In this case, thescammer, the Hochstein impersonator with the forged passport, received $150 in USDC, a stablecoin that trades 1-for-1 with the U.S. dollar, from the victim. The victim's wallet is in dark blue in this chart.      About $35 went to 0xa356acd1e8cd97a33a65ab7845c7f21b8921b276 (the yellow wallet in the middle in the chart) and then sent to a wallet allegedly connected to lending platform BlockFi. For simplicity's sake, these wallets do not include the standard Ethereum address header ""0x"" in the chart.      The other $115 went to 0x87a1865e3ae422385b7d1beb66ad43b2e847f7f6 (green wallet in the middle of the chart ) and then went to a wallet that appears to be affiliated with crypto exchange NEXO.      ""Although the dollar amount itself isn't substantial in this particular case, these methods are applied on a wide scale and have affected countless people as well as exposed companies to money laundering risks,” said Kuskowski.    The ironic aftermath    CoinDesk is in contact with representatives from Paxful and BlockFi and the companies are investigating the fraud and may be able to recover the funds.      Teodora Atanasova, who does business development at NEXO, said the company is ""extremely diligent in tracking down fake accounts, Telegram groups and all kinds of fraudulent activity and I have personally been dealing with a lot of scammers and impersonators lately as they seem to have gotten even more active in the current situation amid the market turmoil.""      Indeed, a funny thing happened when I approached the company in a public Telegram group. Two users reached out to me, each identifying himself as Beyhan Ahmed, a community manager at NEXO.      One of them was the real Beyhan, whose Telegram handle is @BeyhanNEXO. He put me in touch with Atanasova.      The other one went by @BehanNexo, conspicuously missing the ""y"" in his handle. To hear him tell it, he was very high up in the organization.      ""I am Mr Beyhan, the officiating officer for nexo and head of marketing team,"" he wrote. ""You request for me, that's why I have contacted you.""      This obviously fake Beyhan offered me a ""license"" to write a story about NEXO and the opportunity to post my story on ... the company's website, I guess? The details weren't exactly clear, but I strung him along for kicks, as one might do with a dodgy telemarketer.      The discussion went back and forth for a few minutes and, as expected, my ""officiating officer"" needed a little cash to get the job done.      For the record, I never sent him the money.      Sadly, there is no sure-fire way to prevent these kinds of scams. Double- and triple-checking backgrounds is often insufficient and, given the ease with which scammers more sophisticated than ""Behan"" can recreate identities, due diligence is almost impossible.      That said, respectable news organizations would never ask for cash in exchange for coverage, be it CoinDesk or the New York Times. Scammers are out there preying on the distracted and frustrated. Our hope is you don't become one of their victims.      As for my would-be scammer, he disappeared and deleted our conversation when I sent him a link to my ""transaction"" featuring a lurid picture from Wikipedia. We are currently tracing his bitcoin address, which seems to be empty.      Last week another ""NEXO representative"" approached me on Telegram offering support. I blocked him.",NEGATIVE,BTC | NEXO,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | ZRX | NEXO,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/08/how-imposters-scam-entrepreneurs-out-of-their-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70df64242f23590cc712584ff89aaec5e89720a8-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Assistant U.S. attorneys said in a Wednesday memorandum their prosecutions of Manor and associate Edith Pardo “substantially overlap” with the SEC case. They have asked the judge in the SEC case, Stanley R. Chesler, to issue a stay to “preserve the integrity” of their criminal case. The SEC “does not oppose” the motion, according to the filing.      Both are prosecuting Manor and Pardo’s allegedly fraudulent BCT token offering, said by the SEC to have raised $30 million for the development of digital securities hedge fund technology in 2017 and 2018. The SEC also alleged Manor never disclosed to investors his criminal background, real identity or his ties to a failed Canadian hedge fund.      Manor was convicted of breach of trust in 2011 in connection to the Portus hedge fund, which, before shuttering in 2005, had misappropriated over $100 million in investor funds. Manor served one year of his four-year sentence. He eventually headed to the U.S. for a new venture called Blockchain Terminal.      As documented in a December 2018 investigation by The Block, a “Shaun MacDonald” leading the startup’s race to build a “Bloomberg Terminal’ for the initial coin offering space was actually Manor in disguise. Blockchain Terminal’s employees were unaware of Manor’s backstory, and neither were the 275 U.S. investors in the BCT ICO.      A grand jury indicted Manor and Pardo with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and securities fraud prior to the SEC complaint, according to the memorandum. Civil and criminal charges were unveiled on Jan. 17.      The attorney’s office now wants to temporarily freeze the SEC action. Letting that case move forward would give the defendants room to delay and degrade the criminal procedure, they said.      Pardo pleaded not guilty on Jan. 22, according to the memorandum. Manor remains at large.

42431684,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5Wrh,1586371203,"Huobi Exchange Plots Return to US Crypto Market as Soon as This Month, Exec Says","Global crypto exchange Huobi Group could be back in the U.S. market as early as this month, a group vice president told CoinDesk.      Such a move would come five months after Huobi’s San Francisco-based over-the-counter (OTC) brokerage, Huobi US (HBUS), abruptly halted operations, citing unspecified regulatory roadblocks. At the time, Singapore-based Huobi Group said it would return but did not give a timeframe.      Now, the exchange aims to relaunch this business in partnership with a local licensed trading platform, said Ciara Sun, Huobi Group’s vice president of global business. This would allow it to be compliant with regulations at a lower cost, she said.      “Learning from prior experience, Huobi's strategy for re-entering the U.S. market is to partner with a fully-regulated firm,” Sun said. “We will come back as Huobi Group and there will not be a separate legal entity like Huobi US anymore.”      According to Sun, Huobi has been in talks with a crypto brokerage about a potential strategic partnership that could involve Huobi acquiring a minority stake. She would not identify the brokerage.      Read more: Huobi Adds Crypto ‘Circuit Breaker’ After Last Week’s Mass Liquidations      Through the partnership, the exchange would offer asset management services along with OTC brokerage, both exclusively for institutional investors in the U.S. The exchange will extend its offering to retail investors there eventually, Sun said.    Regulatory hurdles    Huobi is one of a few major global exchanges that originated in China. Data provider Nomics ranks it first by year-to-date volume (with the caveat that it has a “C” rating for transparency).      The exchange’s U.S. affiliate had an auspicious start. Before its official launch in March 2018 HBUS registered as a money services business (MSB) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department.      A year later, the U.S. entity hired Katelyn Mew, a veteran of asset management giant BlackRock, to lead a new institutional sales and service group. The company also expressed interest in seeking a BitLicense from New York state, which in regulatory terms would be like trying out for a Major League Baseball team.      But HBUS, it turned out, couldn’t even hack it in the minor leagues. In addition to registering as an MSB, a crypto exchange must obtain money transmission licenses in the states where it operates. HBUS got licenses in 43 of 50 states, but a number of them allowed the exchange to do only token-to-token trading, not token-to-fiat, according to an old FAQ page on HBUS’ website.      In November, HBUS froze all U.S. accounts and kicked local customers off its platform, framing the move as a step to being more compliant with U.S. law and regulations.      Huobi’s rival, global platform Binance, has similarly had to adjust to the regulatory realities of doing business in the U.S. Binance said in June it was not able to provide services to U.S. citizens until it was sure they were following the exchange's terms of use and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures.      Read more: Binance Crypto Exchange Is Launching Its First Bitcoin Mining Pool      That announcement came less than a day after Binance disclosed its intention to expand its U.S. business with a little-known California-based crypto firm, BAM Trading Services, which was already registered as a MSB.

42431693,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5X9h,1586369358,"Bitcoin Cash 'Halved,' DeFi Gets a Boost and Bisq Halts Trading","Bitcoin cash, the splinter cryptocurrency that forked from the Bitcoin blockchain in 2017, underwent its first programmable halving.      Like other proof-of-work blockchains, bitcoin cash (BCH) manages its monetary supply by slowly printing mining rewards to machines that secure its network by solving complicated mathematical problems. As of Wednesday morning, miners will receive half the amount of BCH for essentially the same amount of work. In the past, these ""halving events"" preceded cryptocurrency price rallies, but industry experts have their doubts a bull run is in store for Bitcoin Cash.      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here. Here's the story:    Top Story    Halving effects    Bitcoin cash – the blockchain that forked off bitcoin (BTC) in 2017 – reduced its block rewards by half, hitting some miners' gross revenues hard. The mining difficulty and hash rate on bitcoin cash – a measure of how much miner power is participating on the network – was already on a downward trend in the run up to the halving, following a drop in the splinter currency’s price.  The bitcoin cash event foreshadows the halving scheduled for the Bitcoin network in about 35 days, which is 26 times larger than BCH in terms of market capitalization, as well as Bitcoin SV’s halving expected this Friday. Halvings have been an important variable in cryptocurrency price increases in the past, though developers on these break-off chains expect some miners to defect for more lucrative opportunities. Roger Ver, BCH’s project steward, said it will be a “non-event.”    DeFiers    TD Ameritrade, Cumberland, CMT Digital, DV Trading and Jump Trading, as well as venture capital firm Volt Capital and the DeFi startup Compound, joined forces in the Chicago DeFi Alliance (CDA). Announced Wednesday, the new group will focus on providing advisory services to select crypto startups working on decentralized finance initiatives.  Tezos is getting a “wrapped” version of bitcoin, bringing BTC’s liquidity and the hopes of a nascent decentralized financial ecosystem to its proof-of-stake blockchain. Bitcoin Association Switzerland, Tezos Foundation and multiple partners will issue the token, called tzBTC. The news comes on the heels of a tBTC “bridge” between Ethereum and Bitcoin announced last week.    Programmable money    The Bank of England (BoE) thinks private cryptocurrencies may have a role in the future of money. Although the BoE has already said bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies don't meet the necessary criteria to be considered money, CBDC analyst Ben Dyson said, ""that doesn't mean that it's impossible for somebody to improve upon that technology and create something that much better fulfills the qualities of money.”  Banking services provider Sila has raised $7.7 million to build out a platform that allows entrepreneurs to easily launch programmable, USD-pegged stablecoins.    Exchanges    Account holders at the now-defunct Cryptopia exchange are entitled to their balances still held in trust, a judge has ruled. This decision places the interests of exchange users over the 37 creditors and 90 shareholders also vying for their portion of the remaining assets.  Decentralized or non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange Bisq has halted trading due to a “critical security vulnerability.” While users can override the block, the exchange “highly discourages” traders from doing so. (The Block)    Cash deals    SoFi will acquire payment processor Galileo in a $1.2 billion deal. (The Block)  HDR Global Trading, the operator of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, has granted $400,000 over four years to nonprofit security organization Shadowserver Foundation, to bolster internet security. (The Block)    Coronavirus challengers    Jack Dorsey will place $1 billion, what he says is roughly 28 percent of his wealth, into a limited liability company he started called Start Small to fight the coronavirus. (TechCrunch)  Bay Area researchers are turning to waste water to track COVID-19 outbreaks in cities. (Wired)  Market Intel    Liquidity Bid-ask spreads on major exchanges widened dramatically in March, following coronavirus-led market turmoil. The bid-ask spread is an indicator of market liquidity, measuring the gap between the highest price a buyer would pay and the lowest price a seller would accept.      Halving hope Halvings are not always bullish, and many experts think bitcoin cash has a rough road ahead to retain price and mining capacity. “The conventional crypto wisdom that halvings magically induce a bull run such that the real USD value of miner revenue does not cut in half is naive wishful thinking, encouraging investors to be fooled by correlation/causation,” said Zach Resnick, managing partner at Unbound Capital.        Halving report In May of 2020, bitcoin is expected to undergo its third “halving,” a programmed supply reduction that has in the past coincided with a strong run-up in the bitcoin price.

The state securities regulators filed an emergency action against Ultra BTC Mining and Laura Branch on Wednesday, alleging the firm promised to double investors' funds, touted a massive bitcoin price rise, offered affiliate and partner programs and claimed to donate to COVID-19 charity efforts without proof.      Ultra Mining allegedly raised $18 million.      According to the order, the investments in hash power appear to be securities. The TSSB is alleging that the respondents failed to register before selling these securities, and ""are engaging in fraud"" by making misleading statements about the returns.

42431686,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5Wth,1586361600,Wuhan Days: What I Learned About Blockchain From Two Months Under Lockdown,"Wei Liu is Head of Business Development for DeFiner.org, a peer-to-peer network for digital savings, loans and payments. He is based in Wuhan, China.      For my family and me, the Chinese Lunar New Year in January 2020 marked the beginning of a new way of life. I live in Huanggang, a city of seven million in the Wuhan region of China, where the COVID-19 pandemic began. After two months, my lockdown experience is finally ending, and I’d like to share what I’ve learned in quarantine, particularly about how I’ve seen blockchain applications provide solutions to the health and economic challenges that face the world.      The unity of the blockchain community was evident from the outbreak of the virus. Blockchain startups, together with local authorities, worked tirelessly to collect and secure medical data, track medical supply chains and provide critical information to medical staff. In the first two weeks of February, companies including Vestchain Technology and Alipay released at least 20 blockchain-based applications to tackle the mounting challenges facing communities and front-line health workers. Since then, one of China’s largest couriers, SF Express, has started using blockchain technology to deliver supplies to COVID-19 pandemic victims.      To understand how blockchain played a role in tackling the challenges posed by the virus, let me take you through my journey in the Wuhan region during the period.      See also: Noelle Acheson - How I’m Coping With Spain’s Coronavirus Lockdown      Huanggang is close to the epicenter of the original COVID-19 outbreak. The authorities put strict rules in place and they have been strongly enforced. Only one person in a household could ever exit the house or apartment, and only for absolutely essential needs. Roads into and out of the city were shut down and heavily policed. The government even created an app for people wishing to venture outside. Users who certify they have no symptoms and they have isolated for an appropriate period will receive a custom QR code the authorities may scan. If your app throws up a green border to the QR code, you may go outside. If it’s red, you must remain indoors.      I wasn’t the household’s designated essential shopper, so I spent seven full weeks indoors to prevent infection. As I write, many restrictions are loosening but others remain in force, and it’s clear that it will be many days before things fully return to normal. I’ve been relatively fortunate in my isolation. I live in a house, not an apartment, and I live with family, so I’ve had the company of loved ones during this trying time. My mother keeps active by dancing, while my little cousin runs and jumps. Even at the height of the pandemic, my family has been healthy and active. While we’re all looking forward to the eventual lifting of restrictions, I believe this experience has brought an already tight-knit family even closer together.    Within a few weeks, I was receiving thousands of emails a day in my volunteer role.    Though I couldn’t leave the house, I was fortunate enough to be able to continue my day job, which remained unaffected given that my business has always operated on a decentralized model. What I’ve experienced in the last few months is what my colleagues in the U.S. now face and are coming to terms with. Within a few days of the lockdown beginning, I realized that just doing my regular work wasn’t enough. Blockchain workers like me believe in dreaming big; I began searching online with other members of the DeFi community for ways to help.      This crisis instilled a strong collaborative culture in the blockchain and startup world. Providing effective solutions to economic and human problems has always motivated our industry. I quickly learned this when I began helping the Binance Charity Foundation to help facilitate, track and record the movement of vital medical supplies to the hospitals that needed them. Blockchain has a culture of innovation and disruption, so we were able to establish lines of communication and payment very quickly.      Within a few weeks, I was receiving thousands of emails a day in my volunteer role. People I’ve not yet met in person are now trusted friends, fellow philanthropic relief workers. Most of our correspondence was through WeChat and social media; we didn’t directly use blockchain technology because there were some problems with speed and scale that made WeChat more efficient for our purposes. While the development wasn’t yet ready for our mission, blockchain is improving every day, and I’m sure the ongoing global crisis has inspired many developers to build (some of whom now have unprecedented amounts of time to create solutions to blockchain’s obstacles).    Blockchain for supply chain, payments    If a situation like this ever recurs, I’m sure the blockchain infrastructure will be ready. Much of my work during this pandemic has been arranging payments across time zones and between previously unacquainted parties. I can’t help but think a more robust decentralized financial infrastructure could have made the work easier. For example, countries around the world are distributing one-time or recurring payments to affected citizens, but payment may depend on outdated systems like the American Automated Clearing House (AACH). Some funds will even be disbursed by paper checks. I hear stories of citizens in a number of countries waiting weeks for economic subsidies, and I hope this encourages governments to join the DeFi revolution.      See also: Leah Callon-Butler - Letter from the Philippines: Life During Coronavirus      Similarly, DeFi can assist the unbanked in times of crisis like these, if properly adopted. China has the world’s largest population, as well as the world’s highest number of unbanked people, but most countries face similar obstacles. In the U.S., which looks to be the new epicenter of the pandemic, roughly 25 percent of the population is unbanked or underbanked. My career is building tomorrow’s DeFi platforms. I hope that no society ever faces an ordeal like COVID-19 again, but I want to build systems that will enable quick response to any disasters that do occur. Once DeFi is ready – a reality that is fast approaching – will officials adopt the technology and improve economic crisis preparedness?      As the crisis in the Hubei province recedes, I’m still doing volunteer work. The tools my colleagues and I developed could help hospitals in other outbreak centers across the world. What we worked to ship in, we’re now beginning to ship out. If my expertise can make someone else’s life safer or easier, I feel obligated to help. The people of Huanggang know just how serious this virus is. The blockchain community saw this and coordinated an overwhelming response.      Like millions of others around the world, I will feel relief when I can once again engage face to face with my neighbors, colleagues and others. At the same time, I know I will feel a measure of satisfaction for working in an industry that has helped slow the spread of the coronavirus.      A global crisis of this magnitude requires a collaborative, innovative approach on a large scale. Blockchain technology has the capability to drive forward innovations in helping businesses, hospitals and communities to overcome disruptions. Everyone has a part to play. If you can sew masks, sew masks. If you have spare protective equipment, donate it. If your neighbors are elderly or immunocompromised, volunteer to pick up their groceries. And if there’s no reason to go out, stay inside. You’ll be doing the world a favor.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Wei Liu,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/08/wuhan-days-what-i-learned-about-blockchain-from-two-months-under-lockdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38170b6e8fb358b33a0e3b44676840206de66fbc-1380x1035.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bisq, which allows users to exchange crypto anonymously, abruptly disabled trading late Tuesday night after it uncovered ""a critical security vulnerability.""      At the time, the exchange did not release any information regarding the nature of the flaw or whether user funds were safe. But 18 hours after it halted trading, Bisq said it took the ""unprecedented"" step after finding an attacker was exploiting a flaw in the software to steal cryptocurrency from other users.      ""About 24 hours ago, we discovered that an attacker was able to exploit a flaw in the Bisq trade protocol, targeting individual trades in order to steal trading capital. We are aware of approximately 3 BTC and 4,000 XMR stolen from 7 different victims. This is the situation as we know it so far,"" Bisq said in a statement to CoinDesk.      The value of the crypto stolen was roughly $22,000 worth of bitcoin (BTC) and $230,000 worth of monero (XMR), according to CoinDesk data at press time. In total, that comes to more than $250,000.      To carry out the thefts, the attacker was able to set other users' default fallback address – the destination to which crypto is sent to if a trade fails – to their own. Posing as a seller, they would start a trade with a buyer and simply wait for the time limit to run out. Rather than going to the legitimate owner, the digital assets arrived with the attacker, along with the buyer's payment and security deposit too.      See also: Binance’s DEX Now Supports AML Compliance Via CipherTrace      The flaw in question came as part of a recent update to the trading protocol, which was designed to improve decentralization and remove trusted third parties from the platform.      Bisq managed to fix the flaw by 12:00 UTC Wednesday and told CoinDesk just before publication that trading had just resumed again.      Bisq released onto testnet back in late 2018 as an exchange structured as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It works in much the same way as other DEXs, but users can trade anonymously as there are no registration or identity verification requirements.      With the platform based on a distributed network, each user effectively acts as a node. Although Bisq's developers had suspended trading, the exchange's decentralized nature means users could override the suspension should they wish.      See also:New Crypto Exchange Altsbit Says It Will Close Following Hack      In most cases of an exchange hack, the attacker can be booted off the trading platform for good. Not so with Bisq. One of the DEX's associated developers told CoinDesk that although the flaw was fixed, there was nothing to prevent the attacker – whose identity cannot be known – from accessing and trading on the platform again.

42404416,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi502,1586348506,"Bitcoin Cash Undergoes 'Halving' Event, Casting Shadow on Miner Profitability","Bitcoin Cash – the blockchain that forked off Bitcoin in 2017 – has just reduced its block rewards by half, causing many miners to see gross margins drop to near zero.      The world's fifth-largest cryptocurrency network by market capitalization reached block height 630,000 at roughly 12:20 UTC on Wednesday – by design triggering the so-called ""halving"" event that reduced the network's mining reward from 12.5 bitcoin cash (BCH) per block to 6.25.      That means miners competing for block rewards on the network will see their immediate mining revenue reduced by half, resulting in no or slight returns despite investments in costly mining equipment.      The mining difficulty and hash rate on bitcoin cash – a measure of how much miner power is participating on the network – has recently been on a downward trend in the run up to the halving, dropping from around five exahashes per second (EH/s) in mid-February to 3.3 EH/s currently.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      The trend is in line with the price decline of BCH, which dropped from $492 around mid-February to as low as $165 in mid-March – though it's since bounced back over $250. At press time, BCH is changing hands at $268, according to CoinDesk's price index, a 2.7 percent jump over the last 24 hours.      Based on data from F2Pool, at BCH's current price and the network's latest hash rate, a wide range of the mining equipment that was launched in 2018 and early 2019 are now generating negative daily profits, if assuming an average electricity cost of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).      Even some of the most recent models that hit the market late last year and in early 2020 are seeing gross margin drop to around 10 percent. Only those most powerful models like MicroBT's WhatsMiner M30S or Bitmain's AntMiner S19 or S17 Pro would be able generate a margin above 30 percent, but the manufacturers have not yet been able to deliver these models to the market in large numbers.      See also: Manufacturers Mark Down Bitcoin Miners as Price Drop, Halving Change Calculus      That said, as more unprofitable miners unplug from the Bitcoin Cash network as is expected, mining difficulty will further decrease, dynamically increasing the mining revenue for those who can afford to stick to the game.      Furthermore, specialized mining devices (commonly known as ASIC miners) based on the SHA-256 algorithm – which is adopted by Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV – are able to switch between different networks that use the same algorithm.      The Bitcoin Cash event foreshadows the halving scheduled for the Bitcoin network in about 35 days. Bitcoin is 26 times larger than BCH in terms of market capitalization.      The 14-day rolling computing power connected to the Bitcoin network is currently at 105 EH/s, which has seen a 5 percent uptick after having decreased by nearly 16 percent late last month.      Meanwhile, Bitcoin SV, the network that forked off the Bitcoin Cash blockchain in late 2018, is also scheduled to go through a block reward reduction in about a day.

42404433,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi5Do,1586348284,First Mover: A Sneak Preview of Bitcoin's Halving – in Real Time,"As central banks and governments around the world inject trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related aid and stimulus into the financial system, big investors are becoming increasingly curious about bitcoin's (BTC) potential as a hedge against inflation.      And nowhere is that inflation resistance more evident than in bitcoin's once-every-four-years ""halving."" That's when issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency automatically gets cut in half. The plan, expected to continue for at least another century, was coded into the underlying blockchain network's programming when it was launched 11 years ago. The mechanism's very purpose was to prevent a rapid debasement of bitcoin's purchasing power.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Bitcoin's next halving isn't expected until May. But two lesser cryptocurrencies, bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV, are due for their halvings this week, offering an advance glimpse of the quadrennial phenomenon.    ""You're going to get a sneak preview of what happens with bitcoin in a month,"" said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of Digital Asset Research, a New York-based analysis firm.    Bitcoin cash (BCH), a cryptocurrency that split off or ""forked"" from bitcoin in 2017, is expected to undergo its halving on Wednesday. Bitcoin SV (BSV), which forked from Bitcoin cash the following year, is due for a halving on Friday.      In the realm of cryptocurrencies, the two forked cryptocurrencies are considered also-rans, with a combined total market value of roughly $8 billion, versus $131 billion for bitcoin.    But since halvings constitute a crucial chapter of any crash course in cryptoeconomics, the episodes bear watching. Many crypto traders say big price swings often coincide with halvings, providing ample opportunities for speculation. The German bank BayernLB predicted last year that bitcoin's halving could drive its price to $90,000https://www.bayernlb.com/internet/media/ir/downloads_1/bayernlb_research/megatrend_publikationen/megatrend_bitcoins2f_20190930_EN.pdf, roughly 12 times the current level.    The most likely outcome of this week's halvings, according to the analysis firm Arcane Research, is an immediate drop in profits for computer operators supporting the two lesser blockchains. These ""miners"" will then probably just shift their computing power to the bigger bitcoin network, where the halving is still a month away. Such computing resources, known as hashpower in the industry jargon, are crucial for keeping these blockchain networks secure – preventing theft or other abuses.      ""It's going to push more hash toward the bitcoin network,"" says Matt D'Souza, co-founder and CEO of Blockware Solutions, which brokers high-speed computers used for cryptocurrency mining.      The loss of hashpower on the smaller blockchains might make them more vulnerable to a takeover by a malicious actor in what's known as a 51 percent attack. That's when an individual or cabal amasses sufficient computing resources to co-opt the network – similar to the way a corporate raider might try to buy enough equity in a company to force a takeover.      Mike Maloney, chief financial officer of Coinmint, a cryptocurrency-mining company, estimates that if the security of the Bitcoin Cash network fell by half, an attack would require the computing equivalent of about 400 megawatts of electricity – roughly the output of a medium-size power plant. By contrast, it would take 6,000 to 10,000 megawatts to attack the Bitcoin blockchain, he says.      Bitcoin cash's halving ""will hurt the overall hashrate/security of an already vulnerable blockchain,"" says Michael Thoma, co-founder and lead analyst at cryptocurrency-rating firm CryptoEQ.      What happens in cryptocurrency markets, as a result of this week's halvings, is a bit more speculative. Prices for bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV might fall because holders of those digital tokens might suddenly start worrying about the vulnerability, says Dave Perrill, CEO of Compute North, which provides hosting facilities and services for cryptocurrency miners.      While the hashpower shift would bolster security on the bitcoin blockchain, miners there would suddenly face more competition – resulting in a dilution of profits.      ""We see mining as largely as an experience like evolution, Darwinism,"" Perrill says.      He notes that it will be difficult to draw too many parallels between this week's episodes and bitcoin's halving in May. That's partly because so much of the crypto industry has evolved around bitcoin, and there's such a huge community of traders, developers and marketers who are focused on making it successful, Perrill says. In digital-asset markets, bitcoin is the bellwether, and lesser coins like bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV are often merely trading in sync.      Litecoin (LTC), yet another spinoff from bitcoin, provided a cautionary tale when it underwent a halving in August of last year. While the price quadrupled in the first half of 2019, it peaked a couple months before the halving and tumbled over the rest of the year.      Suffice to say the digital-asset industry is still so new compared with traditional finance that nobody's really certain how the various halvings will play out. Many bitcoiners have a remarkably sophisticated grasp on old-finance concepts like the theory of efficient markets, and even within the cryptocurrency industry there are wide-ranging opinions on whether the halving – an event that's known years in advance – is already baked into the price.      ""Halvings are not unilaterally positive events for cryptocurrencies,"" the analysis firm Messari wrote in a December report. ""Maybe Bitcoin is different, but maybe it’s not.""      This week's halvings on the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV blockchains will provide additional data points – ahead of next month's featured event.    Tweet of the Day  Bitcoin Watch        BTC: Price: $7,334 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $7,464 | 24-Hr Low: $7,081      Trend: Bitcoin is holding ground at press time, but struggling to take out the 50-day average for the second day running. The cryptocurrency is trading near $7,334, representing a 1.6 percent gain on the day, having tested the 50-day MA at $7,422 during the early European trading hours.      A look at the four-hour chart shows the cryptocurrency has failed three times in the last 24 hours or so to keep gains above the psychological resistance of $7,400.      The repeated bull failure, coupled with the four-hour chart MACD's bearish cross below zero indicates scope for a drop to ascending trendline support near $7,000. The risk-off tone in the global equity markets also favors a pullback in bitcoin.      At press time, major European indices like Germany's DAX and U.K.'s FTSE are reporting around 1 percent drops. The cryptocurrency has closely tracked action in the equity markets over the past few weeks.      On the higher side, a sustained move above $7,400 would open the doors to $8,000.

42404424,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi58t,1586347554,Today's 'Halving' May Be Non-Event for Bitcoin Cash Prices,"Bitcoin (BTC) offshoot bitcoin cash (BCH), the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market value, underwent its first ""halving"" Wednesday, but the process is unlikely to have a bullish impact on the cryptocurrency’s price, say analysts.      The event – programmed to occur every four years – took effect around 12:20 UTC, reducing the rewards per block mined on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain to 6.25 BCH from the current 12.5 BCH.      The cryptocurrency rose to a four-week high of $265 early Tuesday and was last seen trading near $276 – up 2 percent on a 24-hour basis – according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Cash Price Index.      See also: Bitcoin Cash Approaches Milestone With First Halving Expected Wednesday      Meanwhile, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency, is trading in the red near $7,260, while bitcoin SV (BSV), a cryptocurrency that forked off BCH, is still up over 6 percent. BSV, too, will undergo a reward halving on Friday, while bitcoin's next halving is due in May.      Some observers believe the halving, which creates a supply deficit, could result in a big rally for BCH.      The above argument, however, does not take into account two important factors: the per-block revenue will drop by 50 percent following the reward halving, and miners operate on cash or fund mining costs by liquidating their holdings.      Essentially, halving leads to a drop in mining profitability and may force small or inefficient miners to shut operations. These players usually offload their holdings while exiting the market, leading to a slide in price.      Put simply, halvings are not always bullish. As an example, litecoin (LTC) underwent a halving on Aug. 5, 2019, following which the price fell from $100 to $50 in the four months to December. It's hash rate, or computing power on the network, also tanked over the same time period.      “The conventional crypto wisdom that halvings magically induce a bull run such that the real USD value of miner revenue does not cut in half is naive wishful thinking, encouraging investors to be fooled by correlation/causation,” said Zach Resnick, managing partner at Unbounded Capital.      See also: Looking for a Halving Payday? Quick Wins in Investing Are Rare      Indeed, if the post-halving price rise is strong enough to compensate for the drop in the revenue, the small and inefficient miners will likely remain active and there would be less incentive to shift base to other blockchains or exit the industry completely.      That, however, looks unlikely, as the traditional markets are not out of the woods yet and the coronavirus outbreak is expected to have a prolonged negative impact on the global economy, as noted by Goldman Sachs.      As a result, investors in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets are likely to stay cautious. Note that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, have more or less moved in tandem with equities over the last six weeks or so.      “Given the current market conditions, this bullish speculative frenzy coming to counteract the halving doesn’t seem likely this time around. Thus, miner revenue will truly halve, leading to many miners becoming unprofitable and shutting down,” said Resnick.      Richard Rosenblum, co-founder at GSR, believes the impending halving could lift prices, but not enough to not outweigh the bigger rewards and higher upside that bitcoin will offer many miners for the next month until it, too, halves its rewards.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      If bitcoin cash miners do make a move to Bitcoin’s blockchain, that will lead to a rise in its hash rate and a respective drop in Bitcoin Cash’s mining power. Both blockchains use the SHA236 hashing algorithm.      “The 'nomadic hash' is incentivized to flee already halved chains for chains that continue to retain their 12.5 coins/block subsidy. Because of this incentive to arbitrage across chains, we expect the hash rate to be volatile, but we don’t expect this to have a significant impact on the coin value,” said Resnick.      At press time, bitcoin’s hash rate is at 3.45 exahashes per second (EH/s), having topped out at 5.00 EH/s on Feb. 14, according to data source BitInfoCharts. The numbers suggest miners are already fleeing in anticipation of the effects of the halving.      Meanwhile, bitcoin’s hash rate also dropped from 133.29 EH/s to 85 EH/S in the three weeks to March 20, and was last seen at 104.98 EH/s.    Focus on transaction fees    As block rewards diminish due to the halving, both bitcoin cash and bitcoin miners would need to replace lost income with higher transaction fees over the long run.      Resnick said bitcoin, with its 1 MB block size, may have to do away with its 21 million supply cap or somehow convince users to accept paying ever-growing transaction fees to use the network.      Bitcoin cash looks better off with a comparatively bigger block size of 8 MB. Even so, Resnick said the networks will struggle due to developers' unwillingness to acknowledge the fact that block subsidies are dropping and merchant adoption is not growing quickly enough to replace it.      ""BCH and BTC miners and investors may be able to continue ignoring this inevitable threat this month, but they won’t be able to forever,"" Resnick told CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,BCH,BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/08/todays-halving-may-be-non-event-for-bitcoin-cash-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1e96d6cbb70ebc593105b783cc36c7ca2a82b7c-1500x874.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404426,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi56v,1586347200,Chicago's Trading Firms Look to DeFi With New 'Alliance',"Some of the most experienced trading firms in Chicago are joining forces to promote decentralized finance (DeFi) during the coronavirus recession.      TD Ameritrade, Cumberland, CMT Digital, DV Trading and Jump Capital, plus venture capital firm Volt Capital and the DeFi startup Compound, all joined forces in the Chicago DeFi Alliance (CDA). Announced Wednesday, the new group will focus on providing advisory services to select crypto startups.      CMT Digital Holdings CEO Colleen Sullivan said she sees a significant benefit in “bringing together the Chicago trading community that’s been active in the digital asset space for some time.”      Plus, mentors stand to benefit, too, by identifying talent. For example, CMT Digital runs both a legacy trading desk and an investment arm interested in equity opportunities.      Funds that invest in early-stage startups may have more responsibility in the DeFi consortium. For example, Volt Capital co-founder Soona Amhaz said the CDA will help entrepreneurs get their startups “up and running during the crisis,” then stay “as insulated from macro conditions” as possible. She said she hopes the CDA will offer a pool of talent that crypto startups like dYdX and Yield can draw from so they can focus on their long-term visions.      “There’s a real opportunity here to leverage financial and trading expertise from Chicago to support DeFi products around the world,” Amhaz said.      Especially during a broader economic crisis, there are ample arbitrage opportunities for companies looking to ensure liquidity for products or services that need Ethereum-based stablecoins. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams said March 2020 was actually his decentralized exchange’s peak month, seeing $220 million worth of activity. That’s $70 million more than February, or nearly a 47 percent increase.      “Stablecoins were the most traded,” Adams said. “There were some active arbitrageurs that were able to keep the prices in the right place and make sure there was always crypto available for purchase.”      Volt Capital co-founder Imran Khan said the CDA will “provide startups with real-world trading feedback.” Volt Capital already invested in one such DeFi startup, Dharma, and Khan said his firm is eager to find the next early stage investment opportunity in the DeFi space.      “We’re very early in DeFi. I think there’s going to be a lot of hand holding with some of these companies before they [DeFi contracts] become decentralized,” Khan said. “Right now everyone is just dogfooding their own products. The goal for us, as the CDA, is to help us get out of that cycle.”      With the help of experienced traders, Khan said the DeFi ecosystem can become more robust.      “All of the DeFi products being built are going to be catering to these large trading firms,” Khan said. “Obviously, we want users. But these products are so complex [today], it only fits well for professional traders.”      That’s why some of the most experienced trading firms in the industry joined forces through the CDA, to help entrepreneurs understand and access liquidity. According to DeFi Pulse, there’s still roughly $744 million worth of crypto locked in DeFi contracts, usually as loan collateral or smart-contract deposits earning interest. The current economic crisis may stimulate even more activity among stablecoin users.      Ledn co-founder Mauricio Di Bartolomeo said demand for his company’s bitcoin-collateralized dai loans doubled between December 2019 and March 2020. These are often average bitcoiners seeking stablecoins so they can use DeFi platforms.      “As market volatility increases, we are seeing the need for more tools that allow our clients to switch between the amount of dollar loans versus bitcoin (BTC) they are holding,” he said of stablecoins.    Crisis management    So far the DeFi ecosystem appears to be maturing in times of hardship.      When the coronavirus crisis hit exchanges in March and crypto prices plummeted, people using the leading DeFi protocol, MakerDAO, had to act fast to fend off widespread liquidation of the system’s collateralized debt positions (CDPs). New dai stablecoins are issued when someone creates a loan backed by ETH collateral. So, although many exchanges offer dai trading regardless of MakerDAO, no one knows how supply and demand for dai might be impacted if the underlying CDP system faltered.    Holders of the system’s MKR voting tokens promptly added a new collateral type for dai, the Coinbase-affiliated stablecoin USDC, which the exchange also distributed to DeFi platforms like Uniswap and PoolTogether. In the most recent community votehttps://vote.makerdao.com/executive-proposal/adjust-multiple-risk-parameters- on emergency measures, which ended on March 30, MakerDAO Foundation head of communications Mike Porcaro said more than 55 percent of the governance tokens came from a single account and just four voters made up more than 94 percent of the votes.    According to Anchorage co-founder Diogo Monica, a custody startup that works with prominent MKR holders like Polychain Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, investors were actively moving MKR tokens out of storage to participate in those urgent votes.      “There was a very significant increase in interest from people using Anchorage for voting and governance decisions for Maker because they had to make some pretty hard decisions to maintain dai, keep it healthy,” Monica said. “Almost all of the clients that had MKR positions wanted to actively participate in this.”    Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma, spearheading a startup that audits smart contracts, said he was impressed with how quickly the Maker Foundation rallied to resolve issues by using public polls for broader feedback. Plus, MKR holders are now votinghttps://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwfvvguaf8rz8xwgv2cqnzzt9t5h6epzh17qmk2ue99y4 on whether to compensate accounts that had liquidated loans.    “They had proactive communication,” Ma said. “We’ve had a lot of requests from companies wanting us to review their systems to prepare for these volatile situations.”    Diversification    Volt Capital’s Khan acknowledged the community still has a long way to go before the DeFi system can work without its creators keeping a proverbial hand on the wheel.      Ma added he’s concerned the DeFi aspect of these systems might not inspire enough accountability for people to continue auditing public contracts. This can lead to hackable vulnerabilities. Startups like those involved with CDA are more likely to audit, Ma said, because they are responsible for a product or service and profit from it. He said he expects startups that work with bitcoin as well, like Ledn and Thesis, will see an uptick in demand.      The latter, which is scheduled to debut tBTC in April, will allow tech-savvy bitcoiners to wrap the godfather cryptocurrency in an Ethereum-friendly shell and use it in DeFi loans or interest-bearing positions. Consumers have a variety of choices at every income level.      “One area I think is going to take off is using bitcoin as collateral for DeFi,” Ma said. “Generally speaking, lending and borrowing are here to stay.”      These DeFi startups already serve some retail users, beyond professional traders and investors, like Argentinian ex-pat María Paula Fernandez in Germany. She had cross-border accounting issues in 2019 and now uses Compound to manage a significant chunk of her income.      “I trust dai more than banks. If I take small [freelancing] contracts, I’ll take dai and save it,” Fernandez said.      But her trust in products that rely on smart contracts has changed since March’s drastic market fluctuations.      “After Black Thursday,” Fernandez added, “I’m no longer using DeFi [products] for a while.”      She’ll continue using stablecoins and wait for a less volatile time to use interest-bearing products or loans.      According to Sebastian Serrano, CEO of Latin American crypto exchange Ripio, dai is the most popular stablecoin among Argentinians and demand for it among his clientele increased six-fold in March compared to January.      Khan said he expects the economic crisis will bring in more users by winter, especially if local fiat currencies suffer. That makes this spring the perfect time for professional traders and technologists to iron out the kinks in ecosystem liquidity.      “People are scared and they need something that will get them through this phase of life,” Khan said in reference to crypto newcomers. “It’s not going to be bitcoin, it’s going to be stablecoins.”",POSITIVE,BTC | MKR,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/08/chicagos-trading-firms-look-to-defi-with-new-alliance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4151690ac23730891171647842901662731b342-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, the Bitcoin Association Switzerland, Tezos Foundation and multiple partners will issue the first tokenized version of bitcoin on the Tezos blockchain, tzBTC. The asset will also be the first vehicle for Tezos-based decentralized finance (DeFi), according to a press release from the association.      Each tzBTC represents one bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain and is minted under the new FA1.2 Tezos token standard.      “The tzBTC brings the brand and liquidity of Bitcoin to the Tezos blockchain and gains the potential for rich functionality made possible by Tezos smart contracts,” Bitcoin Association Switzerland President Lucas Betschart said in a statement.      Read more: What Tezos and Bitcoin Have in Common      Another wrapped bitcoin project was announced for Ethereum last week, tBTC. “Building a bridge that allows Bitcoin to interact with DeFi makes a lot of sense,” investor Fred Ehrsam said of that project. Adding a bridge for Tezos to the most liquid cryptocurrency follows a similar logic.      Roman Schnider, CFO and head of operations at the Tezos Foundation, said the addition of bitcoin is just the tip of the spear as the community builds out DeFi products on Tezos.      “This is kind of the first [wrapped] product that we see and there's not much you can trade against at the moment, but there is a roadmap,” Schnider said in a phone interview.      Next up, Schnider said, are atomic swaps for building out DeFi exchanges and perhaps a wrapped ether (ETH) token.

A little over a year later, and WBTC makes up a small percentage of Ethereum-based DeFi’s $700 million market cap, according to DeFi Pulse.      tzBTC won’t be alone on Tezos, however. The token could soon be joined by Tezos-based DeFi protocol StakerDAO, which is planning to launch this quarter, according to its website. StakerDAO automates capital allocation for staking on various protocols to earn yield for investors.      tzBTC will be overseen by numerous organizations, according to the token’s website.

Sila is an application programming interface (API) platform for entrepreneurs to quickly tap banking tools. The platform has a developer suite that issues an ERC-20 stablecoin called SilaToken (SILA). Every transaction on the platform is done using the token, which is pegged 100:1 to the U.S. dollar (i.e., if a customer deposits $100, they receive 10,000 SILA).      The expansion of Sila’s platform could one day make bespoke stablecoins a common feature of traditional fintechs.      After several months of testing, Sila went into full production in October 2019 with four clients. The company expects to have 20 clients by the end of this quarter and 40 clients by the end of the year, according to Sila CEO Shamir Karkal.

Sila’s growth plans    Currently, it takes around two business days for customers to purchase tokens after they have connected their bank account to Sila’s platform. With the new funding, Sila plans to install card payments, international payments, business ID verification and begin issuing tokens within one business day. Its partner bank, Memphis-based Evolve Bank & Trust, also plans to connect to the Clearing House system, a network started by big banks that provides access to instant payments.      Evolve provides insurance from the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for the funds that tokens are pegged to. (FDIC insurance only protects a user’s funds in the case that Evolve has a bank failure.)

As part of the deal, Hope Cochran, managing director at Madrona, and Rick Holt, lead investor at Oregon Venture, are joining Sila’s board. Matt Compton, general partner at Oregon Venture, will join Sila as a board observer.      The round was raised in four stages, starting with $770,000 that was raised in the spring of 2018, while the bulk of funds came in two weeks ago, Karkal said.    Crypto use case    Crypto exchange Vertbase plans to eventually allow users to hold SILA themselves, said Vertbase CEO Justin Seidl. Once USD is converted to SILA, transfer times between SILA and other tokens can happen in minutes. Currently, the exchange just uses Sila as a payments processor, seeing USD transfer to crypto in as little as two days.      Before using Sila, Vertbase users wouldn’t see their funds be transferred for five to seven business days. Customers regularly filled out support tickets when they saw money leave their bank account for a week without getting any bitcoin, Seidl said.      “There are lots of opportunities to build out what has been laid as a foundation, and we’re very excited that we’re not relying on ancient technology,” he said.

42404419,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi511,1586340000,Overstock Is Set to Finally Pay Out Its Digital Security Shareholder Dividend,"Overstock.com plans to distribute its long-delayed ""digital security"" shareholder dividend on May 19.      Shareholders will receive one Digital Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock (OSTKO) for every 10 of the online retailer’s shares they hold on April 27, the record date, according to Overstock’s Tuesday press release. OSKTO is a “digitally enhanced security” that trades on affiliate tZERO’s blockchain-backed platform – the only trading system that can support it.      If the distribution goes without a hitch, it may validate a corporate gambit whose creator, former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, considered revolutionary. Byrne thought the blockchain dividend could drive growth for tZERO’s blockchain trading system and simultaneously “expose the slop” he said was inherent to Wall Street’s capital markets.      Byrne resigned less than a month after his proposal’s July 2019 reveal. Overstock’s new leadership continued to push for blockchain dividends, calling it “of great importance to the Company’s blockchain strategy,” in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory filings.      “In particular, we believe the successful issuance of the Dividend will demonstrate to other issuers and market participants that this technology is scalable and has significant benefits to all market participants,” CEO Jonathan Johnson and chairwoman of the board Allison H. Abraham wrote in the undated filing from Overstock’s investor site.      Overstock’s May 19 dividend issuance will be more a theoretical demonstration than technological vindication, however. As described in the Tuesday filing, OSTKO is a “digitally enhanced security,” not a full digital asset.      That’s because OSTKO’s on-chain representation is a legally irrelevant “courtesy carbon copy” of the security’s real ownership records held on transfer agent Computershare’s “conventional records,” which update before the distributed ledger does.      Johnson told CoinDesk on Tuesday the technological concession helps the asset “fit within regulatory parameters” (OSTKO is being registered with the SEC). It’s essentially a bridge.      “The goal is that as regulators and market participants become increasingly comfortable with DLT/blockchain technology, it will gradually play a larger role in the overall process to the benefit of investors, regulators and other market participants,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/08/overstock-is-set-to-finally-pay-out-its-digital-security-shareholder-dividend,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6914909ed31f0825dc522b8275072c7a46935890-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a court ruling over how the remaining crypto assets will be distributed, Justice David Gendall at the High Court in Christchurch said users of the exchange are entitled to the assets they hold in Cryptopia accounts, deciding they should be classed as ""property"" as they were held in separate trust accounts.      An alternative ruling would have seen the assets classed as normal debt to be distributed among both users and creditors.      Justice Gendall described the case in a document published on Wednesday, saying: ""Effectively, the tussle which is before the Court is one between the creditors of Cryptopia on the one hand and the accountholders who have invested in the various digital assets (“the accountholders”) on the other.""      Also read: ‘Ship-to-Ship’ Trade and Other Secrets of North Korea’s Illicit $1.5B Crypto Stash      The company had over 800,000 users with positive balances that would need to be reimbursed, but 37 creditors and 90 shareholders have also been vying for their stake in the remaining assets of the company.      Following the hack in January of last year, it was discovered Cryptopia had lost around NZ$30 million (US$17.85 million) in various cryptocurrencies – funds that are still missing with police still not having disclosed if they have any real suspects.      The breach left crypto assets worth around NZ$170 million (US$101 million) held by the exchange. Grant Thornton New Zealand, which was assigned to oversee the firm's liquidation process last May, is still trying to ascertain the details of which users held which cryptocurrencies due to poor record keeping at Cryptopia.      Also disclosed in the filing, creditors would likely end up with a share of other Cryptopia funds to the value of NZ$5.4 million (US$3.2 million). That's less than half of the claimed NZ$12.7 million (US$7.5 million), of which New Zealand's tax department also seeks NZ$5 million (US$2.9 million).      Also read: A New Ultrasonic Hack Can Exploit Your Siri      With lawyers representing the creditors and the exchange users both taking different stances on the key issue of whether the crypto assets are indeed property (the creditors said they are not), Justice Gendall ultimately said: ""I reach the conclusion that the cryptocurrencies here situated in Cryptopia’s exchange are a species of intangible personal property and clearly an identifiable thing of value. Without question they are capable of being the subject matter of a trust.""      ""The argument that cryptocurrency is mere information and therefore it is not property is a simplistic one and, in my view, it is wrong in the present context,"" he added.
