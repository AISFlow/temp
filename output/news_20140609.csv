Gox's US and Canada operations CoinLab has announced that it is now supporting the Japan-based exchange's Chapter 15 bankruptcy filing.  The news comes from court papers filed Friday, 6th June and obtained by The Wall Street Journal that state that CoinLab will not move to oppose the filing. CoinLab previously objected to the revival plan for Mt. Gox submitted by investor syndicate Sunlot Holdings.  The move, while seemingly small, could open the door for the Sunlot Holdings plan, as well as those rumored to be submitted by China-based digital currency exchange OKCoin and CoinLab itself, to move to Japan for formal vetting.  Mt. Gox's Japanese bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi has previously indicated that the bankrupt exchange needs to secure approval for its Chapter 15 protection in the US before he can assert more authority over developments in the case.  Mt. Gox KK, the company's Japanese entity was granted preliminary protection in the US upon filing for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in March, a move that granted certain protections from creditors.  At that time  , it was noted that the presiding bankruptcy judge Stacey Jernigan would need to review the matter before choosing whether to extend the offering.  CoinLab enters the conversation  The move is the second notable development in the case caused by the assertion of CoinLab in the proceedings following its move to block the revival plan proposed by Sunlot.  In this filing, CoinLab argued that Sunlot was perhaps looking to take advantage of Mt. Gox creditors by overcharging for certain responsibilities it would carry out once charged with the management of the exchange's liabilities. However, this was just one of a long list of other concerns.  Notably, CoinLab's claims against Mt. Gox are among the more dated in the case.  CoinLab filed a lawsuit against Mt. Gox in May 2013 claiming that Mt. Gox did not provide it with the necessary resources to fulfill its contractual obligations, and was later countersued by the exchange in September of that year.  Neither lawsuit had been settled at the time of Mt. Gox's insolvency, though CoinLab sources have indicated to CoinDesk that more legal developments were expected in the case prior to the exchange's bankruptcy filing.  Upcoming hearing  The news comes amid a relatively quiet period in what has so far proved to be a chaotic case for the involved legal experts, regulators and creditors, many of whom lost substantial savings in the exchange's demise.  However, new activity is to be expected later this month when on 17th June, Judge Jernigan will hold a hearing to determine whether Mt. Gox is formally granted Chapter 15 protection.  At the meeting, the Journal indicates that Mt. Gox officials will need to ""prove a legitimate court proceeding is taking place in a foreign country"" before securing protection.

42377366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OL5,1402344015,How Bitcoin Tech Could Make Infamous Anonymous Tor Network More Powerful,"A new altcoin called torcoin is gaining interest for its potential to solve a problem that is central to the Tor network, a popular system for masking data and communication on the Internet.  The relationship between Tor and the technology underlying digital currencies is deep. Many bitcoin-powered online black markets, including the infamous Silk Road, use Tor to protect their services from infiltration, while major bitcoin projects like bitcoinj use Tor to facilitate connections.  The central function of the Tor protocol is to provide users with a greater degree of anonymity online than is currently possible with most consumer programs and platforms. Yet according to the creators of the torcoin concept, it’s difficult to incentivize participation in the network, and as a result, the long-term health of the network is also threatened.  Torcoin seeks to solve this problem by creating a system by which relay owners receive revenue for operating nodes within the Tor network. This mirrors the mining function of the bitcoin protocol in that the transaction structure is maintained by providing income to those who keep it running. The block chain is, like bitcoin, used to publicly identify transactions on the network.  Still, torcoin differs from bitcoin in several key areas, most notably with its 'proof-of-bandwidth' system that is responsible for determining whether relays are actually processing network bandwidth instead of discovering blocks.  The developers state in the white paper:  ""Unlike bitcoin, its proof-of-work scheme is based on bandwidth rather than computeration. To 'mine' a torcoin, a relay transfers bandwidth over the Tor network. Since relays can sell torcoin on any existing altcoin exchange, torcoin effectively compensates them for contributing bandwidth to the network, and does not require clients to pay for access to it.""  Anonymous circuit creation  Tor functions by transmitting data from client users through network relays. Part of this process involves restricting information about data sources and information, so that no relay knows the history or destination of a particular connection.  The developers of torcoin promise a few changes to the way that the Tor network functions at its core. One key difference is that circuit assignments are given by what is referred to as an assignment server, as opposed to the normal process of selection from the Tor directory.  This is facilitated by the TorPath protocol, which its authors explain acts as a decentralized decision-maker to maintain the structure that keeps relays from knowing where data is traveling.  The paper reads:  ""The protocol guarantees that no participant on a circuit can identify all other participants, and that each circuit includes a publicly verifiable signature. We use TorPath to 'sign' each torcoin, so that anyone can verify a torcoin's validity by comparing its signature to a global history of consensus groups.""  There are three stages by which TorPath functions to assign groups and facilitate the transfer of data in a decentralized way.  First, consensus groups are assigned, providing public keys in order to identify themselves and begin the data transfer process. TorPath chooses consensus groups randomly to reduce the risk that relays could potentially share data and threaten the anonymity of users who are on that particular circuit.  The next stage involves the shuffling of the public keys provided by the relays and the creation of new temporary keys. At this point, participants can not readily see which keys belong to whom, thereby masking final entry and exit points from those running the relays.  The last phase functions of TorPath actually assign Tor circuits to users while still maintaining the encryption shuffle begun in the second stage.  Mining torcoins  The proof-of-bandwidth concept allows any relay functioning on a TorPath circuit to receive torcoins as compensation for the data it facilitated.  The mining process involves the creation and verification of transactions that occur when bandwidth is moved through the Tor network by relays. While the proof-of-bandwidth process involves more steps than bitcoin's proof-of-work, torcoin mining utilizes the basic structure of bitcoin mining to actually pay relays.  The white paper states:  ""The [Tor] client uses the standard Bitcoin transfer protocol to pay each relay in the circuit one third of the mined torcoin.""  This creates a block chain that can be used to verifying the mathematical stages within proof-of-bandwidth in a public setting, the authors add.  The system takes several steps to keep malicious relays from hijacking the torcoin mining process. One maintains a steady Tor packet rate that reports relays or clients that move data too fast to the assignment servers, which then cut the circuit untirely.  A solution for Tor  According to the creators of torcoin, Tor users experience an environment that ""suffers from slow speeds, due to a shortage of relay nodes from volunteers"". The authors cite this as a long-term issue as well that threatens future growth and functionality.  The paper outlines a server test that demonstrates that the TorCoin protocol only adds a ""small amount of overhead"" to actual Tor traffic. However, they acknowledged that data bottlenecks are possible and that users that don’t wish to wait may simply opt to access regular Tor circuits  Ultimately, the torcoin project offers a way for the Tor network to gain more relays and increase the strength and speed of the system. It remains to be seen, however, whether torcoin will be adopted as a means of incentivizing relay participation, or how any future exchange rate of of the altcoin will impact how much the project helps solve the problems it was meant to address.

42377373,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OTt,1402340714,BitGive Unites Bitcoin Industry for Charity Bowling Showdown,"Eight teams representing bitcoin companies in the San Francisco Bay area competed in a charitable tournament hosted by the BitGive Foundation on Sunday, 8th June at the Yerba Buena Gardens skating and bowling center.  The fundraising event featured food, drink, crypto-related socializing and relaxation. Further, a number of leading bitcoin companies in the Bay Area participated including Coinbase, Xapo, Vaurum, BitPay, Kraken, Buttercoin, BitGo and BTCJam.  The result was that bitcoins were also raised for a good cause. Entrance to the event cost 1 BTC per team, with some proceeds going to BitGive’s current charity campaign for The Water Project.  Connie Gallippi, Executive Director of the BitGive Foundation, told CoinDesk:  ""We raised 8 BTC and had costs of course for the event. We probably cleared over 5 BTC in proceeds for BitGive.""  Preparation evident  The charity event was approached with a certain degree of seriousness by those involved. For example, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken even held tryouts prior to the even in order to put together its team.  Jesse Powell, Kraken’s CEO, explained the rationale behind this move, stating:  ""We had 10 people who wanted to be on the team, but only five slots.""  Many of the bowling teams came to the event in coordinated clothing. Should there have been a costume contest, bitcoin lending startup BTCJam would have taken the top prize.  CEO Celso Pitta looked relaxed doing his best to imitate 'The Dude' from cult classic The Big Lebowski.  Fundraising for clean water  BitGive does its fundraising for various charities via campaigns, and the Water Project, which aims to provide clean water in Sub-Saharan Africa, is currently the foundation’s focus.  Gallippi told CoinDesk that BitGive is a little over halfway towards reaching its goal of raising $10,000 for The Water Project:  ""Once we meet our goal, we will have raised enough to fund and enter water project for a community.""  The Water Project has embraced bitcoin as a tool for raising money. The project’s website displays fundraising progress and even lists every donation in a block chain-style format.  Peter Chasse, president of the The Water Project, has written about the potential cyrptocurrencies have as a tool for charities as well.  Chasse indicates they can lessen the expenses that charities must pay when using credit cards and international money transfers.  Event response  Jason King of Sean’s Outpost just completed his Bitcoin Across America campaign in San Francisco with the goal was of raising awareness about homelessness in the United States. Still, even after all these miles, he found time to speak briefly at the charity bowling event.  Overall, King said he was amazed at the growth in the bitcoin space happening in the Bay Area, stating:  ""Look at all these bitcoin companies. Back in 2010, this was all just a twinkle in someone's eye.""  Charlie Lee from Coinbase, whose company team wore throwback bowling shirts, said that the weekend event was a relaxing social gathering:  ""Who doesn't enjoy some friendly competition between bitcoin companies? And also [helping] out with some donation to BitGive. A great way to spend a Sunday afternoon if you ask me.""  Winners and future events  The bowling event had winners for first and second place.  In first place was Xapo, which received a trophy engraved ‘BitGive Tournament – 2014 Champions – To the moon!’, while second place went to BitPay, who received a trophy bearing the phrase ‘BitGive Tournament 2014 – 2nd Place – We Are Satoshi!’.  Gallippi said that the overall success of the event will lead to future BitGive events in the same vein.  Bowling events will continue, and she is trying to get more creative with her event ideas to help raise money for BigGive:  ""There will definitely be an annual bowling tournament, perhaps semi-annual, and we are talking about other events as well such as a bitcoin - dogecoin swimoff.""

42377369,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OOr,1402336510,Former Visa Exec to Join BitPay as Chief Compliance Officer,"Former Visa anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing officer Tim Byun has announced that he will join Georgia-based bitcoin merchant processor BitPay as its chief compliance officer.  Byun  served as a Visa executive from February 2009, and previously worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  BitPay executive chairman Tony Gallippi framed the hiring as a move that would further demonstrate his company is meeting the expectations of US regulators as it seeks to expand bitcoin adoption among global merchants.  Gallippi said:  ""As the bitcoin industry continues to grow, BitPay wants to ensure that our policies and procedures fall inline with various state, federal and international regulations. For this reason, we hired Tim to set up and maintain our compliance structure.""  The news is perhaps one of the more noteworthy hires to come amid what has been an impressive increase in talent acquisitions at the company and in the bitcoin industry at large.  For example, just over a week ago, Facebook's Ben Davenport announced he would end his three-year stint at the social networking giant to join secure wallet startup BitGo.  Public persona  Byun will also provide a new public face for the company, as he has formerly spoken on behalf of Visa at high-profile conferences such as the annual International Anti-Money Laundering Conference and the National Forum on Prepaid Card Compliance.  BitPay indicates that Byun will represent the company later this June when he speaks at Bitcoin in the Beltway, a Washington, DC-based conference organised by Sean's Outpost founder Jason King.  The conference will include Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, Blockchain's Andreas Antonopoulos and more.  Hiring boom  The news is perhaps the most noteworthy hire to come amid what has been an impressive increase in talent-seeking at the company. BitPay now has more than 40 employees worldwide, but previously indicated that its Series A funding will allow it to expand this total, adding 70 new jobs.  In addition to Byun, the company also brought in former ClearPoint compliance manager Anjali Kamath as its new General Counsel and Compliance Manager.  For more on how BitPay plans to allocate its new talent and the kinds of positions that the company is most focused on filling, read our most recent interview with executive chairman Gallippi.

42377330,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Lwd,1402332865,How to Succeed With Your Bitcoin Startup,"With any new and exciting technology, startups flourish – and bitcoin is no exception.  Venture capital investment in the digital currency space is soaring and is likely to hit $300m this year – three times the total for 2013.  Not all startups succeed, of course. Mt. Gox imploded in spectacular fashion, and BitInstant, too, went down in flames.  So, what does it take to make a startup work?  Bitcoin may be an exciting new paradigm that changes the nature of financial transactions, but don't be fooled into thinking that the old rules don't apply.  The most common piece of advice from the successful entrepreneurs CoinDesk spoke to was: don't develop a solution looking for a problem. Yet, many would-be entrepreneurs in bitcoin and other industries make that mistake all too often, by failing to let the market guide them.  Old rules may apply  “A new bitcoin business must be able to identify a problem, and solve it in a way that allows them to monetize their solution,” said serial bitcoin startup investor Roger Ver, who holds a majority stake in Blockchain, and who many call the ‘bitcoin Jesus’. He explained:  “I have seen far too many bitcoin startup CEOs focusing on how much money they can raise, when they should be focusing on how much money the company can earn.”  Joseph Lee, founder of derivatives trading site BTC.sx, has opened offices in Singapore, London, and New York since starting his company just over a year ago. He agrees, but adds that simply having an idea isn’t enough. Execution is key, he says.  Mt Gox was an example of a company that snagged a good idea before anyone else, but executed it poorly. BitInstant, too, failed because its website was improperly developed. Charlie Shrem’s indictment for money laundering came later.  Classifying startups  Serial bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees has had his fair share of bitcoin successes and failures. He was director of marketing at BitInstant, but redeemed himself with the 126,315 BTC sale of his online bitcoin gambling company, SatoshiDice, to an undisclosed buyer a year ago.  As such, he can speak from experience when he describes three different types of bitcoin startup.  The first are formal companies that are constrained by regulatory guidelines, such as in the US.  “These companies must prepare to follow not only every US government rule, but every potential future government rule, and every potential future retroactive rule,” Voorhees explained.  The second type are formal companies that abandon a strict regulatory jurisdiction and find a more liberal climate for their operations (SatoshiDice stopped serving US residents, for example). They lose a large market, but they also lose a large legal headache, Voorhees pointed out.  The third type of corporation wasn’t possible before bitcoin, he suggested:  “Because bitcoin businesses don't necessarily need bank accounts, they can ‘live in the cloud’ and be ‘corporations of the web’. Such companies will be the most disruptive (and ultimately the most prevalent if the bitcoin experiment succeeds), as they exist upon the very virtues of what a cryptocurrency is all about – market-based legitimacy, equality, freedom, and anti-censorship.”  Funding options  The type of company that you choose will inevitably have a bearing on the type of funding you need – and how you can get it. Many companies remain bootstrapped, developed by their founders without external funding beyond some basic friend or family input.  ""It is certainly possible to bootstrap, but oftentimes angel and VC funding can quickly help to move things into high gear,"" said Ver. “Mostly this will depend on how capital intensive the business is.”  Typically, bootstrapping is more possible with offshore or decentralised bitcoin companies, suggested Voorhees. He adds, though, that companies enmeshed in onshore US regulatory issues will require more significant funding to overcome those legal hurdles.  Having said that, companies in the first category can go a long way before approaching investors.  Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's Vice President of Marketing, said that for the first two years or so, the company funded itself, and became profitable. It only went after angel funding at that point.  “We found that we needed to expand faster than our cash flow and took angel funding in early 2013,” she said.  “Because of that, we were in a good position to attract $2.7 million when the industry was very young and then again $30 million in VC investments just recently – the largest amount of investment for a bitcoin company.”  Crowdsales  will become an integral part of the bitcoin funding process, say experts.  “Once they become fully regulated then they will become an unstoppable force in determining which startups receive funding and which don’t,” says Lee, adding that crowdsales carry a unique advantage: validation.  That is, unless companies create a product or service that resonates with users and solves a clear problem, it is unlikely to attract the funding it needs through a crowdsale platform.  Team building  There are other important critical success factors for entrepreneurs wanting to develop successful bitcoin startups, said Lee. For one, become an expert in your field, he said. Lee worked in banking on two continents and wrote his own trading bot software before he started BTC.sx.  However, you can’t be an expert in all the aspects of running a company, so having a solid team is also vital.  “As your startup grows, surround yourself with the best people you can find, believe in them and the advice they give,” he said. “And, most importantly, have a little faith.”  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42377346,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70MCz,1402328597,How Swarm Plans to Become the Facebook of Crowdfunding,"A new company called Swarm Corp is launching a decentralized crowdfunding platform that will allow companies to sell cryptographic shares easily and quickly by creating their own digital currencies.  Swarm  ’s COO Ben Ingram described the platform as ""the Facebook of crowdfunding"". Powered by the Counterparty protocol, it effectively operates like a social network for cryptocurrency investors.  As well as helping entrepreneurs kickstart their financial product or service, Swarm aims to eliminate previous failures and scammers by performing crowdsourced due diligence on each entrepreneur or team.  The company's CEO Joel Dietz envisages that the best initial use case is in accelerating startups, and Ingram indicated that there are already plans for a Swarm incubator based in London.  Dietz said: “The moment I saw the user-created assets on Counterparty a light bulb came on in my head – this is the future of crowdfunding.”  Experienced team  To raise initial capital, Swarm will be issuing its own cryptocurrency, swarmcoin, starting with a crowdsale on 17th June, which will entitle investors to a portion of the coins launched on the company's platform in future.  Following David Johnston’s strict approach to BitAngel investing, which demands that both investments and subsequent returns are made in bitcoin, Dietz plans to raise capital for his first round using only the digital currency – a process which he described colourfully as ""eating our own dogfood"".  Adam Krellenstein and Evan Wagner, the dynamic duo that founded Counterparty XCP (the platform upon which Swarm is being launched) have been working with Swarm’s five-strong team over the last few months, and said:  “Swarm brings a high level of ability and experience to the first real crowdfunding platform, with a senior engineer previously with Microsoft and Linkedin, a Salesforce MVP, alumni from Loyola, Brown, Harvard and Penn State, and an accomplished user-interface and design specialist.  Collective intelligence  For those in the know, Counterparty is akin to the mastercoin protocol and leverages the bitcoin block chain to offer services – much like a decentralized exchange for tokens, assets, smart property and potentially, shares, stocks and bonds.  Where the mastercoin and Counterparty protocols apparently differ is in their governance and issuance structure.  The now not-so-anonymous XCP devs said that they looked at the mastercoin protocol and ""basically threw out everything [they] didn’t like"", creating ""a simpler better version of a Bitcoin 2.0 protocol"", which is ideally suited to enable crowdfunding and accelerators, adding:  ""Swarm is based on the idea that the collective intelligence of decentralized networks can evolve faster and out-perform centralised systems.""  Swarm relies on the ‘Vennd’ function of XCP, which has in turn become it’s own separate entity that is due to launch soon. So, the company capitalises and magnifies the use of bitcoin technology, taking advantage of the new swarm-like models of information distribution engendered by decentralised network behaviour.  Fair returns  Does this new form of venture capital fundraising really apply to everyone, however? For example, does a product like Oculus Rift belong on the platform as Dietz’ implies?  He put it this way:  ""The Oculus Rift raised over $2m dollars on Kickstarter and then the owner turned around and sold it to Facebook for $2bn. What did the participants in the crowdfunder get? A t-shirt?""  ""With Swarm those who put in always get something out, cryptoequity can even be enforced with corporate bylaws, meaning that if Facebook then wanted to buy the product (or company) they’d need to buy out a majority of the stakeholders, Dietz said. ""It’s a model that makes investing in projects like the Oculus Rift more fun and potentially more lucrative.”  Dietz  explained that he wants to build an app that is ""as easy to use as Tinder"", where you can flick between ‘crypto-share offerings' in a multitude of markets, select the ones you like and buy shares quickly and easily without the hassle of dealing with stockbrokers.  The regulation issue  In light of Erik Vorhees' recent rap on the knuckles by the SEC, there is concern over the legality of making equity offerings in crypto companies, as regulators can levy fines retroactively to punish those they consider to have breached the rules. This is despitethe fact that purely crypto-based companies don’t need to hold bank accounts and, if handled properly, can reasonably be expected to operate outside of existing regulation in perpetuity.  Skype’s former COO Michael Jackson recently argued that bitcoin companies often don’t need and shouldn’t seek regulations, saying:  ""If companies can make a case for themselves that they don’t need regulation, they shouldn't even go near it.”  He furtherexplained that Skype did not ask permission from existing Telecoms regulators to operate, because they weren’t a telecom andnever claimed to be one.  “The general problem when issuing any kind of token where there is some expectation of realisable future profit is that it is possible the law will construe that as a security,"" said Preston Byrne, securitization and cryptocurrency lawyer and Adam Smith Institute Fellow. ""Although in certain cases where very small numbers of investors are involved this is not necessarily a problem, when dealing with large issuances to hundreds or thousands of members of the public it almost certainly is.""  “For startups and investors alike,"" he continued, ""crypto-securities platforms hold the potential to democratise access to capital.""  ""However, they will not be adopted by businesses of any serious stature unless the contingent liability of regulatory sanction is mitigated – which, given the newness of the field, requires comprehensive pre-launch legal structuring advice.”  Lessons learned  With this mixture of talent and features, Swarm seems very promising, but the UK Digital Currency Association’s Simon Dixon pointed out that regulations surrounding equity crowdfunding exist largely to protect consumers.  Investors should always do their own due diligence, however, he said, and with criticisms and controversy still raging around the recent record-breaking crowdsale of MaidSafe on the mastercoin platform, angel pioneers and crypto-cowboys alike are asking hard questions of themselves and their industry.  Investor David Johnston is bullish about Swarm, calling it ""the future of the next generation crowdsales"" and the Swarm team has been careful to take note of that lessons learned from the MaidSafe experience.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/09/how-swarm-plans-to-become-the-facebook-of-crowdfunding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8c62ebf60d1f9c7a47436228659609450bde109-1923x914.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The advertisement states that the candidate needs experience with Hadoop, programming languages used in data analysis, and work experience in the field of data mining and statistical modelling.  More significantly for the cryptocurrency world, the new hire will be investigating the impact of disruptive technologies such as wearables, digital currencies and new means of payment. The ad says a key aspect of the role will be:  ""Investigating the impact of new technologies like Google Glass, Leap Motion, smart watches, Bitcoin, and iBeacons on the future of mobile banking and the financial world of tomorrow.""  “As a Data Scientist at Capital One Labs, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives,” the ad states.  Capital One data scientists have to be able to write software capable of investigating large and messy data sets, integrate their software with existing APIs in order to track interesting trends, and create learning models.  Investigative role  The job posting does not mean Capital One is considering entering the cryptocurrency space just yet, however. On the contrary, Capital One is not very liberal when it comes to digital currencies, and last year closed a company's account over a mere mention of bitcoin.  With this job posting, Capital One makes it clear that it wants to investigate the impact of various technologies on the future of mobile banking and the financial world of tomorrow. Digital currencies are just one small piece of the puzzle and the other technologies listed have a significant disruptive potential in their own right.

The company says the Yukon miner will deliver 2.1 TH/kW (2.1 GH/Watt) – an impressive figure made possible by the use of 28nm silicon and design tweaks. Each SP-30 Yukon unit will feature 30 RockerBox ASICs.  RockerBox ASIC outlined  On its website Spondoolies-Tech has some basic RockerBox ASIC specs. This 28nm part comes in a 19x19mm FCBGA package and it has a has rate of 200 GH/s per chip. The rated voltage stands at 0.7V, while the recommended voltage range is 0.63V – 0.8V. Power consumption is rated at 0.34W per GH/s.  The chip has a wide range of overclock and downclock options. However, the new product brief offers a bit more insight and hard specs.  The RockerBox is a multiple double design, with 193 double SHA low-power, high-performance engines, or cores. Each engine performs a single hash per cycle. The document states the chip can operate at 0.55V-0.8V and each engine can be shut down to conserve power.  The document also features a schematic of the chip and more package info – it is a more or less standard 19x19mm FCBGA design with 480 balls.  Power options  Here are a couple of typical operation parameters outlined in the product brief.  Operating at a core voltage of 0.6V the chip runs at 900MHz and delivers ~174 GH/s. It draws 55W of power, which translates into a power/performance ratio of 0.3W per GH/s.  At 0.7V the chip is clocked at 1,100MHz and delivers 212 GH/s. However, the higher clock and voltage also bring down efficiency, so the chip can draw as much as 90W, or 0.4W per GH/s.  Remember that talk of a range of overclock and downclock options? Well, this is what the company is referring to, although the information is clearly not fit for publication on the product page.  Designing ASICs is not a straightforward process and it is understandable that Spondoolies-Tech does not want to include all details on its site, at least not until the designs are finalized and shipping.  In addition to impressive efficiency figures, the SP30 Yukon also has a competitive price tag of $5,095. The RockerBox ASIC taped out in late May and the company says it is working on a next generation ASIC, slated to launch in Q4.

42377327,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Lxt,1402309280,Minecraft Developer Accepting Dogecoin for New Game,"Games developer Markus Persson has announced his first commercial release since Minecraft – a tongue-in-cheek spoof seemingly designed to make fun of the big studios. Furthermore, he is accepting optional payment in dogecoin.  The PC-only game, dubbed 'Cliffhorse’, is as simple and outlandish as it gets. The user controls a galloping horse through a 3D environment, chasing a ball, neatly textured in what appears to be animal hide.  Persson has admitted he made the game in just two hours, building it using the prolific Unity engine and largely using resources included in the engine by default. To complete the game, Persson simply added a 3D model of a horse and the textured sphere.  After announcing the game on twitter, he said:    (I can't believe this somehow ended up being my first commercial game after Minecraft)      — Markus Persson (@notch) June 8, 2014    Mocking the industry  The game has been released to coincide with the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the biggest tradeshow in the video games industry.  The event will be dominated by big names such as Microsoft, Ubisoft, EA, Sony and Nintendo, showcasing numerous AAA games, including the latest instalments of the Battlefield, Batman and Far Cry franchises.  Cliffhorse seems to be Persson’s way of poking fun at the big developers and publishers with their apparently endless budgets, and perhaps gaining some publicity in the process.  Over the past decade, game development budgets have skyrocketed as a result of strong demand and the introduction of HD graphics, backed by powerful graphics processors capable of delivering near photorealistic quality.  To attain the current level of realism, developers have to invest heavily in various technologies and highly accurate 3D models, textures and other resources needed to deliver a lot of HD eye candy.  As a result, no less than seven games released since the start of the decade have had a combined budget of $100m or more, with Activision’s Destiny topping the list with an estimated cost of $140m, backed by up to $360m in marketing.  Early access controversy  Persson is providing the game for free, but allowing well-wishers to opt to 'buy' early access to the game using dogecoin. This seems to be another swipe at other games developers, which, due to skyrocketing development costs, have started accepting pre-orders for their products.  Generally, fans paying early are rewarded with various extras, usually in the form of exclusive or free additional content. The practice allows publishers and developers to raise extra funds before the game is ready to launch and it some cases it can help in the beta development phase of the title.  However, the practice has received criticism in the gaming community, with many arguing that it is merely bloating development costs and that, in some instances, gamers who choose to opt for early access do not necessarily get a good deal: some early releases have proven to be virtually unplayable and even full releases have sometimes disappointed early backers.  Persson said that, even though payment is not required, he managed to raise about $100-worth of dogecoins (280,000 doge) in the hours after the game was announced.  Reviews for Cliffhorse have been less than complimentary, reflecting the speedy build and throwaway nature of the game, which doesn't even include sound:    ""The [...] future [...] of gaming"" - PC Gamer | ""Not even a game"" - Ed Key | ""Awful. 9.2/10"" - IGN pic.twitter.com/VleDjp6RYw      — Markus Persson (@notch) June 7, 2014",POSITIVE,없음,DOGE,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/09/minecraft-developer-accepting-dogecoin-for-new-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8c5c0882039472a64945afe0ad994036765ccf1-1296x671.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377341,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70M7x,1402290041,Malaysian Retail Giant i-Pmart Will Hold 100% of its Bitcoin Payments,"Another e-commerce giant has joined the bitcoin world, with major Malaysian online mobile phone and electronic parts retailer i-Pmart adding it to the list of accepted payment methods last week.  CEO and founder Mart Tang also said the company will hold onto the bitcoins it earns and watch the price rise, rather than convert them into local fiat currency.  Although based in Malaysia, the company ships worldwide from outlets in its home country, plus China and the US. The bitcoin option was introduced first to the Malaysian site only, though international customers may still use that version.  All other i-Pmart sites worldwide will start accepting about 20 days from now, as soon as the integration process is complete.  Low-key launch  What's most surprising about i-Pmart's decision is the lack of fanfare with which bitcoin was added to the list of options. Rather than publicizing it, or even celebrating the announcement with its 730,000+ fans on Facebook, the company added the bare-bones line ""We accept bitcoin"" and an icon into its long list of existing payment options.  i-Pmart is also a big seller of litecoin mining equipment, selling GPU-based rigs both to advanced users to self-assemble with the 'Savvy Pack’, and a 'Newbie Pack’ for beginners that includes the option to have i-Pmart assemble, host and even operate the hardware for them.  Despite this, however, the company is not adding litecoin as a payment option yet.  Bitcoin fan  CEO Tang said his interest in bitcoin came from being an IT entrepreneur always searching the Internet for the latest tech information and gadgets.  Shortly after absorbing everything he could about bitcoin and other digital currencies, he began hearing about merchants in other countries accepting bitcoin and studied how to become a digital currency miner himself.  ""This gives me more insight into bitcoins and others types of coin on how it works and benefits from it,"" he said.  ""That's how I have started to think if I have customers who want to use bitcoin to purchase my products online which gives convenience of various types of payment choice especially those who do not prefer to pay using their credit card, cash or other mode of payment.""  He then sat down with his web development team to discuss how to integrate bitcoin as a mode of payment in the business portal www.ipmart.com globally.    ""[I'm] looking forward to the new world of virtual payment choice, which I believe can be the future of global virtual currency that people might embrace, especially the Gen Y.""      ""I am holding the bitcoin. Because having a very big confidence the price of bitcoin is not the rates of today USD 650, should be higher than this price very soon.""    Company background  The i-Pmart Group of Companies was founded in 2001, and has focused mainly on the international market since 2005. It has 'MSC status’ in Malaysia, meaning it is part of the country's 'Multimedia Super Corridor' initiative designed to promote Malaysia as a regional center for world-class technology businesses.  The group now consists of domestic and internationally-focused retail sites, plus arms specializing in management, development, and logistics.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/09/malaysian-retail-giant-i-pmart-will-hold-100-of-its-bitcoin-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/842783691cd50b886edf7be7d0f370c2f5d77947-1106x676.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
