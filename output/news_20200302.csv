42383411,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vRJn,1583182833,Why Crypto Should Care About Justin Sun's Steem Drama,"Justin Sun has seized control of the Steem blockchain – with the apparent help of several prominent crypto exchanges.      On the Steemit Blog (which is newly owned by Sun), a post announced the new regime:      ""For the next 4-6 weeks, the Steemit team will be using the voting rights to resume the order of the community while having an open channel for meeting community members and Witnesses.""      However, as of this writing, users are telling us of app instability and users on Steemit are signaling outright revolt. This is an archived version of the original post because Steemit has been unstable.      In a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system such as Steem, this Orwellian update is only made possible by enough of the network’s native currency, STEEM, being thrown behind a new set of blockchain validators.      In short, exchanges have staked STEEM they controlled (seemingly from user accounts) to “vote” for new leadership.      The implications reach much further than just Steem or Tron, underlining the fundamental message of the ""not your keys, not your crypto"" mantra. When users hold large amounts of their assets on exchanges, it gives those firms potentially decisive power over ostensibly decentralized networks, particularly when governance authority is tied to currency holdings.    Wait, what?    The turmoil began on Feb. 14 when it was announced Sun, the controversial founder of the Tron blockchain, had acquired Steemit, a blogging site that owns a very large quantity of the STEEM cryptocurrency.      In response, STEEM community leaders, the validators of the blockchain, initiated a soft fork on Feb. 23 that censored the stake of tokens held by Steemit, usually referred to in the community as the ""ninja-mined stake,"" as CoinDesk previously reported.      ""It's like the rich guys getting together and saying 'let's show them who's the real boss,'"" Roeland Lanparty, a pseudonymous Dutch citizen who runs a Steem witness and some major applications, told CoinDesk over a WhatsApp call.      Leaders or validators on Steem are called witnesses, serving similar roles to bitcoin's miners. All 20 of the new witnesses now leading the chain are accounts created in February 2020.      Tron, Steemit and Huobi have not replied to multiple requests for comment. While Binance has not responded directly to CoinDesk's queries, an enigmatic tweet from its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, addresses the issue.      ""I was made aware of this upgrade/hardfork beforehand, and approved it. Projects do this all the time, and we are usually just in a supportive position,"" he wrote. ""Just messaged @justinsuntron, no response yet. Assume he will respond publicly soon.""      There has been no update on the proposed town hall scheduled for March 6. STEEM value has been generally down since the acquisition, trading at roughly $0.23 before the news and now at around $0.17, according to CoinMarketCap.    Steemit strikes back    The letter posted to the Steemit blog describes how Steemit had previously used its stake to support the community's development and says Sun’s Tron Foundation ""intends to use part of the Steemit stake for such executions.""      It then writes that ""the Witnesses’ decision [to soft fork] created a need to reclaim the stake and vote in new witnesses to usher in new policies for a healthier ecosystem and community,"" also adding that the move ""may be deemed illegal and criminal.""      The post details several priorities for Steem going forward. It lists swaps between Steem and Tron, smart media tokens (a project the company has discussed for at least two years), feature parity with Reddit and incentives for users to bring more people onto the platform.      The new witnesses all now have overwhelming support in terms of STEEM-denominated votes; however, the number of user accounts backing them is tiny, as can be seen in the ""voters total"" column on that same page.      Overnight, Binance, Huobi and Poloniex (which is partially owned by Sun) staked tokens they controlled in order to vote for a new slate of witnesses. Presumably, the lion's share of these tokens are technically owned by users of these platforms, not the exchanges themselves.      A tweet shows large accounts powering up tokens in advance of voting in the new slate of witnesses. Luke Stokes, a witness who has tracked exchange data for STEEM for years, verified that the accounts were related to these exchanges.      Then the accounts enacted a new version of Steem software, version 22.5, which released the tokens controlled by Steemit. In large part these tokens quickly flowed into exchange accounts allowing them to increase their vote for Steem's new leaders.      For context, the Steemit STEEM holdings have been an issue within the community for some time. Lanparty said Witnesses have previously discussed hard forks in order to remove the threat of a takeover by the company.      Stokes broke down the mechanics of the takeover last night on YouTube:      Steem was created in part by Dan Larimer who also co-created EOS, which has a very similar structure. Notably, EOS's creator, Block.One, also holds a potentially controlling portion of EOS tokens, but this has not been a major point of contention within the EOS community.    What are users doing?    Lanparty told CoinDesk he was nervous about the Tron acquisition from the beginning. What alarmed him in particular, he said, was any discussion of token swaps in initial announcements of the Steemit acquisition.      As well as running a witness, Lanparty organizes the annual SteemFest, the gathering of the blockchain's enthusiasts.      ""This is really a blockchain of people. This is a social chain,"" he said. ""You get a little bit tangled up in all these people. It's not a gambling bot.""      The prior group of witnesses has begun signalling for an alternate software, 22.4444, in protest. The multiple fours are meant to have negative connotations, as ""4"" is not seen as a lucky number in China. Users have also been posting giant images of the numeral 4 in threads on Steemit.      The community could still move to hard fork. If they did so, no doubt Steemit would continue to point to the current chain, 22.5, now controlled by Tron allies, but others might not. There are hundreds of apps built on Steem, including alternative blogging front-ends that could start reading a new chain rather than the one controlled by Tron.      Blogging alternatives on Steem include eSteem, Busy.org and SteemPeak, according to Stokes. These could all opt to redirect themselves to look at a new chain if the dispute goes far enough.      On balance, Lanparty said, leaders are keeping apps live in order to not silence the community. However, he pulled an app he had built, SteemWallet, from the iOS and Android app stores in protest.    Exchange culpability    ""This is a larger discussion and potentially historical moment for blockchains,"" Stokes told CoinDesk. ""The mechanisms we use to protect these byzantine-fault-tolerant systems, how secure are they really? This is being tested right now.""      Somewhat ironically, Lanparty said part of the reason why it soft-forked rather than hard-forked was out of deference to the exchanges. A hard fork would have required exchanges to run new code so their users could withdraw tokens, and the witnesses making the change felt this would be unfair to users.      However, until the Steem software is changed, tokens will be locked up for much longer. Once tokens are locked up to vote, it is designed to take 13 weeks to ""power down"" (in Steem parlance) and make them exchangeable again. (Of course, the new slate of witnesses now have the power to simply shorten this window.)      One user told CoinDesk he initiated a withdrawal of 500,000 STEEM on Binance following last night's news and it took three hours to arrive, shortly following the Binance CEO's announcement that it will ""likely remove the vote.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB | FORKS,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/02/why-crypto-should-care-about-justin-suns-steem-drama,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0dc323c3ebd23dde4bd196c6028e4f3be9c0b827-2560x1681.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383393,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vQvt,1583180832,"Bitcoin Rebounds as Coronavirus-Infected Stocks Get Jolt From Fed, BOJ","Bitcoin's (BTC) price jumped the most in two weeks Monday, surging alongside U.S. stocks amid speculation the Federal Reserve and other central banks will support markets as the coronavirus spreads.       The largest cryptocurrency by market value rose 4.1 percent to $8,874 as of 17:53 UTC (12:53 p.m. ET). The move followed last week’s 14 percent sell-off, the harshest in three months.       Despite a belief among some investors that bitcoin should trade as a safe-haven asset akin to gold or U.S. Treasury bonds, the cryptocurrency had tumbled recently along with riskier assets like stocks. The sell-off reversed as global authorities, including the Fed, Bank of Japan, International Monetary Fund and World Bank, pledged to act if needed to help offset any lasting economic damage from widespread travel cancellations, quarantines and factory disruptions.       “Investors are dipping their toes back in the water after last week [when] they jumped out of the pool,” said John Todaro, director of currency research at the crypto-focused firm TradeBlock in New York. “This easy monetary policy across central banks should continue to support markets in general, especially in risk-on areas like equity markets, and that should bleed into other asset classes like digital currencies, including bitcoin.”       Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday in a statement the central bank would “use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.”       Trading in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s market for futures contracts on the Fed’s benchmark interest rate shows that investors now see a 100 percent chance of a 0.5 percentage point cut at the central bank’s next regular monetary-policy decision, scheduled for March 18. The rate is currently set in a range between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent.       Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Monday the central bank would “strive to stabilize markets and offer sufficient liquidity via market operations and asset purchases,” Reuters reported.       The heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank said Monday their institutions stood ready to provide “emergency financing, policy advice and technical assistance,” with special attention to “poor countries where health systems are the weakest and people are most vulnerable.”       The global number of infections is approaching 90,000, according to the New York Times. The first two deaths from the outbreak have now occurred in the U.S., with new cases officially reported in New York, Rhode Island and Florida.       Economists with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development said Monday in an assessment that the contagion likely will shave 0.5 percentage point off of projected 2020 global growth, from an “already weak” 2.9 percent.       “The adverse impact on confidence, financial markets, the travel sector and disruption to supply chains contributes to the downward revisions,” the organization said.       The rebound in bitcoin left prices up 24 percent so far this year — markedly better than the performance in the S&P 500, which was still down 6.8 percent in 2020.       Some investors say bitcoin should serve as a hedge against economic turmoil, partly because it’s perceived as immune to the cycles that have emerged in traditional markets, where central banks are expected to come to the rescue in the face of a sell-off. The idea is that money-printing will stoke inflation, reducing the purchasing power of government-issued currencies like the U.S. dollar.       The issuance of new bitcoins is dictated by the 11-year-old blockchain network’s original programming, and cryptocurrency speculators have pegged their hopes to the upcoming “halving” expected in May — a once-every-four-years, 50 percent reduction in the pace of new supplies.     Analysts for the German bank BayernLB predicted last year that the halving could send bitcoin’s price to $90,000https://www.bayernlb.com/internet/media/ir/downloads_1/bayernlb_research/megatrend_publikationen/megatrend_bitcoins2f_20190930_EN.pdf.     But traders in the nascent market for bitcoin options are split on whether prices will rise above current levels over the next six months. According to Skew, a cryptocurrency-derivatives research firm, pricing in the options market suggests it’s a coin toss whether bitcoin will trade above the $8,000 mark at the end of September.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/02/bitcoin-rebounds-as-coronavirus-infected-stocks-get-jolt-from-fed-boj,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c4fd715d8e736728713ef5d18b01b6fc7565586-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383409,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vRG1,1583170402,"Bitcoin, Uncertainty and the Ultimate Narrative","Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s director of research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.      The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.      If there ever was a week when crypto narratives got confusing, it was last week.      Those who believe in bitcoin’s safe-haven narrative (fewer in number by the hour) are struggling to make sense of the correlated slump which left the bitcoin (BTC) price down even more in percentage terms over the past two weeks than the S&P 500 (-15 percent vs -12 percent). Gold, bitcoin’s “analog” counterpart, actually went up (4.5 percent).      Those that maintain it is a risk-on asset (growing in number by the hour) are transfixed by the jump in correlation between bitcoin and the S&P. Whatever happened to the pitch on the importance of having an uncorrelated asset in your portfolio? (True, it’s still at a low level, but it’s no longer negative.)      While analysts and fund managers produce arguments for bitcoin being both risk-on and risk-off at the same time, the bigger crypto story is happening beyond our markets. And it is worth paying attention to.      The stock market's shellacking last week seems to have been triggered by concerns about the economic impact of supply chain disruption and production slowdowns caused by coronavirus prevention measures. While these factors are unlikely to have a big impact on bitcoin fundamentals (no matter how delayed mining equipment deployment gets, the protocol will keep doing its thing), in times of fear investors exit riskier assets. They also exit liquid assets, and bitcoin is probably easier to offload than other high-risk holdings such as thinly traded stocks or private equity.    Supply chain impact    Moving beyond markets, the disruptions will have a deeper and longer-lasting impact on global supply chains. This threat, combined with building tensions elsewhere, could eventually consolidate crypto’s risk-off status, and endow it with the use case the market has been waiting for.      Unless the coronavirus spread is quickly contained, global supply chains will need to be reconfigured to more local variations. This will most likely accelerate the already-present unwinding (due to trade tensions and increased border controls) of the globalization trend in manufacturing that had led to lower costs all around.      This unwinding will most likely push up costs for consumers, as low-cost manufacturers (usually based in Asia) are replaced by less efficient or more highly taxed local suppliers. This could finally produce the inflation that central bankers have been longing for.      However, this inflation could manifest just at the time central banks are yet again lowering rates and flooding the markets with new money to combat the market slump. Last week’s fall may be temporary – but it was the largest since the 2008 crisis, which is understandably ringing alarm bells.      Running in parallel, we have political uncertainty. The market rout, if it continues, could end up having a significant impact on the upcoming U.S. elections. A large driver of Donald Trump's support has been the strength of the S&P 500. Should that evaporate, support could swing. And an increased likelihood of a victory for Bernie Sanders, for instance, could further spook the markets, perhaps making that victory even more likely.    Climate of uncertainty    Uncertainty in the U.S., both economic and political, is likely to spill over into other regions, perhaps pushing countries further towards populism as economies struggle and local tensions escalate.      You see where I’m heading with this? It’s not towards a fog of doom and despair. It’s toward the growing realization that there is an alternative. The mix of rising inflation, more printing of money and growing populism should heighten global interest in an alternative asset that is immune to inflation, monetary depreciation and political manipulation.      The likely eventual outcome, after tragic suffering and wealth destruction which is never a good thing, will be a new type of narrative, one with greater clarity and acceptance, not to mention urgency.      Bitcoin may be a risk-on asset now, as uncertain narratives, contained liquidity and limited awareness put it in the “optional” bucket of most portfolios. But as its use case becomes even more obvious, given macro developments that highlight the vulnerability of fiat-based finance, it could finally rise to become the “safe haven” or “necessary hedge” that we have been talking about.

42383395,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vQx9,1583169839,US Treasury Department Blacklists 20 Bitcoin Addresses Tied to Alleged North Korean Hackers,"The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control has added 20 new bitcoin (BTC) addresses associated with two individuals to its list of sanctioned individuals.      According to an update to OFAC's ""Specially Designated Nationals"" (SDN) list, Jiadong Li and Yinyin Tian are accused of being linked to the Lazarus Group, a cybercrime group possibly affiliated with the North Korean government.      The group has been accused of stealing more than half a billion dollars in crypto as far back as 2018, when cybersecurity vendor Group-IB claimed it had targeted 14 different exchange in two years. Monday's action specifically stems from the hack of an unnamed exchange in April 2018, according to a press release by the Treasury Department.      According to a grand jury indictment unsealed Monday and flagged by George Washington University's Seamus Hughes, the two are charged with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments and operating an unlicensed money transmission business.      A separate in rem forfeiture document unsealed Monday shows the U.S. government is trying to seize the crypto held in 113 different addresses, alleging that the two defendants (who are explicitly named on page 21) laundered ""a bulk of the stolen BTC.""      According to the forfeiture document, a total of $234 million in crypto was actually stolen, including bitcoin, ether (ETH), zcash (ZEC), dogecoin (DOGE), XRP (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and ethereum classic (ETC).      Most of the proceeds from the hack were laundered through the use of ""peel chains,"" a term the U.S. government is using to describe the act of sending crypto from one address to another, with some portion of the funds moving to a different address than the bulk in each transaction.      The litecoin was not properly laundered, and appears to remain at the address it was sent to.      The defendants sold some of the crypto to U.S. customers and used a U.S.-based exchange for some transactions, according to the forfeiture document. A South Korean exchange is also implicated in the document.      A U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) press release added further information, saying some of the laundered funds allegedly helped North Korean actors continue hacking campaigns against other financial industry participants. The release also alleged that North Korean co-conspirators are connected to ""the theft of approximately $48.5 million"" in crypto from a South Korean exchange.      While the DOJ does not name the exchange which was hacked, South Korea-based Upbit reported the loss of roughly $49 million in ether on Nov. 27, 2019.      The agency listed 12 addresses associated with Jiadong Li:    XBT 1EfMVkxQQuZfBdocpJu6RUsCJvenQWbQyE  XBT 17UVSMegvrzfobKC82dHXpZLtLcqzW9stF  XBT 39eboeqYNFe2VoLC3mUGx4dh6GNhLB3D2q  XBT 39fhoB2DohisGBbHvvfmkdPdShT75CNHdX  XBT 3E6rY4dSCDW6y2bzJNwrjvTtdmMQjB6yeh  XBT 3EeR8FbcPbkcGj77D6ttneJxmsr3Nu7KGV  XBT 3HQRveQzPifZorZLDXHernc5zjoZax8U9f  XBT 3JXKQ81JzBqVbB8VHdV9Jtd7auWokkdPgY  XBT 3KHfXU24Bt3YD5Ef4J7uNp2buCuhrxfGen  XBT 3LbDu1rUXHNyiz4i8eb3KwkSSBMf7C583D  XBT 3MN8nYo1tt5hLxMwMbxDkXWd7Xu522hb9P  XBT 3N6WeZ6i34taX8Ditser6LKWBcXmt2XXL4    OFAC listed eight addresses affiliated with Yinyin Tian:    XBT 134r8iHv69xdT6p5qVKTsHrcUEuBVZAYak  XBT 15YK647qtoZQDzNrvY6HJL6QwXduLHfT28  XBT 1PfwHNxUnkpfkK9MKjMqzR3Xq3KCtq9u17  XBT 14kqryJUxM3a7aEi117KX9hoLUw592WsMR  XBT 1F2Gdug9ib9NQMhKMGGJczzMk5SuENoqrp  XBT 3F2sZ4jbhvDKQdGbHYPC6ZxFXEau2m5Lqj  XBT 1AXUTu9y3H8w4wYx4BjyFWgRhZKDhmcMrn  XBT 1Hn9ErTCPRP6j5UDBeuXPGuq5RtRjFJxJQ    While thousands of bitcoin appear to have flowed through the listed addresses, the majority appeared to hold no bitcoin as of press time.      Monday's move is the third time OFAC has listed cryptocurrency addresses on its sanctions list. In 2018, the agency tied bitcoin addresses to a pair of Iranian nationals it accused of facilitating financial transactions related to ransomware. Last year, the agency also listed a litecoin address and additional bitcoin addresses affiliated with three Chinese nationals it charged with violating money laundering and drug smuggling laws.      According to the Treasury Department's press release, ""North Korea's malicious cyber activity is a key revenue generator"" for the nation. The country uses peer-to-peer marketplaces and exchanges with ""negligible"" know-your-customer controls, and crypto stolen by the nation can be used in a variety of ways.      ""Given the illicit finance risk that cryptocurrency and other digital assets pose, in June 2019 the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) amended its standards to require all countries to regulate and supervise such service providers, including exchangers, and to mitigate against such risks when engaging in cryptocurrency transactions,"" the press release said. ""The United States is particularly concerned about platforms that provide anonymous payment and storage functionality without transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, or customer due diligence, among other obligations.""      OFAC also deleted a number of Russian entities linked to the Independent Petroleum Company from its sanctions list in Monday's action.

42383414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vRIX,1583168381,Bitcoin’s Option Market Sees Low Chance of Post-Halving Rally,"Bitcoin (BTC) is unlikely to get bid up after the May 2020 mining-reward halving, based on the way the cryptocurrency’s options are valued.       The top cryptocurrency is currently trading around $8,800, representing an 20 percent gain on a year-to-date basis.       Meanwhile, the options market is reporting the probability of prices holding above the $8,000 mark by the end of September at coin toss levels, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.       To put it another way, option traders are not sure if bitcoin will trade above the $8,000 mark four months after reward halving – supposedly a price-bullish event. The probability stood at 65 percent a week ago when bitcoin was trading near $10,000, Skew’s co-founder and chief operating officer, Emmanuel Goh, told CoinDesk.       An option is a derivative that trades contacts between buyers and sellers, giving the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specific price on or before a specific date. A call option gives its owner the right to buy something while a put option gives the right to sell.       Bitcoin is set to undergo its third mining-reward halving sometime in May 2020. As the name suggests, the rewards per block mined will be halved from current 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. The process is repeated every four years and is aimed at curbing inflation in the cryptocurrency.       Conventional wisdom, at least among bitcoin analysts, holds that the reward halving could create supply deficit and put bitcoin on the path to new lifetime highs above $20,000.       “In approximately 200 days (69 days unil the halving) buying [one] bitcoin will be out of the reach of 99.8 percent of the population of the earth,” Jason Williams, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital tweeted on Sunday.       Historical data show the cryptocurrency rallied sharply in the years following the previous halvings, which took place in 2012 and 2016.       While halving may repeat history by rallying in 2021, the options market indicates a low probability of a big move higher this year.       The market sees a 3 percent chance of bitcoin setting a new high above $20,000 by the end of June. Meanwhile, the probability of a rise to fresh record highs by the end of September currently stands at 6 percent.       In fact, the odds of the cryptocurrency refreshing market cycle tops (the high from the preceding bear market low) with a move above the June 2019 high of $13,880 by the end of June stands at merely 11 percent.       Meanwhile, the probability for a September expiry above $14,000 is currently seen at 16 percent.       The probabilities are calculated with the help of Black-Scholes formula, which is based on key metrics like call options’ prices, the current price of bitcoin, strike prices of the options, the risk-free interest rate and the time to maturity of the options.     Halving is not always bullish    Option market probabilities should come as no surprise to litecoin (LTC) investors, who saw the value of their holdings fall sharply following the reward halving, which took place on Aug. 5, 2019.       On that day, the cryptocurrency was trading just above $100. However, by December, the price of single litecoin had dropped below $50.       Its hash rate, or the computing power needed to validate transactions on the blockchain, also tanked by 70 percent in the five months to December, as reward halving and the subsequent drop in prices whitted away mining profitability. That forced small and inefficient miners to shut down operations or move on to mining other currencies.     Pre-halving rally?    Historically, bitcoin has set new market cycle tops in the calendar year of halving, but ahead of the event, according to Rekt Capital.       For instance, bitcoin’s bear market from the December 2013 high of $1,150, ran out of steam near $150 in January 2015. The cryptocurrency then rose to a high of $502 in November 2015, confirming a bullish reversal.       Prices then fell back to $365 in February 2016 before hitting a new cycle top $778 in June – a month ahead of the reward halving, which took place in July 2016.       The high of $778 reached in June 2016 was the highest price from the bear market low of $150, but was well short of the record high (at the time) of $1,153, reached in December 2013.       Similar price behavior was seen in the months leading up to the 2012 reward halving.       If the same thing were to happen again, the cryptocurrency would set a new cycle top above the June 2019 high of $13,880 in the next two months. The options market, however, indicates the history is unlikely to repeat itself.       Currently, the options market sees only 3 percent probability of bitcoin rising above $14,000 by the end of March.      The probability of a move above $10,000 in March is also quite low at 21 percent.",NEGATIVE,BTC | LTC,BTC | LTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/02/bitcoins-option-market-sees-low-chance-of-post-halving-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56503cdd710dd92cbc7843eb3f0c39e68f762bd2-1500x931.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Provided by Coincover, a crypto ""lifestyle"" service provider, the insurance is underwritten by Lloyd's insurance syndicate Atrium, Coincover announced on Sunday. The liability policy is said to be a new type of insurance with a dynamic limit that increases or decreases in line with the price changes of covered crypto assets.      Offering coverage with limits starting from £1,000 (US$1,280), the policy is designed to protect investors and traders against losses arising from the theft of crypto held in online, or ""hot,"" wallets.      The news marks an effort by Lloyd's, via Atrium, to move further into digital assets insurance after it began offering protection to qualified custodian Kingdom Trust almost two years ago.      Trevor Maynard, head of innovation at Lloyd’s, said in the announcement the U.K.-based insurance giant is the ""natural home for insurance innovation because of the unique ability of syndicates to collaborate to insure new things.""      “As more money flows into the crypto-asset market, losses from hacks are on the rise. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency companies have found ways to protect their digital assets from theft,"" Maynard said.      The policy is backed by a panel of Lloyd’s underwriters, including TMK and Markel, that are members of Lloyd’s Product Innovation Facility (PIF), an initiative aimed to speed up insurance product development for complex and non-standard risk policies.      Founded in 2018, Coincover is offering the insurance policy for assets held in multi-signature wallets from its partner BitGo to cover against third-party hacks or the theft of private keys.      The firm told CoinDesk that in making a claim""the customer would inform, supply us with certain details such as what they felt happened (i.e. PC hacked, lost phone etc.) as well as fill out a police report."" Coincover would then investigate the claim and ""endeavor to pay out within 48 hours"" if the claim is approved.      The policy would not cover crypto asses ""willingly"" sent to the wrong address, the firm added.      David Janczewski, CEO of Coincover, said that as the crypto markets heat up again at the start of 2020, crypto-curious customers may have been put off by the lack of adequate protections in the past.      “With this innovative new policy, we can remove these barriers and broaden the appeal of crypto.

The Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange announced Saturday its proprietary network, Huobi Chain, had been successfully deployed on its testnet. Developed in collaboration with layer-1 protocol provider Nervos, Huobi said its new blockchain will allow businesses and regulators to determine the rules of the road for the emerging DeFi space.      ""With Huobi Chain, we want to provide the decentralized framework that facilitates industry-wide collaboration, which is critical to the widespread adoption of DeFi,"" said Ciara Sun, Huobi vice president for global business.      Entities in the financial services sector, including banks, will be able to use Huobi Chain to develop DeFi applications that have anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance baked into the chain itself, the exchange said.      A Huobi spokesperson told CoinDesk the firm hasn't yet entered talks with banks or other financial institutions, although that's part of the plan once Huobi Chain has successfully passed the public beta phase.      The technology would allow regulators to maintain oversight of the distributed ledger through Huobi Chain's delegated proof-of-consensus (DPOS) algorithm. A decentralized identification system (DID) allows users to create identity profiles that can be accepted and verified by regulators in multiple jurisdictions.      The exchange is eyeing use cases for its tech across areas such as tokenized asset issuance, payments, identity verification and lending.      Although Huobi Chain will support multiple cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the exchange's native Huobi Token will be the protocol's sole utility token. Support for other types of digital assets will be added over time, the exchange said.

42383410,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vRHH,1583148604,Bitcoin Rallies After Biggest Weekly Drop Since November,"View  Bitcoin produced a doji candle on Sunday, neutralizing the immediate bearish setup.  A UTC close above Sunday's high of $8,756 would validate the seller exhaustion signaled by the candle and potentially yield a test of key resistance at $9,500.  Chart-driven selling could gather pace if prices fail to defend Sunday's low of $8,410, leading to a deeper sell-off to support levels at $8,213 and $8,200.    Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing green on Monday, having suffered a double-digit price drop last week.      The top cryptocurrency is currently trading over $8,740, representing a 1.9 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      The news will be welcomed by bitcoin's bulls, as prices fell by 13 percent in the seven days to March 1, registering the biggest weekly loss since the third week of November. Back then, the cryptocurrency dropped by 18.7 percent over the same period.      Equity markets across the globe also fell sharply last week as investors shunned risk on fears the coronavirus pandemic will cause a serious slowdown in the global economy.      The S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark stock index, fell for the seventh straight day on Friday. The sell-off wiped out five months of the rally from 2,855 to 3,393. Even so, the index outperformed bitcoin on a weekly basis with an 11 percent drop.      Despite last week's drop, bitcoin is still outperforming both gold and the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis with 20 percent gains. Meanwhile, ethereum’s ether (ETH) token, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has rallied 74 percent so far this year.    Liquidity source?    Bitcoin fell last week as investors liquidated their holdings to fund margin calls triggered by the stock market crash, according to billionaire investor and Galaxy Digital founder Micheal Novogratz.      A margin call occurs when the value of the investor’s leverage account drops below the minimum margin requirement. The investor is then required to bring in additional capital or securities to build back the account up to the minimum margin requirement.      Essentially, Novogratz thinks bitcoin served as a source of liquidity last week, having apparently found a role as a safe haven in January when prices rose by 30 percent amid the U.S. Iran tensions and the beginnings of the coronavirus outbreak in China.      Currently, there is no evidence to prove that margin call-related selling fueled bitcoin’s price drop. That possibility, however, cannot be ruled out altogether, as perceived safe havens like gold are often used as source of liquidity.      Gold, a classic anti-risk asset, fell by 4 percent last week – also the biggest weekly loss since November – reportedly due to margin calls.      At press time, the metal is changing hands at $1,610 per ounce – up 3 percent from Friday’s low of $1,563.      As bitcoin also gains ground, the bulls need a close above Sunday’s high to maintain the rally.    Daily chart    Bitcoin created a doji candle on Sunday, signaling seller exhaustion. A UTC close above Sunday’s high of $8,756 would validate the doji candle and confirm an end of the pullback from the recent highs above $10,500.      A bullish close could bring additional gains towards the former support-turned-resistance of the head-and-shoulders neckline at $9,500.      Alternatively, if prices find acceptance under Sunday’s low of $8,410, a bearish doji continuation pattern would be confirmed and a deeper drop to $8,213 (Feb. 24 low) and possibly to $8,000 may be seen.

On Saturday, NBC News reported West Virginia's secretary of state, Mac Warner, had announced disabled and overseas voters would not, after all, be able to vote with mobile applications during the state's primaries. Instead, they will have to use a service by Democracy Live, which allows users to fill out a ballot online and return it via post.      West Virginia piloted Voatz's app during last year’s general midterm election, and introduced legislation early this February mandating an electronic voting option for counties across the state. NBC also said it had seen an agreement between Voatz and the state, indicating the app firm would provide its services for voting in 2020.      However, it seems West Virginia's confidence in the technology was shaken by two studies from MIT and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published in mid-February that found the Voatz app and internal processes had a number of security vulnerabilities that could lead to hackers altering the ballot and revealing voter identities.      The DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), however, determined Voatz had ""no active threats"" on its network during the week-long operation for the U.S. midterm elections in September 2019.      Voatz said it has since addressed recommendations provided by the DHS.      An election auditor who supervised Utah County’s rollout of the Voatz system told CoinDesk previously that at least some of the bugs the MIT researchers found cannot be exploited in practice.      “If the public doesn’t want it, or is skeptical to the point they’re not confident in the results, we have to take that into consideration,” Donald Kersey, general counsel to the West Virginia secretary of state, said in NBC's report.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/02/west-virginia-ditches-blockchain-voting-app-provider-voatz,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f2205f88777888c3b08f1b6a9f117cfb37f1b92-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The popular cryptocurrency exchange, which previously applied for an operating license in the country, has now become a second-class member of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) – the self-regulatory organization given the mandate to oversee the industry by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in 2018.      Announcing the news on Monday, the JVCEA said local firms Digital Asset Markets Inc. and Tokyo Hash have also joined the group alongside Coinbase as second-class members.      Coinbase has had a Japanese exchange in its sights since as far back as 2016, after it received a $10.5 million investment from a group that included Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ and Mitsubishi UFJ Capital.      In mid-2018, the firm named a chief executive for its local subsidiary, and later in the year indicated it was confident it would receive an operating license from the FSA before the end of 2019. That hasn't happened as of early 2020.

The body aims to ensure its exchange members carry out ""sound"" business as set out in local law. As an official SRO, it has the power to put in place rules for the nation’s exchanges and take action over any violations.      The JVCEA was founded to restore confidence in the industry after a series of major hacks on exchanges including the industry's biggest ever breach at Coincheck, which lost $420 million in January 2019.

42383405,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vRAz,1583130600,Why Enterprise Blockchains Fail: No Economic Incentives,"Stephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies, and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. She has a PhD in Business Economics from Harvard.      Enterprise blockchain is in the doldrums. Only three years ago, Gartner predicted blockchain would produce $3.1 trillion in new business value by 2030. But pilot project after pilot project has been announced to great fanfare, only never to be heard from again. Industry leaders publicly debate whether the technology is passe. The trough of disillusionment – Gartner’s term for the post-hype period when people inevitably realize a technology’s limitations – has arrived.      Is enterprise blockchain over? Not necessarily. Blockchain is hardly the first emerging technology to struggle to move from inflated expectations to reliable commercial viability. But if it is to have any chance of delivering on its initial promise, the approach that teams take when designing and launching products needs to change.    What’s gone wrong so far?    First and foremost, firms have been putting technical design ahead of economic design. They prioritize hiring technical teams and developing code, and then delay important discussions about the value that the product delivers and users’ incentives to adopt it. By the time the team addresses incentive design, teams have boxed themselves in to a narrow set of economic design options that are compatible with the existing code, or face deleting and rewriting huge chunks of the platform.    Blockchain platforms are economic systems.    Blockchain platforms are economic systems. Blockchain-based consortia allow enterprises to share, buy, and sell valuable data and to use that pooled data to create new goods and services, which can then be monetized. Their economic design is just as important as their technical design, and this must be reflected in the development process.      Second, teams are choosing the wrong initial use cases and founding members, typically based on the following questions:    What is the biggest client that we can get on this network?  Which use case will be most profitable when the network is mature?    Firms want to make a return on their investments, and these questions reflect that desire. However, they betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the economics of blockchain networks and the path to creating long-term monetization.      Like social networks, blockchain consortia derive much of their value from network effects: that the value of the network to each participant increases with each additional participant. Many teams are familiar with this concept, which was popularized by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian and UC Berkeley Professor Carl Shapiro in the late 1990s. But few projects understand that different use cases have different types of network effects, and the dynamics of these network effects impact how each use case develops.      When launching a network, bigger is not always better. Securing, say, Walmart as a founding member does not ensure a network will succeed. Instead, it is important to understand the network effects of potential early use cases and align them with the initial user base.    How should firms and projects approach this?    First, any consortium project must select an initial use case that can deliver value for a new, sparsely populated network. All other elements equal, use cases that require bilateral interactions (with two participants) are easier to bootstrap than use cases requiring multilateral (multi-participant) interactions. A use case that facilitates data sharing between a doctor and a patient, for example, will be able to deliver value earlier than a product that requires the doctor, the patient, and the insurance company all to join.      Second, select founding members that will be able to generate value immediately through interactions with each other. For example, social networks such as Facebook exhibit local network effects. Users benefit when other users join who are in their existing, underlying social or business networks. Use cases with local network effects may want to follow Facebook’s lead and launch with a small, highly connected subset of the underlying network (in Facebook’s case, Harvard undergraduates) to demonstrate value in the short term.    Use cases that require bilateral interactions (with two participants) are easier to bootstrap.    Once the network has launched, the set of use cases and the network membership must grow hand in hand. The optimal growth path for each depends on a number of factors, including the network effects of each use case, the level of market penetration the network has achieved, and overlap in resource contributions and participants among different use cases. A health care-focused network that launches with a product for doctors and patients, followed immediately by a product connecting insurance companies with each other, is making life hard for itself. The second product has a different user base than the first and must effectively be “re-bootstrapped” from scratch. If the network instead rolls out multiple products that serve doctors and patients, or products that connect doctors and patients with insurance companies, it can build on its existing user base and data contributions and make the most of its initial groundwork.      With the initial use cases up and running, projects are tempted to move straight to maximizing revenues. They want to recoup their investments and demonstrate to their sponsors that their new endeavor is succeeding by achieving early monetization.      As difficult as it is, teams need to be willing to focus on promoting adoption in the short term and postpone the focus on revenues until later. Products with network effects deliver more value as they grow, and users will be willing to pay more to use the network when there is widespread market penetration. The bulk of financial reward will come in this stage.      A well-developed monetization plan needs to take this into account. Charging early users too much, too soon, or imposing too high up-front costs, will stunt the growth of the network and prevent the network from ever reaching market penetration. Offering early adopters discounted fees, or even subsidies for significant adoption costs, will pay off in the long term and allow the network to achieve the yet elusive holy grail of monetization.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/02/why-enterprise-blockchains-fail-no-economic-incentives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff18b7e1067a984e7106334557d517f603afdffe-1200x850.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383392,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vQzf,1583125200,The States Can't Blockchain,"Preston Byrne, a columnist for CoinDesk's new opinion section, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies. His biweekly column, “Not Legal Advice,” is a roundup of pertinent legal topics in the crypto space. It is most definitely not legal advice.      I’ll let everyone reading this column in on a little secret: The definitions of ""blockchain tech"" used by various state legislatures to look technologically astute are something of a running joke among the hardcore crypto-lawyer set.      One exception to this is the definition used by Vermont and California, the least-bad definition of a chain I’ve read so far. Those laws refer to “a mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized ledger or database.""      Simple, straight, to the point. I give California and Vermont a solid C-minus: the definition hits the high notes, but it also probably captures an instance of Postgres-XL that stores passwords as MD5 hashes. This is quite obviously not what the definition is supposed to do, but because it’s poorly drafted, that’s what it does.       Other states are far, far worse. Take, for example, Arizona's definition, which says “blockchain technology” is    ""a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless… protected with cryptography, is immutable and auditable and provides an uncensored truth.""    “Uncensored truth.” What the hell does that even mean? Anyone who has a passing familiarity with blockchains will know that blockchains can't guarantee an ""uncensored truth"" as they only show the transactions that validators committed to the chain. If censorship happened, we’re not going to find out about it, because it isn’t going to be there. “Tamper-evident” would be a more accurate description.      Furthermore, not all blockchains are ledgers, just as not all databases are ledgers.      D minus, Arizona. See me after class.      Then there’s Colorado, which doesn’t define “blockchains” but, in a bill about state records, just refers to them in plain English. Simple, and, if put in front of a judge, it probably works. Colorado also gets points for the zany title of its blockchain-aware legislation: ""an Act Concerning the use of Cyber Coding Cryptology.""      Fabulous. A+.    The fact that Connecticut legislators felt the need to copy-paste other states' terrible definitions reveals only that they and legislators of other states have absolutely no clue what they're doing.    Connecticut — my home state — gets a solid F for its latest effort. The short story here is that someone managed to convince a member of the state house to introduce a bill that would abolish non-compete clauses in employment contracts where a ""blockchain"" company was one of the counterparties.      If you wish to see my testimony on the bill you may find it in full here. Apart from being very anti-business, the bill also proposes a definition of ""blockchain"" so broad that it would capture practically any contract with any employee of any company that employs distributed software architecture of any kind.      It defines ""Blockchain Technology"" as a    ""distributed ledger technology that uses a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless and that may include the use of electronic currencies or electronic tokens as a medium of electronic exchange”.    If you recognize this, it’s because you have seen something very close to it before in Arizona (and Rhode Island, New York, Tennessee and Michigan, among others). The fact that this definition is the law in Arizona doesn’t mean it’s correct.      A blockchain, as any informed person will tell you, is a hash-linked chain of blocks. If we wanted to be a little more specific, we might say “a hash linked chain of blocks that usually (a) uses digital signatures to authenticate transactions, (b) P2P networking protocols to communicate those transactions and (c) Merkle trees to render the transaction log tamper-evident.”      The Connecticut bill doesn’t do this. It continues by defining ""Distributed Ledger Technology"" as a critter which    may include supporting infrastructure, including blockchain technology, that uses a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, whether public or private, permissioned or permissionless, and that may include the use of electronic currencies or electronic tokens as a medium of electronic storage.”    This definition is both duplicative and incorrect.      Not all distributed databases are distributed ledgers, despite the fact that this bill treats them as one and the same on a plain English reading. Not all distributed systems are ""decentralized,"" either, despite the fact that the bill defines a blockchain system as ""distributed and decentralized."" Similarly, not all blockchain systems are decentralized.      The term “decentralized” itself lacks a uniform and concrete definition in both (a) industry and (b) under any law in any jurisdiction of these United States or indeed the world. “Decentralized” is an adjective, like “fluffy” or “happy,” and the word has no place in laws deciding what software should or should not be regulated by the government.      “Why should we care?” I hear you ask.      Well, the problem with a sloppy and overbroad definition is that sloppy definitions lead to sloppy and overbroad application on businesses that the drafters didn’t intend to capture.      Second, the fact that Connecticut legislators felt the need to copy-paste other states' terrible definitions reveals only that they and legislators of other states have absolutely no clue what they're doing. It’s like stealing an answer key to a test, only stealing the wrong key: if everyone makes the same mistakes, everyone’s probably cheating.      Third and finally, banning non-compete clauses in employment contracts for software firms is a great way to ensure that software firms stay out of your state, and Connecticut needs all the jobs it can get.      Summing up, state legislatures have proved only one thing with bills that define “blockchain” incorrectly: that they don’t understand the technology. Accordingly they shouldn’t be writing laws that regulate it.      Legislators passing “blockchain” laws should keep it simple in the operative text, add necessary context in the preamble, rely on the Golden Rule of statutory interpretation — that is, follow the literal meaning of the words in a statute, except where the result would be absurd — in case of disputes and leave it at that.      If states want to promote the use of blockchain tech, they need to be advised by people who possess a solid technical understanding of what they're trying to legislate, the commercial issues involved in deploying that technology, how to speak clearly about both of those things, and who are independent and disinterested.      If the current laws on the books are any indication, the states have a lot of work to do.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Preston J.
