42429528,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzQth,1534194904,EU Lawmaker Wants to Include ICOs in New Crowdfunding Rules,"A draft proposal by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs suggests creating new regulations for public initial coin offerings (ICOs), according to a document published Friday.  Ashley Fox, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) representing the United Kingdom, wrote a draft report on proposed regulations for Europe's crowdfunding platform operators and companies. Work on crowdfunding regulations has been ongoing since last year, with a formal proposal from the European Commission (the EU's executive branch) coming in March with the mandate of developing a framework on ""crowd and peer-to-peer finance.""  According to Fox's note accompanying the legislative language for the proposal, the framework provides an opportunity to regulate token sales.  ""This Regulation gives the opportunity to ICOs that want to prove their legitimacy to comply with the requirements of this regulation. Whilst this regulation may not provide the solution for regulating the ICO market, it takes a much-needed step towards imposing standards and protections in place for what is an excellent funding stream for tech start-ups,"" he wrote.  The report states that crowdfunding service providers ""should be permitted to raise capital through their platforms using certain cryptocurrencies."" However, while ICOs ""offer new and innovative ways of funding,"" they can also be used to ""generate substantial market, fraud and cybersecurity risks to investors.""  The proposed regulation appears only to apply to public sales that raise less than 8 million euros, stating:  ""...crowdfunding service providers that wish to offer an ICO through their platform, should comply with specific additional requirements under this Regulation. However, private placements, ICOs raising in excess of 8,000,000 [euros] or ICOs that do not use a counterparty do not fall within the scope of those requirements.""  These new rules would require platforms to create a cap for crowdfunding efforts and follow certain securities laws, according to the document.  Fox emphasized the importance of providing some regulatory guidelines for the space, noting that ""at present initial coin offerings are operating in an unregulated space and consumers are at risk from fraudulent activity taking place in this market.""  While Fox published a draft proposal last week, he also wrote that he ""believes that a number of changes should be introduced to improve the proposal,"" adding that ""this regulation is an opportunity to provide regulation for initial coin offerings.""

42381084,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93nhp,1534176044,Bitt Inks Blockchain Deal With Another Caribbean Central Bank,"Barbados-based blockchain startup Bitt is partnering with the Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten (CBCS) to look into issuing a central bank-backed digital currency for the two nations.  Bitt, a portfolio company of Overstock's Medici Ventures, said Monday that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the central bank for the Dutch Caribbean island Curaçao and Netherlands constituent country Sint Maarten earlier this month. The goal of the deal is to jointly examine the possibility of issuing a digital Curaçao and Sint Maarten guilder to replace the current Netherlands Antillean guilder.  The project will focus in part on testing know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) technology, according to statements.  CBCS acting president Leila Matroos-Lasten said the bank signed the MOU with Bitt ""due to this company's regional experience in digital payments and its macroeconomic views.""  She added:  ""The central bank is determined to address its challenges proactively by exploring the latest technology available, for example, to reduce the level of cash usage within the monetary union, and to facilitate more secure, more AML and KYC compliant and more efficient financial transactions within and between Curaçao and Sint Maarten.""  The MOU signifies that the bank recognizes the potential improvements that technology can bring, she added.  ""The CBCS ... is committed to exploring solutions regarding the efficiency of cross-jurisdictional transactions and digital payments whilst ensuring compliance and security assurances obtained by these state of the art [fintech] solutions,"" Matroos-Lasten was quoted as saying. ""This would be beneficial to everyone.""  The news comes a few months after Bitt signed a similar MOU with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, a central banking institution that covers Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  That trial may be used to develop new digital payment and settlement systems, and if successful, could ultimately help the bank issue a cryptocurrency of its own, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

42381096,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93nvf,1534173617,Bitcoin Price Hits 7-Month High Against Turkish Lira,"Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to seven-month highs against Turkey's national currency, the lira (TRY), on Monday.  The price spike comes after the U.S. imposed sanctions against Turkey on Friday for continuing to hold an American pastor in custody.  The resultant economic shock-wave has seen the lira drop to a new lifetime low of 7.20 TRY against the U.S. dollar today, after already having dropped 27 percent last week. On a year-to-date basis, the lira is down more than 80 percent against the greenback.  The crash in the lira looks very likely to be increasing bitcoin's proposition as a safe-haven asset in Turkey, and the price of the cryptocurrency shot up to 47,192 TRY earlier today – the highest level since January 21, according to Bitfinex data. At press time, the figure had dropped slightly to around 44,000 TRY.  Since August 8, BTC has appreciated against the lira by 31 percent and is also up by 67 percent from the June 24 low of 26,337 TRY. By comparison, the cryptocurrency's U.S. dollar-denominated exchange rate is up just 12 percent from its low of $5,755 seen on June 24.  BTC/TRY chart  So what's behind the sudden appeal of bitcoin for Turkish investors?  The sharp slide in the lira has already pushed up inflation, which, along with a slump in spending power for TRY holders, has certainly boosted bitcoin's appeal as a store of value.  The increased interest is evident from the fact that Turkish cryptocurrency exchanges Paribu, Btcturk, and Koinim have witnessed a spike in trading volumes since Friday. As of writing, Paribu is reporting a 100 percent rise in trading volumes for the BTC/TRY trading pair.  Looking forward, BTC could well rise further against the lira, as Turkey's President Erdogan continues to oppose interest rate hikes to stabilize the currency and, rather than backing down, has referred to the President Trump's decision to impose sanctions on Turkish steel and aluminum as an ""attack"" on its economy.

42381083,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93nfJ,1534168807,Former S&P President Leads Seed Round for ICO Compliance Startup,"Regtech and compliance startup iComply has just completed a seed funding round led by former Standard and Poor's president Deven Sharma.  The firm – which seeks to develop standard compliance tools and services for other blockchain startups and in particular those which launch initial coin offerings or ICOs – announced Monday that it raised a seven-figure number during the round, although it did not provide an exact figure. DMG Blockchain and Block X Capital also participated in the round.  In its announcement, iComply also revealed that former CFTC official Jeff Bandman, former Nasdaq and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) executive Manny Alicandro, MIT fellow Praveen Mandal and attorney Thomas Linder have joined the startup as advisers.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Sharma said he chose to invest in iComply specifically because of the startup's ""focus on compliance and risk services for ICOs."" Compliance, he said, will help ease regulator concerns by providing transparency into ICO issuers.  Sharma also believes that the firm can aid adoption by supporting traditional financial services firms looking into the technology.  ""My interest is to see iComply evolve into a benchmark that investors can use to assess credibility of issuers, sustainability of underlying services and the price of ICOs,"" he said.  The startup's founder and chief executive, Matthew Unger, said in a statement that new ICOs and exchanges will have to answer to regulators including FINRA, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, among others.  As such, he said, ""iComply's patent-pending software enables both security and utility tokens to monitor and document compliance, governance and risk procedures, before a public blockchain executes an immutable trade, providing trust, integrity and transparency for our clients.""  Sharma explained that new tools like blockchain still need transparency to build investor confidence. Doing so, he said, ""will allow for more growth of innovative ways of raising funds and investment – I see iComply as a critical component of making the entire ICO space more successful, because it provides the confidence.""  The concepts of transparency and trust, he said, were what sparked his interest in blockchain to begin with.  That said, Sharma said he has yet to invest in any token sales, telling CoinDesk:  'There have been a few ICOs that had a fundamentally robust offering that I understood and did interest me [but I] missed the opportunity. Others that have transparency from a service like iComply, I would [invest in].""

After roughly four-and-a-half months on its Rinkeby test network, the startup will be moving to ethereum for its full live launch. The firm claims to provide a censorship-resistant, accessible social network for users, especially those in potentially authoritarian nations, according to a press release.  The platform already sees around 500,000 daily page views, CEO Bill Ottman told CoinDesk. The platform also claims roughly 1.25 million registered users, about 75 percent of whom have already earned test tokens. These users will be eligible to receive the platform's live token via a free ""airdrop"" distribution as a result.  ""We expect an overall increase in transactions, both on-chain and off-chain, due to the activation of token withdrawals, purchases and rewards,"" he said.  Ottman continued to say that the team had engineered a ""hybrid on-chain, off-chain model"" to ensure that the system can handle the volume Minds is seeing and to provide a simple user experience for crypto newcomers.  The on-chain and off-chain model will also help the platform handle large user volumes without congesting the ethereum network, according to the company.  Users can pay tokens to ensure a greater number of people see their posts, or earn tokens by interacting with content. Users can also use it to pay creators directly and subscribe to premium content.  Ottman said the use case has been popular on the testnet, predicting that the decentralized platform will become one of the more popular apps on ethereum as a result of the launch.  The CEO anticipated few issues ahead, saying ""the only disruption will be a 24-hour pause in [peer-to-peer] transfers between users via our Wire and Boost features ... this is necessary only to ensure the airdrop to our beta users accurately reflects their prior token balance of earnings thus far.""

A convincing break above that key resistance level would validate the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by a bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence over the weekend, and could be a springboard on to a stronger rally toward $6,850.  That could still be a tough task, though, as the downward sloping (bearish) 50-candle moving average (MA) is currently located at $6,580, while the 100-candle MA is soon set to cross the 200-candle MA from above in favor of the bears.  As a result, a repeated failure to take out trendline resistance could shift focus back to bearish MAs and weaken the bull case.  Hourly chart        BTC created an inverse head-and-shoulders-like pattern on the hourly chart over the weekend and cleared the neckline hurdle earlier today, adding credence to the bullish RSI divergence seen in the 4-hour chart.  The bullish breakout has opened up upside toward $6,850 (target as per the measured height method).  View  BTC will likely find acceptance above the falling trendline hurdle of $6,480 and extend the corrective rally from the six-week low of $6,000 to $6,850 in a day or two.  Bull failure to take out the falling trendline resistance in the next few hours could prove costly and yield a re-test of $6,162 (support as per the hourly chart). A violation there would expose $6,000 (February low).  Acceptance below $6,000 would revive the bearish view and shift risk in favor of a drop to $5,755 (June lows).

42381091,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93no7,1534147228,"Where Roads Can't Reach, Blockchain Drones Just Might Travel","A metal frame with four small and two large propellers – carrying a container the size of a refrigerator – rises into the air with a roar, hovering above an empty road amidst snowy fields.  The video was shot on the airfield near the Russian city of Kazan, which is located to the south-east of Moscow, and the machine is a SKYF drone, designed by a team of Russian aviation engineers.  According to its makers, the drone can carry up to 880 pounds, travel as far as 220 miles and work up to 8 hours. And everything that happens to these drones is going to be recorded on the project's own blockchain, SKYFchain.  The SKYF team is trying to crack into a rapidly growing ecosystem, with PwC valuing the emerging global market for drones at over $127 billion in 2016. As of today, drones can only carry small objects, but the SKYF team aims to open a totally new market for heavy-duty cargo drones.  The idea is that they'll serve multiple purposes, such as delivering large amounts of cargo, fighting fires and spraying insecticides and fertilizers on agricultural lands.  SKYF is a decidedly Russian project. The drones are being produced domestically by OKB Aviareshenia Ltd., a subsidiary of British entity ARDN Technologies. Both entities were founded by the same team of engineers and tech entrepreneurs: Aleksander Timofeev and Ilya Rodin – managing partners of the FPI venture fund – engineers Dmitry Arsentyev, Marat Sabirov and Nail Zinnurov, and others.  To financially support the project, the team is holding an initial coin offering (ICO). In February, Skyfdrones Services OU, a company registered in Estonia by Alexander Timofeev, registered the token sale with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Form D (Rule 506(c)) exemption, declaring a goal to raise $30 million.  Recently, this plan was adjusted – thus far, the project has managed to raise around $6 million, and they plan to raise some $500,000 more before the end of the ICO. Timofeev told CoinDesk that 45 percent of the funds will be spent on R&D.  Trusted delivery  According to Ilya Rodin, SKYF's GR manager, the use of blockchain in this context is aimed at creating a trust layer between stakeholders, including public and private sector interests.  ""We need a blockchain to create trust between the counterparts: the banks, leasing and insurance companies, drone manufacturers and users, government agencies, licensing bodies, self-regulating organizations, and so on,"" Rodin told CoinDesk.  The idea is that the data being stored will encompass various pieces of information about the drones. This includes information about what licenses the manufacturers possess, the drones' flight paths, their performance and data on the people operating them.  ""Drones are a new thing, banks don't know how to evaluate them and calculate interest rates for them, how to monitor their use,"" added Olga Budnik, a PR director of ARDN. ""So they would rather deny a loan or a leasing agreement than take a risk. And we give them a tool to follow the entire life of a drone.""  The idea for the startup came about in 2014, when Dmitry Arsentyev was trying to create a flying motorbike – but in the end, he wound up working on an industrial drone with Sabirov and Zinnurov. Soon after, they got investment and support from FPI back in 2014, Inc. magazine wrote.  ""Initially, the guys had a prototype of a self-piloting flying taxi,"" Alexander Timofeev explained. ""We realized that the system was new and viable, but we convinced them to transform it into an unmanned cargo platform.""  Timofeev believes that drone delivery will be in demand in the areas with bad road infrastructure. This is especially the case in places like northern Russia and the banks of large Siberian rivers, where bridges are far apart from one another and getting from one side to the other using road vehicles means miles of extra driving.  Putting drones to work  Even though things are in the early stage, the startup is pushing ahead with its ambitious plans for its blockchain-connected fleet.  At the heart of the project is the token, which the team says will serve a key role in managing the fleet.  ""From the start of SKYFchain the SKYF drone autopilot will require authorization in the SKYFchain to lift off,"" the project's white paper states.  ARDN has manufactured three drones so far, but the plan is that, by 2021, there will be more than 1100 SKYF drones operating worldwide. Looking farther, the aim is for other manufacturers of air-borne, sea-borne, and ground-borne cargo drones to join the SKYFchain network.  And within that time, the project's backers hope to see as many as 12.5 million transactions made on their purpose-built blockchain.  What's more, company has already secured partnerships with Vietnamese port ITC, a Chinese delivery company ZTO Express and a number of Russian entities, including agricultural, delivery and oil and gas companies, as well as the Department of Transportation of the Far East region of Khabarovsk, ARDN says.  The parties involved have signed preliminary agreements to test the SKYF drones for possible applications in their businesses.

According to a media report from Bangkok Post on Monday, a group approached and solicited Finnish businessman Aarni Otava Saarimaa in June 2017 over investment in several Thai stocks, a casino in Macau and a new cryptocurrency called Dragon Coin.  The group claimed that upon issuance, Dragon Coin could be used at the casino, the report said. They also brought Saarimaa to the Macau casino in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of the project. Saarimaa, who bought into the scheme, transferred a total of 5,564 bitcoins to the group, the report indicted.  Having seen no returns months after the investment, Saarimaa filed a complaint to Thailand's Crime Suppression Division (CSD) in January, together with his local business partner who believed the investment plan was a scam.  The CSD subsequently launched an investigation and alleged in the report that the group did not make any investments for Saarimaa, but instead liquidated all the bitcoins into Thai baht and deposited the funds into seven bank accounts.  Although it is unclear when the group sold the bitcoin assets, the CSD said the fraudsters made off with nearly 800 million baht, or around $24 million.  Following a months-long investigation, the CSD also suspected that the Thai film actor Jiratpisit ""Boom"" Jaravijit was involved in the plan and arrested him last Wednesday.  The CSD further alleged that the actor's sibling Prinya Jaravijit is suspected to be the ""ringleader"" of the scheme and has left Thailand for the U.S. via South Korea.

42381094,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93nt9,1534132819,"In Rare Decision, ICO Founders Will Delay Crypto Paydays – For a Decade","In an industry that's become synonymous with fast cash, patience can be a rare commodity.  That makes a little-discussed announcement last week by the Nebulas project, powered by the top 100 cryptocurrency NAS, all the more remarkable. The team behind the protocol, today valued at $64 million, will now voluntarily wait a decade before they can get their hands on the blockchains' tokens they'll earn for their labor – seven years longer than they had originally planned.  In December, the Beijing-based team raised $60 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) for a general purpose blockchain with additional features that they believe will accelerate development and market adoption. In the original token allocation, 20 percent of the initial supply (or 20 million NAS tokens) were set aside for the team and founders to be gradually released over a three-year period.  But based on a blog post published last week, the timelines for the token release are being extended considerably.  For the developer team, the start date for the gradual distribution of tokens will be postponed for a year, and for the founders of the network, the token distribution doesn't start for a full decade.  Its a move that's already winning nods of approval from an industry seeking to develop best practices. Ryan Selkis, founder of the token data source Messari, said that he believes a multi-year vesting schedule should become a standard for new token companies.  ""The best way to align founder incentives is with vesting schedules – could be time-based, many are starting to do this, or milestone-based,"" he wrote CoinDesk.  The Nebulas team has also committed to publishing the smart contract address holding the NAS tokens and will contract with a third-party auditor to verify their finances.  ""We are conscious that the construction and development of Nebulas still have a long way to go. We need to focus on Nebulas developing, including technology and ecosystem,"" Hitters Xu, a founder of Nebulas, told CoinDesk.  Echoing that, the project's marketing director, Becky Lu said, ""We just want our team to focus on our technical vision.""  She continued:  ""It's not an easy decision for everyone because the blockchain industry is a very innovative industry and still has a lot of risk. I think that shows our determination.""  Ranking dapps  Part of the reason behind the move, founders say, is the strength of the project's core idea, the mission of creating a blockchain ranking system that helps users elevate the best dapps, or decentralized applications.  ""It's like Google ranking in the blockchain world,"" Lu explained. ""There's a lot of data.""  By analyzing the interactions between smart contracts and addresses, Nebulas believes it can create a more sophisticated view of the blockchain's users. This mechanism could be helpful to entrepreneurs behind token projects, who have become more interested in sophisticated user targeting for their airdrops.  Speaking to that, Lu said of Nebulas: ""You can reach some people if you see they are your target audience.""  Or at least that's the goal.  Nebulas' mainnet went live the first quarter, but there are still several tools promised in the ICO that have not been completed: Nebulas Rank (a system for assessing entities on the blockchain based on activity), Nebulas Force (a way to upgrade the software on-chain) and Nebulas Incentive (providing dynamic to developers using Nebulas).  Developing dapps  According to the project's spokespeople, 6,900 dapps have already been built on the blockchain as it exists today.  From May to July, Nebulas ran an incentive program for developers, distributing in total 450,000 nas tokens to 1,472 different applications. Plus, the project continues to provide these incentives for new dapp development.  Still, those dapps will have some time before they see significant use, primarily because the project's token migration (moving from ethereum to its own blockchain) is still ongoing, and some users have run into roadblocks.  Since many of Nebulas' token holders are investors within the United States and the regulatory framework for crypto tokens is still very much uncertain, they have not been able to execute the swap on exchanges.  ""Originally, we thought the exchanges would be easier,"" Lu said.  Yet, that hasn't stopped the team from continuing development on tools that will one day help users interact with the protocol. For instance, the team is building a way for its wallet to allow users to execute the migration that way, instead of having to go through an exchange.  Speaking to the need for such a feature, Lu told CoinDesk:  ""In this bear market, some community members are very worried about token price.""  The nas token – which was sold for $2 each during the ICO – is currently trading at $1.41, according to CoinMarketCap.

42381092,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93npN,1534125643,Microsoft Looks to Trusted Computing for Blockchain Security Boost,"Two newly published patent applications from Microsoft suggest that the software giant is looking at the use of trusted execution environments, or TEEs, within its blockchain offerings.  According to information gathered from two filings published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Thursday, a TEE is specified to store ""a pre-determined type of blockchain or other security protocol code"" in a ""validation node.""  With this kind of data, a ""TEE attestation"" is able to verify participants of the system who possess matching information held within the node. In blockchain, a node is simply a point of connection able to receive, store and send data within the network.  And how all this might prove to be useful is explained in two ways.  First  , a TEE may assist in the establishment of a ""consortium blockchain network."" By setting up the first node of the blockchain to store ""a pre-determined membership list"" among other pieces of information, a TEE attestation could be used to securely onboard members of the ""consortium network.""  Second  , a TEE may also assist in verifying blockchain transactions on a similar network in which multiple pre-authorized entities must interact. For example, using this process of attestation through programmed TEEs once more, certain encrypted transactions on the network could be processed and confirmed ""directly"" to the official state of the blockchain without any need for decryption.  The patent reads:  ""In some examples, the entire network accepts the transactions, including chaincode transactions, and blockchain states are directly updated. In some examples, there is no need for a copy of the transaction in order to confirm a block.""  Aside from these two use cases, both applications also give mention to the process of TEE attestation in context of a ""Confidential Consortium (COCO) Blockchain framework"" which would potentially allow more complex systems of verification requiring the consensus of a multiplicity of validation nodes.  While these filings were submitted by the licensing arm of the company as early back as June of last year, Microsoft has since began offering blockchain applications through its Azure platform. This month, it was announced Microsoft has updated additional features to the product specifically for clients working off of public blockchains such as ethereum.
