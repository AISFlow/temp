42428869,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeYXh,1523995219,Amazon Sees Bitcoin Use Case in Data Marketplaces,"Amazon has won a patent for a streaming data marketplace that could allow subscribers to receive real-time cryptocurrency transaction data.  The patent describes a system in which individuals and organizations can put streaming data feeds up for sale, to which customers can then subscribe. It was granted to Amazon Technologies, a subsidiary of the e-commerce and cloud computing giant, on Tuesday.  Adding on to that base, the filing says, developers could ""build real-time dashboards, capture exceptions and generate alerts, drive recommendations, and make other real-time business or operational decisions.""  Amazon's filing lists a number of potential use cases for the marketplace, including ""web site click-streams, marketing and financial information, manufacturing instrumentation and social media, operational logs, metering data and so forth"" – yet it includes one notable use case focused on the cryptocurrency market.  It argues that individual data streams may not be so valuable on their own, using bitcoin and cryptocurrency transaction data as an example. Yet by combining this data with information from additional sources, ""the data stream may become more valuable.""  The patent states:  ""For example, a group of electronic or internet retailers who accept bitcoin transactions may have a shipping address that may correlate with the bitcoin address. The electronic retailers may combine the shipping address with the bitcoin transaction data to create correlated data and republish the combined data as a combined data stream.""  The filing also mentions the marketplace's potential appeal to law enforcement.  ""For example, a law enforcement agency may be a customer and may desire to receive global bitcoin transactions, correlated by country, with ISP data to determine source IP addresses and shipping addresses that correlate to bitcoin addresses,"" Amazon wrote. ""The agency may not want additional available enhancements such as local bank data records. The streaming data marketplace may price this desired data out per GB (gigabyte), for example, and the agency can start running analytics on the desired data using the analysis module.""  If Amazon decides to build the marketplace out, the centralized offering could pose a competitive threat to startups who are building similar yet more decentralized marketplaces.  Henri Pihkala, CEO of Streamr – one of the startups in question – told CoinDesk in an email that ""data marketplaces aren't a new idea,"" but that ""what is novel, is creating a space that finally gives users ultimate control over the data they create through their actions in the digital realm.""  ""If that's Amazon's ultimate vision, then bravo, but something might suggest it's not in the company's DNA to think like that,"" he added.

The messaging app's creator announced Tuesday in his Telegram channel that he had created bitcoin grants for administrators running virtual private networks (VPNs) and other proxy services to allow users access to the platform after the Russian government blacklisted Telegram for refusing to share private messages. That ban went into effect last week, and as reported this week by local media outlets, the government is doing all it can – such as blocking millions of IP addresses – in an attempt to stop people from using Telegram.  While losing Russia-based users – estimated at 7 percent of Telegram's total base – would not have a long-term negative impact on the app, Durov said ""it is important for me personally to make sure we do everything we can for our Russian users.""  He explained:  ""I started giving out bitcoin grants to individuals and companies who run socks5 proxies and VPN. I am happy to donate millions of dollars this year to this cause, and hope that other people will follow. I called this Digital Resistance – a decentralized movement standing for digital freedoms and progress globally.""  The decision came after internet service providers began banning Telegram on Monday, he said. Though it has been in place for more than 24 hours, the service has not seen any significant drop in usage, partly due to existing VPN and proxy services, and also because third-party cloud services which are allowing users to connect to the platform.  Telegram's ban may be lifted if the company turns over its encryption keys to the nation's security agencies, according to Durov. However, he added that ""we promised our users 100 [percent] privacy and would rather cease to exist than violate this promise.""  The company is notably raising funds in what could be the largest initial coin offering (ICO) to date. The company has reportedly collected $1.7 billion as of today and intends to create its own decentralized ecosystem using the funds, as previously reported.

The privacy-focused token ran into offers after the news hit the wires at 10:00 EST that Pornhub, the biggest website in the porn industry, would accept XVG as a mode of payment, officially putting an end to rumors of a breakthrough partnership that have been in the air since late March.  Developers had been doing their best to fan the flames, billing the announcement as one of the biggest cryptocurrency collaborations to ever hit the market, and investors responded by pouring money into XVG (buy the rumor), pushing it higher by more than 300 percent in the last two weeks.  Now that the partnership is officially confirmed, however, the token is taking a hit possibly due to profit taking (sell the fact).  As of writing, XVG is changing hands at $0.07 on Bittrex - down 30 percent from the intraday highs. The price chart analysis indicates rally from the March 18 low of $0.023 has topped out and XVG risks bearish reversal.  XVG Daily chart  XVG has created a bearish outside day candle (today's high and low engulf previous day's price action), signaling a temporary top is in place at $0.11810955.  That said, only a negative close (as per UTC) on Wednesday, preferably below the ascending trendline, would signal bearish reversal/bullish-to-bearish trend change.  View  A bearish reversal would open up downside towards $0.03 (Feb. 6 low).  A strong defense of the ascending trendline over the next few days would shift risk in favor of a re-test of $0.12 (today's high), although only a close above the said level would signal resumption of the bullish move.

42428852,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeUvh,1523968255,The Seven Pillars of ICO Investing,"Tim Enneking is managing director at Crypto Asset Management. Robert Brauer and Andrew Kang are members of the Crypto Asset Management ICO Analysis team.      The number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) is growing rapidly, having raised an astounding $5.6 billion in 2017 alone. More outrageous is that, by most estimates, over half of the ICOs launched in 2017 have already failed.  In addition to the hundreds of ICOs being launched every month, our management company Crypto Asset Management (CAM), also receives around a dozen emails per day from new companies planning on launching crypto tokens to raise capital. CAM, through the various funds and share classes it manages, invests in less than one out of every 100 ICOs that comes across its desk.  Out of absolute necessity, we have developed an analytical framework for ICOs, which CAM applies to every such opportunity it evaluates.  In this article we explain what we call The Seven Pillars Of ICO Investing™, which we’ve rigorously crafted over several years of investing in crypto and other assets.  Pillar #1: Team  The critical element which we are searching for is an experienced team, ideally with a strong track record in developing and launching blockchain technology. In addition, the team should have experience in the market it is targeting. A team that is not only competent, but capable of developing, completing and/or expanding the project is paramount to its success.  A couple of additional issues to consider are:  Does the team have a vesting token schedule that will properly incentivize it?  Do the advisors have the right experience and are they actively engaged?  Does the project have any notable financial backers? (VCs, other hedge funds, etc.)  Pillar #2: Idea  Without a compelling, realistic and timely idea for a blockchain-based enterprise, the investment will almost certainly fail.  A few of the key things we look for are:  Total addressable market: How large is the opportunity? We want as large of a market as possible (See: ethereum, filecoin).  Product-market fit: Does the business address an urgent problem? (0x, ChainLink)  Unique value proposition: What facets of the technology enable it to stand out from the competition? How much competition is there (Wax)? Ideally, the token has proprietary technology, and as little competition as possible (Orchid Protocol).  There is clearly an interrelationship between Pillars 1 and 2. However, if we had to choose between them, we would clearly rather invest in an “A” team working on a “B” idea than a “B” team working on an “A” idea.  A talented group of people are the lifeblood of any business, and crypto is no different.  Pillar #3: Execution  In the cut-throat business world we live in, the only thing that matters is results.  A brilliant idea and great team are nice, but execution is everything. Is there a working prototype or does your idea only exist in a nebulously written white paper? We prefer to invest in a product that already exists to some degree (Presearch, Basic Attention Token, Superbloom, FunFair), whether in the crypto space or analogously in the fiat space (Wax).  Finally, we look for some sort of proof that the company will be able to hit future milestones.  Pillar #4: Legal/Regulatory  This pillar is essential given the current and growing regulatory uncertainty in the industry.  Almost every week, there is news of a governmental agency in one country or another taking regulatory action or making a new statement around ICO governance. Of course, almost as often, there is news of a different country considering crypto-favorable legislation. Comprehensive regulation in many marketplaces is on the horizon and it is imperative to ensure that ICOs vigilantly navigate the landscape to the best of their abilities.  The threshold issue is jurisdiction: in what country is or will the ICO company be incorporated and the ICO executed? This determines the rules that will apply to the company’s actions and the ICO.  Depending on the approach taken, we may apply the somewhat arcane rules of the Howey test (in the US or if US investors are targeted or allowed to invest), KYC/AML principles (which are essentially universal) and applicable securities law.  Pillar #5: Tokenization  A significant number of the ICOs we analyze do not actually need the blockchain, tokenization or a public sale of their tokens to be successful.  When this is an issue, it is usually the last - public sale - which is not necessary. (NASDAQ’s settlement system is an excellent example of where tokenization is a brilliant idea but a public market would be superfluous, or even counterproductive.) Also, they are sometimes glorified apps that could be built without creating a specific token, despite how much “utility” the founders may claim their token provides.  With the enormous amount of value exchanging hands over the blockchain and the prospect of getting “free” money without giving up any equity, it’s not hard to imagine why many industrious entrepreneurs try to identify any possible reason to launch an ICO.  That being said, one of the crucial things that every investment we make must have is a legitimate reason for “tokenizing” their business, and for creating a public market for that token (OmiseGo, Icon, Raiden Network, Cosmos).  Pillar #6: ICO Structure  Similar to traditional venture capital investing, the financial underpinnings of the deal ultimately determine the decision to invest. The characteristics of an ICO can have important implications on the expected upside of the token.  This can be split out into two categories - ICO mechanics and ICO deal structure.  ICO Mechanics – Historically, ICOs with a lower hard cap tend to outperform ICOs with massive hard caps. While it is important that the parent companies be well funded and have sufficient runway to work with, ICOs need to have a convincing plan for use of proceeds as the potential upside decreases in proportion to the amount raised. The precise metric here is valuation of the token economy - a derivation of the hard cap. Both the valuation in light of circulating tokens at launch and the valuation upon release of all tokens are factors that we consider.  ICO Deal Structure – The deal should be structured in a way so that investors are not at a disadvantageous position to the market.These are a few of our considerations:  Distribution: The team should have a compelling structure for the distribution of tokens, fair allocation among team/advisors and investors, programs for market uptake, etc.  Distribution Schedule: Given the fast-moving pace of the crypto market, the distribution schedule should not massively favor specific parties. While long distribution periods can be considered acceptable for high-potential ICOs, individual liquidity preferences should be considered.  Discounts: Discounts are ubiquitous in the ICO environment, so examining the discount levels given to different tranches allows investors to understand where they stand in relation to other stakeholders.  Equity Stakes: At Crypto Asset Management, we like to be part of the growth of the company and investing directly into the equity of a company allows us to play a greater role in that development. In the world of token sales and short-term liquidity, people often forget that the value proposition of a company can be just as great or even greater than the token ecosystem it is developing.        Pillar #7: Price Drivers  Even if we believe a team is able to create a great product that incorporates a token with an imperative use case, this does not necessarily mean that we will want to hold the token or invest in the ICO. A token must additionally have a mechanism to drive price appreciation.  A token with constant supply without any incentive to hold, will not be subject to buying pressure which significantly outweighs selling pressure over the long run (Votes). This is underpinned by the concept of price risk, in which individuals will lean towards reducing their exposure to price volatility in favor of fiat or a form of stable currency. (Kyle Samani has written an in-depth piece on this velocity problem here.)  A few of the price drivers we look for include:  Network Volume: In almost every instance the value of a token increases as the number of transactions on the blockchain increases (bitcoin, ethereum). This is one of the most basic, yet influential, indicators of demand, and is also the reason we invest primarily in protocols rather than dapps.  Market Leadership: We look to invest only in tokens that are clear market leaders, or have the potential to be in the near future. Usually, these tokens have a distinct and growing unique advantage over their competition (Practical VR).  Incentives to Hold: There is a clear reason why a user would rather hold than spend the token, which can be related specifically to speculated price increases or other non-monetary rewards (Presearch, PROPS). We won’t invest in a token that’s only purpose is a medium of exchange.  Supply Changes: This can include limiting inflation, meaning the token supply does not dilute the value of all tokens over time, or token burning, where the supply of tokens in the system decreases over time (Binance Coin, Iconomi).  Profit Sharing: Part of the value that is extracted from the system is given back to the token holders (Augur, NEO, Neon Exchange, Ethorse).  Staking: Having users of a network to lock up their tokens either for network consensus or as a requirement in certain processes. (Bee Network, Open Platform, NuCypher, Video Coin).  Sufficient Liquidity: If the project isn’t proactive about getting listed on multiple exchanges, preferably top-tier exchanges, we will likely not make an investment.  Please note that, as a general rule, we are not in favor of asset-backed tokens as an investment vehicle at this time. There are no real drivers of price formation after an initial, relatively small boost for convenience (Sandcoin, OneGram) and the opportunity cost is consequently too high (there are far greater returns elsewhere).  Importantly, the effect of implementing strong incentives to hold is multiplicative. Not only will the price increase be driven by the inherent tokenomics design, but also by speculation directly related to the implementation of these drivers.  Despite the incredible number of fly-by-night operations in the world of ICOs, it is certain that token generation events are here to stay. Such events are completely transforming the traditional venture capital industry and, for savvy investors, are creating fortunes literally overnight. For unsophisticated or undisciplined investors, ICOs are a minefield that should probably be avoided. However, for those who perform proper due diligence, the odds increase for realizing breathtaking returns on your investments.  This article is an abbreviated summary of our process for investing in ICOs.  Here at Crypto Asset Management, we’ve also developed more in-depth tools, such as our innovative 64-point ICO Scorecard and a more traditional Private Equity Due Diligence Checklist.

42428856,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeV7h,1523966419,Crypto Hedge Funds Face Tough Choices on Tax Day,"Jon P. Brose  is a partner and Brett R. Cotler is an associate in the blockchain and cryptocurrency practice at the law firm of Seward & Kissel.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      Like so much else in cryptocurrency taxation, the rules for crypto funds – pooled investment vehicles that seek above-market returns from digital asset investments – are far from straightforward.  In some instances, a tax law concept may include (or not include) crypto assets as securities or commodities for tax purposes. In other instances, existing interpretation of U.S. tax law predates the advent of cryptocurrency (thus not considering unique characteristics of crypto as an asset class).  Such discrepancies may lead to non-intuitive outcomes for crypto funds. Here's a quick overview.  US investors  U.S. investors in crypto funds (other than tax-exempt investors) will typically invest in domestic partnerships or LLCs. Onshore funds could stand alone but could also be part of larger structures, incorporating one or more entities accommodating tax-exempt and non-U.S. investors (e.g., mini-master, master-feeder and side-by-side structures).  As partnerships, onshore crypto funds are generally not subject to tax, but rather their investors are taxed on the funds’ profits. Each year, investors receive “K-1s” reporting their respective shares of the crypto fund’s items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit for the prior year, regardless of whether profits were distributed.  Investors may be limited when claiming certain deductions or losses, including passive activity losses, business losses, business and investment interest expenses, and miscellaneous itemized deductions, which are currently non-deductible (including for alternative minimum tax purposes).  In addition, crypto funds should restrict withdrawal rights or limit the number of investors to avoid classification as publicly-traded partnerships, which are taxable as corporations. Unlike partnerships, corporations are taxed on their income, and shareholders, on distributions.  Funds that do not limit withdrawal rights or number of investors rely on the “qualifying income” test to avoid publicly-traded partnership classification. It is unclear whether 90 percent of a crypto fund’s income would be “qualifying income” to avoid publicly-traded partnership classification.  If crypto funds allow investors to contribute cryptocurrency (rather than fiat) when subscribing for fund interests, investors may be required to recognize gain (but not loss) on the contribution. If contributions in-kind can be made tax free, crypto funds must track the contributors’ bases in the contributed cryptocurrency and allocate any pre-contribution gains or losses to such investors.  Investor or trader?  Different U.S. federal income tax rules apply to investors, traders and dealers. Generally, dealers make a market in an asset class by being willing to buy and sell assets at certain prices, profiting from bid-ask spreads. Most crypto funds will not be dealers.  Crypto funds will be traders if their trading activities are substantial, seeking to profit from short-term market swings (rather than ""hodling"" for long-term appreciation). In determining a fund’s status as a trader, relevant factors include the total number of trades in a year, frequency of trading activity, and portfolio turnover.  Unlike traders, investors are not engaged in a trade or business. Crypto funds that are not traders in crypto will be investors.  Classifying crypto funds as traders or investors affects whether expenses (other than investment interest expenses) of the funds are deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Traders in commodities, which may include crypto for this purpose, can elect to mark-to-market their open commodities positions (other than those identified as held for investment) at the end of each year, recognizing gains or losses as ordinary income or losses. Funds with significant mismatches between long-term capital gains and short-term capital losses may want to make this election, since recognition of short-term capital losses may be limited.  In addition, crypto futures that are “1256 contracts” and remain open at year end must be marked-to-market. Any gains or losses will be treated as 60 percent long-term capital gains and 40 percent short-term capital gains.  This tax treatment carries through to the general partner as part of their carried interests. However, straddle rules might delay recognition of losses if crypto funds hold, for example, crypto long and crypto futures short.  Other investors  Non-U.S. persons and tax-exempt investors in crypto funds will typically invest in an offshore corporation formed in a no- or low-tax jurisdiction.  Offshore funds will either invest into a master fund (master-feeder), into an onshore fund (mini-master) or alongside an onshore fund (side-by-side). Unless an offshore fund’s activities is limited to certain investments, the offshore fund (but not its investors) may be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent the offshore fund is engaged in a U.S. trade or business.  Generally, offshore funds will not be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business if the funds only buy and sell stocks, securities and certain commodities for their own account (and certain other requirements are met). These are known as the “securities trading safe harbor” and the “commodities trading safe harbor.” For purposes of the securities trading safe harbor, securities generally means debt instruments.  For purposes of the commodities trading safe harbor, the commodities must be “of a kind” that is customarily dealt in on an organized (i.e. CFTC-regulated) exchange and the transaction is “of a kind” customarily consummated at such place. For this purpose, “commodities” generally means commodities in the ordinary financial sense. The CFTC, which generally regulates commodities markets, has stated that cryptocurrencies are commodities.  The commodities trading safe harbor may apply to crypto trading if the crypto is “of a kind” that is customarily dealt in on an organized commodities exchange. Currently, only bitcoin futures are traded on an organized exchange. While non-U.S. persons’ bitcoin trading activity in the U.S. should fall within the commodities trading safe harbor, it is not entirely clear if trading other cryptocurrencies (e.g., ethereum, litecoin and altcoins) come within the commodities trading safe harbor.

42428855,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeV3h,1523964324,Cryptocurrency Exchange Kraken to Shutter Services in Japan,"San Fransisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has announced it is shutting its doors for investors in Japan.  According to a statementhttps://support.kraken.com/hc/ja/articles/360000570486 released on Tuesday, the company said it will cease to provide exchange services to Japanese residents, with a planned cutoff date for final withdrawals penciled in for the end of June.

While the company put the decision down to ""the costs and resources required to maintain service,"" it's notable that the exchange is currently not among trading platforms registered with the Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan's financial watchdog.  Kraken's move to bar Japanese investors comes at a time when the FSA is beefing up efforts to scrutinize exchanges offering services in the country following the hack of $530 million-worth of the NEM cryptocurrency from the Coincheck exchange in January.

The strategic round was led by Founders Fund, and included the participation of Andreessen Horowitz and Pantera Capital. Existing Harbor investors Craft Ventures, Vy Capital and Valor Equity Partners, as well as Future Perfect Ventures, 1confirmation, Abstract Holdings and Signia Venture Partners also took part in the round.  Harbor CEO Joshua Stein, told CoinDesk that the company will use the funding to further develop its ethereum-based R-Token platform, which he said provides for ""compliance at the token level.""  In practice, this means that the protocol tokenizes real-world assets and uses ethereum smart contracts to ensure that investors can execute trades only if they satisfy pertinent regulations, such as know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements.  The company also intends to direct funds toward the expansion of its team.  ""We've had so much inbound interest from folks from different asset classes seeking to tokenize what they're doing,"" Stein said in an interview. ""Now we need to build out the team and the platform and the protocol to be able to handle that inbound interest.""  Stein suggested that Harbor was able to attract prominent investors in part because the company has gained significant traction since its inception.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There's literally tens of trillions of dollars of real-world assets that would benefit from the ownership interest being tokenized, and that can unlock tremendous economic value.""  Pantera Capital's Joey Krug echoed this point in statements.  ""With Harbor, we could see things like funds tokenizing LP interest for illiquid asset classes, marrying the liquidity of markets with the illiquidity of the underlying assets owned by the fund. The infrastructure Harbor is building will unlock a range of new possibilities for capital markets,"" he said.  Stein said Harbor's efforts to create liquidity will benefit the larger blockchain ecosystem, and that he's excited about the services and dapps emerging from the ethereum community.  ""By driving a whole bunch of economic value around the public blockchain ecosystem, we help drive all those different companies, providers and developers,"" he explained.

42428860,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeVFh,1523961039,Support Forming? Why $7.9K Is Bitcoin's New Price to Watch,"Bitcoin remains in a bullish territory for now and is looking at further gains, though a pullback is possible if support at $7,900 is breached, according to technical studies.  The cryptocurrency's first attempt to scale the long-term descending trendline (drawn from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) failed on Monday and prices fell below $8,000 as expected at 12:00 UTC.  It's worth noting that the Bollinger bands (seen on the chart below) show the volatility dropped after BTC dipped below the psychological mark, likely signaling indecision among the bears. As a result, it is not surprising the dip below $8,000 was short-lived.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,145 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, but could soon report further gains as the hourly Bollinger bands indicate scope for a retest of $8,400–$8,500.  Hourly chart  The Bollinger bands (+2 and -2 standard deviations from the 20-hour moving average) narrowed after the dip below $8,000, indicating the low volatility period – popularly known as a Bollinger band squeeze.  The 19-hour squeeze ended with a bullish breakout. Additionally, the hourly relative strength index (RSI) is above 50.00 and trending north, also indicating a bullish setup. So, BTC could have another attempt at breaching at the trendline resistance seen today at $8,420.  However, a failure to capitalize on the bullish Bollinger breakout could yield a drop below $7,900 (previous day's low). In such a case, BTC will likely test 4-hour 200 MA lined up at $7,690.  That said, the outlook as per the daily chart still remains bullish.  Daily chart  Only a daily close below $7,510 (double-bottom neckline/former resistance turned support) would abort the bullish view.  Meanwhile, a dip to $7,690 will likely find bids as the short-term momentum studies are biased bullish. The 5-day MA and the 10-day MA continue to slope upwards (bullish).  View  Bitcoin could revisit the descending trendline resistance seen today at $8,420. A daily close (as per UTC) above that level would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  On the downside, a move below $7,900 could yield a fruther drop to $7,690.  A daily close below $7,510 would signal the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 has ended.

Leila M. de Lima, a Philippines' opposition senator, urged her colleagues in the legislative house on Monday to allow ""swift passage"" of bills she has previously introduced that propose raising the penalties for crypto crimes to one degree higher than currently.  As reported by CoinDesk, the politician first moved forward with the bill (SB 1694) in March after noting the increasing difficulty of investigating crimes that make use of the anonymity-providing features of cryptocurrencies.  De Lima's latest call to speed up the passing of the bill, however, was prompted by a recent bitcoin fraud case in the Philippines that saw 900 million pesos ($50 million) apparently taken from more than 50 residents.  According to a statement from the Philippine National Police on April 10, the scheme's suspected organizers – Arnel Ordonio and his wife Leonady Ordonio – have been arrested for allegedly swindling the investors.      ""No matter how small or big a group, same punishment must be given. It should never be easy to escape after stealing the hard earned money of other people,"" de Lima said of the case.  To that effort, the senator is also urging the house to swiftly pass another bill (No. 959) that she introduced previously. The legislation, if passed, would reduce the criteria to qualify as a ""syndicated estafa"" crime from five to two perpetrators.  Under the current legal framework in the Philippines, syndicated estafa refers to scams that involve more than five individuals, who upon conviction, may be punished by life imprisonment or death.

A South Korean blockchain industry organization has proposed a self-regulatory framework to set standards for the cryptocurrency exchange industry.  In a press conference, Tuesday, the Korean Blockchain Association, formed in December 2017 by industry companies, has proposed rules that would mandate exchange members of the group to hold at least 2 billion Korean won ($1.8 million) in equity capital, in addition to filing financial statements and audit reports with the association.  Applicable to 14 cryptocurrency exchanges in the country, including Bithumb, Coinone, Gopax, OKCoin Korea and Huobi Korea, the new rules, when they come into effect, will also mandate that members store users' transaction records for five years, according to South Korea news agency Yonhap. Exchanges must also put systems in place to detect and report abnormal transactions.  The rules are being pursued as part of a wider industry effort to better implement anti-money laundering regulations put in place by the country's Financial Services Commission.  ""We will establish the order of the domestically cryptographic [exchange] market through self-regulatory review,"" said Jeon Jae-jin, chairman of the association. ""By providing a safeguard for the protection of users, we will contribute to ensuring the asset safety. ""  The move marks to self regulate the exchange industry in South Korea is also in line with with positions taken by domestic exchanges that had pledged to clean up the market.  To that end, the proposed rules also require each exchange to form a special committee to review the listing of new tokens issued through initial coin offerings (ICOs) with ethical charters in place to prevent insider trading.  In response to CoinDesk, OKCoin Korea said it is ""preparing to meet all the criteria, fully abiding [by] the new rules from KBA.""  Further, a Coinone representative said:  “We are definitely welcoming new self-regulation measures and thinking positive on this active movement to make reliable blockchain ecosystem. As part of this effort, Coinone has already set its internal organization and system to make transparency in trading of cryptocurrencies.”  According to Yonhap, the rules will be further finalized by end of next month, after which each exchange member will submit relevant documents by June 8.

42428851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeUth,1523948412,Bitcoin Merchant Adoption Might Just Be Accelerating In Asia,"Bitcoin isn't for payments?  While that may be the popular narrative of late, don't tell that to Bellatorra Skin Care, a luxury brand that has found the opposite as it's expanded internationally into markets such as China and India.  Not only is bitcoin (which has seen years of declining interest from merchants as the network bumped up against its limits) a sought-after choice for business-to-business (B2B) payments, but for retail payments, other cryptocurrencies are finding a foothold as well.  “We expanded our business internationally this past year, and have had strong demand [for cryptocurrency] from customers in markets such as China and India, where fiat cross-border transactions have inefficiencies,"" said Nathan Halsey, the CEO of Bellatorra, based in Beverly Hills, California.  Halsey told CoinDesk:  ""We have found cryptocurrency to be a viable solution for resolving these challenges, and we see other companies with international business adopting the same practices.”  Indeed, one of the early use cases highlighting bitcoin's innovation was cross-border payments where there were bottlenecks and high fees for transacting.  Bellatorra ran into these hurdles in Asian markets and says its wholesale customers began asking for the option of paying in bitcoin. So in July 2017, the company began a relationship with bitcoin merchant services provider BitPay.  ""We have completed multiple six-figure transactions, without an issue, and have settled funds from the time of customer payment to settling in U.S. dollars in our U.S. bank accounts in less than one business day,"" Halsey continued.  And according to BitPay CEO Stephen Pair, Bellatorra's experience in circumventing cumbersome traditional payments rails with crypto isn't uncommon. Cosmetic companies such as Nuciya Beauty in Canada have found that people tend to spend more per purchase when they use cryptocurrency.  As such, Bellatorra is looking into adopting other cryptocurrencies, and making them a bigger segment of their business, in the future.  “We are definitely pro-cryptocurrency as a payment option,” Halsey said, adding that the company has started holding onto small amounts of the cryptocurrencies it accepts instead of immediately cashing out.  Diversifying retail payments  For its retail customers, Bellatorra has already begun accepting litecoin and ether, ethereum's native cryptocurrency.  Since BitPay doesn't facilitate merchant payments in anything other than bitcoin and bitcoin cash, Bellatorra had to establish relationships with other processors to enable these cryptocurrency payments.  According to Halsey, using PayWithEther.com and GoUrl.io, Bellatorra garnered dozens of litecoin and ether payments from predominantly Asian customers spending roughly $300 to $1,000 per order.  While bitcoin's transaction fees have come down significantly over the past several months, the thought of high fees has caused some merchants to hedge, according to Jimmy Song, a well-respected developer and partner at Blockchain Capital.  Yet it's not only a hedge but also a way to solicit more sales, Song said.  Cryptocurrency trading has seen huge amounts of adoption in Asian markets recently, with many industry observers asserting that if cryptocurrency businesses aren't targeting these markets, they'll be left behind.  And according to Bellatorra's Halsey, there's no reason for a merchant business to not turn on the option since it's so easy.  “I can tell other companies looking at the space that if you are used to taking a credit card for payment, this is every bit as simple if not simpler,” he said.  An Asian persuasion  Yet, the rapid growth of B2B bitcoin payments still dwarfs altcoin use cases for retail payments.  To get an idea of the size of the market, international B2B payments now account for roughly 15 percent of BitPay's business. And that's after a 328 percent increase in the payments dollar volume BitPay took in between 2016 and 2017.  Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer at BitPay, told CoinDesk he expects those payments to increase another fourfold in 2018.  These numbers are likely one of the reasons BitPay secured $40 million in a Series B round recently. And the main focus for that money will be expanding its services into Asia, said Pair.  For one thing, a BitPay investor based in China would like to see the company open an office in the country, Pair said.  To make that happen, the company would like to start building relationships with banking partners in China, to offer the ability for merchant clients to cash out into their preferred currency and account, he continued.  Speaking to that focus, Pair said:  “The staff there will be focused on customer service, sales, engineering services, compliance, things you really need a local presence for.”  Beauty products image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BCH | BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/17/bitcoin-merchant-adoption-might-just-be-accelerating-in-asia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76115f80ac6df4291347025e1ba075e806c5d151-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428839,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeUdh,1523944809,Economists Explore Bitcoin's 'Equilibrium Price' in New Paper,"Two economists have developed a model for pricing bitcoin and other assets in decentralized financial networks.  Emiliano Pagnotta and Andrea Buraschi, professors of finance at Imperial College Business School in London, have proposed a theoretical structure for networks based on proof of work, which include bitcoin and ethereum. Their paper is dated March 21 of this year.  Their analysis focuses on two main variables: the number of users – who represent the demand side – and the hash rate provided by miners, who represent the supply side.  The authors point out that decentralized financial networks are unique in that tokens ""simultaneously serve two functions."" In addition to functioning as an asset, they incentivize miners to maintain the network. The equilibrium price of the token, then, is the solution to ""a fixed-point problem that characterizes the interaction between consumers and miners,"" according to the paper.  There are two solutions to this problem for any set of conditions, the paper says, one of which is $0.  Buraschi and Pagnotta wrote:  ""Indeed, if the price of bitcoin were zero, miners would not provide any resource to the network, and its trust would be zero. Consumers would derive no utility from the system and would not pay a positive price for bitcoins.""  But there is also a positive equilibrium price, according to this model. What that figure is depends on the network's hash rate, the expected number of future network users, and the value users place on the network's resistance to censorship, they argue.  This framework sheds light on some recent adjustments in bitcoin's price. According to Pagnotta and Buraschi's model, regulatory changes in China would matter more than such changes in Britain. Even though both countries have similar numbers of bitcoin users, China has more miners – meaning a crackdown there would have a greater effect on the hashrate and, therefore, the price.  One factor the authors did not take into account is ""pure speculative motives,"" which arguably affected the price of bitcoin more than any other development in 2017.

In a closing remark at a conference with the International Monetary Fund and Japan's Financial Services Agency on Monday, the BoJ's deputy governor Masayoshi Amamiya said issuing a digital currency directly for consumers – whether or not on a blockchain – could undermine the existing two-tiered system.  Currently central banks only give access to limited entities such as private banks, which face consumers directly in a second tier – a process that Amamiya praises as ""the wisdom of human beings in history to achieve both efficiency and stability in the currency system.""  As such the deputy governor moved on explaining that having a digital currency backed by the central bank will change the system without proving to be financially stable.  Amamiya stated:  ""In this regard, the issuance of central bank digital currencies for general use could be analogous to allowing households and firms to directly have accounts in the central bank. This may have a large impact on the aforementioned two-tiered currency system and private banks' financial intermediation.""  That said, Amamiya does not entirely rule out the possibility of considering the bank's own cryptocurrency in the future as it has already started looking into the underlying blockchain technology, though currently just for business applications.

42428843,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeUlh,1523937635,Lightning + NFC? The New Plan to Bring Bitcoin to Retail,"Imagine a way to expand bitcoin payments to millions per second. Now, imagine a clunky, command-line interface.  That's the extent of the divide between the vision enabled by bitcoin's best-yet scaling solution, the lightning network, and the current state of its design. But while that's daunting, developers are moving ahead on designs to make the payment system easier to use, with one recently submitting a proposal for connecting lightning with a payment technology that could make it feel as futuristic as it's touted.  That payment technology, near-field communication, or NFC, would allow a user to pay for an item just by holding their smartphone an inch away from the device it's paying.  Not a new idea in bitcoin or the payments world at large, NFC-based payments have caught on throughout Asia and Europe – not only on smartphones, but also through chips embedded in payment cards. And while the U.S. might be lagging behind in NFC adoption, bitcoin's early adopters might just be the right target audience.  As such, the proposal, submitted by developer Igor Cota, looks to standardize a way to connect lightning with NFC.  Invoking the name of his lightning wallet that uses NFC, Presto, Cota told CoinDesk:  ""I want the payments to be instant just like with the contactless cards we have here in Europe. A user would simply tap on the payment terminal and presto!""  Further, Cota imagines turning any computer into a lightning point-of-sale terminal through the use of a $29 USB attachment, a route that has proven successful in his early tests.  Replacing QR codes  Given the success, Cota's proposal is about standardizing what he's created, adding it to the many other standard rules that describe how each lightning software implementation should operate.  Many bitcoin payments implementations tend to use QR codes – those pixelated-looking black-and-white squares that encode data that can then be scanned and consumed by smartphones. And while Presto supports QR codes alongside NFC, he believes the latter provides a much better experience.  QR codes not only can be a bit finicky, but they also can become ""unwieldy,"" Cota said, especially when more information is added to them. In this way, merchants won't be able to add much information such as itemized receipts and coupons to QR codes, he said.  NFC, though, doesn't have this hurdle.  ""I'd like to see a system where the payment terminal sends a nice HTML receipt for the customer – that receipt has, say, a table list of your grocery shopping with subtotal, taxes, grand-total, perhaps a shop logo, some loyalty code or a coupon for future use,"" he said.  In Cota's mind, this would give consumers a more detailed record of their spending habits, empowering them to take even more control of their finances.  ""Imagine a wallet that can tell you how much you've spent on broccoli last month?"" Cota said, adding:  ""With crypto you're always in control, but with these digital receipts you are even more so.""  A bolt of lightning  But first, Cota is trying to get his NFC implementation added to the standards that lightning network developers have established in an effort to make sure all implementations are compatible with each other.  These standards are called ""BOLTS,"" and Cota believes NFC should be added to BOLT 11, which explains how ""invoices"" – describing how much a person owes – should be encoded and presented to a user. It's a similar process to that of the credit card reader at Starbucks showing you that you owe $4.50 for a mocha latte.  For now, BOLT 11 only describes a standard for QR codes.  Already, Cota has come up with a rough standard, putting together a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type, which is a format for sending data; an NFC application ID, which indicates the payment method is lightning; and a ""very simple protocol to forward socket data.""  Though these pieces weren't so hard to come up with, Cota said he thinks it's important to write up a standard, whereby all NFC-enabled point-of-sale devices can accept any NFC-based lightning payment, now to be ahead of the game should NFC-based lightning payments take off.  ""For the sake of interoperability, it would be great if we agreed on some standards,"" he explained.  And already, most of the public technical feedback has been positive, with Lightning developers ZmnSCPxj and Corné Plooy responding favorably to the proposal on the mailing list.  However, Bitrefill lightning developer Justin Camarena was a bit wishy-washy, telling CoinDesk:  ""It's an obvious way to pay in the future but it seems we're a bit too early as there are no hardware point-of-sales offering lightning support.""  Still, Cota is plugging away on the next steps to move the project forward.  ""As you can see the [Presto user-interface] is not really there yet but I'm working on it,"" he said, adding, ""What I'm working on at the moment is a protocol that makes sure the NFC payment goes through even in case the paying device is offline.""  Cota plans to submit another pull request for developers to review once this mechanism is finished.

42428858,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeVDh,1523930403,Why the IRS Should Treat Crypto as a New Asset Class,"Zac McClure is the Co-founder of TokenTax, a cryptocurrency tax startup.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      2017 was a banner year for cryptocurrency—an expansive bull market, exciting new coins, and an explosion of crypto-related services.  As cryptocurrencies finally reached the mainstream, regulators and governments have stepped up their oversight. While some nations banned (and rapidly un-banned) cryptocurrency marketplaces and services, the United States moved towards more stringent IRS enforcement by establishing a dedicated cryptocurrency team and forcing major exchanges like Coinbase to turn over user information on trades.  Some may view any governmental activity as anathema to the ethos of cryptocurrency. However, increased IRS scrutiny does have a positive benefit: it adds a layer of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency world as, instead of banning cryptocurrencies, the US government is tentatively acknowledging it as a financial asset.  This is a powerful step forward in the growth of this new industry. I want the U.S. regulatory bodies to embrace and celebrate the transformative potential of cryptocurrency, rather than be mired in an antagonistic battle against the movement.  The current crypto-tax landscape is so chock full of “gray areas” that it would make winter-time Chicago blush. Are you allowed to defer taxes by claiming a 1031 Exchange on your coin-to-coin transactions? Which accounting methods can be used? Do wash sale rules apply? Are forks and airdrops taxable?  As a result, tax professionals in the cryptocurrency space are applying a hodgepodge of rules that historically have been applied to stocks, bonds and other tradable securities, real property, intangible property, and so on. Having spent the last several months helping people calculate their cryptocurrency tax liabilities has often felt like driving while staring straight into the rear view mirror.  Without clear guidance from the IRS, the resulting non-consensus amongst cryptocurrency tax professionals has led to an environment where it seems even most accountants are hesitant to handle crypto taxes.  In fact, the majority of my firm’s clients are actually calculating their own capital gains not to file on their own, but in order to make life easier for their accountant. This is especially surprising given the asset class ended the year worth more than $600 billion, and many investors had capital gains much larger than their annual salary, and minimal to no experience calculating capitals gains in the past.  Notably, no tax rules are being drawn from crypto’s namesake – currencies.  That is because the most recent meaningful statement from the IRS about cryptocurrency taxation came in 2014 when the agency specified that crypto was not actually a currency, and therefore even tiny gains were taxable and needed to be reported, unlike with actual foreign currency that has a de minimis exclusion for gains under $200.  What is the IRS going to do when another government adopts a cryptocurrency as its national currency? The Marshall Islands intends to issue the Sovereign, or SOV, to supplement the USD as local tender. Venezuela is also heading in that direction and many more nations will surely follow.  Crypto tax reform  Here are a few foundational ideas I would propose for cryptocurrency tax reform:  De minimis exclusions (e.g. spending less than $200 for a good or service should be exempt from reporting and capital gains tax)  Designate cryptocurrencies as a new asset class, complete with common sense rules that are customized for cryptocurrencies’ unique use cases, as opposed to strained comparisons to semi-related asset classes  Last in, first out (LIFO) or specific-shares should be the default accounting methods, as they more closely track the economic realities of investors buying fresh bitcoin or ethereum in order to transfer it to other exchanges and invest it in other cryptocurrencies  Exempt bitcoin and ethereum from wash sale rules. As currencies often traded for others they should be exempt from rules about not buying back a currency you’ve recently sold. Those same rules should apply to other currencies to prevent selling and buying back just to harvest tax losses  Safe harbor for reporting back taxes: Once guidance is given, offer investors a chance to pay back taxes or amend prior returns given the uncertainty of the current environment  Safe harbor for regulations around reporting foreign assets via the FBAR and/or FACTA forms – most people do not even know where in the world an exchange is located, unless it’s Bitmex or Coinbase  Explicit tax deferral on cryptocurrency capital held within one exchange: When an investor trades cryptocurrency only for other cryptocurrencies without transferring it out of an exchange and being able to convert it to USD, for example, it seems a bit unfair that he or she would be expected to pay paper gains in USD that have not been realized  Aggregate reporting of gains and losses at exchanges that do not offer exchange to USD or other fiat – as opposed to the burdensome task of requiring billions of trades made in “Satoshi’s” (e.g. units of bitcoin) to be converted to USD when no consensus market price exists for most currencies at any time. Instead, a user would report the USD values of cryptocurrency transferred in (effectively a “buy” from a capital gains perspective), and the USD value of cryptocurrencies transferred out of an exchange (a “sell”)  I am sure the IRS would love nothing more than to give clear guidance on all of this– but the truth is if there were easy answers we would already have them.  While the dust settles on this tax season, my hope is that the new IRS cryptocurrency group will gather together a working group of industry practitioners tasked with building consensus around these topics and writing sensible regulations.  I think it is unfair to expect the IRS to do all of the hard work of making these decisions on its own. Progress is neither automatic nor inevitable.  It is much easier for us in the industry to hide behind the caveat of “well, the IRS hasn’t said anything about it yet…” than to try and drive the space forward with meaningful thought leadership. I sincerely hope I get the chance to participate in a group like this someday.  Happy tax filing day everyone!
