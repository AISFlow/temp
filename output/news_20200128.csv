42431474,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kTh,1580250305,Crypto-Related Deposits Drop by Half at Metropolitan Commercial Bank,"Metropolitan Commercial Bank’s deposits from digital currency businesses have steadily declined for more than a year, a sign competition is heating up in a field where the bank was once one of the only games in town.      Over the course of 2019, the New York-based lender’s deposits from the industry shrank by 52 percent, to $104 million on Dec. 31, according to an investor presentation the bank put out last week. Digital currency clients accounted for 4 percent of the bank’s total deposits at year's end, down from 13 percent a year earlier.      Metropolitan is one of a handful of banks that openly services the sector. In the presentation, the bank still advertises a diverse set of global payment clients including crypto payments processor Bitpay, crypto-asset platform Crypto.com, crypto exchange Coinbase and crypto brokerage Voyager. But the business is well off from its peak in the second quarter of 2018 when Metropolitan’s deposits from digital currency firms averaged $369 million.      While that decline may partly reflect the 2018-2019 crypto bear market, it also suggests the bank faces stiffer competition in a field where most financial institutions have historically feared to tread.      At Metropolitan’s rival Silvergate Bank, for example, crypto deposits declined at a slower rate, just 22 percent on a year-over-year basis, to $1.29 billion on Sept. 30, the most recent date for which figures are available. Over the same 12-month period, the La Jolla, Calif.-based bank’s crypto clientele increased by 273 firms to 756 in total, and they account for 70 percent of its $1.8 billion of deposits.      Silvergate, which went public last year, is set to report fourth-quarter results Wednesday.      A few players have entered the market for banking crypto businesses in the last year, such as Massachusetts-based Provident Bank and Quontic in New York.      Rather than fight to retain deposits, Metropolitan was likely content to let some of this business go, said Christopher O’Connell, a bank stock analyst at investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.      “As more [bank] competitors get into the space, some of the overall fee rates that they can charge have changed,” O’Connell said. “Since they have a solid [deposit] pipeline … the bank may not want to pay for a larger portion of this business.”      Revenue from digital currency customers has steadily hovered around 1 percent of Metropolitan’s total ever since foreign exchange conversion and cash management fees from the sector spiked in Q4 2017 and Q1 2018, said O’Connell. That period coincided with the peak of the last crypto bull market.      Metropolitan declined to comment. In its fourth-quarter earnings release, the bank pointed to a decrease in fees from digital currency customers when explaining why non-interest income had decreased by $1.5 million for the full year compared to 2018.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/28/crypto-related-deposits-drop-by-half-at-metropolitan-commercial-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56566925908bf2341d57095dc145866b20b2a606-1500x857.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431465,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kHh,1580248295,Lawyers Ramp Up Pressure to Exhume Quadriga CEO's Body,"Lawyers representing the former users of the QuadrigaCX platform are doubling down on a formal request to exhume the exchange’s founder’s body.      Miller Thomson, the court-appointed representative counsel for Quadriga’s former users, contacted Bill Blair, the public official responsible for overseeing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, asking him to clarify whether the law enforcement agency investigating Quadriga’s 2019 collapse would exhume founder Gerald Cotten’s body in a letter emailed to creditors and posted to the law firm’s website Tuesday.      The law firm first requested the RCMP exhume and autopsy last month, asking the agency to both confirm Cotten’s body is indeed in his grave, as well as determine the cause of death. Cotten’s demise precipitated the exchange’s eventual transition into bankruptcy.      “Today, Representative Counsel issued a letter to the Honorable Bill Blair, Canadian Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, requesting an update on whether the RCMP will conduct an exhumation and post­mortem autopsy on the alleged body of Gerald Cotten prior to Spring 2020,” the letter reads.      The document notes users can contact the minister directly via email “if they have further questions about the RCMP’s management of this file,” while also suggesting they can contact their Members of Parliament for possible answers.      An email sent to Blair was not immediately returned.    'Law enforcement activities'    Tuesday’s letter follows an update from Ernst & Young (EY), the bankruptcy trustee for Quadriga. The company, which was appointed by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court last year to consolidate Quadriga’s crypto holdings, said Monday it was requesting a court approve nearly $640,000 CAD ($484,000 USD) in expenses for cooperating with multiple federal agencies.      According to the report, EY spent $188,939 CAD between June 24, 2019, and Dec. 31, 2019, “in connection with the Law Enforcement Activities.” In addition, Stikeman Elliott and Lenczner Slaght, law firms representing EY, charged $133,618 CAD and $314,599 CAD, respectively, over the same time period.      According to EY, much of this billing comes from analyzing 750,000 documents the company compiled into an “EDiscovery Database,” which was then used to determine which documents met production demands from the various law enforcement agencies involved.      “During the process, the Trustee made various efforts to minimize costs and to streamline wherever possible the accumulation, review and production of documents,” the report said. “This included utilizing the services of contract lawyers specialized in privilege review and available at a significantly lower billing rate than other professionals managing the overall Law Enforcement Activities.”      However, the sheer volume of documents meant that “significant” effort on EY and its counsel’s part were still required, the report claimed.      A nearly 80-page breakdown details how the expenses were accrued. The report did not provide any information on how many claims were filed by creditors or how much each creditor might expect to receive.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/28/lawyers-ramp-up-pressure-to-exhume-quadriga-ceos-body,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/857fdf702644a5180f5ece6ff5a28883bd6eef16-1500x888.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431471,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2kPh,1580245233,Ex-PBoC Governor Urges China to Join Global Conversation on Libra,"A former senior official with the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) believes the nation should join a global conversation about regulating stablecoins, with a particular focus on the Libra stablecoin.      Min Zhu, former deputy governor at the PBoC, said China should join other nations in regulating the Facebook-led Libra stablecoin, according to a report by South China Morning Post.      “I think it’s critically important to join the discussions and take part in coordinated global regulation of Libra,” Zhu said, noting there is still no specific timeline to launching the digital yuan, which is also called Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), according to the report.      The comment comes as central banks and financial institutions put forward guidance on how to better regulate stablecoins. International organizations such as the G7 working group and the Financial Action Task Force have taken steps to evaluate and regulate Libra’s potential impact on the global financial system.      China in particular is racing Libra to launch its stablecoin, the digital yuan. Last year David Marcus, who oversees Facebook’s blockchain wallet subsidiary Calibra and is a member of the Libra governing council, warned U.S. legislators that China would win the currency race should Libra be halted.      Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeated the claim in his testimony before congressional lawmakers.      Meanwhile, officials from the Chinese central bank have repeatedly said the digital yuan is more advanced in several technical aspects than Libra. However, China could lose substantial financial clout at home and abroad if Libra prevails.      Like many central banks, PBoC fears the rise of Libra could erode its ability to carry out effective monetary policies as the bank would lose its absolute control over demand and supply of the currency market.      China also fears Libra, partly backed by the U.S. dollar, could amplify the currency’s dominance over the international financial system, making it even harder for China to internationalize the yuan.      The Chinese central bank initially assembled a task force in 2014 to develop its own national digital currency. However, it accelerated the process and released more details about DCEP when Facebook unveiled its plan to launch Libra in June 2019.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/28/ex-pboc-governor-urges-china-to-join-global-conversation-on-libra,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3236acdcec1c522a3ea77ad216ee61539289f593-1500x993.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403877,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgv58,1580237460,Standard Chartered Invests More Money in Newly Rebranded Trade Finance Startup,"Standard Chartered has invested an undisclosed sum into Contour, a Corda-based blockchain trade platform, to streamline transaction settlement processes.      Contour, which rebranded from Voltron last week, recently tapped R3's Asia chief Carl Wegner as CEO in the run-up to a full commercial launch of its digitized letter-of-credit (LoC) service, which it claims reduced processing time for LoCs from two weeks to just under a day in multiple pilot projects. Standard Chartered Global Head of Transaction Banking Lisa Robins said Tuesday the company streamlined the trade process by cutting down on the amount of paper needed.      Letters of credit are a bank-backed payment guarantee – transferable proof the seller will get the money owed. They are an integral part of cross-border commerce and yet, according to Contour, LoCs can take up to 10 days to process and settle.      Contour has financial backing from Bain and Co., Bangkok Bank, BNP Paribas, HSBC, ING, SEB, R3, CryptoBLK and CTBC Venture Capital. Many of those current partners were part of Contour’s LoC trials under the network’s previous name.      Contour’s rebranding was first reported by Global Trade Review (GTR).    “The opportunity cost in trade finance is huge,” Carl Wegner said in a recent company blog posthttps://www.contour.trade/post/contour-launches-following-success-of-bank-backed-project-to-digitise-trade-finance. “Trillions of dollars in commodities, products and services are transacted daily, but the sector is still characterized by slow, duplicative and expensive processes. Contour delivers a network where trusted information is shared in real time, effectively digitizing letters of credit across all users in the transaction.”    As Voltron, Contour had tested its LoC digitization platform on cross-border oil shipments and yuan-denominated transactions, finding that a blockchain LoC scheme could cut processing times to 24 hours.      Institutional clients seemed to agree. In May 2019, 96 percent of participants in an R3-run trade trial of 50 banks and firms indicated Voltron could improve their finance processing.      The newly branded company will seek to capitalize on that sentiment later this year. According to Wegner, the company is “now focusing on scaling the network with more banks, corporates and partners, and look forward to continuing to collaborate with our growing community.”      GTR reported Contour will launch a commercial version of the product in the second half of 2020 and plans to build out its technical staff in the interim.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/28/standard-chartered-invests-more-money-in-newly-rebranded-trade-finance-startup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5194787c57ef4d7af298aa39f8f1aa16b8c8a1bd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following in the footsteps of companies like Schwab and TD Ameritrade that have made trading free of commissions for customers in the traditional markets. Uphold CEO JP Thieriot said the move was based on Uphold’s ability to net trades at a lower cost after gaining more liquidity providers.      “In the old paradigm you charged a spread and a fee,” he said. “Now, the fee part has gone away, there's a spread on anything that’s traded. We’ve gotten to a level of precision in the way the platform functions to be able to operate on spread and have a lower spread overall.”      Uphold is also removing fees for customers funding their accounts with a credit or debit card.      In addition to removing fees, the company announced a new feature allowing customers to trade directly between any two supported assets on the platform in real time. This means Uphold doesn't have to use a bridge currency – such as U.S. dollars – to convert between assets. Uphold integrates with the different ledgers that hold the currencies it supports and pre-funds the native currency on those ledgers. As part of this feature, the startup has simplified its trading interface down to three fields.      Formerly called Bitreserve before a rebranding in 2015, the platform provides foreign exchange and international remittances in bitcoin and fiat currencies. It also offers e-commerce services. The platform is available in 182 countries around the world and supports trading in 27 cryptocurrencies, as well as 29 fiat currencies.

42403878,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgv49,1580224854,Roger Ver's Mining Pool Pulls Support for Bitcoin Cash Dev Fund Over Chain Split Threat,"Mining pool Bitcoin.com will not now support the controversial bitcoin cash development fund proposal without broader agreement from the community.      In a blog post published earlier on Tuesday, Bitcoin.com said it would no longer back the existing plan for a dev fund unveiled last week by the CEO of mining pool BTC.TOP, Jiang Zhuoer.      ""Bitcoin.com will not risk a chain split or a change to the underlying economics,"" reads the Bitcoin.com blog post. ""Any proposal will need to have as many people of economic weight on board as possible, including businesses, exchanges, miners, and Bitcoin Cash implementations.""      Last week's proposal, which was signed by Roger Ver, executive chairman of Bitcoin.com, as well as Jihan Wu of Antpool/BTC.com and ViaBTC's Haipo Yang, called for a 12.5 percent share of the block reward to be redirected to a new zcash-style development fund. At the time, the group said it could fund long-term development and give ecosystem members a role in deciding which projects get funded.      Although the proposal was met with some support, critics pointed out there were many underspecified aspects of the proposal – such as the ""Hong Kong corporation"" that would coordinate and pay for network development – as well as the ""no-debate"" clause that meant any miners who didn't support the soft fork risked having their blocks orphaned.    Hard fork threat    By withdrawing support, Bitcoin.com said there would be a ""great opportunity"" for users to say what they need and for developers to put together clear funding proposals.      ""In business, you do not begin with a pot of money then figure out something to do with it. You begin with an idea of what needs to be done and then allocate funds to achieve it. This makes all parties involved more accountable and more efficient,"" according to the mining pool.      The news comes after an anonymous ""opposing miner group,"" which claims to control roughly a quarter of total network's mining hashrate, threatened Monday to itself hard fork bitcoin cash. Although ""empathetic"" to protocol developers, the group said it was ""totally unfair and unethical"" that a small group of mining pools were trying to force the ecosystem to accept a compulsory charge they had not agreed to.      In response, the mining group said it would transfer hashrate from signatory pools and ""launch a competing BCH pool to offer a voice to miners that disagree with the proposal."" The post added that should signatories continue with the unamended proposal, they would ""mine up to the hard fork, which will create our own chain after the fork"" with more hashrate than ""the signatories can muster.""      In an update Tuesday, the anonymous mining group said it had ""taken notice"" of Bitcoin.com's post and would stand down and ""not start our competing pool."" ""We trust Bitcoin.com are going to be able to convince the rest of the signatories to severely amend the IFP [invitation for proposal],"" it adds.    Along for the ride    Bitcoin.com will now work with the ecosystem to develop a new plan ""that is profitable for all the relevant parties and which preserves the fundamental economics of Bitcoin Cash.""      ""No proposal should put this goal at risk,"" the post reads. Although some sort of a funding plan is required, ""it cannot come at the expense of compromising the foundational goals of Bitcoin Cash,"" the pool said.      In an email to CoinDesk Monday, Ver said he was ""mostly just along for the ride on this one.""      It is unclear if the remaining three signatories will continue to support the existing proposal.",NEGATIVE,BCH,ASIA | BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | FORKS,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/28/roger-vers-mining-pool-pulls-support-for-bitcoin-cash-dev-fund-over-chain-split-threat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7167d53c076968a9a1e1221a307eb0f4aec8a0df-980x608.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403890,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgvFx,1580220013,Opporty Founder Calls SEC Suit 'Grossly Overstated' in Public Defense,"The founder of blockchain marketplace Opporty said the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) legal case against the firm could have repercussions for other crypto companies.      In an eight-page open letter to the crypto community Tuesday, founder Sergii ""Sergey"" Grybniak claimed the firm followed all regulatory guidance available at the time of Opporty's 2017–2018 initial coin offering (ICO) ""from day one.""      ""We believe that the statement made by SEC is missing important facts and grossly overstated, making it not truthful,"" reads the letter. Should the case be successful, Grybniak said the regulator could prosecute other ICO projects that either used a Regulation D or S exemption.      The case is an attempt by the SEC to ""create a legal precedent"" for crypto companies launching an ICO under Reg D/S exemptions, wrote Grybniak. He believes the commission has targeted his project because it was a relatively small ICO with fewer funds available for legal fees in an extended court case.      Should the regulator's case succeed, many other projects that used a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) model – an investment contract model that governs tokens sales under U.S. law – could face bankruptcy, he claimed. His letter calls for other cryptocurrency companies to donate funds to help Opporty contest the case.      The SAFT framework is an unofficial one that has not been endorsed by the SEC.    Sale 'in good faith'    The SEC announced Jan. 21 it was taking action against Opporty, charging both Grybniak and the company with fraudulent sale of unregistered securities. Per the complaint, the regulator said ""multiple false and misleading statements"" were made to investors that included exaggerations of the size and activity of the userbase as well as claims the ICO was SEC compliant.      The Opporty sale, held between September 2017 and October 2018, raised a total of $600,000 from 194 investors in the U.S. and elsewhere. The SEC alleged Opporty broke the law by not registering the sale. In his letter, Grybniak said the sale had not needed to be registered because it had been conducted under Reg D/S exemptions.      ""I hired a professional independent securities law firm that helped me to organize the process and, rather than hide from the SEC, in fact submitted the ICO as a Reg D/S offering. In good faith I have done my best to follow their legal advice,"" he wrote.    Exceptions to the rule    Companies planning on hosting a securities sale in the U.S. or selling to U.S. investors must usually register first with the SEC, a process that can be slow and costly.      Failure to register correctly can lead to a lawsuit. Block.One received a $24 million penalty in 2019 for not registering its year-long $4 billion EOS sale; the Blockchain of Things Inc. (BCOT) agreed to a $250,000 settlement for similarly not first registering with the commission.      But there are exemptions. A Reg D allows smaller companies to host a sale discreetly, without registering with the SEC, with only a limited provision to promote to U.S. investors already in their network. A Reg S allows a company to sell to investors outside of the U.S., as long as it takes adequate measures to ensure American investors can't purchase securities during an agreed time period, usually around two years.      Only six persons had invested under the Reg D exemption, with the remaining 188 exempted under Reg S, according to Grybniak. ""We were advised by an attorney to do so, and we have done as we were advised in good faith, and being confident that we were doing everything right,"" he said.      Grybniak filed the Form D notice on Feb. 20, 2018. But, according to the SEC's lawsuit, Opporty already ""began their general solicitations and directed selling efforts in the United States and abroad"" several months beforehand.      Opporty had reportedly begun claiming it was ""SEC compliant"" and ""SEC regulated"" on its social media channels weeks before it had even filed for its Form D, the commission added.      Grybniak told CoinDesk he could not comment on these points for legal reasons.

42403881,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgv94,1580214635,IBM Awarded Patent for 'Self-Aware Token',"IBM has received a U.S. patent for a type of ""self-aware token"" that can record its own transaction data.      Awarded by the U.S. Patent Office on Jan. 7, the patent outlines a ledger-based payments system that could make it easier for individual users, businesses and governments to track and trace transactions made using a cryptocurrency.      Dubbed the ""self-aware token,"" it is designed to record all transaction data when not being used on a payments platform IBM patented in 2012. When the token rejoins the platform ecosystem at a later stage, it automatically uploads data from any ""off-line transactions.""      According to the patent, the concept makes it possible to create a ""complete lifecycle"" for tokens that can include data on the payment location and amounts transacted, as well as any information regarding previous token holders. The token cannot store transaction data itself but would store it on some sort of personal device, like a phone or laptop, or alternatively a purpose-built database.      For IBM, the ability to determine the provenance of a token can help ""bolster trust and viability"" within a new token-based economy. Businesses can confirm tokens have not been used for any criminal activities, users can ensure they haven't been falsified or corrupted at any stage and administrators or regulators can build profiles on parties to enforce relevant laws and regulations.      ""Such a system would constitute a significant improvement to the art of financial data processing,"" the patent continued. Self-aware tokens record data by measuring their value against the other asset involved in the transaction, which is said to better aggregate and quantify values against other assets, including other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies.      IBM said the token could facilitate exchanges between different asset classes. As more cryptocurrencies develop, the question of how to enable payments between otherwise diverse forms of assets becomes increasingly significant, the patent noted. By recording this transaction data, ""e-Currencies [could] operate across disparate economic systems, fostering easier participating alongside sovereign currencies and other non-standard currencies.""      In August IBM received a patent for a blockchain-based web browser that could protect user privacy. The firm's work in the space is more than theoretical, too, having launched its IBM Blockchain platform in 2017 and being a contributor to the Hyperledger project.      Other companies are also patenting concepts aimed to help close the gap between fiat and cryptocurrency.

42403892,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgvIu,1580210168,"Bitcoin Rallies to Near $9,150 as Stocks Drop Over Coronavirus Fears","Bitcoin is maintaining its upward trajectory as coronavirus-led risk aversion hits the traditional markets.      The top cryptocurrency by market value crossed the 200-day moving average at $9,000 during Tuesday's Asian trading hours and rose to a high of $9,150, pushing the cumulative month-to-date gains to over 25 percent.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,061. Despite the minor pullback from the morning's high, the cryptocurrency is still reporting a 4.8 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, and is up roughly $700 from lows near $8,250 observed over the weekend, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      While bitcoin has kicked off the week on a positive note, stock markets across the globe are facing selling pressure.      Notably, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 450 points on Monday with travel-related shares suffering sharp losses on fears the coronavirus outbreak in China could spread globally, hurting worldwide economic growth.      The virus, which first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan, is spreading fast. It has so far claimed more than 100 lives in China and the number of confirmed cases increased to 4,515 on Tuesday from 2,835 on Monday, according to the National Health Commission.      With bitcoin outperforming stocks amid the coronavirus scare, a few experts are convinced the cryptocurrency is drawing haven bids – more so, as classic safe-haven asset gold has risen by just 0.65 percent so far this week.      The safe-haven argument, however, is not strong, according to prominent analysts like Alex Kruger. ""Keep in mind that until Friday the narrative was 'Coronavirus pushing bitcoin lower'. It now is 'Coronavirus pushing bitcoin higher.' Some people try very hard to create narratives,"" he tweeted Tuesday.      Moreover, bitcoin picked up a strong bid below $7,000 at least two weeks before Chinese authorities placed Wuhan under quarantine on Jan. 23, sending equity markets into a tailspin, and has extended the rally over the last two days.      In fact, the virus outbreak could ultimately have a negative impact on crypto markets, Jason Wu, CEO and founder of non-custodial crypto lender DeFiner, told CoinDesk earlier this week.      Many Chinese crypto retailers tend to cash in on cryptocurrencies right before the Chinese New Year holiday and reinvest in the market in the next year, Wu said. With the virus outbreak, that money may not return to crypto markets, possibly leading to a price drop.      From a technical perspective, bitcoin is looking heavy and could suffer a minor pullback in the next 24 hours.    Hourly chart    The relative strength index charted a bearish divergence (lower highs) earlier on Tuesday, signaling bullish exhaustion, and dived out of an ascending trendline to indicate an end to the rally from lows near $8,250.      The MACD histogram is printing deeper bars below the zero line, indicating a strengthening of downside momentum.    4-hour chart    The current four-hour candle is flashing red, validating the buyer exhaustion signaled by the preceding inside bar candle, which occurs when the specific period's price action falls within the preceding period's trading range.      The RSI has also rolled over from the overbought (above-70) region, signaling scope for correction.      Both the hourly and four-hour charts are indicating the cryptocurrency could revisit the former resistance-turned-support at $8,793-$8,750 (horizontal lines on the four-hour chart).      A violation there would expose the next support at $8,530. If that level holds, bulls might breathe a sigh of relief and another attempt higher could be initiated targeting resistance at $9,000.      The odds of a pullback to $8,750 would weaken if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance above $9,150 during the U.S. trading hours. In that case, the recent high of $9,188 will likely be scaled.      It's worth noting that longer duration charts are aligned in favor of the bulls. So, pullbacks, if any, could be short-lived.

42403885,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgvD0,1580205635,"British Court Freezes $860,000 in Bitcoin Linked to Ransomware Payout","A U.K. court has ordered Bitfinex to freeze bitcoin worth $860,000 after the crypto exchange and blockchain sleuthing firm Chainalysis traced the funds to a ransomware payment.      The victim of the ransomware attack had paid $950,000 in bitcoin to the perpetrator through an insurance company, according to a filing published last week by the England and Wales High Court (Commercial Court) and first reported by New Money Review. While some of the bitcoin was converted into fiat currency, the remainder appears to have been sent to an address on the Bitfinex platform.      The court ordered Bitfinex to freeze the address and share its know-your-customer (KYC) information about the account's owner.      The victim, an unnamed firm, had been told to pay $1.2 million in bitcoin after its computers were hijacked by ransomware. The company's insurer, which filed the court claim, ultimately paid $950,000 in the form of 109.25 BTC, according to the filing. While some of these funds were converted into fiat and are not traceable, 96 BTC (worth $861,200 at press time) were sent to an address owned by Bitfinex.      New Money Review claims this ruling marks the first instance of the U.K. High Court endorsing bitcoin as property.      In a statement, Chainalysis Director of Communications Maddie Kennedy said that ""a leading cyber insurer used Chainalysis software to investigate ransomware payments made on behalf of their clients and trace the flow of funds from the point of extortion to known services such as exchanges.""      ""A significant amount"" of this ransom was tracked to a user on Bitfinex, and the insurance firm's lawyers were able to successfully petition for a freeze on these funds, she said.      The filing confirms Chainalysis assisted in tracking the bitcoin.      Bitfinex and its parent firm, iFinex, are listed as defendants (""D4"" and ""D3,"" respectively) in the filing. However, the exchange said in a statement it has been working with the claimant to trace the bitcoin and it is not now seen as being involved with the crime.      ""Bitfinex has robust systems in place to allow it to assist law enforcement authorities and litigants in cases such as this,"" the statement said. ""We understand the focus of the Claimant’s attention is no longer on the Bitfinex platform. It now appears Bitfinex is an entirely innocent party mixed up in this wrongdoing.""      Spokespersons for the exchange declined to confirm whether Bitfinex had provided the KYC information for the account associated with the address. However, the court ruling stated Bitfinex would provide the information as long as it had a court order to comply with.      ""It is fair to say that D3 and D4, at the moment at least, have cooperated with the claimant in the following sense, which is that in email correspondence they have indicated that they are not able to comply with any order to identify anyone associated with the account, absent a court order, but that it is their practice to comply with the court order for any national jurisdiction,"" the ruling reads.

42403887,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgvC1,1580202000,Why Lightning Payments Aren't Clicking for Porn Companies (Just Yet),"Bitcoin may finally achieve broader traction through the adult entertainment industry in 2020, but the chips aren’t stacked in its favor.      So far, typical sex industry businesses like London’s 23 Paul Street strip club, said in June the venue stopped accepting bitcoin because customers simply weren’t paying with it. But the lightning network, a layer on top of bitcoin used for faster transactions with lower fees, may now be ready to facilitate broader payments for online platforms.      Iterative Capital’s Escher project offers fiat on-ramps to the lightning network, with other projects like Zap offering similar functionality. There are now service providers to feed a fledgling demand for lightning channels.      According to Veronika Mishura, marketing manager at the payment processor CoinGate, her startup processed 1,400 lightning invoices in 2019 for clients like adult industry sites LiveJasmin and CooMeet, with the average payment being worth around 12 euro. A LiveJasmin spokesperson confirmed the site does receive lightning payments for porn, although he declined to specify details.    In this audio interview, CoinDesk's Leigh Cuen and Spankchain community manager Allie Eve Knox talk about the conjunction of porn and crypto. From performers who accept BTC and XRP to decentralized delivery services, Cuen and Knox explore what happens when financial companies meet censorship-resistant systems.    “We don’t offer payouts in crypto and we don’t track the content per payment method,” he added.      There is certainly room for growth in the adult entertainment industry, as Pornhub famously had trouble paying performers with PayPal in 2019 and now lets performers cash out with Tether instead. ZmnSCPxj, a pseudonymous bitcoin researcher who recently received a grant from Jack Dorsey’s Square Crypto, said he expects privacy-enhancing mixing services to become a more popular part of the lightning economy.      “Improved privacy is always desirable and people will pay for such,” ZmnSCPxj said, adding that channel fees and transaction costs will be “minimal compared to mixer fees.”      Blockstream's lightning expert, Rusty Russell, said in Q1 2020 his team is “working on making our payment paths less predictable, which improves privacy,” along with setups that can help “businesses transition from ‘playing with lightning’ to ‘relying on lightning.’”      He believes porn is an “obvious avenue” for lightning usage, given the high rate of credit card chargebacks. But, he added, “at the moment it makes more sense as an experiment for such sites given our small user base.”      Bitrefill CCO John Carvalho, who formerly ran the adult entertainment company XO Media, said, “Lightning payments can work in the adult industry, but not in any major capacity any time soon.”      Namely, Carvalho said, because video monetization software is expensive to build at scale and erotic content creators aren’t offered access to some popular site hosting services. Few service providers will work with porn companies (at least at the same rate), which contributed to why some started accepting cryptocurrency in the first place. But these sites generally use internal credit systems, accepting bitcoin or credit card payments for centralized credits.      Spankchain CEO Ameen Soleimani said although his ethereum startup was “one of the first companies to put payment channels into production,” it promptly shifted gears because there’s still a lot of work to be done “around watch towers, wallet integrations, and merchant integrations before it can reach critical mass.”      ""While crypto natives gave us a lot of support for being payment channel pioneers, normal users couldn't care less,” Soleimani told CoinDesk. “They want a product that just works, and with SpankPay we've discovered (or rediscovered) that 0-conf instant payments are the way to go for fiat-competitive checkout systems.""    Still an experiment    Some bitcoiners are still altogether skeptical about lightning. Regardless of payment channels, bitcoin itself has plenty of privacy kinks to work out.      An anonymous Samourai Wallet co-founder, behind the privacy-focused bitcoin wallet that powers the Nodl mixing feature, said his own open-source team has “no interest in lightning” because mainstream adoption is a “poison pill.” (Perhaps as illustrated by the companies like LiveJasmin that don’t offer erotic performers the chance to hold their own crypto.)      “Bitcoin is in danger of replicating the system it set out to destroy,” he said. “I also don’t see retail, mass adoption pickup. … That’s a blessing in disguise and we should embrace that.”      Beyond adult entertainment, Mishura said CoinGate also processed payments for Habsak cafe in Oslo and usage is trickling down from tech experiments to rare customers. OpenNode’s head of marketing, Ryan Flowers, saying his startup processed over 68,970 lightning invoices received and 38,986 payments sent in 2019. Most lightning-oriented startups, including Carvalho’s Bitrefill and Flower’s OpenNode, are focused on expanding their pool of merchants in 2020.      As it stands, lightning analytics site 1ML.com tallies at least 11,174 nodes online and a network capacity exceeding $7.8 million. That’s why lightning advocates believe broader commercial usage of the network, beyond isolated experiments, could be on the horizon.      “The network is definitely becoming more liquid over time,” said developer Anand Patel, who earned roughly $3 a day over the past year by routing lightning payments. “If you’re going to pay a merchant, it makes sense that they don’t see your whole transaction balance or history.”      So far, small groups of merchants accept lightning payments, mostly for the curiosity factor. But since those adult performers and adventurous merchants rarely cash out in crypto, it’s still too early to see any significant benefits.      “Usability, thanks to something like [lightning wallet] Phoenix, is now good enough that more people can try it,” Bitcoin Core contributor Sjors Provoost said, noting that the last merchant rush followed the 2014 bull market, but hasn’t revived since. “So maybe, if there’s a price spike, we’ll see … more merchants trying it. Then we’ll see if it sticks.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/28/why-lightning-payments-arent-clicking-for-porn-companies-just-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d51c990f7dabe9aa552b1258546aef84d5b07cc-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Halliday will report to Gemini’s managing director of U.K. and Europe, Julian Sawyer, and will work closely with the firm’s New York City-based chief compliance officer, Noah Perlman, who was formerly global head of financial crimes at Morgan Stanley.      The move comes as ramped-up regulations go into effect with the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which requires crypto firms to demonstrate compliance with enhanced know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) procedures.      Halliday’s first project will be ensuring Gemini’s risk management practices are in place as the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority reviews its e-money license application, Sawyer said.      “At the moment, our customers in the U.K. have to send money to the U.S. as a wire transfer,” Sawyer said. “An e-money license would allow them to deposit local currency without foreign exchange [costs].”      At Circle, Halliday was chief compliance officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

42403889,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgvGw,1580186426,Singapore Announces New AML Rules for Crypto Businesses,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is updating its regulatory framework for digital payments.      Announced Tuesday, Singapore’s Payment Services Act 2019 (PSA) brings so-called Digital Payment Token (DPT) services – effectively covering all crypto businesses and exchanges based in Singapore – under current anti-money laundering (AML) and counterterrorist-financing (CTF) rules.      As such, crypto businesses in Singapore are required to first register and then apply for a license to operate in the jurisdiction.      Similar to the Fifth European Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which went into effect Jan. 10, Singapore’s new rules are long awaited: the PSA was passed back in January 2019. In the intervening months, Singapore has further cemented itself a forward-thinking jurisdiction in regulating the cryptocurrency industry.      As of Jan. 28, firms will have a month to register with MAS, stating they are based in Singapore and are operating a DPT business. Once firms have registered, there’s a six-month grandfathering period during which they have to apply for a payment institution license.      “The Payment Services Act provides a forward-looking and flexible regulatory framework for the payments industry,” MAS Assistant Managing Director Loo Siew Yee said in a statement. “The activity-based and risk-focused regulatory structure allows rules to be applied proportionately and to be robust to changing business models. The PS Act will facilitate growth and innovation while mitigating risk and fostering confidence in our payments landscape.”      'FATF-ready'    When it comes to implementing crypto regulations, countries around the world are dancing to the beat of the latest Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, first made in October 2018 and then updated in June 2019.      This means preparing for a future when payment data relating to the originator and beneficiary of a crypto transaction travels with the payment, guidance known as FATF’s “travel rule.”      “The interesting thing about the Monetary Authority of Singapore is that, in a sense, it’s FATF-ready,” said Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at trade group Global Digital Finance. “They were first out the door with a consultation back in July saying this is what we are proposing in terms of the implementation of the PSA, as it relates to sending origination and beneficiary information.”      MAS also launched a consultation just before Christmas, adding some amendments to the PSA regarding digital assets. Further aligning Singapore with the FATF, the amendments widen rules to include the transfer of DPTs (as well as them being exchanged); the provision of custodial wallets for or on behalf of customers; and the brokering of DPT transactions.      “They [MAS] have gone a bit further than FATF in terms of some criteria, but at the same time some of the other aspects of it are probably not as far as FATF has intended,” said Wright, who is also chief compliance officer at Diginex, a Hong Kong-based firm offering institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets.      There are always fears regulation could stifle innovation in such a nascent space as crypto. Indeed, the advent of AMLD5 across Europe may bring increased M&A activity as firms consolidate to meet the increased costs of regulation.      U.K.-based Bottle Pay, a cryptocurrency payments provider, said it was closing down in December 2019, citing forthcoming EU money laundering rules; crypto mining pool Simplecoin and bitcoin gaming platform Chopcoin were also reported to be shutting down for the same reason.      Meanwhile, Deribit, a Netherlands-based crypto derivatives exchange, said it’s planning to relocate to Panama because its home country's version of AMLD5 “would put too-high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise.”      David Carlisle, head of community at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, offered a different take. He said the AMLD5 regulations imposed on crypto firms are “bread-and-butter requirements,” including know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and the monitoring of suspicious transactions. Firms will need an appointed person to carry out these tasks, he said, such as a money-laundering reporting officer.      “We have certainly not heard any rumblings or intention by businesses to move their operations,” said Carlisle. “Singapore and Switzerland are two countries that show you can strike a balance between having meaningful regulation in place and not being prevented from attracting businesses.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/28/singapore-announces-new-aml-rules-for-crypto-businesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ea19689f2761055e1d6f59c308c2824565e07ee-1700x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403891,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgvHv,1580179372,"Volatility, Illiquidity Threaten BSV’s Newfound Position","Volatility in bitcoin SV (BSV) is raising concerns about the resilience and stability of the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, as ranked by CoinMarketCap.      On Jan. 14, at around 00:35 UTC, the price of BSV shot up 6 percent over a 10-minute period and 22 hours later, it was up a total of 139 percent from $196 to $458.  A sell-off quickly followed BSV’s rally at around 00:30 UTC on Jan. 15, with the price dropping from $458 to $278. According to some analysts, the cryptocurrency is plagued by controversy and poor liquidity due to shallow order book depth.       Research analyst at eToro, Simon Peters, said that when rumors surfaced that BSV founder Craig Wright received the ""keys"" to 1.1 million bitcoins (BTC) locked up in a fund known as the Tulip Trust, many in the crypto community anticipated Wright could dump a large proportion of his BTC holdings onto the market in favor of BSV.      The trust is said to be guarding pieces of the private keys necessary to unlock the bitcoin Wright and his former partner Dave Kleiman mined before 2014. Wright claims this is the $9.5 billion fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s founder.      “As it stands, a 300 percent move in a week is generally unsustainable,” Peters said of BSV.      Titled “Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision,” BSV has been embroiled in controversy since its early days, with major exchanges including Binance, Kraken and Shapeshift delisting the cryptocurrency , a move that has been contributing to increased volatility, Peters said.      “BSV is more vulnerable to major price swings due to a lack of depth of the order books in the smaller exchanges where it can be traded,” Peters said.      An order book refers to an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level. When there aren't enough buyers or sellers on the books, illiquidity makes the assets more at risk to be manipulated by larger funds and investors.      BSV’s trading volume remains relatively thin compared to the others in the top 10 cryptocurrencies for the past 30 days. However, the standard deviation of returns — in other words, its volatility — has soared relative to the other nine leading cryptos. That signals that single orders in its shallow order books have a large impact on BSV’s price.      “Clearly the case,” said Alex Krüger, a prominent crypto trader and analyst, discussing BSV’s swift price rise and steep sell-off, saying that it was related to a lack of liquidity on the major exchanges.      But it’s not just the result of delisting the coin on many major exchanges. As Peters suggested, Wright’s recent court issues may have also caused a demonstrable effect on price movement.      CoinDesk recently reached out to Wright for comment but he declined to comment on price movement, BSV’s delisting and price volatility.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BSV,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BSV,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/28/volatility-illiquidity-threaten-bsvs-newfound-position,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
