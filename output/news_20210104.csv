42385529,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2BNR,1609803607,US Federal Regulator Says Banks Can Conduct Payments Using Stablecoins,"Federally regulated banks can use stablecoins to conduct payments and other activities, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said Monday.      The federal banking regulator published an interpretive letter addressing whether national banks and federal savings associations could participate in independent node verification networks (INVNs, otherwise known as blockchain networks) or use stablecoins. The letter said these financial institutions can participate as nodes on a blockchain and store or validate payments.      Any banks that do participate in an INVN must be aware of the operational, compliance or fraud risks when doing so, an OCC press release warned.      Still, the OCC said INVNs “may be more resilient than other payment networks” due to the large number of nodes needed to verify transactions, which can, in turn, limit tampering.      Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, said on Twitter that “the letter states that blockchains have the same status as other global financial networks, such as SWIFT, ACH and FedWire.”      Brian Brooks, the Acting Comptroller of the Currency, said in a statement that while other nations have built real-time payments systems, the U.S. “has relied on” the private sector to create such technologies, seemingly endorsing the use of cryptocurrencies – specifically stablecoins – as an alternative to other real-time payment systems.      Brooks has overseen the publication of two other interpretative letters and a number of other crypto-friendly moves during his time overseeing the agency, including a letter telling federal banks they can provide services to stablecoin issuers and store reserves for stablecoins.      Last month, Brooks announced his support of a letter by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets that outlined how stablecoins should be regulated within the U.S.      President Donald Trump has twice nominated Brooks to serve a full five-year term heading up the agency, including earlier this week. However, it’s unclear whether the U.S. Senate will schedule a confirmation vote.As of press time, it does not appear likely it will do so before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.      Monday’s interpretive letter also comes on the same day as a public comment period for a proposed Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN) rule closed. The controversial rule only had a 15-day comment period, and was reportedly spearheaded by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who appointed Brooks to the OCC in early 2020.      “[Monday’s OCC letter] goes to show that there’s not an all-out assault on cryptocurrencies, that there are bright spots in the government that realize that crypto networks are going to be the foundation of future payments systems and other financial services applications, so we welcome this type of interpretive guidance,” Smith told CoinDesk in a phone call.

At that point, the firm's investment across funds investing in bitcoin stood at $182 million.  According to a SkyBridge spokeswoman, the increase in the position was mostly due to market appreciation, with a small amount of additional purchases.  “With global money printing at an all-time high, bitcoin offers a strong alternative to gold as a store of value and hedge against future inflation,” Ray Nolte, SkyBridge's co-chief investment officer, said in the press release.

42385547,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Bip,1609795521,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Briefly Drops Close to $28K as Ether Futures Heat Up,"Over-leveraged bitcoin investors in the derivatives market led to Monday’s sell-off while ether spot and futures markets are starting to get a lot more attention.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $31,444 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 5.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $28,154-$33,562 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC slightly below its 10-hour and well below the 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a bearish-to-sideways signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin fell Monday, met by a spate of selling pressure. Around 10:00 UTC (5 a.m. ET), spot exchanges like Coinbase saw a larger-than-normal number of traders hitting sell, with 6,000 BTC in volume on the exchange during that hour. Prices dropped as low as $28,154, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Read More: Bitcoin Suddenly Drops 13% as Altcoins Continue to Rise      “A lot of folks are now taking a profit after rapid growth in price,” said Constatin Kogan, managing partner at crypto investment firm Wave Financial. Indeed, bitcoin crossed $34,000 and hit an all-time record high of $34,366 on Jan. 2, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Analysts are seeing many investors realize some gains after such a rapid rise.      ""Over the weekend, as bitcoin prices hit fresh all-time highs, markets touched new levels of resistance,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “Profit-taking occurred around these levels, resulting in some sideways trading and causing many to be over-leveraged long on futures.”      During the 10:00 UTC (5 a.m. ET) period of higher-than-normal selling Monday, derivatives exchange BitMEX saw $10 million in liquidations, the crypto comparable to a margin call on over-leveraged bullish bets.      In total, $135 million in sell liquidations occurred on BitMEX over the past day, far outweighing the $34 million in buy liquidations from traders going short. This indicates some exhaustion of what has been a hyper-bullish market until Monday.      Nonetheless, Lau still expects buying pressure to keep bitcoin’s price up. ”These dips are being bought up pretty quickly, reinforcing the narrative that there are underlying bids by institutions keen to access bitcoin,” he told CoinDesk.      Some profit-taking is likely going from bitcoin into ether. Since Jan. 3, ether has exploded and is now up 38.5% in 2021 while the price per 1 BTC has appreciated 7.5% thus far in 2021.      “Traders rotated assets from BTC into alts to gain higher returns,” said Lau, who refers to ether as one of the “alts,” or alternative cryptocurrencies. “This is evident as [ether] gained over bitcoin in the last 24 hours.”      Wave Financial’s Kogan sees this rotation from bitcoin to other crypto assets as an impermanent condition. “Another interesting factor now is the alt season, so the demand slowly switches to other crypto assets. But in my opinion, this is temporary.”    Ether futures open interest crests $2.6 billion    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Monday trading around $1,034 and climbing 10.4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Ether Price Passes $1,150 to Hit Highest Since January 2018      The ether futures market set a new record high Sunday, at $2.6 billion in open interest, or OI. Leading the way in OI is Binance with $632 million, followed by OKEx with $421 million and Huobi in third with $382 million.      Futures interest in ether is rising because savvy investors want to start hedging lofty ether price levels, according John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto asset manager Tritum. “There is a strong natural inclination for some long-term ETH hodlers to finally sell at the numerically significant $1,000 threshold, where we have seen a lot of limit orders sitting on exchange books waiting to get filled,” Willock told CoinDesk.      He also said institutional interest in ether is growing because CME is expected to launch ether futures next month and investors are currently looking for any way to access the ether futures market. “Institutions are able to put short pressure on these markets as many people will expect a near-term price correction after this monumental and fast run-up in blue-chip crypto instruments,” Willock added.

42385524,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27aB,1609791121,Why I’ve Changed My Mind on Bitcoin,"There comes a point in every investor’s journey when he must admit he is wrong about something. In my case, I was wrong about bitcoin and whether it would ever be considered a legitimate asset class. This realization dawned on me in the last month when the price of bitcoin passed its December 2017 highs of $20,000. My prior belief was that bitcoin wouldn’t surpass these highs for many years, if at all. I didn’t think that bitcoin was “going to zero,” but I also didn’t think it would eclipse its December 2017 peak anytime soon.    Nick Maggiulli is chief operating officer at Ritholtz Wealth Management and author of the ""Of Dollars and Data"" financial blog, where a version of this article first appeared.    Now that it has surpassed that peak by over 50%, I have come to realize that bitcoin isn’t the one-trick pony I thought it was. As Paulo Coelho wrote in ""The Alchemist"":    Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.    Well, here we are again. Bitcoin is on another spectacular bull run and investors are taking notice. Now that bitcoin has survived (and thrived) beyond its 2017 peak, many investors who used to see it as a joke are now realizing it isn’t one. I am one of them.      I have changed my tune on bitcoin, but not because of many of the arguments put forth by bitcoin bulls. For example, bitcoin bulls have claimed that bitcoin would be used as a currency, that the U.S. dollar would plummet in value and that the halving in May 2020 would increase bitcoin’s price. They were wrong on all counts, yet bitcoin’s price has still gone up.      What the bitcoin bulls were right about was increased adoption and the ability of many bitcoin owners to hold (“HODL”) even as prices rose dramatically. These two effects (more demand from buyers and reduced supply from sellers) have helped to boost bitcoin’s price and cement it as a legitimate asset class within the investment community. As a result, bitcoin has become a form of digital gold. You may not agree with this assessment, but if you still think bitcoin is “going to zero” you should reconsider your assumptions.    Why bitcoin is here to stay    The problem with arguing that bitcoin is “going to zero” is there are too many investors who are willing to buy it at a price far above $0. I remember speaking to many non-crypto investors before the recent run-up in price who said they wouldn’t buy bitcoin at $10,000, but if it dropped to $1,000-$2,000 they would surely jump in.      Well, guess what? Now that the current price is above $30,000, some of those investors have likely increased the limit at which they would consider buying bitcoin. Instead of buying at $1,000 these same investors may be happy to jump in closer to $10,000. And every time the price goes up in the future, these “mental buy limits” go up as well, increasing the likelihood of bitcoin’s future survival.      “But Nick, bitcoin doesn’t have any intrinsic value!” Well, guess what? Neither does gold, which has a $10 trillion market capitalization! So if you want to argue against bitcoin on intrinsic value terms, then you have to argue against gold, too. Because both the price of gold and the price of bitcoin are based around one thing and one thing alone – belief, the belief that these assets will have value in the future.      See also: Pondering Durian – Why >15% of My Net Worth Is in Bitcoin      And right now the collective belief in bitcoin is increasing. The cult is becoming a religion. Don’t just take my word for it though. There are plenty of articles (see here, here and here) that discuss this increased adoption within the investment community. And if this trend continues (as it probably will), then we are even less likely to see a future without bitcoin.    How will bitcoin behave?    Now that bitcoin is here to stay, you might be wondering how it will behave in the future. Will increased adoption lead to higher prices? I have no idea! What I do know is bitcoin is a speculative asset class. Therefore, we should look at other speculative asset classes as a guide for how bitcoin might behave. And I believe there is no better speculative asset to use for this comparison than the early years of gold as an investment.      While gold has been around for millennia as a form of money, it wasn’t until August 1974 in the U.S. that it was an investable asset class. And in the six years following its reintroduction to the investment community (1974-1980), gold tripled in value in real terms (i.e., the yellow line below):      But since that tripling, it hasn’t performed all that well. Though bitcoin is unlikely to follow a similar path to gold, it is likely to exhibit similar behavior. This means bitcoin will continue to have huge run-ups in price followed by violent crashes that may last years (and possibly decades) in the future. We have already seen this kind of behavior from bitcoin before and I am quite confident we will see it again.    The difference between bitcoin and gold is that bitcoin is still gaining adoption among investors.    The difference between bitcoin and gold is that bitcoin is still gaining adoption among investors. Will that continue at its current pace into the future? Who knows? However, if bitcoin’s market capitalization were to match that of gold, it would be worth over $500,000 a coin. This is why some investors are so bullish on bitcoin.      However, there are still some reasons to be bearish. The main one is that bitcoin is associated with some of the most speculative investment activity out there. This is most apparent when comparing its price movement to the price movement of another speculative cryptocurrency – dogecoin. Though you may not have heard of dogecoin, it is an alternative crypto currency (altcoin) that is kind of an inside joke on the internet.      And since dogecoin’s price is a clear indicator of speculative behavior, if we look at the correlation between dogecoin and bitcoin we can get a better feel for how much speculation might be occurring in bitcoin at any point in time:      As you can see, over the last three years the correlation between dogecoin and bitcoin has been quite high, with the most recent correlation reading around 0.8.      But if we compare dogecoin to gold, we see that the correlation between their prices tends to center around 0:      This is just more evidence that bitcoin is associated with speculative activity and will continue to behave like a speculative asset in the future.    Is there a right way to invest in bitcoin?    Though I have changed my mind on bitcoin, I haven’t necessarily changed my view on how one should invest in it. I believe the only prudent way to invest in this asset class without any long-term negative repercussions is to hold no more than 2% of your portfolio in it. I wouldn’t recommend this approach for everyone, but it may work for some people. By limiting your exposure to 2% of your portfolio you’re unlikely to get rich, but you’re unlikely to go bankrupt either.      Why 2%? This was the allocation I got when I worked out the optimal portfolio back in October 2017. Anything more than 2% adds too much risk (per unit return) to your portfolio and anything less than 2% reduces your returns (per unit risk) too much. Of course, the optimal portfolio is the best solution for the past, not the future. Either way, I don’t see the harm in a 2% allocation, but please do your own research first.      See also: Ajit Tripathi – Why I’m Long Crypto, Short DLT      The biggest risk I see to owning bitcoin going forward isn’t a price crash (which is inevitable), but the possibility of a government ban on ownership. This might seem outlandish but in April 1933 the U.S. government banned the ownership of gold bullion/coinage for all U.S. citizens. The reasons for that ban are very different from a bitcoin ban that could happen today, but with the recent Securities and Exchange Commission complaint against Ripple I wouldn’t rule it out completely.      Lastly, I might be wrong on many of the things I have stated today or in the past. But I don’t blog so that I can be “right.” I do it so I can learn more about investing and get closer to the truth. As economist John Maynard Keynes (or Paul Samuelson) supposedly said:    When the facts change, I change my mind.

The cryptocurrency’s most recent rally came as the Bitcoin network celebrated its 12th Genesis Block day, on Jan. 3 – the anniversary of when the first bitcoin block was mined in 2009.    Top shelf    CBDC experiment Ukraine plans to launch a digital version of its hryvnia currency on the Stellar blockchain. This is the latest in a series of projects projects from European governmental and institutional players that have sided with Stellar, including a euro stablecoin effort and a tokenized bond pilot from one of the world’s oldest banks.      Red envelopes Shenzhen is doubling the amount of digital yuan residents can win in a lottery (up to 200 yuan) meant to test its novel, government-backed payments system. The Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DCEP) platform is the most advanced and visible CBDC experiment to date.      Imminent launch An Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution expects to mainnet on Jan. 15 (The Block). Edan Yago, a Bitcoin developer, argued in a recent op-ed that the rise of off-chain scaling solutions may portent the demise of alternative tokens.

The idea is to allow cryptocurrency projects to sell tokens that are locked until maturity.  DELISTING, DERISKING: Bittrex will delist monero, dash and zcash in the latest swing against “privacy coins.”  VENTURE GROWTH: Crypto venture funding grew 32.5% to $5.7 million in 2020, according to The Block.  BTC AT 12: Forkast gives a rundown of bitcoin's ""three lives.""  At stake    Open interest Bitcoin climbed from around $19,000 to over $30,000 in the last four weeks of 2020 – a meteoric rise that several industry observers think is likely to continue. Yesterday, the cryptocurrency set a new high of $34,347 before hitting a “much-needed reset.”      As bitcoin ventures out into uncharted territory, many institutional and retail traders are placing bets on its future price. As of Sunday, there is more than $10 billion in open futures contracts all seeking to profit on BTC’s rise or fall. This is a record amount of capital, according to crypto data firm Skew.      Futures give traders the right to buy or sell assets at a predetermined price, at a specified date or within a window of opportunity. They’re a way to gain exposure to a market without necessarily holding the underlying asset. A type of financial product, futures and other options invite institutional players into crypto markets.      As Skew CEO Emanuel Goh told CoinDesk Research Director Noelle Acheson: “In 2020, institutions finally embraced bitcoin but not always in the way one would expect. For instance, sophisticated investors such as hedge funds have been looking at capturing spreads by looking at the inefficiencies of this nascent market. This has translated in particular to leveraged funds positioning of CME bitcoin futures making new record shorts almost on a weekly basis in the last quarter of 2020.”      In fact, last week the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) topped the charts in terms of bitcoin futures open interest, with more than $1.66 billion at stake. CME has become synonymous with institutional crypto involvement. Other derivatives platforms, including BitMEX, OKEx and Huobi are also seeing growing interest.      This influx of capital, coupled with bitcoin's 24/7, global market infrastructure has led to some far-out speculation. Last week, one of the largest crypto options trading platforms Deribit opened a market allowing people to bet bitcoin will climb to $200,000 by Dec. 21, 2021.      Volatility is the name of the game. As bitcoin tumbled nearly 15% below $30,000 trading yesterday – the steepest since it crossed $20,000 in December – billions worth of futures and options positions were liquidated.      Industry publication Decrypt (citing data from tracking site Bybt) reported over $1.14 billion was liquidated during this price pullback. Liquidations happen automatically when bitcoin’s price falls below a trader’s leveraged position.      As several cryptoratti have already pointed out – bitcoin’s $6,000 drop (and bounce back) was larger than what the crypto was worth at its lowest point last year.

42385518,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27RN,1609782307,Bitcoin Mining Machine Shortage Worsens as Bitmain Sells Out Through August,"Even though leading bitcoin mining manufacturer Bitmain doubled prices to capitalize on overwhelming demand resulting from the surge in the price of bitcoin, it still pre-sold three months of inventory in a few weeks.      In early December, Bitmain was pre-selling bitcoin ASIC miners with an expected shipping date of May 2021, per CoinDesk’s prior reporting. Less than a month later, Bitmain has sold out through August 2021 and has raised its prices significantly.      In late November, Bitmain’s Antminer S19 was priced at $1,897. Now, the same machine sells for $3,769, a 98% markup.      Bitmain’s prices have gone up, said Kevin Zhang, vice president of business development for New York-based mining company Foundry, noting that demand for new ASICs shows no sign of abating soon. “But there also has been very limited extra allocation for May though July next year for S19s and S19 Pro models.”      With miners eager to buy any available machines, secondary mining markets continue to benefit from primary manufacturers’ low inventory, with activity surging to its highest levels since 2017. Prices for more efficient, second-hand models have climbed to 12-month highs, per Luxor Technologies market data.      “Secondary markets are also booming”, said Amanda Fabiano, head of mining at Galaxy Digital. “S9s that were being sold in May 2019 for $20 are now being sold at $130 on some channels,” she told CoinDesk in an email.      The surge in mining activity comes as bitcoin ended 2020 with a more than 300% gain, currently trading just below $31,000. Miner revenue has also soared, with the dollar amount earned per terahash per second (TH/s) reaching $0.25 Sunday, its highest level since August 2019, per data from Luxor.      To meet growing market demand, Bitmain has “been enhancing the efficiency and capabilities of our manufacturing facilities,” said International Marketing Director Nathaniel Yu.      But Yu doesn’t expect demand for mining machines to subside anytime soon as “more institutional investors take interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.”      Fabiano described the current mining machine market conditions as a “perfect storm” for supply constraints: limited capacity at the foundries, larger facilities buying up supply and companies with strong balance sheets entering the market with the ability to place massive orders.    Those massive orders are coming from mining firms like Riot Blockchain (RIOT)https://hashrateindex.com/stocks/riot, which bought over 31,000 new machines this year; Core Scientific, which bought 59,000 machines from Bitmain in one order, and Marathon Patent Group (MARA)https://hashrateindex.com/stocks/mara which expanded its mining fleet to over 100,000 machines.    “At this rate, hardware procurement will continue to be an obstacle throughout 2021,” Fabiano said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/04/bitcoin-mining-machine-shortage-worsens-as-bitmain-sells-out-through-august,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7fd5173ae539c28f0f511fab72a87891b48b086-837x576.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385514,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27L5,1609780803,We Don’t Need a New Regulator to Have Better Crypto Regulation,"Most crypto firms complain there are too many regulatory bodies globally and particularly in the U.S., and protest that this overlapping and even contradictory regulation stymies growth and innovation. The “alphabet soup” of U.S. federal regulatory bodies – the SEC, CFTC, DOJ, FDIC, FTC and IRS, to name a few – is just the beginning.      At the state level, there are 50 attorneys general to contend with, not to mention the various state agencies and regulators that enforce the myriad of laws passed by state legislatures and applied by the courts. Digital currency has no borders, and while regulators do, they can extend their regulatory reach if markets, consumers and institutions in their jurisdictions are impacted.    Donna Parisi is the Global Head of Financial Services and FinTech at law firm Shearman & Sterling. Sandra Ro is a former derivatives banker and market infrastructure executive and the CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council, a Swiss industry non-profit building the next multi-trillion dollar industry through partnership, education, and advocacy.    Some crypto startups and fintech leaders have advocated for a new regulatory body that would supersede these myriad of regulators, as a way to streamline regulatory compliance and reduce overlap between competing agencies. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in the U.K., is frequently cited as an example of a central superseding agency that recognizes and promotes innovation through its policies, and many have advocated for a parallel agency in the U.S. Some fintech leaders have even threatened to leave the U.S. entirely, and relocate to friendlier regulatory regimes in the U.K. or elsewhere.      No question, it is painful and costly today for young crypto startups and even mature fintechs to navigate the matrix of federal and state regulations. But despite the seemingly chaotic and burdensome regulatory structure, the U.S. system provides confidence to both investors and consumers.      This approach to regulation of digital assets allows innovation to flourish by preventing fraud, unhealthy speculation and asset bubbles. To spark innovation and stay competitive with other international markets, U.S. regulators need to reduce “grey areas” so more fintechs and entrepreneurs can clearly navigate the rules of the road. The problem is not the many regulators in the U.S. but rather this lack of clarity and overlapping regulations.      The many U.S. regulatory bodies are creatures of different laws that were passed in response to different national crises – the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) was integral to the development of a national banking system to finance the Civil War, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) were established in the wake of the Great Depression, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council was part of the reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act. What has been inherited is a complex regulatory landscape with many different regulators and statutory mandates. For example, whereas the SEC and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) are principally charged with investor and consumer protection, the U.S. federal banking agencies are focused on the safety and soundness of banking institutions and the stability of the financial system itself.    Despite the seemingly chaotic and burdensome regulatory structure, the U.S. system provides confidence to both investors and consumers.    Having one monolith of a regulator may be an easier, one-stop shop in the short run, but that model also can pose significant challenges and risks if that regulator gets things wrong. While it may be more complex, the U.S. regulatory system breeds lasting investor and market confidence.      Given the wide latitude of regulators, particularly in the regulation of fintech and financial innovation, the result are regulations that can be flexible and elastic as technology evolves. The existence of several federal financial regulators means that no single regulator will set the standard for “all things crypto.” The diversity of state-level regulation also can help inform which regulatory approaches work and which do not. In some sense, regulatory agencies may compete with one another in striking the right balance between innovation and safety and soundness. At the state level, New York and Wyoming are examples of states that have led the way (albeit in different ways) on the regulation of digital assets. Time will tell which approach is more effective in the long run.      These tensions between regulators are frustrating at times. For instance, it has meant the U.S. has lagged in the development of coordinated, comprehensive “regulatory sandboxes” that other jurisdictions, with much slimmer regulatory systems, have fostered. But ultimately this uniquely American regulatory landscape may result in a more stable market that can solidly mature in a stable fashion. Regulators in the U.S. take pride that they have cultivated a highly stable financial system that is an envy to the world. Innovation, however, prods them to not be left behind on the global stage.      Regulatory complexity is not new. While it might make life more complicated for some crypto businesses, it is consistent with the way that financial regulators in the U.S. approach regulation generally. There is nothing magical about digital assets.      For any new product or service, regulators still need to ask and answer these questions: what is the activity, who does it touch, how could this activity damage the financial system or harm users, how could the markets and consumers benefit for example by increased access, lower fees and more transparency? While these questions are clear, the answers are complex and often intersecting.      But why not do away with all of this regulatory overlap, and create a single agency to oversee crypto and digital assets at least at the federal level?      First and foremost, this would take an act of Congress. Given the low probability for bipartisan agreement on new legislation in a divided Washington, the responsibility falls to the regulators to leverage their powers and elastic regulations in a creative way. Coordination and communication, however, is key and very achievable.      To this end, a council should be formed to share knowledge and experience and to avoid redundancies and enhance communication between regulatory bodies and all participants in the system. The council could be modeled, at least in part, on the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, which seeks to enhance the integrity, efficiency, orderliness and competitiveness of U.S. financial markets while maintaining investor confidence. The work of any such council could benefit significantly by having a broadened membership to include not only regulators but thought leaders from academia, the non-profit sector and the start-up community.      In September, bank regulators from 49 states released a plan to streamline compliance examinations for money service businesses (MSB). This will save time and money for both the companies and the regulators, and makes it easier for MSBs to do business across the U.S. This model of a collaborative approach gives us a roadmap to achieve better and more efficient regulation across the U.S.. Applying this same spirit of collaboration to other areas like KYC processes, capital raising and passporting licenses would similarly reduce frictions and allow for compliant, seamless and less costly ways for startups to do business. A collaborative approach is also more likely to weather shifting political winds, avoiding partisan squabbling that has hobbled the work of the CFPB, for example.      We do not need a new super-regulator for digital currency. Instead, we need to improve communication and collaboration among regulators, entrepreneurs, investors and banks. Doing so will strengthen oversight, protect consumers, maintain market integrity and, perhaps most important, lead to a financial system that is better equipped to meet the challenges of the future.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Sandra Ro, Donna Parisi",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/04/we-dont-need-a-new-regulator-to-have-better-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aac335439f68cb2f5ec7b590ea3e44a19acb8a47-1040x992.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

District Judge Vanessa Baraitser said Assange's poor mental health rules out sending him to face charges of espionage and the hacking of government computers under section 91(3) of the Extradition Act 2003.  Assange is wanted by U.S. authorities over the publication of classified documents between 2010 and 2011 relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In the ruling, Judge Baraitser said Assange's mental condition is such that, if extradited to the U.S. and kept in isolated conditions, there is a ""high risk"" of suicide.  According to detailed psychiatric reports and assessments, Assange has been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome and has a history of mental health issues.  U.S. authorities have 14 days in which to appeal and are expected to do so. For now, Assange will remain in custody at Belmarsh Prison, according to The Guardian.

U.S.-based Marathon reported Monday that following the previously announced shelf offering, it had ended the 2020 fiscal year with $217.6 million in cash and 74,656,549 shares outstanding.

42385525,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27bR,1609769410,First Mover: Bitcoin's Plunge to $31K Shows How Bullish Market Had Become,"Bitcoin (BTC) suffered its biggest pullback in four months, tumbling 9% after a seven-day winning streak that took prices to a new all-time high of $34,347 on Sunday.      “Bitcoin is having a much-needed reset,” Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk.      Some analysts saw signs that cryptocurrency traders might be rotating out of bitcoin into digital-market alternatives like ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC). Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, rocketed 27% on Sunday and hit a 35-month high above $1,150 early Monday. Litecoin, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, was changing hands at its highest since April 2018.      In traditional markets, European indexes rose on the first trading day of the year, buoyed by encouraging signs of a manufacturing recovery, and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open. Gold strengthened 1.9% to $1,935 an ounce.    Market moves    Cryptocurrency markets so far in 2021 have been looking a lot like they did in 2020: Prices are up.      After quadrupling last year, bitcoin has gained about 7% in the first few days of January. That's nearly half the gains that the Standard & Poor's 500 Index mustered over the entirety of 2020.      Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, soared 26% on Sunday alone, pushing past the $1,000 mark for the first time since February 2018. The digital asset's price rose nearly five-fold last year.      And even with last month's 67% plunge in prices for what had been the third-biggest digital asset, XRP (XRP), the crypto industry's total market capitalization has more than doubled in the past two months to about $883 billion.      ""At the current trajectory, we can estimate that we'll easily break the $1 trillion mark within the next few months,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis Quantum Economics, wrote last week.      For context, recall that it was big news in traditional markets when the outstanding amount of U.S. ""leveraged loans"" – those made to companies with junk-grade credit ratings – grew to about $500 billion in late 2010, and then doubled to $1 trillion by early 2018.      Such rapid (and frankly astounding) growth in digital-asset markets should theoretically send any responsible financial journalist scrambling to round up experts who might speak to the growing risks.      But aside from the usual warnings that cryptocurrencies are volatile and prone to unexpected and punishing price corrections, analysts and traders say it's likely that institutional adoption of bitcoin, ether and an array of other digital tokens is just beginning.      And that prices are far more likely at this point to keep rising than to suddenly reverse, absent any major surprises akin to last year's pandemic, which sent stocks swinging wildly, from American Airlines to Zoom.      Jim Bianco, a widely followed Wall Street veteran who now heads Bianco Research, tweeted on Jan. 2 that bitcoin ""makes Tesla look like it is standing still,"" referring to the electric carmaker's stock price.      First Mover has previously discussed that as bitcoin enters uncharted territory, investors reading price-chart patterns – a widely followed practice among crypto traders known as “technical analysis” – have fewer signposts to key off.      Just a month ago, when the cryptocurrency was changing hands around $19,000, Kraken Intelligence, a research unit of the digital-asset exchange Kraken, published results of a survey noting that clients expect an average price of $36,602 in 2021. Were such predictions to prove on target, bitcoin's biggest gains for the year would already be in the books.      But well-respected pros in both digital-asset markets and on Wall Street have recently bandied about price predictions from $50,000 to $400,000.      The truth is nobody knows where prices are heading, just as nobody can say for sure that the 2021 economy will be any brighter than the bleak 2020 that just ended. Or how much additional money the Federal Reserve and central banks around the world might have to create to finance stimulus measures and prop up financial markets.      What seems clear is that, for now anyway, ""there is little sign that the rally is over,"" as Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency firm Diginex, put it Sunday in his daily newsletter.      ""Bitcoin has started the year exactly as it ended the last - bid,"" Blom wrote.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin pulled back sharply early Monday in a move typical to bull market correction.      Prices fell from $33,000 to $28,000 before bouncing back to $30,000. The sharp correction has erased the rally from $29,000 to over $34,000 in the previous three days.      A correction appeared to be in the offing, with the perpetual-swap funding rate – a proxy for the cost of maintaining a long position in the derivatives market – reaching an 11-month high of 0.137% early today. An elevated funding rate can signal excessive bullish leverage and often yields pullbacks similar to the one seen in late November. Even with Monday's price drop, the funding rate has declined only slightly to 0.122%.      According to trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe, bitcoin came under pressure as the spread between EUR/USDT (euro's tether-denominated exchange) and the EUR/USD spot rate normalized. EUR/USDT had jumped to 1.33 on Saturday - a 9% premium to the EUR/USD spot rate of 1.23 seen on Friday, according to the data provider TradingView.      ""That possibly pushed bitcoin's tether-denominated price higher,"" Poppe said, adding that the premium began normalizing early Monday. Tether (USDT) is the biggest dollar-linked stablecoin by amount outstanding.      Investors expect the cryptocurrency to trade volatile over the next four weeks. That's evident from the rise in the one-month implied volatility to near 100%, the highest level since March 2020, according to data provider Skew.      Analysts, however, expect bitcoin dips to be short-lived.

42385516,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27Q7,1609768828,Ukraine Government Picks Stellar Development Foundation to Help Build National Digital Currency,"Ukraine’s government has chosen the Stellar blockchain network as a platform to build a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      Announced Monday, the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to build out a “virtual assets ecosystem and national digital currency of Ukraine.”      The National Bank of Ukraine has been researching the possibility of CBDC implementation since 2017, and the Stellar partnership will now be the basis of its virtual currency development, according to Digital Transformation and IT Deputy Minister Oleksandr Bornyakov.      “The Ministry of Digital Transformation is working on creating the legal environment for the development of virtual assets in Ukraine,” Bornyakov said in a statement. “We believe our cooperation with the Stellar Development Foundation will contribute to development of the virtual asset industry and its integration into the global financial ecosystem.”      Stellar, the cryptocurrency and non-profit organization launched in 2014 by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, was selected last month by German bank Bankhaus von der Heydt (BVDH) as the means to issue a euro stablecoin. German regulator BaFIN has also approved the issuance of tokenized bonds on Stellar.    See also: One of the World’s Oldest Banks Is Issuing a Euro Stablecoin on Stellar    Stellar Development Foundation CEO Denelle Dixon said the partnership with Ukraine’s government and other stakeholders to digitize the hryvnia will officially launch this month.      ""We've been in conversations with governments and institutions all over the world about the key considerations for issuing CBDCs. It's important to remember many, if not all, of these organizations weren't designed to be technology companies and that they have many audiences that they are supporting,"" Dixon said via an email. ""That makes a public-private partnership so essential to getting this right.""      The National Bank of Ukraine mentioned the use of a “private version of the Stellar blockchain” as part of its E-hryvnia Pilot Project back in 2019.      Stellar’s consensus mechanism (SCP) gives issuers unique certainties they wouldn’t have on other public blockchains (like issuer-enforced finality), according to Stellar COO Jason Chlipala.      ""SCP would well serve a central bank, reflecting the trusted relationships it would hold and ultimately award it a significant vote in the consensus protocol,"" Chlipala told CoinDesk via email.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/04/ukraine-government-picks-stellar-development-foundation-to-help-build-national-digital-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f650e8af440aea90892a6856dd3c15bfb62a1e6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385522,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27Xf,1609756546,Bitcoin Suddenly Drops 13% as Altcoins Continue to Rise,"Bitcoin has shed much of the weekend's stellar gains, as relatively cheap alternative cryptocurrencies play catchup with the crypto market leader.      At the press-time price of around $29,000, bitcoin is down over 13% on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Prices have declined by well over $4,000 in the last two hours, having reached a record high of $34,347 on Sunday.      ""Bitcoin is having a much-needed reset. After a period of increased leverage and high [perpetual] funding rates across derivatives platforms, a brief consolidation around these levels is required,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk.      Bitcoin's perpetual funding rate (the cost of holding long positions) jumped to an 11-month high of 0.137% early today, signaling excess bullish leverage and scope for a price drop similar to the one seen in late November. With the pullback, the funding rate has declined only slightly to 0.122%.      Trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe said a correction was overdue after the overextended vertical move.      The cryptocurrency surged by $5,000 to above $34,000 in the first three days of 2021, having rallied by over 165% in the final quarter of 2020. The breakout above $30,000 happened alongside large outflows from the Coinbase Pro exchange, a sign of institutions buying the cryptocurrency, according to some analysts.      ""Most likely money is shifting from bitcoin towards altcoins or just temporary profit-taking is causing a price drop,"" Poppe told CoinDesk. Investors may have rotated some money out of bitcoin and into relatively cheap prominent alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether, stellar, chainlink and litecoin. These coins have outperformed bitcoin in the past 24 hours.      Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose to 35-month highs above $1,150 early Monday and is currently trading near $920, representing an 11% gain on a 24-hour basis. At press time, litecoin is changing hands at its highest since April 2018, and bitcoin cash is trading at 11-month highs.      Ether was was up 30% during the early European trading hours before it was dragged lower by bitcoin. Other coins have also trimmed gains, but are still outperforming bitcoin.      See also: DOGE’s Gone Wild! Meme Coin Soars After Adult Star Says She’s a HODLer      Dibb predicted a continued rotation of capital into ether and other altcoins as bitcoin slows down. However, options market data shows investors expect bitcoin to remain highly volatile in the short-run.      Bitcoin's one-month implied volatility, which gauges investors' expectation of how volatile an asset would be over the next four weeks, has risen to near 100%, the highest level since March 2020, according to data source Skew.      ""Bitcoin's implied volatility has hit a ten-month high because options traders assume that the major moves in the price action over the past ten days – which has seen BTC increase to well over $34,000 – will continue,"" Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks said.      Analysts, however, expect bitcoin dips to be short-lived.

The lottery is aimed to test China's in-development central bank digital currency in the hands of the public.  A total of 100,000 red envelopes will be distributed, with winners to be awarded 200 digital yuan each to spend from Jan. 7 until Jan. 17 at around 10,000 physical merchants.  Red envelopes are a common way of gifting cash in China on special holidays or occasions such as weddings.  The nation is accelerating its push toward the adoption of a digital currency. The People’s Bank of China has been working with banks and commercial entities on public pilots to gauge user experience.  Shenzhen held a similar lottery in October 2020, handing out a total of 10 million digital yuan (worth around $1.5 million) to winners.

42385523,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27Yv,1609751163,"Ether Price Passes $1,150 to Hit Highest Since January 2018","Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, chalked up fresh multi-year highs early on Monday after a double-digit rally last week.      At around 06:35 UTC, ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, reached $1,151 – a level last seen in January 2018, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Prices rose over 40% last week to register the biggest weekly gain since December 2018.      ""The ether slingshot has arrived and is playing catchup to big brother bitcoin,"" Jehan Chu, CEO at Hong Kong-based trading firm Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk. ""While ether hasn't established a store of value narrative, its relatively low price is becoming irresistible to Wall Street investors drunk on bitcoin gains.""      At the press-time price of $1,020, ether is still down around 43% from the record price of $1,433 observed in January 2017. Bitcoin surpassed its December 2017 peak of $19,783 last month and soared as high as $34,545. MicroStrategy and several other publicly listed companies diversified their cash holdings into bitcoin in the second half of 2020, likely boosting the crypto market leader's price.      According to Chu, MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor and SkyBridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci are now playing chicken over who will first make an ether investment. ""Once they make a move, we can expect a mad rush to $2,000,"" he said.      John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital, also said ether could challenge all-time highs. ""Ether trading volumes are closing on bitcoin trading volumes. That shows an aggressive move by bulls into ether,"" he said.      ""Top-tier"" exchanges have registered ether trading volume of over $19 billion in the past 24 hours, versus $16 billion in bitcoin, according to data source CryptoCompare. So, ether is now the biggest cryptocurrency by trading volume. However, its $120 billion market capitalization is still far below bitcoin's $600 billion.      Aside from increased demand, ether seems to be benefitting from a drying up of sell-side liquidity, according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.      Exchange reserves of ether are down 20% compared to May 2020. The slide is likely the result of investors taking direct custody of ether or moving their coins to decentralized finance or staking on Ethereum 2.0, creating a shortage of ether supply in the market.
