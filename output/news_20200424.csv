Announced late Friday, the unidentified owner of the site tried to sell the domain to an undercover agent with the Department of Homeland Security's Criminal Investigations unit, who said they wanted to use the site to sell fake COVID-19 testing kits, a plan the owner reportedly said was ""genius.""      According to a warrant attached to the press release, the owner of coronaprevention.org, referred to as ""Subject A,"" listed the domain for sale on a forum ""known to focus on content related to, and populated by users interested in, hacking and hijacking online accounts"" a day after U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency due to the virus.      The undercover agent reached out, and Subject A allegedly said they were charging $500 payable in bitcoin for the domain (according to the warrant, such domains are usually closer to $20). The agent ultimately sent a partial payment to an undisclosed bitcoin address.      The news comes on the heels of the DOJ's announcement that it had ""disrupted"" hundreds of domains that were being used to shill scams related to COVID-19.      A list of the domains seized was not available, and it is unclear whether Friday's seizure was related. However, earlier this week a DOJ spokesperson told CoinDesk, “The department is aware of the reported increase in COVID-19-related fraud involving various virtual payment platforms and appreciates the proactive assistance of many in the cryptocurrency community to thwart those schemes.”      The spokesperson did not respond to an additional question about which entities it was working with.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/24/us-authorities-freeze-covid-19-website-alleged-scammer-tried-to-sell-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c49f8270046075322f96dca920dfe234e487e13-1342x941.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431827,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6g1h,1587760144,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Steady at $7.5K as Short Sellers Back Off,"Since Thursday’s jolt in bitcoin prices, the cryptocurrency has traded in a tight range close to the $7,500 level. It has not only come back from the losses suffered in March, it’s also showing some upward momentum.      The price for one BTC is currently above 10-day and 50-moving averages on the daily charts, a bullish technical signal. “Despite the mid-March 2020 bitcoin sell-off when we saw a close to 50 percent drop, it has now, within a month, recovered 95 percent,” said Antoni Trenchev co-founder of crypto lender Nexo.      Thursday’s jump in bitcoin price, briefly as high as $7,800 on some spot exchanges, hurt short sellers in the crypto derivatives market. Those trades betting on crypto prices going downward have not returned to derivatives exchanges like BitMEX, said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of exchange platform Alpha5.      “What we saw yesterday was a collapse in open interest, and no real premium being built into the futures curve,” he told CoinDesk. As short sellers were wiped out on BitMEX Thursday during the bitcoin price spike, open interest dropped and it hasn’t recovered.      “It's tough for me to digest that there's new capital funneling in; it's likely capital within the ecosystem sloshing around and targeting pain points,” Shah added. “It feels pretty firm, with the next battle trench likely in the $7,850 - $8,000 region.”      Inflows are needed to push crypto prices higher. Bitcoin’s year-to-date high was $10,510 on spot exchanges like Coinbase back on Feb. 13 and more capital into crypto will be needed to push the markets higher.      “Demand continues to be steady. You have to remember that for bitcoin to stay at these levels, you need inflows of new dollars matching supply of new coins,” said Daniel Masters, chairman of U.K.-based asset manager CoinShares.      That being said, Masters anticipates most investors holding rather than selling ahead of the bitcoin halving in mid-May - with the exception of miners, who need cash to pay for operational expenditures like energy costs and data center leases.      Read More:Bitcoin Halving, Explained      “Analysis of wallets shows most tourists and speculators have sold, meaning we don’t expect many folks to sell into the halving except for miners who may be anticipating some pain around and are trying to lock in opex costs,” said Masters.    Crypto markets    As bitcoin remains in sideways trading and price is flat, ether (ETH) has lost less than 1 percent in the past 24 hours.      Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board had mixed performances Friday. The biggest winners Friday include cardano (ADA), up 4.2 percent, neo (NEO), higher by 3.9 percent, and tron (TRON) gaining 2.8 percent.      Losers Friday include zcash (ZEC) off 2.9 percent, stellar (XLM) slipping 1.8 percent and decred (DCR) in the red less by than a percent. All price changes are as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).    Other markets    Oil was in the green Friday, up 1.3 percent as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT) Friday after a historic week of lows in the spot and futures markets. For the past two months, the fossil fuel has actually been more volatilethan bitcoin.      Gold dipped sharply in trading Friday but recovered a bit but is still down less than a percent as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).      In the United States, the S&P 500 index climbed 1.3 percent as Federal Reserve data recently published shows its balance sheet has jumped sharply on stimulus.      U.S. Treasury yields are all down on the day as investors jump to the safety of bonds.

42431816,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6flh,1587757832,Public Opinion Shifts on Big Tech and Privacy During Pandemic,"Recent polling finds the COVID-19 pandemic has softened the backlash against big tech firms. A majority of Americans now support tech firms being involved in tracing COVID-19, for example.      The recent round of polling is a turnaround from 2019. In 2015, 71 percent of Americans said tech companies had a positive impact on the United States, with that number falling to only 50 percent by 2019, according to the Pew Research Center. Over those same years, negative views of tech went from the high teens to 33 percent.      But during the pandemic tech companies are stepping into a new field — public health. Google and Apple have announced an initiative to support contact tracing through Bluetooth technology, which tracks when people come in contact with an infected person. MIT researchers have developed an app to serve a similar purpose, and other tech companies are lending their support to help combat COVID-19 in a variety of ways.      Taken together, the results from a number of different polls raise questions about a continued desire for products and services that focus on privacy and security, which were the beneficiaries of an estimated $124 billion in spending on this industry in 2019, according to Gartner estimates.      A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll covering late April found 68 percent of Americans would now share their COVID-19 test results with officials using an app, though that dropped to 45 percent if the app tracks with whom they come into contact and sends them alerts if one of those people tests positive for coronavirus. Such measures are currently on the table in the U.S. and Europe.      See also: For Contact Tracing to Work, Americans Will Have to Trust Google and Apple      Even so, people have an improved view of tech companies generally during the pandemic.      Thirty-eight percent of Americans say their view of the tech industry is more positive since the start of the outbreak, according to a Harris/Axios poll. Forty percent said the tech industry should be providing solutions, and an overwhelming 81 percent said they support large tech companies helping with contact tracing.      The results are heartening for public health officials given that any contact tracing app in the U.S. would likely not be mandatory, and a recent study said any such app would need to be adopted by 60 percent of a population to be effective.      The question is whether these positive feelings hold when the pandemic passes. To companies that have built their businesses around the notion of privacy as a commodity that's here to stay, that seems unlikely. Previous distrust of big tech companies that came to a head as a result of data and privacy violations have expanded the Overton window, a publicly acceptable range of policy proposals, in such a way that makes privacy a fixture of our world, not a passing fad.    The question is whether these positive feelings hold when the pandemic passes.    Tor Bair, the Head of Growth at Enigma, a decentralized, open source protocol, said privacy and security will always be essential, even if user attitudes towards privacy fluctuate over time.      “If big tech firms commit to defending the privacy and security of their users by default, then users will expect privacy as a universal value,” said Bair. “Anyone who then takes advantage of that trust will be punished by users, not to mention regulators. In this world, privacy technologies become an essential core of any product.”      And while consumer views go back and forth when it comes to trusting Apple or Google, for example, there are still industrial clients such as oil or shipping companies that see the ability to share data privately and securely as a fundamentally part of their businesses, according to Duncan Greatwood, CEO of Xage Security. His company provides a decentralized platform for protecting the industrial internet of things, among other data security measures.      “I think that a crisis like this does give people a bit of a pause and say, 'Maybe privacy isn’t quite as important as I thought it was,'” said Greatwood. “But I do believe that once this crisis is past, people will care about their privacy. That’s certainly the case in the industrial world we operate in.""      Looking beyond the pandemic, a National Research Group polling report published just days ago found two out of three Americans are excited about how technology can “accelerate positive trends on the other side of the curve.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/24/public-opinion-shifts-on-big-tech-and-privacy-during-pandemic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db091d6163f9118a1679015c72b87d1d743c9542-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431819,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6frh,1587754294,Why Global Deflation May Not Be Bad News for Bitcoin,"Contrary to expectations, bitcoin could see a positive performance during a possible bout of global deflation if it acts not just as an investment asset, but as a medium of exchange and a perceived safe haven like gold.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is widely considered to be a hedge against inflation because its supply is capped at 21 million and its monetary policy is pre-programmed to cut the pace of supply expansion by 50 percent every four years.      As such, one may consider any deflationary collapse as a price-bearish development for bitcoin. Talk of deflation began earlier this month after the U.S. reported massive job losses due to the coronavirus outbreak. The prospects of a deflationary collapse have strengthened with this week’s oil price crash.      “The oil price rout will send a deflationary wave through the global economy,” tweeted popular macro analyst Holger Zschaepitz on Tuesday.      Read more: First Mover: What the Oil Price Collapse Means for Bitcoin’s Halving Valuation      Cash typically becomes king during deflation because the drop in the general price levels boosts the monetary unit’s purchasing power, or the ability to purchase goods and services.      “Unlike inflation, when people try to get out of the dollar because it's losing value, during deflation people are more comfortable with the dollar because its value is going up,” said Erick Pinos, ecosystem lead for the Americas at the public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform Ontology.      The rush for cash, however, may not have a substantially negative impact on bitcoin’s price because deflation would also boost the purchasing power of the cryptocurrency.      “While the price per coin may stagnate during a period of aggressive economic deflation, the inherent buying power of the currency will actually rise, possibly quite significantly,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO of the bitcoin ATM provider Bitcoin Depot.    As time goes on and people become more comfortable with digital assets, the average person begins to see Bitcoin as a legitimate viable alternative to gold.    The uptick in the purchasing power will likely draw greater demand for bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency is already used as means of payment.      “Hundreds of thousands of businesses, brands and merchants do accept the ‘digital gold’ as payment, and thousands more every day are realizing the benefits of diversifying their revenue stream and accepting bitcoin as payment for their goods and services,” said Derek Muhney, director of sales and marketing at Coinsource, the world’s leader in Bitcoin ATMs.      Moreover, the cryptocurrency’s appeal as a medium of exchange is likely to continue strengthening with the growing prevalence of technology in consumers' everyday lives caused by the coronavirus pandemic.    Digital gold    Ever since its inception, bitcoin has been dubbed “digital gold.” Like the yellow metal, the cryptocurrency is durable, fungible, divisible, recognizable and scarce.      Both assets share features that fulfill Aristotle’s call for a currency to be practical and functional. Bitcoin has actual utility as the means of payment, which gold lacks, according to Coinsource’s Muhney.      “As time goes on and people become more comfortable with digital assets, the average person begins to see Bitcoin as a legitimate viable alternative to gold. Thus, it's reasonable to assume that during a period of deflation bitcoin would perform well like gold has in the past,” said Erick Pinos, America's ecosystem lead at the public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform Ontology.      Read more: Looking for a Safe Haven Digital Asset? Try Gold      Hence, gold’s performance during the previous bouts of deflation could serve as a guide for bitcoin investors.      Historical data shows gold performs well during deflation, which includes a sharp rise in financial stress and increased risk of corporate defaults; highly levered companies tend to go bust during deflation because their revenues fall while their debt service payments remain the same.      Of course, gold’s shine is particularly bright during periods of inflation as well. As in periods of sizable deflation, inflation brings a set of price distortions that shake-up income statements and economies.      A commonly-used measure of stress is the “Ted spread” or the difference between the three-month U.S. interbank rate and the three-month T-Bill rate.      ""Massive spikes in the Ted spread in the 1970s were accompanied by a sharp rise in gold. The Ted spread also rose sharply in the early 1980s; in 1987 in the wake of the stock market crash and during the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 – both also periods of stronger gold prices,"" according to Oxford Economics' research note.      The real or inflation-adjusted price of gold rose an average 33 percent per annum in the 1970s, 18 percent in 1980s and 15.8 percent in 2000.      Underscoring all of the scenarios is that a sudden rise in economic stress usually fuels a global dash for cash, forcing investors to sell everything from stocks to gold. However, once economic uncertainty starts settling, people again start looking for safe havens.      “During the Great Recession, while gold initially declined alongside other equities, it found its footing and rallied faster than stocks recovered,” Ontology’s Pinos told CoinDesk.      The Ted spread spiked as high as 4.6 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in August 2008. Gold fell from $920 to $680 per troy ounce in the August to October period, as investors treated the yellow metal as a source of liquidity, but still ended that year with 5.5 percent gains. More importantly, it rallied by 24 percent in 2009 and went on to hit a record high above $1,900 in 2011.      Read more: First Mover: Bitcoin Jumps as Fed Assets Top $6.5T and Traders Focus on Halving      The yellow metal’s recent price gyrations suggest history may be repeating itself. As the Ted spread rose from 0.11 to 1.42 in the four weeks to March 27, gold fell from $1,700 to $1,450 yet is now trading near $1,725 per ounce, having hit a 7-year high of $1,747 ten days ago.      Bitcoin, too, was treated as a source of liquidity last month, as evidenced from the near 40 percent drop to levels under $4,000 seen on March 12. Since then, however, the cryptocurrency has risen by nearly 85 percent to $7,500.      If gold’s historical data and the recent market activity is a guide, then the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side.     Unprecedented stimulus to undermine fiat currencies    Both the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have unleashed massive amounts of liquidity into the system over the past few weeks to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.      Notably, the Fed is running an open-ended asset purchase program and its balance sheet has already risen to record highs above $6.5 trillion. Meanwhile, central banks from New Zealand to Canada have slashed rates to zero and have recently announced bond purchase programs.      What’s more, the amount of fiscal stimulus announced by 22 countries in March is equivalent to 75 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), according to JPMorgan.      However, most governments and central banks appear to have run out of ammo. Hence, if the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread or leads to corporate defaults, investors may lose trust in traditional finance and look for alternatives like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.      Moody's Analytics recently warned of the heightened risk of corporate defaults in the oil and gas sector across the globe, and weakness in entertainment and leisure giving way to pressure on consumer durables.      “The willingness to fight deflation should bode well for bitcoin,” said Richard Rosenblum, head of trading at GSR.      Meanwhile, Ashish Singhal, CEO and founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinswitch.co, said, “In a deflationary scenario, the chances of negative interest rates are high, and users would want to move their existing assets into more stable assets like bitcoin to prevent loss in their asset value.”      Interest rates are already set below zero across Europe and in Japan and are hovering at or near zero in other advanced countries.      Further, with central banks willing to do whatever it takes to defeat deflation, the real yield or inflation-adjusted returns on bonds are likely to remain negative or meagerly positive at best. As a result, zero-yielding assets like gold and bitcoin may attract more buyers.      Bank of America’s analysts noted earlier this week that the stimulus frenzy amid the coronavirus pandemic would put pressure on the currencies and send gold to $3,000 by October 2021.      While bitcoin could perform well during deflation, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have seldom tracked macro developments on a consistent basis in the past. “Blockchain-based currencies are really their own beasts,” said Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mitz.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/24/why-global-deflation-may-not-be-bad-news-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ad608b16645b9aac53c805b757c3c01dc7d522e-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431814,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6fhh,1587752774,China's National Blockchain Will Change the World,"Professor Michael Sung is founder and chairman of CarbonBlue Innovations, a tech transfer platform for commercializing internationally sourced blockchain, fintech and digital finance innovation in developing countries. He is also co-director of the Fintech Research Center at the Fanhai International School of Finance at Fudan University.      This week, China will officially launch a major new blockchain initiative called the Blockchain-based Services Network (BSN). The BSN is a critical part of China's national blockchain strategy that was announced by President Xi in late November 2019, but went largely under the radar as the simultaneous announcement of China’s digital RMB currency, called the DCEP, swept the world by storm. Only recently has the Western media recognized the significance of the BSN, which sees its mainland commercial launch April 25. The portal’s global commercial launch is scheduled for June 25.      See also: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption      Essentially, the BSN will be the backbone infrastructure technology for massive interconnectivity throughout the mainland, from city governments, to companies and individuals alike. The network will also form the backbone to the Digital Silk Road to provide interconnectivity to all of China's trade partners around the globe. The BSN will be a new internet protocol to allow a more efficient way to share data, value and digital assets in a completely transparent and trusted way between anyone who wants to be a node on the network.      The main BSN founding consortia partners are the State Information Center (China’s top-level government policy and strategy think tank affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission), China Mobile (China’s largest national telecom with over 900 million subscribers), China Unionpay (the world’s top payment and settlement provider with eight billion issued credit cards), and Red Date Technologies (the main blockchain architect for the BSN). (CoinDesk had a separate article about Red Date here.)    The BSN will catalyze the globalized digital economies of the future.    China Mobile is focused on the IT infrastructure deployment and has been accelerating the rollout of 5G and cloud adoption on the mainland. The BSN has developed cloud management technology that will allow multiplexing compute on top of a flexible multi-cloud architecture in a very resource-efficient way. Cloud providers under BSN’s multi-cloud management services already include AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Baidu Cloud, China Unicom, China Telecom and China Mobile.      The BSN launch will allow companies to access ultra-low cost blockchain cloud computing services. Target pricing is less than $400 USD/year, which would allow any SME or individual access to the critical tools to participate in the digital economy and drive adoption and financial inclusion opportunities.      See also: Byrne Hobart - China Has Many Strategic Reasons to Invest in Blockchain      The scale of the BSN is breathtaking, with a hundred city nodes across China at launch and participation by all three major national telecoms and major framework providers on the mainland. The central government has developed a master top-down plan to connect all the major cities in the country, rolling out to 200 cities over the next year and rapidly to all 451 prefecture-level cities thereafter. As I write this article, the world's largest scaled blockchain testnet is imminently preparing to launch. There are various blockchain-as-a-service applications being developed simultaneously, many of which are already being deployed by city governments to provide services for citizens across the mainland ranging from paying utility bills to registering company credentials. As example, the Hangzhou government has launched a blockchain pilot for unified digital identity, for faster authentication of individuals using government services.      The Chinese central government sees blockchain as the critical next-generation IT infrastructure to build future smart cities, connecting cryptographically secure databases linked by 5G to scalable cloud and data management infrastructure such that big data/AI analytics can efficiently run on top.      China simply can’t implement all of that at scale with a mashup of decentralized systems at the moment. Nor does it want to given the attendant security issues related to sensitive government information and citizen privacy. Thus, a permissioned blockchain ecosystem becomes the key infrastructure-of-infrastructures that allows the vertical integration of cloud computing, 5G communications, industrial IOT, AI and big data, with fintech and other application-level services overlayed on the stack.    The BSN will be the backbone infrastructure technology for massive interconnectivity throughout the mainland, from city governments, to companies and individuals alike.    While the BSN itself is a permissioned chain forked from Hyperledger Fabric, it will allow interoperability with public chains and other decentralized platforms (which will be fully implemented by July 2020). The protocol at launch will already be interoperable with major blockchain platforms and frameworks such as Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, EOS as well as most relevant mainland-based blockchain protocols for enterprise, including WeBank’s FISCO BCOS (the Financial Blockchain Shenzhen Consortium, with members such as WeBank, Tencent, Huawei and ZTE) and Baidu’s Xuperchain.      See also: Meet Red Date, the Little-Known Tech Firm Behind China’s Big Blockchain Vision      To be clear, the BSN is created to facilitate strong cryptographic security and privacy measures to protect the interests of anyone who will be operating with the protocol. This is analogous to the original TCP/IP internet protocol, which was originally developed by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Project Agency for military purposes, but now adopted commercially and privately by the entire free world.      In a similar vein, anyone can now become a node and/or deploy a dapp on the BSN network and share data or conduct business in a completely trusted way. On the mainland, all city governments, state-owned enterprises, and IT framework operators are gearing up to adopt and/or interoperate with the protocol. Because of the scale of the deployment and adoption within China alone, upon launch the BSN ecosystem will instantly become the largest blockchain ecosystem in the world and will become a strong driving force of institutional and government adoption of blockchain around the globe.      The launch of the BSN comes at a critical point in the history of humanity. Modern civilization has never been in a more precarious position, where the beginning of 2020 has witnessed an unprecedented pandemic that is concurrent to the kickoff of perhaps the largest-scale financial crisis the world has ever seen.      This Great Lockdown comes as nations around the world are decoupling from each other, blatant disinformation has been weaponized and nationalism rears its ugly head in ways not seen since the beginning of World War II. One way to solve these systemic challenges is through technology that can enforce trust at all levels of society just as it begins to fray dangerously.      The BSN can facilitate increased global trade and bilateral economic activity to buffer against systemic shocks and great rifts that have been exacerbated by mistrust and differences in ideology. It can connect the world more synergistically together, while democratizing access to the critical tools that will allow more efficient cross-border trade, investment and international collaboration.      This is particularly relevant in a post-COVID-19 world where the ability to digitally conduct business online will be paramount in the new normal. The BSN will catalyze the globalized digital economies of the future through new modes of collaboration and cooperation that are core to the blockchain ethos.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Michael Sung,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/24/chinas-national-blockchain-will-change-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73191fa33063914fae45870c004b604962f79014-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383567,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5HZ,1587752122,Dole Plans to Use Blockchain Food Tracing in All Divisions by 2025,"The Dole Food Company has a five-year blockchain plan for stronger food safety.      Dole aims to launch blockchain product tagging and other “advanced traceability solutions” across its three business divisions – tropical fruits, fresh vegetables and other diversified products – in a bid to enhance food safety operations by 2025.      The deadline, contained in its sustainability report released Wednesday, charts a system-wide redesign of how Dole, one of the world’s largest fruits and vegetables distributors, traces its food. Top of mind is improving the speed with which Dole can identify trouble spots in the supply chain during a recall of contaminated products, something it has worked on improving for years through its association with IBM Food Trust.      “Blockchain cuts the average time needed for food safety investigations from weeks to mere seconds,” the report said. “Produce that’s been logged via blockchain can be instantly tracked back through the supply chain, giving retailers and consumers confidence in the event of a recall.”    Faster food tracing    Distributed data could make investigations more nimble, Dole said in the report. It will also use that data to make consumers more informed. Dole said it plans to “eventually” pull back the curtain on its supply chain with scannable vegetable packages that reveal the product’s “journey from farm to store shelf.”      This was something Dole said it had already been doing with its salad and fresh vegetable supply chain, according to the report. The company claimed it was already sharing this data with retail customers last year, although it built protections into its platform to prevent different retailers from seeing their competitors’ data.      Now, it intends to soon launch blockchain systems for other products. Dole’s plan does not give a timeline on specific initiatives.      The 2025 goal comes nearly three years after Dole began experimenting with distributed ledgers as a member of IBM’s food blockchain consortium, the precursor to IBM Food Trust.      Dole appeared ready to continue that partnership through at least the next five years. The report notes fellow consortium member Walmart and IBM, the group’s cornerstone, are both working with Dole to showcase blockchain’s potential “to bring about a step change in food safety.” An IBM spokesperson declined to comment on Dole’s strategic planning.

42383565,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5F3,1587748520,"For Contact Tracing That Preserves Privacy, Focus on Incentives","Stephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies, and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. She has a PhD in Business Economics from Harvard.      “I’ve read the plans to reopen the economy. They’re scary.”      That’s how Vox journalist Ezra Klein titled his piece reviewing four plans to transition the U.S. economy out of COVID-19 lockdown. Discussing the Herculean societal shifts required to implement contact tracing, which include requiring almost every American to download a geo-tracking app to their phone, he writes: “The technological and political obstacles are massive...Who is trusted enough, in this country in this moment, to shape this?”      Countries planning for the end of COVID-19 lockdowns face a host of daunting technological, government and public health challenges. One of these challenges is implementing a contact tracing system that doesn’t double as a dystopian surveillance tool. But there are more. How can governments quickly, credibly and transparently distribute government assistance to individuals, especially the unbanked? How can companies enable adaptive supply chains for high-demand goods such as PPE and ventilators, including the potential for 3D printed goods? How can data be shared across independent organizations and entities, such as hospital groups, states and cities, that don’t normally collaborate? The list goes on and on.       See also: Stephanie Hurder - How Blockchain Tech Can Make Coronavirus Relief More Effective      As an economist advising permissionless and enterprise blockchain projects, I spend as much time explaining why DLT is not useful as why it is useful. What is stunning to me about the list of challenges above is how many of them DLT could help to solve.       DLT has an opportunity to add tremendous value to the United States at this time of huge societal and economic upheaval. To see why, it’s essential to understand the levers by which DLT and associated technologies, such as smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs, create value. At Prysm Group, we have developed a framework for DLT value creation we call the 3 Cs, which I previously discussed here:    Coordination: A shared ledger enables the use of a unified set of data across various companies and organizations. This reduces the costs of sharing and reconciling data, and enables insights derived from multiple data sources.  Commitment: Smart contracts and distributed consensus increase the credibility of agreements to take future actions and make payments. The cost of executing and enforcing contracts goes down.  Control: Distributed storage and zero-knowledge proofs allow data owners to selectively share their sensitive or personal data, making them more likely to participate in data sharing consortia.    Combined with tailored, use case-specific design choices, these are exactly the types of tools that can help solve major virus-driven problems.       In previous columns, my colleague Cathy Barrera and I have discussed how DLT can add value by credibly implementing automatic stimulus payments and enabling marketplaces for 3D printed supplies. Consider now the case of contact tracing.       SIMBA Chain, a DARPA-funded government contractor, is partnering with the Stanford Medicine Healthcare Innovation Lab and Prysm Group to develop an incentive-compatible, privacy-preserving solution that won’t require users to expose their personal data. The solution, which leverages zero-knowledge proof technology to enable privacy protection, retools a secure blockchain messaging system developed for the U.S. Department of Defense and integrates a disease detection AI algorithm leveraging consumer wearables.     The ability to create projects from the ground up without relying entirely on governments, universities or large corporations has never been more important.    Aside from the technology itself, the decentralized governance structures established by the DLT community provide another path to address COVID-19 induced problems such as contact tracing and adaptive supply chain management as our standard institutions struggle. As the federal government stays paralyzed, universities are overwhelmed by the transition to online instruction, companies lay off hundreds of workers, and states and localities look to create their own ad-hoc governing coalitions, the ability to create projects from the ground up without relying entirely on governments, universities or large corporations has never been more important.       DLT projects will need to engage in smart economic design to deliver solutions to problems of this magnitude. In order to gain adoption and have real, positive impact, those projects should consider the following:    1. Get serious about incentive compatibility    The Verge tech journalist Casey Newton says adoption rates for even the most successful contact tracing applications have been universally low. Even the best technologies – especially contact tracing solutions – are of little use if no one will use them. Understanding how individuals make the choice of whether or not to adopt a technology, and how to incentivize them to adopt these new solutions using both monetary and non-monetary levers, is essential for any large-scale program.    2. Adopt a user and expert-driven development approach    Designing effective incentives requires a deep understanding of how people will use (and potentially misuse) products, and expert knowledge of the systems and environments in which the product will operate. This understanding cannot develop in a bubble; it requires ongoing communication with users and subject-matter experts. Public health, law and economics insights will be essential to incorporate throughout the development process.    3. Focus on adoption early to achieve fiscal sustainability later    DLT-based projects exhibit network effects: their value grows as more users join. Projects that are developed in response to the current crisis may initially need to be funded with public money, but can evolve to be fiscally self-sustaining in the long run. Platform development teams should focus on bootstrapping early, building a robust user base, and then shift to monetization and profitability as the economic value delivered increases.       See more: COVID-19 Tracing Apps Have to Go Viral to Work. That’s a Big Ask      For example, if the privacy-preserving contact tracing system discussed above is adopted widely, this could lead to significantly reduced costs for insurance companies, who would face huge fiscal challenges if millions of people become infected with COVID-19 and require intensive medical care. While the willingness to invest upfront to launch such a project may be low due to the substantial uncertainty in the current environment, in the long term health care payers could have significant willingness to pay to sustain such a service. A product offering like this could be a valuable addition to existing large blockchain consortia already working in healthcare, such as the Health Utility Network or Synaptic Health Alliance.       The challenges presented by COVID-19 require drastic and creative solutions. Blockchain and DLT have the right features to address some of the biggest obstacles to overcoming these challenges. If groups currently building with these technologies rise to the occasion using the right economic approach, DLT has the potential to shift from a niche technology to mainstream contribution.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/24/for-contact-tracing-that-preserves-privacy-focus-on-incentives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e9600e546a227a0b2df3cfd7efbe7bd64c9a59e-2550x1700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383572,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5LL,1587745268,COVID-19 Tracing Apps Have to Go Viral to Work. That’s a Big Ask,"To be useful, any COVID-19 tracing app has to go viral.      But with concerns about privacy running high, getting a contact tracing app voluntarily adopted at scale is a big ask. Governments around the world are weighing different privacy-enhancing designs, with some saying an app would be voluntary to begin with, but not ruling out making it compulsory.      A now oft-cited statistic, Singapore’s TraceTogether app was adopted by only 10-20 percent of the population, with the country's government now calling on everyone to download it. In the U.K., for example, experts believe some 60 percent of the population would have to download the app to make it work effectively, which equates to 80 percent of all smartphones in the country.      Meanwhile, we are seeing a digital divide between centralized and decentralized approaches. (From a high level, the debate turns on whether pseudonymous data is stored on centralized servers or stays on the phone.) Privacy advocates may be relatively relaxed about a solution with Apple and Google on board, but the question of voluntary mass adoption of the app remains uncertain.      Read more: Money Reimagined: A World Where Privacy and Saving Lives Can Coexist      “It’s hard to predict,” said cypherpunk Harry Halpin, the CEO of privacy startup Nym Technologies. “I honestly think a relatively small number of people will install the app. We don't want to live in a world where we have to have an app on our phone to go outside.”      A big problem for a voluntary app comes down to the interaction between privacy and economics, says Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University.      “If the app’s voluntary, nobody has an incentive to use it except tinkerers and people who religiously comply with whatever the government asks,” Anderson said in an April blog post.      Read more: For Contact Tracing to Work, Americans Will Have to Trust Google and Apple      Studies on privacy regulation and technology incentives in the context of health information exchanges (HIEs) show only U.S. states that combined incentives with consent requirements saw a net increase in operational HIEs.      It’s worth remembering that the Estonian government – which successfully rolled out a digital identity scheme to 98 percent of its population – enticed people to sign up by telling them digital citizenship meant they could ride on the bus for free.    ‘Here is your NHS app’    If only one in six people use the app then it’s no use to anyone; so how do you persuade people to forget their privacy concerns and keep Bluetooth turned on all the time, said David Birch, author and director at Consult Hyperion.      “The government could say, ‘Here is your NHS app. Please turn on Bluetooth and run it so everybody can get back to work.’ I don't know what proportion of the population could even understand that, let alone make a rational decision whether to do it or not. Life just doesn't work like that,” said Birch.      “What you have to say is, ‘Here is an app that can get you into a pub, you’re going to have to run it or you won’t be allowed in,’” he said.      Register: David Birch is speaking at Consensus: Distributed on May 11      Making the app a requirement for entering certain public places has precedence in so-called implied consent laws, such as agreeing to field sobriety tests when getting a driver’s license. It’s possible to imagine grocery stores, schools and universities requiring a contact tracing app to be installed as a precondition for entrance.      Still, there are calls for more draconian measures.      A recent opinion piece in The Times in London warned readers not to be blind to the fact that “we need Big Brother to beat this virus.” Why not force biometric ID cards as well?    The joy of contact tracing    As food for thought, Consult Hyperion’s Birch, an authority on digital identity, suggested some novel ways to get more people using a COVID-19 tracing app.      “What if the contact tracing APIs could facilitate other useful purposes?” said Birch. “For example, what if you could message people who were at a concert with you last night; say the half-dozen other fans around you, without access to their real names and addresses.”      Read more: European Contact Tracing Consortium Faces Wave of Defections Over Centralization Concerns      As such, the app could work like the “missed connections” section of Craigslist, facilitated by everyone being online in a privacy-enhanced environment. If the recipients of messages granted their consent then the system could send back identifiers so they could be contacted, said Birch.      “If that interface could be delivered in a privacy-enhanced environment, it’s possible that other people would come up with clever applications to sit on top of it, which would make it useful, and therefore people would carry it and have it turned on,” he said. “And a happy byproduct is that contact tracing would work and fewer people would drop dead.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/24/covid-19-tracing-apps-have-to-go-viral-to-work-thats-a-big-ask,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53b45af283225bc4ebcdd6f07d0ac75dee921059-1500x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383581,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5U9,1587744245,Money Reimagined: A World Where Privacy and Saving Lives Can Coexist,"Defenders of Washington’s COVID-19 response say it’s unfair to compare surging U.S. death rates with the far lower numbers in countries such as South Korea or Singapore because Americans would never accept the kind of social surveillance that's ingrained in their approach.      The statement implies a depressing trade-off of deaths for privacy. Although it recorded its first COVID-19 case on the same date, the U.S. currently has, per capita, 13 times South Korea’s caseload and a shocking 33 times its deaths. It’s also a depressingly defeatist notion. The trade-off need not exist.      The U.S. could and should have an effective smartphone-based “contact tracing” system that doesn’t encroach on our civil rights. For two decades, cryptographers have been highlighting the threat to privacy from our expanding online habits. They’ve also found ways around that problem, inventing encryption tools that let us share data without giving up our identities.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      But just as we ignored epidemiologists and their warnings of an inevitable pandemic, we also ignored the cryptographers. Worse, perhaps, we labeled them as cranks and criminals.       This must change. If Americans truly want to protect their freedoms, they must now support research and development in zero-knowledge proofs, end-to-end encryption and self-sovereign digital identity.       Thankfully, the cryptocurrency explosion has fostered a boom in innovation in these fields, often resulting in side applications that are unrelated to digital tokens or blockchains. This is not a crypto fringe concept; it’s core infrastructure for the digital age.      Here’s the challenge: To test decentralized data-gathering tools at scale, in real life, and then to deploy them widely, requires regulators and intelligence agencies to roll back roadblocks they’ve put in front of open source cryptographer communities. A change in policy is urgently needed because once we get through COVID-19, another digitizing trend will start encroaching even further into our private lives: central bank digital currency.      For now, though, until it has a strategy in place that combines comprehensive COVID-19 testing with a decentralized, privacy-protecting contact-tracing regime, the U.S. faces three stark options: 1) We stay ignorant of the extent of the virus’ spread, forcing us to stay in lockdown for much longer than better-informed countries; 2) We send everyone back to work and expose millions to an extremely contagious disease whose morbidity levels are high enough to drive another overrun of our medical system; or 3) We leave our homes but submit to a regime of rigorous state and corporate surveillance.      South Korea shows what’s possible with option three. Under the somewhat ironic acronym of TRUST (Transparency, Robust screening and quarantine, Unique but universally applicable testing, Strict control and Treatment), authorities employed mass drive-thru testing and then – while surveilling people with phone GPS data, security cameras and credit-card and bank records – limited the movement of those who tested positive. As Bruce Klingner of The Heritage Foundation writes, the government employed powers it gained after the 2015 MERS outbreak that gave it “warrantless access” to private information.      Resistance to such invasive approaches is leading governments in the West to favor a pro-privacy approach to contact tracing – officially called “proximity tracing” in Europe. Yet, in both the U.S. and Europe, a familiar challenge has emerged: Can we trust the controlling entity to maintain users’ privacy?      In a rare act of cooperation, Apple and Google teamed to build a system based on Bluetooth transmitters, a technology far less prone to mass surveillance than GPS. It’s a voluntary model that would inform people of their contacts with infected people without revealing their identity.      It’s an attractive idea in principle but, setting aside its dependence on widespread voluntary participation and that it only works with Android or iOS phones, its core weakness, as CoinDesk’s Benjamin Powers reports, is users must trust Apple and Google with their data. The demands of shareholders and the Web 2.0 history of “surveillance capitalism,” the NSA’s PRISM program, the Patriot Act and Cambridge Analytica have undermined people’s willingness to trust that the powerful gatekeepers of our online lives won’t abuse our data. A new report that secretive intelligence firm Palantir has been awarded a separate COVID-19 contract will do nothing to boost that trust.      Such concerns presumably led a European group called the Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing consortium to initially include a sub-group of academic cryptographers from the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, or DP3T, consortium. A decentralized model for sharing data, which ideally would leave data control in the hands of users, would remove the risk of capture by a controlling entity. In theory, that would bolster public trust in the initiative and increase its data-gathering capabilities.       But now it’s all falling apart. (Here again, read Benjamin Powers, whose coverage of the contact tracing debate is unparalleled.) The DP3T members are defecting from the PPPT in protest that the biggest countries are pushing for more centralized control over the data. This follows a Bloomberg interview with French Digital Minister Cedric O where he called on Apple and Google to disable a Bluetooth feature designed to protect users’ privacy.      It’s as if there’s a concerted effort to block the development of truly decentralized, privacy-preserving systems. Critics will point to the untested nature of the technology and scaling challenges. Yet, in deeply poor Honduras, blockchain startup Emerge and the Inter-American Bank managed to pull such a system together in just five days.      Such initiatives stem from the progress in cryptographic science that has come with the rise of open source cryptocurrency developer communities. It has produced innovations such as atomic swaps, decentralized exchange, Zk-snarks, recursive zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures and homomorphic multiparty computation, all pointing to a future in which society gathers valuable transactional information while keeping secret the human identities behind it.      Yet, mainstream corporate and government sectors show little interest publicly in testing and employing these solutions. In fact, for years governments have worked against valuable cryptographic solutions. Think of the mid-1990s criminal investigations of Phil Zimmerman – whose PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software now protects most of the world’s email – Australia’s anti-encryption law or the FBI’s efforts to force Apple to give up user data.      Whether these roadblocks are to protect corporate crony interests or government intelligence agencies, we can now see them as self-defeating. We urgently need to bring pro-privacy cryptography out of the shadows. Our way of life is at stake.    A world gone mad    This crisis continues to throw up strange and unforeseen phenomena. Who could have predicted a few weeks ago the U.S. Federal Reserve would directly buy corporate debt or that “Sorry, I was on mute” would become part of the daily cadence of our office meetings. In the spirit of that, we thought we’d illustrate the distortions occurring with three charts offering snapshots of different aspects of the fallout in the financial and economic realm. A picture paints a thousand words, but in true exponential effect, we think these three paint many more than three thousand – maybe 30,000?      1. When oil becomes worthless:       2. When millions of Americans are gainfully employed...until they’re not:      3. When a hacker reminds us that Decentralized Finance still has security challenges:    The Global Town Hall    Central Bank independence may not survive the coronavirus. So argues Bloomberg columnist Clive Crook, writing a kind of pre-obituary for a tenet of monetary policy that dates back to Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker’s successful but politically difficult fight against inflation in the 1980s. The nail in the coffin, Crook argues, would be the massive public spending needed to revive the U.S. economy. If, in the future, the Fed buys Treasury bonds issued to fund that effort, can it really define it as monetary policy? Or is it more like “monetizing the debt?”      USDT is invading Ethereum. In his newsletter Wednesday, Messari CEO Ryan Selkis picked up on the fact that surging stablecoin usage is swelling the total value of such transactions over Ethereum to point out the blockchain itself is being transformed by it. The daily amount traded in stable-value ERC20 tokens now surpasses that of ether – most prominently led by Tether’s USDT token. ""While Ethereum is many things, the most relevant thing it is now is a globally accessible, 24/7 digital eurodollar infrastructure,” Selkis writes. “Essentially, USDT has invaded the Ethereum blockchain without anyone's permission, which is the explicit purpose of permissionless public blockchains.""      Everyone (on my Twitter feed at least) is talking about Marc Andreessen’s “build” essay. My take: the legendary Silicon Valley developer and venture capitalist is right to lament that the U.S., despite its wealth and scientific talent, has stopped building and innovating, but I was disappointed he didn’t try to answer the bigger question: Why? Why has American democracy failed to prioritize things like bridges, buildings and medical equipment?      I’ll presumptuously offer an answer: In the Web 2.0 era, our system for processing and prioritizing the information that society uses to make political and resource decisions is now controlled by a small group of giant companies funded by VCs like Andreessen. What we read and view is determined by the hidden algorithms of platforms such as Google and Facebook, which intermediate between media creators and their audiences. Those algorithms serve the interests of the platforms’ advertisers (as well as those of disinformation actors like Cambridge Analytica who’ve figured out how to exploit them). Whatever your view of “MSM,” the reality is that algorithms have more say in setting the agenda than journalists.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

The SEC alleged in a Friday announcement that Jeremy McAlpine, Zachary Matar and Patrick O'Hara, all California residents, lied about Dropil’s financial status and DROP token profitability to their investors, who they also misled by drastically overstating the success of their ICO.      Dropil’s founders said they raised $54 million from 34,000 global investors. The complaint alleged they actually raised only a fraction of that: $1.8 million from 2,472 investors      Those funds, raised between January and March 2018, were supposedly intended to act as an investment in the DROP token that Dropil would manage and multiply via their algorithmic trading bot “Dex,” according to the complaint. Proceeds would be distributed in DROP in 15 day increments.      But the SEC alleged the ICO money never made it to “Dex.” Instead, the SEC said the founders funneled $1.4 million into their personal accounts. They then kept up the ruse by cooking up bogus profitability reports whose credibility they bolstered with the expected DROP payments, the complaint said.      “There is no record that Dex, which Dropil promoted as a differentiating feature of DROPs, ever operated or generated any trading profits,” the SEC said in the complaint. It alleged the DROP distributions were merely recycled tokens from Dropil’s reserves and post-ICO trades.      Additionally, the SEC said the DROP token sale amounted to an unregistered ICO. Dropil is also accused of falsifying evidence and testimony during the SEC investigation.      McAlpine and O’Hara did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42383574,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5P7,1587741660,"Oil's Been More Volatile Than Bitcoin for Nearly 2 Months, Data Shows","Since oil futures crashed earlier this week – some hitting negative prices for the first time ever – the crypto world has been enjoying the fact that bitcoin suddenly appeared to be a relatively stable asset.      Markets were shocked when the May futures contract on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the main oil benchmark for the U.S., crashed Monday on fears arising from massive oversupply due to the effects of the coronavirus measures.      A day later, the June contract tumbled more than 43 percent to a 21-year low of $11.57 a barrel. Bitcoin, though, barely flinched and held within its recent trading range between $6,400 and $7,400.      But, according to data from CryptoCompare, bitcoin has outshone oil for far longer than just a few days when it comes price stability. In fact, ""black gold"" first started showing greater volatility – that is, the degree of fluctuation in the price of an asset – in early March, and has largely remained higher in April.      CryptoCompare graphed 14-day rolling volatilities for oil, bitcoin, gold and the S&P 500. A volatility above 5 percent for 14 days translates to 25 percent or more on an annualized basis.      ""The more volatile, the bigger the percentage move, the riskier the asset (regardless of the direction),"" the firm told CoinDesk in an email.      While bitcoin was the ""riskiest"" – most volatile – asset of the four contenders at the start of the year, in early March, oil surged to levels above 0.10, and even as high as 0.15 later in the month.      ""As the year progressed, the disagreement between OPEC and Russia, coupled with negative demand shock caused the oil price to collapse, making it riskier than bitcoin,"" said James Li, analyst at CryptoCompare.      Bitcoin's volatility surge came soon after and is likely associated with the ""Black Thursday"" crash on March 12, which saw the cryptocurrency plunge to as low as $3,867 as all markets suffered from coronavirus-related shocks.      While both assets have since seen volatility drop, it doesn't appear oil's price gyrations have come to an end yet.      ""Without any significant catalysts for demand, there’s nowhere to put oil,"" said Daniel Masters, chairman of CoinShares, a U.K.-based digital asset management firm. Continued problems with the oil futures market could be on the horizon because of there's a shortage facilities for oil, according to Masters. ""The worst isn’t over yet, the May contract just got rolled into June this week, and when June contracts expire, it will be absolute carnage.""      The June WTI contract is currently trading at about $16.60.      See also: Coinbase Launches Price Oracle Aimed to Reduce Systemic Risk in the DeFi Space      So what's the safe haven in the storm of volatility? Gold is the least volatile of the four assets compared, according to the chart, never crossing 0.05. CryptoCompare's Li is concerned even cash may prove inflationary given the massive stimulus efforts so far. And it appears more is on the way in the U.S. after the Senate passed another stimulus bill later approved by the House of Representatives. If signed by President Trump, it will pump billions of dollars more into the economy.      ""Under these circumstances, we may see a shift to assets that cannot be perpetually diluted instead of papering over the cracks. For the moment cash is the only port in the storm, but that may prove to be a false hope in the mid to long term,"" said Li.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING | BTG,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/24/oils-been-more-volatile-than-bitcoin-for-nearly-2-months-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47f3978b16a10b3fb541c00d91b78313244215ec-2560x1552.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the steady decline in the bank’s crypto business has stopped, Metropolitan Commercial will likely keep the business line steady at around 4 percent of total deposits, said Christopher O’Connell, a bank stock analyst at investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.      Read more: Crypto-Related Deposits Drop by Half at Metropolitan Commercial Bank      “It’s still something that they’re maintaining, but it’s not a primary driver of growth,” O’Connell told CoinDesk. Metropolitan Commercial declined to comment for this story and did not talk about its digital currency business on its first-quarter earnings call Monday.    By the numbers    The bank saw the greatest decrease in its corporate cash management deposits, which fell by $155 million. The bank more than doubled its loan loss provisions to $4.8 million in the first quarter as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.      The size of its digital currency deposits is still lower than historical averages. In Q1 2019, the bank had $210 million from the crypto sector. Metropolitan’s digital currency banking peak came in the second quarter of 2018, at $369 million in deposits from the sector.      On the lending side, the bank continues to look like a traditional bank, with more than half of its loans going to commercial real estate projects.      Read more: Metropolitan Bank Is Handling Millions for Crypto Clients (And It Wants More)      In its investor presentation, Metropolitan Commercial highlighted BitPay, Crypto.com, Coinbase and other crypto companies as firms that take advantage of its global payments business.      In comparison, Metropolitan’s rival – La Jolla, Calif.-based Silvergate Bank – had $1.2 billion in deposits from cryptocurrency clients at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. (Silvergate is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on April 29.)      New York-based and crypto-friendly Signature Bank saw a $1 billion rise in non-interest bearing deposits in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of this year, Signature reported non-interest bearing deposits made up 32 percent of total deposits at the bank, or $13.4 billion. While the bank hasn’t shared the total value of its deposits from crypto customers, the crypto industry is typically among the primary sources of non-interest bearing deposits.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/24/crypto-firm-deposits-jump-24-in-q1-at-metropolitan-commercial-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/040dd24bdbc53008cddd809233183ca05932b128-1500x1201.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383575,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5QN,1587730352,First Mover: Bitcoin Jumps as Fed Assets Top $6.5T and Traders Focus on Halving,"Bitcoin, which after wild swings earlier in the year had stagnated over the past few weeks, finally broke out of its range on Thursday – jumping to the upside.      Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Delphi Digital, a digital-asset research firm, said the price surge was consistent with historical patterns where volatility tends to pick up whenever the bitcoin futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is nearing expiration. The April contract is scheduled to expire Friday.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The move upward may have been fueled by traders keying off market signals, according to Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital. Prices found a floor at the 50-day moving average around $6,800, breached a resistance level at $7,300 and now appear on track to push toward the 150-day moving average around $7,800, he wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      ""As is often the case, the line acted as a resistance level on the way up, and now that we're above it the line is currently being tested as a level of support,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote in an email to clients.      So where does that leave bitcoin?      It's now at the highest price since March 11 – the day before the ""Black Thursday"" plunge, when bitcoin tumbled 39 percent amid a flight to cash across both digital and traditional financial markets, as the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus came into view.      Bitcoin is now up 5.1 percent for the year to date, a performance that looks impressive compared with the 13 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The cryptocurrency still trails gold, up 14 percent on the year.      DiPasquale predicts that ""after some consolidation"" bitcoin prices could rise toward $9,000.      From a fundamental perspective, bitcoin is now just a few weeks from its once-every-four-years ""halving,"" when the pace of issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency decreases by 50 percent.      German bank BayernLB predicted last year bitcoin's halving could drive its price to $90,000, roughly 12 times the current level, but some traders say that the well-telegraphed event is already baked into market expectations.      What's clear is governments and central banks around the world are pushing to pump additional fiscal and monetary stimulus into the global financial system. Cryptocurrency traders are tracking the money injections, which could eventually lead to inflation, since bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold.      Fitch Ratings said this week in a statement that an ""unparalleled global recession"" is underway, with global gross domestic product set to contract by 3.9 percent this year, the biggest drop in the post-war period. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business on Wednesday that ""we need to spend what it takes to win the war"" against the coronavirus.      The Federal Reserve, which is indirectly providing financing for government emergency programs, including through purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, said late Thursday its total assets surged this week past $6.5 trillion for the first time in the central bank's 107-year history. That's an increase of more than $2 trillion in just six weeks.      Yet, an analysis Thursday by The TIE, a research firm, showed some traders might be shifting their focus toward the halving. In tweets mentioning the word ""bitcoin,"" those that included the term ""halving"" surged by 63 percent on Thursday to 1,058. Bitcoin-related tweets mentioning gold slipped by 8.1 percent to 634.      Cryptocurrency analysts have latched onto the contrast between the tightening supply of bitcoin and the Fed's loose monetary policy.      ""The halving is now 18 days out, ensuring the increased scarcity in a world where money supply in other currencies is drastically increasing,"" Greenspan wrote.    Tweet of the day    Bitcoin Watch    Trend: Bitcoin is a better bid on Friday amid signs of increased institutional adoption.      At press time, bitcoin is priced around $7,530 on major exchanges, having breached the resistance of $7,468 (April 7 high) on Thursday.      As prices broke above the key hurdle, open interest in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rose to $233 million, the highest since Feb. 26, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew. Meanwhile, daily trading volume rose to $485 million to hit the highest level since March 12.      ""The growth in open interest from CME may indicate that entities from traditional finance are more open to add bitcoin exposure to their portfolios, whilst retail investors are seemingly more reluctant to indulge in the futures market,"" said cryptocurrency platform Luno.      An increase in open interest along with an increase in price is said to confirm an upward trend. So, bitcoin’s ongoing rally may have legs.      Some observers put the rise down to a pre-halving price boost that could take prices well above $8,000. Bitcoin is set to undergo its third mining reward halving in May.      Technical charts, too, suggest scope for stronger gains in the short term. For instance, a symmetrical triangle breakout seen on the daily chart indicates a resumption of the stalled rally from the March 23 low of $3,867.      Bitcoin could soon challenge the 100-day average located at $8,024. A violation there would expose next price hurdle lined up at $8,213 (Jan. 24 high). The immediate bullish case would be invalidated if prices fall back below Thursday'slow of $7,031, although that looks unlikely, as the breakout is backed by an above-50 or bullish reading on the 14-day relative strength index.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/24/first-mover-bitcoin-jumps-as-fed-assets-top-65t-and-traders-focus-on-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc7c0093e3526a50dedee71a0d3d1d1c0e0073d1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383595,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5A1,1587727857,Bidooh Founders Admit to Cloning Business for Rival Advertising Venture,"The former CEO and CTO of Ethereum-based advertising company Bidooh admitted they copied proprietary software for use in a new rival venture.      Abdul Alim and Shahzad Mughal, who co-founded the Manchester, U.K.-based firm in 2017, admitted April 7 to all counts of copyright infringement and misuse of confidential information, as well as a breach of their fiduciary duties as directors and of their shareholders' agreements.      As CoinDesk reported in January, Alim and Mughal were at the center of controversy after they were ejected from Bidooh and accused of stealing company software. The remaining Bidooh directors, including Michael Edelson, a non-executive director of Manchester United football club, took legal action in 2019 and claimed they had attempted to steal clients for their rival venture, Flydooh.      Bidooh is a digital advertising company that allows companies to broadcast customized ads to anyone walking past their interactive billboards. Raising $5 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018, advertisers can pay by the second with the firm's Ethereum-based DOOH cryptocurrency.      Bidooh's directors secured a high court order last September ordering Alim and Mughal to hand over any software and code related to Bidooh and Flydooh, as well as an injunction halting all their activities until a full trial. Both Alim and Mughal previously admitted to counts of copying facial analytics software used in the billboards in November 2019.      In January 2020, Alim and Mughal countersued Bidooh, accusing the remaining directors of not paying them £320,000 (US$395,000) in back salaries. Alim told CoinDesk at the time his former employer was ""completely screwing us over"" and that the company had effectively been ""hijacked from them.""      Alim also claimed the proprietary technology had already been ported over to a similar digital advertising platform, Promokio, which was owned solely by Bidooh director Gary Partington.      Alim and Mughal have now agreed to pay Bidooh £80,000 (nearly $100,000) in interim costs, with a full amount to be decided at a later date. Their countersuit has been dropped and all their remaining shares in Bidooh will be handed back to the company for a nominal fee.      Abdul and Mughal have until April 29 to pay the interim costs to Bidooh.      See also: JPEG on the Blockchain: Image Format Creator Believes Tech Can Fight Copyright Theft      ""The final court order signifies the end of a frustrating and unfathomable chain of events,"" Edelson said in a statement. “Naturally, as an investor and shareholder, I have been outraged that the people we invested a lot of belief and trust in chose to work against us for personal gain.""      “Since the initiation of the first court order on [Sept. 11, 2019], a number of false counter-claims have been made by Alim and Mughal against Bidooh and individuals linked to the business, which has been very distressing for all involved. These have now been dropped and we are confident the final court order sets the record straight.”      Bruce Jones who, as head of intellectual property at Kuits Solictors, represented Bidooh, also said: ""Abdul Alim and Shazhad Mughal appear to have mistakenly believed that they could behave as they wished. In over 30 years of legal practice I have never before encountered such flagrant infringements and abuses.      “That they were undertaken by two individuals in whom so much faith and trust had been placed by investors who were willing to back them, makes their conduct all the more egregious.""      See also: UK’s Tech Bailout Could Help Blockchain Devs Weather COVID-19 Shutdown      In an email to CoinDesk, Alim said they had established rival advertising firm Flydooh in an attempt to start again. ""But we failed to realize that we had signed over the [intellectual property] to the limited company and that Bidooh owned the IP,"" he said.      Alim said that, although they had wanted to continue fighting the legal battle, they had no choice but to concede: ""Unfortunately, we have had to admit to the claims as the legal costs amounted to over £100k [$123,000] and it would have cost us another £30k [$37,000] to prepare for and attend court, and we don’t have deep pockets like Michael Edelson.""      He added he and Mughal continue to believe they had been ""taken for a ride,"" and they should have acted earlier.      Alim also claimed Edelson advised both him and Mughal, when they were still at Bidooh, to become Uber drivers and that Partington had sometimes made personally disparaging remarks. A Bidooh spokesperson denied the allegations and countered with other accusations about Alim’s personal conduct when he was a director at the company.      ""Getting screwed out of your own company hurts,"" Alim added. ""It’s not easy seeing the company that we started being taken from us.""      See also: Brexit Divorce Is Advertising Opportunity for Crypto Firms      Asked if there was any truth to Alim's claims his digital advertising company had effectively been hijacked, a Bidooh spokesperson said: ""This claim is untrue as revealed and verified by the final court order.""      The spokesperson added that Alim's and Mughal's actions have had a ""significant impact on the business,"" including losing important clients and effectively destabilizing the platform. The firm is now having to reassess the product and, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, are focusing on the business' survival, the spokesperson said.

42383561,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5CX,1587721674,AVA Labs Will Splash Millions to 'Brain Merge' DeFi and Traditional Finance,"Now that its public testnet is live, Emin Gun Sirer’s AVA Labs wants to invest heavily in building a DeFi space more in its own image.      Speaking on Google Hangouts, AVA Labs COO Kevin Sekniqi told CoinDesk the company was focusing its energies on a new grants program, made available through its venture arm, AVA X, that will provide financing of up to $250,000 to selected projects building with its technology.      AVA has earmarked a ""pretty substantial"" amount of cash for projects and initiatives that build out the ecosystem, Sekniqi said. Half of AVA Labs' allocation of mainnet tokens – with a value ""in the many millions of dollars"" – would also be available to selected projects as grants, he added.      The AVA platform is a highly scalable protocol with a claimed thousands of transactions per second throughput – designed to be the basis for a new type of financial infrastructure.      Founded by Cornell Professor Emin Gun Sirer, who has previously worked on a scaling solution for bitcoin, AVA had been in private testnet for over a year. It originally had been slated for launch as early as December but this was pushed back until April. The project is now aiming for a full launch sometime in July, according to its roadmap.      Since the public testnet launch earlier this month, Sekniqi said the team had been in dialogue with at least five projects interested in applying for grants.      See also: Multi-Chain DeFi Protocol Raises $750K in Token Sale With Framework Ventures      This sudden ramping up in grants comes as AVA solidifies in the approach to launch. It's even started to proselytize, offering its own vision of what the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) space should start to look like going forward.      ""There is nothing about [DeFi], to be totally honest with you, that is decentralized,"" Sekniqi said, as evidenced by the reality of hacks like the attack on dForce at the weekend. DeFi, he added, is just as susceptible to fallible people and relationships built on trust as traditional finance.      However, debates about decentralization detract from DeFi's real killer app: the compatibility and programmability of capital and new financial products, according to Sekniqi.      ""Ethereum has effectively shown that there huge power in composability and if you do make financial products standardized then you can compose them in all kinds of new and interesting ways that we've never thought of before,"" he said.      Left to its own devices, DeFi would only rediscover all the ""basic instruments that have been known about for many years"" in traditional finance. Changing the narrative from decentralization and toward ""programmable capital"" will attract ""finance guys"" with the knowledge and experience to realize its potential, he said.      ""In mainstream finance you may have corporate bonds but they're not composable with anything else, it's very much siloed and very much fragmented,"" Sekniqi said. ""DeFi is really all about the composability of these financial products"" – allowing different assets to interact with one another in a frictionless manner, sometimes for the very first time.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: DeFi and Traditional Finance Are Forming an Unlikely Friendship      AVA Labs may appear like the sort of tech firm found all along the Pacific Coast of the U.S., but its base is in Brooklyn, N.Y., not far from Wall Street. Speaking to CoinDesk earlier this year, Sekniqi said there were even tentative plans to move the office to lower Manhattan so they could be just a stone's throw away from the global financial hub.      As well as the grants program, AVA is running hackathons for students, some specifically aimed at building new applications for finance. The company plans to invite some ""very influential"" financial experts, many from outside the blockchain space, to judge which products have the most utility.      One such event, announced Thursday, will offer $50,000 in cash prizes to students able to build infrastructure tools, identify and fix bugs, or develop ""new applications for financial products and services.""      Through grants and hackathons, Sekniqi said AVA hopes to conduct a ""brain merge"" that will bring those in traditional finance and blockchain together.      See also: Morgan Creek Invests in Startup Bringing Bitcoin to DeFi      CoinDesk asked whether AVA was necessary to this process: do suited Wall Street bankers and hoodie-wearing DeFi developers really need someone to act as matchmaker?      ""I don't personally know of financial experts that are currently working on Defi ... it's just lots of innovative technologists,"" Sekniqi replied, suggesting that the lack of a charismatic Steve Jobs-like figure meant DeFi may have initially struggled to combine its community of like-minded souls with established businesses.      Whatever the reason, the fact of the matter is ""nobody else is doing this right now,"" he said, adding that if AVA doesn't intervene now, there's a danger companies in both the DeFi and traditional finance spaces will continue to miss out on some crucial opportunities to collaborate.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/24/ava-labs-will-splash-millions-to-brain-merge-defi-and-traditional-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35bfe4f8961386e0433c67625afbe102430f4978-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383555,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x57V,1587717798,Coinbase Launches Price Oracle Aimed at Reducing Systemic Risk in the DeFi Space,"With around a billion dollars sitting in decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and protocols, Coinbase has started to provide a data feed for cryptocurrency prices to help keep those funds secure.      Available from Thursday, the San Francisco crypto exchange said the feed, or oracle, provides data from Coinbase Pro on the exchange rates for both bitcoin and ether against the U.S. dollar. It is further signed with Coinbase's private key, meaning that when shared across third party services and protocols, the data can always be verified as being from the exchange.      Coinbase Oracle can be pulled in by blockchain networks and, once there, can be married with other data feeds for use by in DeFi projects to carry out functions such as lending, margin trading, collateral liquidations and derivatives, Coinbase said in a blog post.      The new offering is aimed at helping counter the dangers encountered when DeFi protocols using off-chain third-party data, which requires trust the prices being provided are accurate. The firm also points to the risks of using data from decentralized exchanges. That has already led to new kinds of attacks, such as those that hit ethereum-based lending project BZX in February when bad actors manipulated price feeds to make off with around $1 million in ether.      See also: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack      ""A highly reliable price feed anchored into Coinbase’s secure infrastructure can help make the DeFi ecosystem safer, reduce systemic risks and unlock the next wave of growth and adoption,"" according to the post.      The oracle is being supported by the same secure key storage infrastructure that supports Coinbase's exchange operations, storing billions in user funds. It further offers protection against manipulation of prices by exchanges or invalid data.      Last year, Bitwise Asset Management issued a report claiming 95 percent of all reported bitcoin trading volume is faked. In such a market, reliable sources of price data are essential for automated protocols that hold sway over users' funds.      “Coinbase Oracle will increase the security and decentralization of Compound’s price feed, which is mission-critical to the protocol and the ecosystem of applications built on top of Compound,"" said Robert Leshner, CEO at Compound, provider of an autonomous, algorithmic interest rate protocol for financial apps. ""We’re not alone – the rest of DeFi will benefit with faster development, consistent data, and shared standards.”      See also: Crypto Lender Celsius Taps Chainlink’s Price Oracles for Interest Rate ‘Decentralization’      In the blog post, Coinbase delved a little into the technical side of the new oracle, saying it is provided via an API compatible with Open Oracle – an open-source set of Ethereum smart contracts originally developed by Compound to help standardize and increase interoperability between different sources of oracle price data.      Projects using Open Oracle are able to select the included feeds they want included in the calculation of an average price returned by the oracle contract.      To help ensure this median is accurate, Coinbase designed its feed to have three ""layers"" of protection, including data quality arising from Coinbase Pro's high liquidity platform, an off-chain filter that blocks crypto asset price data points that significantly deviates from the expected volatility, and on-chain filtering via Open Oracle’s DelFiPrice smart contract. The latter again rejects price data points that significantly deviate from the last reported price from so-called ""anchor sources.""      See also: Exchange Volumes May Be Fake, But Bitcoin’s Value Is Real      “Price oracles are used in every lending and derivatives protocol,"" said Antonio Juliano, CEO of dYdX, a decentralized margin trading exchange. ""Coinbase is uniquely positioned to provide oracle prices as they’re the most trusted and secure institution in the space.""      Using Coinbase Oracle data could facilitate the creation of ""more decentralized and secure price oracles for the ecosystem,” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/24/coinbase-launches-price-oracle-aimed-at-reducing-systemic-risk-in-the-defi-space,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd88581fe59f1dedf64b6a914bdd7040d4b42a0f-1500x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
