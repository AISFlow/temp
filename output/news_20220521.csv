42411466,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO5DL,1653137100,Regulators Are Paying Attention to UST,"Luna collapsed, terraUSD collapsed and this is now going to be a Big Thing. I would go so far as to say that UST’s collapse, as dramatic as it was, will have a legacy similar to Libra’s.  PSA: I’ll be in Davos, Switzerland, covering the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting next week, so next week’s edition will be a recap. Going to be in town? Come say hi.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Terra firma  The narrative  Regulators and lawmakers are looking at the collapse of terraUSD (UST) as a question of whether esoteric products, such as algorithmic stablecoins, are safe for crypto investors as well as whether there are broader financial stability concerns with them.  Why it matters  The introduction of the Libra stablecoin project led to, years later, multiple regulatory approaches and the certainty that sooner or later, governments will have rules in place for how stablecoins can operate. However, all of these efforts have focused on asset-backed stablecoins, not algorithmic stablecoins. The novel structures here might result in new approaches from regulators. The major difference? Libra never launched, and there haven’t been any asset-backed stablecoin collapses the way there was with UST. That difference may lead to regulators placing a higher priority on this issue.  Breaking it down  In June 2019, social media giant Facebook unveiled its long-awaited cryptocurrency project, Libra. Despite assurances from the company that it was not seeking to take over global payments or create a non-U.S. dollar-based financial system, regulators pushed back strongly against the project.  They were largely successful, too: Libra later rebranded as Diem, scaled back its vision to a fraction of what was originally intended and still ended up selling off its assets and shutting down.  Even though the project never launched, the regulatory impact was massive. Regulators worldwide suddenly saw stablecoins as a huge issue they needed to pay attention to.  The collapse of terraUSD (UST) is algorithmic stablecoins’ Libra moment. Regulators are all of a sudden paying close attention to algo stables generally, and UST and luna in particular.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen brought up Terra independently twice last week during separate Congressional hearings on the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  “I think you've just illustrated that we just had this last week with Terra, and with tether in illustration of the risks associated with stablecoins, that there can be runs. And we've seen this historically with private monies, and we invented a good regulatory framework, I think for dealing with this, [we’re] going to try to solve the depository [framework],” Yellen said.  Moreover, she later made it clear that she isn’t saying UST is exactly like Tether: “it depends on the backing of the stablecoin. Terra is algorithmic and doesn't really have a backing as such.”  It doesn’t seem that the FSOC, a group of regulators tasked with maintaining the economic stability of the U.S., is going to take a look at this, suggesting they don't see this as being very significant on a macro scale, though individual regulators may have more pointed concerns.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra told Bloomberg this week that the collapse of Terra is showing people that a stablecoin is not “as good as a dollar.”  “Stablecoins are something that all the regulators are looking at. Most stablecoin use right now is really for speculative trading in and out of cryptocurrencies. Many are wondering if it’s one day going to be used for consumer payments, but many think it’s not ready yet,” he said.  Potential regulations will likely focus on how the stablecoins – and other cryptocurrencies – are being used.  Notably, this is one of the first times Chopra has spoken about cryptocurrencies since taking on the role of CFPB director last year.  Lawmakers in the U.S. have also been asking regulators about UST and luna – it’s even come up during confirmation hearings for new regulators.  Meanwhile, rumors abound that South Korea’s parliament may try to bring Terra creator Do Kwon in for a hearing, while law enforcement entities are probing the collapse as a possible Ponzi or other criminal enterprise.  The question remains, just what will regulators actually do? So far there isn’t a clear answer. Everyone seems to agree that algorithmic stablecoins are their own thing, distinct from reserve-backed stablecoins. Fewer individuals seem to have opinions on how that translates into clear regulation or guardrails, however.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  We continue with the status quo.  Elsewhere:  How Not to Run a Cryptocurrency Exchange: Japan’s Liquid exchange seems to have been a poorly managed, chaotic company. This in-depth report is worth your time. To quote from the report, “Sources say that executives downplayed some information security breaches, did not disclose others, failed to adequately address low-level insider theft and prematurely stopped investigations into last year’s $90 million hack.”  Outside CoinDesk:  (Protos) Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) director William Hinman received “millions of dollars in retirement benefits” from his former law firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, which is also a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Protos reports.

Past Performance of APE As can be seen from the previous trend on the chart of APE/USD, the market&apos;s value has drastically decreased since the $9.5 retest, which resulted in a 40% drop to $5.6.

Today, it is entering the education sector. From cross-border payments to synthetic assets, distributed blockchain ledgers and their tokenization utilities have created powerful financial products that are globally accessible. While blockchain is democratizing finance, its usability doesn&apos;t have to be limited to cryptocurrencies. Another industry that carries equal weightage as finance and needs an immediate restructuring is education. The current system doesn&apos;t cater to all students equitably. Some have more access to higher-level education, while others struggle to get the bare minimum, which was primarily observed during the pandemic. So to make sure such disparity never occurs again and all learners have access to top-notch education, there has to be a solution fundamentally changing the education system from the inside out, and many believe blockchain technology powering the metaverse is the way to go. Blockchains Can Make Structural Changes to Education The distributed ledger technology can significantly impact how teachers and students interact and how academic documentation is done.

The downtrend cut the market price in half before showing a bullish retracement with increased momentum to challenge the correction-generated resistance trendline. This reversal starts from the $140 support level and accounts for a 30% jump to challenge the $175 resistance along with the descending trendline. Source-Tradingview XMR Technical Analysis The recovery rally in XMR prices reached $175 on 15th May, but the excessive selling pressure and bullish fightbacks led to consolidation. This sideways shift now approaches the resistance trendline with hopes of a bullish breakout to reach the $200 mark. With the recent bearish crossover of the 100 and 200-day EMAs, the crucial daily EMAs achieve a bearish alignment. However, the lack of a bearish spread keeps the possibility of a bullish reversal standing strong.

Key technical points: FTM price rose 8% last night. The price action displays a consolidation range in the daily chart. The 24-hour trading volume of Fantom is $401 Million, reflecting a 26% hike. Past Performance of FTM On analyzing the performance of FTM, we saw an 80% drop in market value last month, but it was able to find support at $0.30. Following this interruption in the correction phase, buyers quickly overtook the trend control and led to an upward shift in the range of $0.40 and $0.30.

He noted that the first design flaw of LUNA was that the system could mint a limitless number of new tokens.

Instead, they waited till around $80 billion was wiped off the market before trying to restore parity with $3 billion.

On platforms built using Seaport, users can agree to offer ETH / ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC1155 items in exchange for an NFT, implying bartering a combination of assets. This means that bidders can acquire NFTs using a combination of different assets instead of a single cryptocurrency like ETH. For instance, users can offer a combination of NFTs and cryptocurrencies that totals the value of the NFT that they are looking to acquire. Filtering NFTs by Traits Seaport also allows people to filter NFTs collections by traits, enabling them to purchase NFTs featuring their preferred trait. Offerers can also combine partial fills of offered items with criteria-based items to create standing offers to buy or sell multiple NFTs that all share a given characteristic.
