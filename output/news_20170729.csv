42379664,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KOG7,1501329912,Startups Brace for Bitcoin Cash Fork in Wave of Policy Updates,"What should we do about Bitcoin Cash?  That’s the question facing industry startups, as it seems likely that a group of developers and miners might actually fork from the main bitcoin network next week, forming a brand new cryptocurrency.  Due to differences in opinion about how bitcoin should be governed and what technical features should be added to the cryptocurrency network, the idea of a split has been raised several times over the last few years. But this time, the developers behind Bitcoin Cash claim they plan to go through with it – and on a short timeline.  The cryptocurrency is breaking off from the ""main"" bitcoin blockchain on August 1, with the specific goal of creating a competing cryptocurrency. Everyone who owns bitcoin will have an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash – if and when users and miners split off.  While users are wondering how it will affect them (i.e. how to access Bitcoin Cash and whether they should buy, sell, or ""hodl"" this new type of bitcoin) the ecosystem's third-party companies are grappling with this question as well – especially those that retain custody of funds in some capacity.  Unsure if the new cryptocurrency will rally users – or if it will just fade away – wallet providers, exchanges and mining pools are all issuing statements about how they will deal with the split and how users can respond.  But for most, it's more than a question of politics.  For the CEO of the bitcoin app Coins.ph, Ron Hose, the bitcoin scaling debate has been an economic drain, not only in the mental effort he's put into wrapping his head around the changes, but also in the actions he might need to take to now secure potentially vulnerable customers funds.  Hose told CoinDesk:  ""The biggest cost is time and distraction from executing on what we see as core to our mission of providing financial services to the unbanked.""  Still, he called the features that Bitcoin Cash offers (not necessarily the project itself) ""necessary for bitcoin to continue to evolve as a financial railway,"" adding that a block size increase could become a ""welcome improvement"" despite the short-term headaches.  Tech bottleneck  Often companies pick and choose which cryptocurrencies they support, usually based on how profitable they think it will be for them.  One key takeaway from recently released statements by startups – such as Hong Kong-based exchange ANXPro and mobile wallets Electrum and GreenAddress – though, is that they simply don’t have the time or technical resources to support a new cryptocurrency.  Bitstamp, one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges, stated in vaguer terms that it will ""not be in a position"" to support the ""altcoin,"" while Circle emailed customers to state ""we may never support the new version and any value on it could potentially be lost to you.""  It might be hard to fault the companies that simply don't have the money to commit to making Bitcoin Cash easily redeemable for users.  Still, some see this as a form of fraud, arguing that, since third-party companies that control users' private keys will end up with all the Bitcoin Cash, they're effectively stealing the coins from bitcoin users.  Prepaid phone startup Bitrefill has developed a creative way of dealing with this problem. Like other small firms with limited resources, it does not plan to support the competing cryptocurrency. Instead, it plans to sell all of the Bitcoin Cash it accumulates in exchange for bitcoin – later dividing these funds between users, proportional to the amount of bitcoin each holds with the company.  Some startups are uncertain of the best path, though.  Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift plans to ""turn off trading"" on August 1 for an unspecified amount of time, but didn't say whether the firm will list Bitcoin Cash.  Meanwhile, in what seems to be a minority opinion, bitcoin payments provider BitPay said it believes ""there should be no chain split and no disruption in service on the bitcoin network.""  As such, it does not plan to suspend its services.  Bitcoin Cash support  It's worth noting that Bitcoin Cash has its supporters.  Some want to try out the bitcoin alternative because they support its vision for scaling bitcoin to more users by way of a block size parameter increase, while others anticipate gains in selling their free new coins.  (Others note that developers, by way of Segregated Witness, have made the block size irrelevant through technical breakthroughs that enable other forms of capacity increases.)  Either way, if users want to receive Bitcoin Cash on August 1, they need to move their bitcoin to a wallet where they control their private keys – or, at least, to a wallet that will support Bitcoin Cash.  Some wallets do indeed support Bitcoin Cash. Among these are hardware wallets Trezor and Ledger and mobile wallet Airbitz.  Users will also be able to trade the new coin for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on one of the few exchanges that will support it.  Mining pool ViaBTC has already launched futures trading for the tokens, which at time of writing is trading for 12.5 percent of what ""normal"" bitcoin are worth, at 2,203 Chinese yuan, or $327.  One of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex, will list it under the ticker symbol BCH to ""avoid confusion with bitcoin"" (it has also been given the symbol BCC elsewhere). Chinese exchange Huobi indicated it will reveal more details about trading come August 1.  'Stay rational'?  It doesn't seem like many mining pools or miners support Bitcoin Cash so far, so one of the remaining questions is how diverse and decentralized its computing power – which works in part to add new transactions blocks to the blockchain – will be.  Slush Pool, the first-ever mining pool, said it won’t support it, arguing ""we do not see any real demand from miners."" Mining pool Bixin, with about 5% of the hashrate, also stated that it will keep its hashrate dedicated to the main bitcoin chain and urged other miners to ""stay rational.""  Mining pools Bitmain and Bitcoin.com both plan to uphold the Segwit2x agreement, including the block size parameter increase hard fork, scheduled to activate in three months. They are, though, open to supporting Bitcoin Cash in the future.  ViaBTC, one of the pioneers of the project, remains the only mining pool committed to the cause so far. Yet, it says it isn't putting any of its own mining power toward the effort, instead giving users the option to direct their hardware toward Bitcoin Cash in support.  All these pieces of the ecosystem considered, the bigger question might be, what's the future of Bitcoin Cash?  Although companies are deciding whether or not to make it easy for users to access and use the cryptocurrency, there’s still little evidence that more than a few companies, developers, users, and mining pools plan to actually move over to it and use it long-term.  Still, some users cite ethereum classic as an example of a cryptocurrency that exceeded expectations in the long run, due support from enthusiastic and ideologically driven supporters.  As usual, we will just have to wait and see.

42379650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KO11,1501317043,ViaBTC Claims Neutrality Ahead of Bitcoin Cash's Likely Launch,"Often described as the ""ringleader"" of a controversial plan to fork the bitcoin blockchain, mining pool ViaBTC is speaking out against the idea that it's the driving force behind a bitcoin alternative called Bitcoin Cash.  A fork of bitcoin that would create a new network with new rules, Bitcoin Cash is notable in its rejection of code changes favored by other developers to boost the network's transaction capacity.  But what separates the project from any other bitcoin fork is that Bitcoin Cash will share a transaction history with the original blockchain, dating back to the network's inception. As opposed to creating its own tokens in, say, an ICO, everyone who owns any of the more than 16.5 million bitcoins in existence will have an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash if it's created.  While this may sound like just another proposal (and it is one of a very large number introduced in the scaling debate of late), Bitcoin Cash took a notable step forward earlier this week when ViaBTC launched futures trading for the tokens – and trading took off (it had about $11m in volume on Thursday).  At that point, ViaBTC did something that hadn't been done for the idea previously: give Bitcoin Cash economic value for the first time. It was a move that also further legitimized the fork in the eyes of others, one that was later followed by a range of statements from exchanges worldwide as to how they would handle the fork. At press time, one as-yet-nonexistent Bitcoin Cash token was worth roughly 2,203 yuan, or $327.  But while it's this decision that helped push the project forward, ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang and COO Sara Ouyang aren't claiming responsibility for it. To the extent this perception exists, they argue it's a Western creation, one compounded by the fact that information is often shared in rough translations that ultimately spark more confusion.  Yang told CoinDesk that, as a company, ViaBTC doesn't even plan to mine Bitcoin Cash. Rather, as a mining pool operator, ViaBTC will enable users in its pool to mine the asset if they choose.  He said:  ""It depends on the miners, it's their choice. They can choose to mine bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. We are just an exchange platform, we are neutral on this.""  And to an extent, Yang said the company has to be. As ViaBTC is a mining pool, it relies on other miners to use its platform (and it competes against a wide range of mining industry software providers in the process).  In this way, Yang said the exchange simply has to remain open to users. It notably launched a trading pair for the UASF proposalhttps://www.viabtc.com/convert/148, a move that Yang said he doesn't believe is in the best interest of the network.  And while the difference in tone for both product announcements is notable, he cautions that it's not exactly his role to choose.  ""We don't think it's a bad thing or a good thing. It's a choice of the market. We provide the technical services to support those trading,"" he said.  Closet moderate?  Best known for his vocal dislike for bitcoin's development team (even going so far as calling for them to be fired), Yang still notably considers himself a moderate in the scaling debate.  In interview, he paints himself as someone who was willing to test out different ideas (by listing futures options on the exchange) and accept the results.  ""A month ago, we released a BIP 148 futures trading, but the trading went not very good. Now, we can see the global users coming to buy and sell the BCC [Bitcoin Cash], so it's like a lot more market fever for this,"" he said.  On August 1, ViaBTC intends to suspend withdrawalshttps://www.viabtc.com/announcement/detail?id=3 so that it can begin listing actual Bitcoin Cash tokens, and other mining pool operators have said they will use the term Bitcoin Cash and the BCC ticker symbol to differentiate it from bitcoin, generally represented by the ticker symbol BTC.  And while ViaBTC previously said that it would not move to define users' balances as ""BTC"", citing ""the complexity of a bitcoin fork"", Yang suggested that he's willing to go with consensus on the matter.  Still, he seems to think and hope that Bitcoin Cash will become the dominate blockchain.  ""I feel the best chance BCC will get majority hashing power and it will become the bitcoin banner,"" he said.  As for whether that's possible, given that bitcoin's mining difficulty can adjust, remains another matter, though his thoughts on this were less clear.  Communication breakdown  Overall, Yang's comments also point to an East-West disconnect in the scaling debate.  While the perception in the West is that Bitcoin Cash won't be widely used, he argues that this isn't true in Asia. He reported that a majority of ViaBTC's users are from Japan and Korea, and that most of its exchange users are generally from outside China.  The comments, as well as some of the nuance in Yang's positioning, suggest that the fork may also best be considered the end result of a continual lack of communication, coupled with the difficulty of carrying out long, deeply philosophical arguments with individuals who have cultural and linguistic differences.  With this upswing in support, Yang thinks that Bitcoin Cash could one day co-exist with bitcoin in the same way that ethereum and its fork, ethereum classic, continue to develop in tandem.  Yang concluded:  ""I think [Western exchanges] will support it eventually. That's a fight for the users. They have no other choice, or they will lose the market share.""
