CoinDesk has identified as many as nine more websites claiming to sell the Telegram token after previously reporting on another fake website, which claimed to be run by the ""Telegram Foundation.""  Most of the sites claim that the token pre-sale will end sometime this weekend, with the price listed near $1. Notably, the first bogus website identified by CoinDesk has since been taken down.  Many of the websites found in CoinDesk's review are similar, with several sharing common design elements, while other sites are blatant clones of each other. Additionally, several of the sites use identical language to describe their purported offering:  ""We present GRAM, the representative cryptocurrency of the TON Blockchain. 200 millions of [sic] Telegram users will get a TON wallet making it the world’s most adopted cryptocurrency, it will easily accommodate millions of users and thousands of decentralized applications, to provide direct payment channels to transfer value in milliseconds.""  Domain-ownership searches of the websites yielded varying results, including some entries that attempt to provide an air of legitimacy.  For example, Telegram.tokyo was registered by someone claiming to be Telegram founder Pavel Durov, while tonico.info was attributed to another apparent Russian resident named Vladimir Timofeev.  It is unclear whether these individuals have any connection to the sites registered in their names. For most of the sites, the domain registration was hidden.  The problem, as previously reported, is that the Telegram sale is taking place out of the public eye. So far, any sales have been restricted to accredited investors, and it is unclear who exactly is buying into Telegram's proposed platform.  Furthermore, no tokens are actually being sold right now: Telegram’s ICO is operating under a simple agreement for future tokens framework, meaning the tokens being purchased will not be distributed until several waiting periods have elapsed. The longest period will last 18 months.  Similarly, it is unclear whether Telegram has taken any action to tamp down on these activities. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

His initial focus is new consumer protections, public documents suggest. To start, Hoekstra wants to talk with credit card companies about potentially instituting stronger protections for people who buy cryptocurrency with credit cards, for example.  Under some of the proposals put forth by Hoekstra, local exchange platforms and cryptocurrency services would reportedly need to register with the government and adhere to know-your-customer requirements by the end of 2019. In the letter, the finance minister proposed new laws to help protect initial coin offering (ICOs) participants as well.  He explained:  ""It is being investigated whether investors in ICOs can become just as good protected as investors with a normal IPO or bond issue. The current framework is not sufficient for this.""  The proposals are notable, given that regulators in the country have flagged issues around the tech – ICOs in particular – in the past.  The Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (AFM), which is the Dutch equivalent of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, issued a statement last November calling the ICO market a ""dangerous cocktail."" In a nod to those statements, Hoekstra proposed bans that would prohibit advertising risky financial products to ordinary consumers.  Further, he promised to work with other countries in the European Union and promote cooperative research to explore the ""cross-border nature of the market.""  Still, Hoekstra indicated that within the Netherlands, more work is needed on updating the country's laws to account for cryptocurrencies and the more speculative activities around it.  ""The current supervisory framework and instruments are insufficiently tailored to cryptocurrency,"" he wrote in the letter.

42428671,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qNh,1520629322,Vitalik Reveals New Idea for Plasma Scaling On Ethereum,"In a surprise appearance at the ethereum community conference EthCC in Paris on Friday, ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin presented a scaling solution for Plasma, a system of smart contracts that seeks to increase the computational potential of the world's second-largest blockchain.  Created by Buterin and Bitcoin Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon last year, the scaling solution is one of many under development that aims to boost the capacity of ethereum, specifically working by creating a layer of smart contracts that can interact with the main blockchain.  But while the current iteration of the prototype requires all users to download and validate each smart contract in the Plasma system, in his new talk, Buterin described a way to limit this to a handful of data points.  ""The main benefit here is that basically the amount of data that clients need to process goes down by a lot,"" Buterin explained.  Rather than having to download the entire Plasma history, users would be able to instead generate ""Plasma coins"" by sending a deposit to the contract. As such, instead of downloading and verifying everything, users could simply track the tokens they have created within that system.  ""Now users only have to verify the availability and correctness of the Plasma chain only at the specific index that they want to spend, or the specific index of any coins that they own and coins that they care about,"" Buterin said.  Created by Buterin and developers Dan Robinson and Karl Floersch, the idea has yet to undergo testing. However, according to Buterin, this minimized system could have a number of important use cases, such as protecting cryptocurrency exchanges from large-scale hacks.  Rather than dealing directly with user funds, the vision is that exchanges could provide order book functionality and insure losses through Plasma contracts.  ""Hopefully when the next multi-billion dollar exchange written by a totally incompetent developer gets hacked, no one will lose any money,"" Buterin said.  And crucially, the discovery could help accelerate scaling efforts at a time where the platform is under pressure to keep up with the demands of an expanding user base.  In a nod to this, Buterin said:  ""It's just one simple way to make Plasma more scalable and vastly reduce its usage requirements for regular users.""

However, it's not certain whether this digital currency will take the form of a cryptocurrency or whether some other technological innovation will form the basis of this currency, he said in remarks during a press conference on Friday, in which he also took aim at speculation around cryptocurrency markets.  Any potential development of a digital currency will follow the needs China believes must be fulfilled, he said. The first need, he explained is that any digital currency must focus on ""convenience, rapidity and low cost in a retail payment system while taking into account security and protection of privacy.""  Despite some speculation to the contrary, Zhou didn't formally unveil any kind of digital currency product – rather, he outlined what it may look like, suggesting that distributed ledger tech could underpin a future release.  Yet as it stands, existing cryptocurrencies do not meet the aforementioned needs, he said, going on to explain:  ""We think that we need to be more cautious in this direction, because this doesn't serve our goals that financial products shall serve the real economy.""  To that end, the bank must carefully research any bank-backed digital currency to prevent it from becoming a speculative product, he said.  ""The emphasis should be to serve the real economy,"" he remarked, adding that any new digital currency should also ""not conflict with the current financial order.""

It enables trustees to not only invest funds in legal investments, it also provides powers to work with different entities as well as to contract out the services required to maximize an investment.  An amendment to both bills would allow educators participating in post-employment benefits investment trusts through local agencies to continue doing so. While it is not explicitly stated, it seems to indicate that these trusts can potentially be invested in cryptocurrencies without impacting educators.  If passed, this would mark the first time public trustees would be banned from investing in cryptocurrencies for retirement funds.

42428667,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qFh,1520614834,US Rep: Congress Must 'Push Back' Against Blockchain Overregulation,"Blockchain technology could drive the most significant change in society since the American Revolution, U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer says. But only if regulators resist the temptation to be heavy-handed.      “Now, it’s been two-hundred and thirty some years. We’ve kind of gone through this evolution,” Emmer told CoinDesk at the D.C. Blockchain Summit this week. “We’ve been centralizing, consolidating authority for years. This technology…it could maybe restore what it was the founders were looking for, what they tried to create.”      But the transformative potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies will never be fulfilled if regulators overreach, he said.      “We have to be vigilant and we have to remember that you create room for innovation when you don’t stifle it,” Emmer said. “And too much regulation, too many regulators has a tendency to put a wet blanket on it.”    And that's where Emmer says he and his colleagues on the Congressional Blockchain Caucus come in. He told CoinDesk:  “It’s up to members of Congress with election certificates to push back where it’s appropriate to push back.”  Japan as a model    Emmer said the U.S. would do well to mirror Japan, where only one regulatory body, the Financial Services Agency, has jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies.      More clarity and certainty would help the blockchain space to flourish, but “the way you do that is you don’t have a dozen or so agencies that are all trying to grab for a piece of the jurisdiction and responsibility.”      Rather, the best situation would be “one agency, you know where you’re going, you know who’s in charge, you know what the issue is, what you have to respond to.”      Yet government regulation is not the only way to achieve clarity and certainty about the rules of the road, Emmer claimed.      “I think the industry can actually supply a lot of this, and then it’s going to be up to legislators to be vigilant about recognizing we want the industry to do as much as it possibly can,"" he said, adding:      ""There might be some very basic things when it comes to fraud, those types of issues the government might need to be involved in. But you shouldn’t default to government. You should default to the industry, and then working with the industry you should be able to find those rules.”              In any event, Emmer said Congress is not yet ready to act and that he didn’t expect to see related bills emerging in the near future.      “First you have to educate people,” he said, a process which will be underway next week at a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing entitled “Examining the Cryptocurrencies and ICO Markets.”    Political football    Emmer did suggest, however, that legislators could eventually develop ""some actual proposals"" in the next legislative session beginning in 2019. And while he said that his colleagues on the caucus were treating blockchain and cryptocurrencies as non-partisan issues, he would not be surprised if they were eventually politicized.      “The people that are most interested in this are the young people that are probably most distrustful of government,"" Emmer said. ""So don’t be surprised if a politician tries to grab ahold of some area of it and either bring it under their control, because they can’t control it, or utilize it as a political ‘something.’”      He added that he was unsure of what that ""something"" might entail.      Regardless of any future efforts politicians and regulators might make to assert their influence over blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Emmer said he is largely optimistic.      “I think that the future is bright for blockchain,” he said, adding a precaution, “I do think we in government have to be very careful about keeping the dogs at bay.”    Image by Annaliese Milano for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Annaliese Milano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/09/us-rep-congress-must-push-back-against-blockchain-overregulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/418b1530c4e3bbb6d3889ea5a6a467e3177b72ef-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428679,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qdh,1520604001,Bitcoin Dropped 20% But Wasn't Week's Big Crypto Price Loser,"If February was bad for the crypto market, March hasn't fared better.  Bitcoin's (BTC) repeated failure to beat inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance saw bears come in full force, pushing prices to a one-month low of $8,371 Friday. As of writing, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $8,970, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  But the 28 percent drop from BTC's March 5 high of $11,660 had broader implications, pushing the market capitalization below $350 billion for the first time since Feb. 14.  The sell-off in BTC seems to have roiled broader markets, a trend evident by the fact the top 25 cryptos by total value are all reporting weekly losses.  As such, while bitcoin has depreciated by 20.98 percent week-on-week, it's notably not the top loser of the week, with TRON, ICON and IOTA ranking higher on bigger losses.  Nano  Weekly performance: -42.65 percent  All-time high: $34.40  Closing price on March 2: $16.20  Current market price: $9.29  Rank as per market capitalization: 22  Having topped out at $17.38 on March 1, nano prices fell below $10 today for the first time since Feb. 23 this week.  So, despite positive news, such as a thumbs up from influential litecoin founder Charlie Lee, the endorsement failed to keep the nano bid amid a broader market sell-off.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is seen changing hands at 0.0011 BTC (about $10) on Binance. The recovery from the intraday low of BTC 0.001008 (roughly $9) in the wake of oversold conditions (as shown by the relative strength index) has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook.  However, only an upside break of the descending channel would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  TRON  Weekly performance: -38.51 percent  All-time high: $0.30  Closing price on March 2: $0.05  Current market price: $0.03  Rank as per market capitalization: 15  After rocketing to records earlier this year, TRON showed signs it hasn't quite been able to recover from the backlash of severe criticism.  This week, TRON even reached a strategic partnership with Trip.io to advance blockchain applications in the travel industry, and announced a strategic cooperation with BitGuild (a blockchain game platform).  Elsewhere, TRON Founder Justin Sun went so far as to reveal plans to accelerate the launch of main net.  Still, the positive news flow failed to put a floor under TRON prices. TRX/USD fell to $0.03 yesterday – its lowest level since Feb. 8.  ICON  Weekly performance: -38 percent  All-time high: $12.04  Closing price on March 2: $3.71  Current market price: $2.30  Rank as per market capitalization: 24  February's top loser hasn't had a good start this month.  Prices for ICON's ICX token fell to $2.16 on Binance – the lowest level since Dec. 22, with a series of lower highs and lower lows on the daily chart indicating the bears are in control of the market.  However, short-term oversold conditions as shown by the relative strength index could yield a minor corrective rally.

42428676,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qXh,1520600455,OKCoin CEO Hints at China Cooperation In Leaked Chat,"The founder of one of the largest cryptocurrency businesses in China appears willing to work more closely with the government.  In comments that first emerged in an all-staff messaging group on WeChat, Star Xu, the founder of exchange services provider OKCoin, discussed a press conference Friday in which the governor of People's Bank of China (PBoC) addressed various financial issues including cryptocurrency.  A screen capture of the group chat further shows that Xu told the staff he had also briefed the country's central bank on OKCoin's overseas expansion plan, its research on blockchain development and notably, a commitment that the firm is ""prepared to donate it to the country anytime in the future.""  The lack of clarity inherent in the remark has since drawn speculation on Chinese-language social media, with at least one domestic media outlet also taking note of the claim.  In a response to a CoinDesk inquiry, a spokesperson from OKEx, the crypto-to-crypto trading platform under OKCoin, confirmed the authenticity of group chat, acknowledging Xu did share the messages with internal staff.  However, the firm did not further clarify what exactly is to be donated – whether it's the group's crypto exchange business or the blockchain research results, or elaborate on why Xu would make such a claim.  Yet, the comment is notable given recently reported measures taken by Chinese authorities to clamp down on domestic cryptocurrency companies. Currently, the WeChat social media channel of OKEx, the crypto-to-crypto trading platform under OKCoin, is being blocked, and a previous report indicated that this was due to tightened government oversight.  As reported by CoinDesk, following PBoC's ban on initial coin offering and fiat-to-crypto trading in September last year, OKCoin has since moved its platform overseas to continue offering trading services to investors.

42428674,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qPh,1520598645,NY Wealth Manager to Issue Loans Against Bitcoin,"Crypto rich but low on cash?  With all the ICOs that have taken place (not to mention the meteoric rise in the value of crypto assets late last year), there are a lot of entrepreneurs who fit this description, but few products that allow them to turn long-term HODLing into actionable capital.  That's the idea behind a new subsidiary being started by Dominion Capital, a family office based in New York City. While the company has long invested in a variety of assets, Dominion's known for helping to finance projects by backing loans.  As it turns out, Dominion has also been quietly involved in crypto for years, and the firm believes now is the time to prove the worth of the nascent asset class by expanding its services into the sector.  ""Community is a huge part of this movement,"" CEO Mikhail Gurevich told CoinDesk. ""One of the tests of whether assets are legitimate is if people are willing to lend against them.""  For the entrepreneurs who are willing to bet on the strength of their holdings, there's a strategic opportunity at play. Essentially, the service would allow individuals and projects to borrow against either their own crypto assets (or those invested by supporters) rather than converting them directly to cash.  As such, Gurevich expects the idea could even draw some of the largest ICOs, many of which have raised millions in assets that are hard to liquidate.  Gurevich told CoinDesk:  ""We had a number of companies come to us who had raised an ICO to borrow with crypto as collateral. [There's] $1 billion-worth of demand out there.""  Dominion, Gurevich said, will likely only offer loans against bitcoin at first, with the intention to expand into other currencies as it finds product-market fit.  In turn, Dominion's new company will take custody of the collateral for the life of the loan.  Prior lenders  Still, it's worth noting that lending against bitcoin isn't exactly a new idea, and early movers in crypto lending didn't exactly succeed in building a large market.  Founded in 2013, BTCJam quit accepting new U.S. customers in 2016, citing regulatory concerns, and it aims to wind down completely on July 1, according to public statements.  BitLendingClub, founded a year later, also announced it would wind down in late 2016.  However, most of that group of efforts were launched in 2013 and aimed at the consumer market, which dried up over 2014 and 2015 as the price of bitcoin fell dramatically and there was more selling than holding going on.  Still, not all of these early ventures are gone. Another company from the same era, Germany's Bitbond, was able to hang on, raising $1.2 million in early 2017.  New companies have also seen the opportunity. SALT, which ran an ICO late last year, is advised by Shapeshift founder Erik Voorhees, and it offers fiat loans against crypto assets. Another is ETHLend, both of which were covered in an article on the use case by Bloomberg late last year.  Still, Gurevich argues that none of the existing efforts have the right mix of user experience, capital and strategic partners, and he believes Dominion can bring all three together in its as yet-unnamed new venture.  ""We think of Dominion Capital as an incubator of strategies,"" Gurevich said.  How it works  Key to its realization of the idea will be the partners Dominion expects to bring together at launch.  Indeed, Gurevich acknowledges that what's been missing from the space so far is banks. ""We want to bring in a number of strategic investors to help us build this out,"" Gurevich said.  So far, Dominion has already spent $1 million of its own funds building a minimum viable product, and it will formally start a Series A in a couple of weeks, aiming to raise $5 million that will be used develop the product, design the user experience and hire a team.  After that, it will make a modest amount of initial loans.  Once it has a working beta, the team expects to raise $100 million in a credit facility to finance loans, either through large hedge funds or a public bond offering.  ""We think there could be a lot of interest for this type of product in the current yield-starved debt markets,"" Gurevich said.  Still, while nothing is set in stone yet, Gurevich said it's likely that they should be able to lend at roughly 50 percent of the value of the asset under loan. There will be terms in place – similar to margin calls – in case the value of the collateral asset drops dramatically.  Gurevich concluded:  ""This will hopefully help legitimize the entire field.""

While nothing has been stated publicly by Bitmain, the bitcoin mining hardware producer appears be connected to a new company called Ant Creek, LLC, that, reports say, is trying to build mining facilities in Washington state.  According to business data site companies-number.com, Bitmain's co-founder, Jihan Wu, is the sole governing person behind Ant Creek, which was founded on June 28, 2017 and is registered as an active for-profit entity in the state.  While the company does not have a listed address, the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin reports that the Port of Walla Walla, a city in Washington, is considering a land-use agreement with Ant Creek. Under the terms of the agreement, Ant Creek would lease land from the beginning of 2019, with an option to purchase up to 40 acres.  If approved, the Union-Bulletin reports, this land would be used to develop and operate a cryptocurrency mining facility.  The development is notable, given the general lack of communication on this move – there appear to be no documents linking Bitmain with Ant Creek publicly available.  However, the report indicates the new mining facilities are already past the early stages of development, stating that Ant Creek’s proposal would bring 15–20 jobs and $7–$10 million in private investments to the city. Further, one local official said he has been working with the company for roughly six months.  This is just the latest expansion effort by the China-based ASIC chip producer, which in recent months has launched expansion efforts in Canada and Switzerland, as reported by CoinDesk.

According to an announcement from Civil, Cannabis Wire's newsroom is targeted at offering different types of content for both individual consumers and larger organizations such as farms, lawmakers and lobbyists.  “We’re promoting a more objective standard for responsibly covering the cannabis industry. Many people don't realize the scope of it today, and the myriad ways it can affect them,"" said Alyson Martin, co-founder of Cannabis Wire.  Civil touts a mechanism that can incentivize Cannabis Wire's newsroom staff to disseminate quality journalism by distributing the content over its decentralized platform. Readers pay for content with cryptocurrency, and the system sidesteps the need for advertisers and avoids political influence.  Newsrooms are self-governed by community members using Civil's ERC-20 ""CVL"" token. In addition, the platfrom also boasts that archives are tamper-proof, since content is stored on a distributed ledger.  Civil's decentralized newsroom received $5 million in funding last October last year from blockchain development firm ConsenSys. As reported, Civil said at the time half of the funding would be used to develop its services.  While still in development and the success of the newsroom's operation are yet to be seen, Civil has signed up at least five publications, including Cannabis Wire, according to its website.

42428677,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qbh,1520589602,"Bears in Control, But Bitcoin Eyes $8K Defense","Bitcoin's 28 percent drop this week has turned the tide in favor of the bears, but a sustained break below $8,000 looks unlikely in the short-run, the price charts indicate.  Having registered losses for four straight days, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price index (BPI) fell to a one-month low of $8,371 in Asian hours. The decline was in line with the bearish continuation pattern seen on the bitcoin (BTC) charts during the U.S. session. The sell-off has pushed the market capitalization of BTC below $150 billion for the first time since Feb. 14.  As of writing, the BPI is seen at $8,590. Despite the slight recovery from the session's low, the cryptocurrency is down 14.5 percent on a 24-hour basis, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  Furthermore, most other crypto-market leaders are reporting double-digit losses. For instance, ether has depreciated by 10.11 percent in the last 24 hours, while bitcoin cash, NEO, stellar, and cardano are down 10 percent each.  The 28 percent drop in BTC seen this week indicates the corrective rally from the Feb. 6 lows below $6,000 has ended, and the bearish drop from December's record high of around $20,000 has resumed. So, there is potential for prices to revisit $6,000 going forward.  However, chart analysis suggests that BTC could consolidate around $8,000, or witness a minor rally to $10,000 over the next 24–48 hours, before heading down again.  4-hour chart: BTC looks oversold  Daily chart: Primary trend is bearish  A close today (as per UTC) below $9,280 would confirm a double-top bearish reversal and open the doors for a drop to $6,860 (target as per the measured height method). So the primary trend – if you hadn't guessed – is bearish.  View  Bitcoin looks set for a drop to $6,860 and could possibly extend losses as low as $6,000, as indicated by the bearish setup on the daily chart.  However, oversold conditions as seen in the 4-hour chart could yield a minor corrective rally in the short-term to $10,000.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently seen at $10,527) would signal the sell-off has ended and will likely be followed by a bout of consolidation.

42428666,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qDh,1520586027,Progress Slows On Once-Hot Ethereum Privacy Projects,"Ethereum's moon math is showing signs of coming back to earth.  Such was the feeling at EthCC, an ethereum developer conference in Paris, Thursday, where a dedicated privacy track struck a somber note compared to years past.  Indeed, despite a software upgrade in October that saw improvements built to pave the way for confidentiality, such methods have been shown to exceed ethereum's processing capacity, with the computationally intense cryptography all but bringing the blockchain to its limits.  So, while developers like Andrew Miller had predicted a rise in privacy-centric ethereum applications just months ago, the conference showcased how an almost eerie silence has followed as scaling and security obstacles have proven more difficult to solve than foreseen.  As evidence, ZoKrates, a programming language aimed to equip average developers with the ability to code private contracts, has struggled to find its way out of the setup phase.  Speaking in a presentation today, the code's creator, Jacob Eberhardt, said that ethereum will need to add more cryptographic variables in a system-wide software upgrade for the concept to work. Still, Eberhardt also bemoaned that, given the controversy that can follow such a suggestion, it's perhaps not one that will be adopted quite so easily.  “We don’t want to keep adding new crypto,” Eberhardt said.  Matthew Di Ferrante, developer at the Ethereum Foundation and founder of smart contract company ZK Labs, echoed this cautionary tone. In a discussion on the relationship and trade-offs between privacy and scalability on ethereum, Di Ferrante went so far as to warn the audience.  “If you think ethereum isn’t scalable now, or that blockchains aren’t scalable now, the further you get the more alarming it is. Everyone likes to talk about the magic, but not many people can write the code,"" he said.  The statement is notable considering the urgency of the ideas at stake.  In particular, zero-knowledge proofs, due to their ability to compress information in a concise format, could eventually work to reduce information on the ethereum blockchain, thus enabling better scaling.  According to Di Ferrante, such achievements are still possible, they’re just a little further down the line.  He told the audience:  “Progress is slow but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible.”  Waiting for privacy  As an example, Di Ferrante pointed to blockchain voting to illustrate the problems faced today.  “A vote of a thousand people would require a thousand signatures each a thousand bytes each. You would never be able to check a single signature due to the block gas limit,” Di Ferrante said.  Such a use case is the core emphasis of Di Ferrante’s research, which seeks to anonymize proofs through the use of ring signatures – a way of obscuring information in a retrievable way that works by aggregating the data within a group.  Di Ferrante has found that by using bi-linear pairings, a form of elliptic curve that is active within the ethereum virtual machine, various shortcuts in the complex cryptography can be made to minimize the scalability trade-off.  However, while his prototype has a working implementation, Di Ferrante told the audience, “It’s just ridiculous, it’s way too inefficient, if people started using that as a main service the chain would go down again.”  And that wasn’t the only sobering note struck at the conference today.  Currently, in order to generate a ZoKrates contract, each individual needs to enact the setup phase themselves, a fact that is perhaps slowing the adoption of zero-knowledge cryptography into businesses built on the ethereum platform.  In the generation of a zk-snark, information is produced that could allow the holder of the information to falsely manufacture transactions, providing the data generated by the zk-snark had not been destroyed.  Whereas zcash corrected this by introducing many participants to destroy the data, thus furthering security, such criteria would be harder to enforce in ZoKrates, as the setup is limited to each individual node.  Light at the end of the tunnel  However, the conference was not without optimism, too.  In another talk, ""Silur,"" a member of the monero research lab, described his work to implement a newly improved ring signature into blockchain-agnostic code, one that could function in monero, ethereum or bitcoin, irrespectively.  Also known as RuffCT, StringCT or RTRS RingCT, these signatures allow for a more complete form of confidentiality compared to their predecessors by hiding, not just transaction amounts, but also destinations and sender addresses.  Crucially, it achieves this in a secure way, without relying on any kind of trusted setup. The work will be explained in more detail in an upcoming white paper, Silur said.  And perhaps propelling the research forward is the necessity for such tools today.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Gregor Zavcer of DataFund, an ethereum-based startup that allows users to reclaim sovereignty of their data, said that, until zero-knowledge cryptography on ethereum become more mature, the company will retain its users' data in a centralized, securely encrypted database.  Down the line, Zavcer hopes that advancements in privacy could “change the interaction paradigm” when it comes to data exchange. “We could design the process so the individual will be really able to share information on a need-to-know basis,” Zavcer said.  And the challenges faced by privacy today aren’t just technical, he told CoinDesk. When it comes to DataFund, “it’s about how we integrate in a way that is frictionless and adds value.”  Further, advancements in privacy could change the way that we integrate with the digital world more broadly. Because of the ability for users to be selective regarding the information they reveal online, Zavcer said:  “If we can model interactions online according to the expectations of the physical world, then zero-knowledge proofs would enable a conversation, and not just a data dump.”  Privacy masks via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC | RESEARCH,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/09/progress-slows-on-once-hot-ethereum-privacy-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36c7b7ba3001f89919a662d60359bc8e9d99ee10-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at a press conference amid the Two Sessions, China's annual political event, People's Bank of China (PBoC) governor Zhou Xiaochuan took aim at cryptocurrency projects that have shifted away from their purported use cases in favor of promoting what is essentially market speculation.  ""Lots of cryptocurrencies have seen explosive growth which can bring significant negative impact on consumers and retail investors,"" Zhou said. ""We don't like (cryptocurrency) products that make huge opportunity for speculation that gives people the illusion of getting rich overnight.""  The comment may signal an increasing level of scrutiny down the road by the PBoC over initial coin offerings and trading services that are still available for domestic investors, even after regulators issued a ban on ICOs and essentially pushed fiat-to-crypto exchanges out of the domestic market.  It also follows recent measures reportedly taken by Chinese regulators to block social media channels offered by cryptocurrency exchanges that still provide trading services in the country.  That said, the central bank still holds what appears to be a positive view on blockchain development, and projects trying to bring genuine services to consumers. That position is also in line with the PBoC's efforts to study applications of the tech through its digital currency research lab.  On Friday, Zhou called for those behind such efforts to be cautious – and not to grow too fast.  ""For blockchain projects with technological potentials, they should conduct thorough testing before rolling out services.

According to a 2018 Fintech Action Plan released on Thursday, the European Commission – the executive arm of the European Union – plans to form a new Fintech Lab in the second quarter in 2018.  The new initiative will see participants from EU-level and national authorities, as well as technology providers in Europe, seek to raise the ""regulatory and supervisory capacity and knowledge"" around new technologies, including blockchain.  ""Technologies like blockchain can be game changers for financial services and beyond. We need to build an enabling framework to let innovation flourish, while managing risks and protecting consumers,"" Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society, said in a statement.  The report identified areas of possible development, including legal clarifications around smart contracts, initial coin offerings, and other jurisdictional issues raised by the tech.  Indeed, the new plan marks the latest move by the European Union to foster work around blockchain within in a regulated environment.  Currently, according to the document, the European Union has already revised its Payment Services Directive since January this year, which requires banks in the region to open up their communication channels, such as API, to blockchain applications that require payment account integrations, for instance.  The Commission's FinTech plan also highlighted work already done within its Blockchain Observatory initiative, which was launched last year as part of an effort to create a common framework for use of the tech within the economic bloc.

42401209,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcM0yV,1520553619,Time to Acknowledge – and Encourage – Women in Blockchain,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.      It's International Women's Day – a good time for a mea culpa to the overlooked women in the blockchain industry.  Last week, Paul Vigna and I presided over a Museum of American Finance event at Fordham University to mark the publication of our new book, The Truth Machine.  We sold a good number of books. We were very happy.  But the event could have, and should have, been different.  The lineup of speakers  , excellent as it was, was entirely composed of white men. It further reinforced the idea that the world of cryptocurrency and blockchains is a male-dominated affair, and it did so before an impressionable audience of relative newcomers to the technology.  We helped perpetuate an imbalance in which the narrative, the access, the culture and thus the development and policymaking behind this technology has been steered by a small group of similar male elites. In planning the event, we’d fallen for the oldest mind trick in the book, and it had been played on us by very own minds: the bias of habit and of insufficient critical thinking.  I’m especially embarrassed about this because I’ve been preaching for some time the urgent need for diversity in the crypto community.  My concerns are only slightly fueled by stories of the ugly “bro” culture and showy displays of wealth that permeate the crypto trading community. It is sad that the ""lambo"" crowd in general gets so much attention from mainstream press. Relative to so many other important elements of the blockchain and crypto ecosystem, it’s a sideshow.  The bigger problem is that in those more important realms – the areas of software and protocol development, of entrepreneurship and of policy negotiation – male voices are also overly dominant. These are the people writing the rules by which this vital new technology gets to evolve. If our economic existence is to be defined by these new, far-reaching algorithms, humanity needs as a diverse an input as possible into their development.  There’s no a shortage of brilliant female minds in this space. Those who suggest there is are guilty of the same circular arguments rife in anti-feminist arguments everywhere: that men are simply better at this stuff, as proven by their prominent leadership positions. “Better” is defined by its own, internal parameters. Men, wielding power, set the terms of the debate.  I know loads of women providing intelligent, outside-the-box perspectives on the challenges and solutions we face across the multi-disciplinary arena that blockchain technology resides within. I work for one of them at MIT. But rather than deliver some tokenistic sample of those names, I want to instead focus here on just one woman in this industry, because he story has helped me discover the pitfalls of my own biases.  Glaring omission  Recently, I was at a birthday party for Sandra Ro (a woman who, incidentally, masterminded the CME Group’s bitcoin futures policy before departing her position as that company’s blockchain lead just before they were launched to pursue a new blockchain-based commodity exchange project in Africa.) The venture capitalist Jalak Jobanputra was present at that party. When I mentioned our new book, she asked whether she was in it. When I said that I didn’t think so, she politely pointed out that her name had not appeared in Paul’s and my prior book, The Age of Cryptocurrency, either.  My first thought was, well, sorry, but loads of people weren’t cited; we can’t please everyone. But after pointing out that index contained just a tiny smattering of female names, she explained why she truly deserved to be included. You see, Jobanputra was one of the very first investors in a bitcoin venture. As early as 2013 she was putting money into startups such as Blockchain.info (now known simply as Blockchain), the wallet and data services company that last year announced a $40 million new round of financing from the likes of GV (formerly Google Ventures), Lakestar and billionaire investor Richard Branson.  Like anyone’s at the time, Jobanputra’s investments were a bold bet. She saw an opportunity that only a few visionaries could spot. (I certainly didn’t see the potential of this technology at that time.) And in Jobanputra’s case, it was fueled by a passionate belief in its sweeping social impact, in particular its potential to improve the lives of billions locked out of the global financial system. (That rationale drove her to invest in another female trailblazer: Elizabeth Rossiello, who, in 2013 quit a traditional finance career that had included stints in investment banking for Credit Suisse in Zurich and London to set up shop in Nairobi with a bitcoin-based cross-border payments startup called BitPesa.)  The Age of Cryptocurrency was filled with stories of wild adventurers who’d bet big on bitcoin and on early bitcoin projects, the guys who set the foundation for all that has since come and will come. There was no mention of Jobanputra. Yet she was surely as bold and as important as any of them. The book was well received and earned acclaim – as we hope will be The Truth Machine. But both need more stories like hers.  A vicious circle  Why did we overlook Jobanputra? A simplistic argument is that she hadn’t promoted herself sufficiently. Indeed, I only got to know her after the book was published. But that’s too easy. The reality is that we were part of a vicious circle in which structural barriers make it much harder for women investors, entrepreneurs and innovators to get their stories out and be noticed. Those barriers include being under-represented at conferences and in books, articles and media.  Those barriers often reside in our heads, reinforced by a male-dominated industry that doesn’t challenge the status quo. Well-meaning men will neglect to think sufficiently about these issues because there’s little downside to not doing so. There’s no imperative to break with that status quo. And so, we hit the trifecta: two books with underrepresented stories of women and a conference.  Importantly, women themselves are taking action to overcome these biases. Jobanputra, along with Ro, Rossiello and other women in blockchain such as CoinDesk Advisory Board member Maja Vujinovic, recently gathered in Brooklyn to set up a group called the Collective Future to advocate for diversity in the crypto industry.    Brooklyn: time to talk about #crypto #regulation #legal @AndreaTinianow & @josh_blockchain discussion leaders #fpvwomen - major implications for states, govt, & securities pic.twitter.com/Eb3vXAS7P5        — Sandra Ro (@srolondon) February 10, 2018      But this effort will succeed more readily if men like us, who also care about diversity, start tackling their own biases.  And no doubt this column will prompt a backlash from some quarters. But for those who agree with us, this is surely the right moment to act. Unless you’ve been living under rock, you’ll know that the past year has produced a reckoning with the problem of male indifference.  The #MeToo movement is not just about egregious abusers of power like Harvey Weinstein. It’s about ordinary Joes – and Michaels and Pauls – who perpetuate the existing structure by doing too little.
