The exchange announced Friday that it was looking into potentially adding cardano's ADA token, basic attention token, stellar, zcash and 0x to its platform, and each of the tokens immediately saw double-digit percent price spikes. The increases are even more interesting considering Coinbase noted that it ""cannot guarantee they will be listed for trading.""  Notably, the exchange also claimed that ""we are making this announcement internally at Coinbase and to the public at the same time to remain transparent with our customers about support for future assets,"" possibly in reference to past allegations of insider trading.

42381006,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93GnF,1531515646,Something Strange Is Going On at a Crypto Exchange Called WEX,"Users of WEX, the cryptocurrency exchange built on the ashes of BTC-e, are reporting withdrawal problems, raising new questions about an already mysterious trading platform.  ""‏Dear Wex, when withdraws will enable ??"" asked Twitter user Alireza Moosavi on Friday, joining a crowd of Wex customers complaining they couldn't withdraw funds for the second day in a row.  Ehsan Mahmoodi similarly inquired, ""Hello, why withdrawal is disabled?""  A third user, Hasan Gusseynov, asked the exchange, in Russian, ""When will everything be ok?""  The user complaints follow odd trading activity observed on the exchange. Earlier this week, CoinDesk reported that the price of bitcoin (against the U.S. dollar) shot up to nearly $9,000 on WEX, while it was still in the $6,000 range practically everywhere else.  Observers say the anomaly could have been due to a number of reasons, from recently-raised fiat withdrawal fees on the exchange to suspicions of insolvency. As of this writing, the USD price of bitcoin on WEX was $7,451, more than $1,200 higher than the price recorded on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Stepping back, WEX was launched last year in an apparent effort to resurrect BTC-e, a long-running bitcoin exchange that was targeted and eventually shut down by U.S. and Greek law enforcement officials. A Russian national named Alexander Vinnik was arrested and charged with laundering billions of dollars on BTC-e, and U.S. regulators hit the exchange with a $110 million fine.  Although WEX claimed to be unrelated to BTC-e, its website design and trading pairs were very similar and it was pitched as a service for former BTC-e customers.  Questions aside, posts on social media as well as WEX's chatbox indicate that the withdrawal problems remain ongoing as of press time, though a note on the exchange's official Twitter account claimed that user funds are secure.  The developments also follow a string of reports from Russian media outlets detailing the murky background of the exchange, as well as a reported legal effort filed by one of BTC-e's former users.  Unanswered questions  In a July 12 post on Facebook, Dmitrii Vasilev – who, according to Singapore records obtained by Russian news agency RBK, is listed as the owner of WEX's operator, World Exchange Services – attributed the price disparities to the actions of Dmitry Sutormin, who he described as a former WEX manager.  Vasilev explained that Sutormin, a vice president of the Russian Association for Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain and a venture investor in Russia, had been selling a high number of ""WEX codes,"" which could be redeemed on the exchange for cryptocurrency.  Sutormin ""carried out the purchase and sale of WEX codes in any volumes,"" Vasilev explained, ""which means that there are a lot of codes on the market ... now all those who bought those codes want to buy bitcoin, exchange rate goes up, as very few wish to sell.""  However, talking to CoinDesk via Facebook Messenger, Vasilev said he's not sure what Sutormin's role is now, because, as he admitted, at some point he lost control over the exchange. He would not go into additional specifics.  And when reached via Telegram, Sutormin said that he has no connection with WEX and has never worked there.  ""I bought and sold my own codes, I was, in fact, the exchange's client,"" he explained. When asked why he would sell his codes, he said he was ""affected by the hype around cryptocurrencies,"" adding that it's a popular business in Moscow.  RBK  recently dove into the topic during a long piece on WEX. RBK reporter Andrew Zakharov attempted to conduct such a deal, pretending that he wanted to buy a large amount of bitcoins through a meeting in Moscow and contacting Sutormin who, in turn, connected him to other people for the transfer of money.  Meanwhile, earlier this week, the Russian cryptocurrency website CoinRadio detailed a lawsuit filed by a former BTC-e customer named Pimporn Carty. The website also published a copy of the claims made against WEX.  Carty reportedly sued WEX over funds previously held on BTC-e prior to its collapse, arguing that once she was able to regain access, some of the funds went missing, including more than 11,000 litecoins. While a hearing on the issue was reportedly scheduled for July 12, and referenced in Vasilev's Facebook post, it's unclear whether the meeting took place or, if so, what the outcome was.  Who's in charge?  Indeed, statements from Vasilev suggest that it's not entirely clear who is in charge of WEX at the moment.  RBK also reported that Vasilev was planning to sell the exchange to Dmitry Khavchenko, a former volunteer fighter in the war in Ukraine and a participant of the militia forces in Crimea that supported the Russian annexation in 2014.  Khavchenko, in turn, told RBK that he was going to move WEX's office to Crimea and register the managing company in the war-torn region of Ukraine known as Donbass.  According to RBK's sources, Khavchenko and other people engaged in the conflict in Ukraine are already involved in the exchange's management, including people connected to Konstantine Malofeev, who has been cited in the press as one of the shadow sponsors of East Ukrainian militants.  WEX denied that the exchange is going to be sold on Twitter, and the exchange did not respond to questions regarding who is in charge or why, exactly, its prices shot up earlier this week.

42381013,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93GxJ,1531500952,Russians Indicted for US Election Hacks Used Bitcoin to Fund Operations,"A group of Russian military intelligence officers indicted Friday as part of an ongoing investigation into interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election allegedly used bitcoin to fund their operations.  In the just-released indictment, prosecutors assert that the 12 named intelligence officers hacked computer networks and email accounts owned and used by the U.S. Democratic Party, including the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  The details were included under a charge of conspiracy to launder money. According to the indictment, the defendants ""conspired to launder the equivalent of $95,000 through a web of transactions structured to capitalize on the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.""  ""In an effort to pay for their efforts around the world ... the defendants paid for it with cryptocurrency,"" deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said during a press briefing.  While the defendants allegedly used other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, ""they principally used bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains, and otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity.""  Payments are said to have been made to companies in the U.S., with some of those funds being traced to a bitcoin mining operation.  The indictment explains:  ""In addition to mining bitcoin, the Conspirators acquired bitcoin through a variety of means designed to obscure the origin of the funds. This included purchasing bitcoin through exchanges, moving funds through other digital currencies, and using pre-paid cards. They also enlisted the assistance of one or more third-party exchanges who facilitated layered transactions through digital currency exchange platforms providing heightened anonymity.""  The defendants allegedly used multiple ""dedicated email accounts"" to both track bitcoin transaction information and facilitate payments, the release added. Further, the indicted officials transferred bitcoin using the same computers that they used in hacking various email accounts  The indictment is the latest to come out of the ongoing – and politically explosive – investigation into Russian election meddling and the possible involvement of members of the presidential campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump.  Robert Mueller, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation director, was appointed in May 2017 to lead the special counsel investigation, which has drawn the ire of Trump, who has vehemently denied any collusion on election meddling.

42381008,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93GsH,1531497964,Major League Baseball Collectibles Are Coming to Ethereum,"Major League Baseball (MLB) is turning to blockchain to expand its fanbase.  MLB announced Friday that it has partnered with Lucid Sight, a blockchain startup based in Los Angeles, to launch a dApp game on ethereum late this summer to allow baseball fans to interact with their favorite moments during the games, Yahoo Finance reported.  The game, MLB Crypto Baseball, will work similarly to CryptoKitties, which had a direct influence on the baseball league's new game, according to MLB executive vice president of gaming and new business ventures Kenny Gersh.  ""We were already talking to Lucid Sight around the time that CryptoKitties first came out,"" Gersh said. ""And then CryptoKitties sort of validated it a little bit more.""  In order to play this game, users must purchase ether and transfer it to MetaMask, one of the most popular ethereum browser wallets. After that, they can trade digital avatars tied to specific moments in recent games while possibly earning rewards and stickers.  MLB has seen attendance at games drop this season and it hopes that this game can attract a broader audience.  Gersh explained:  ""That is 100 [percent] one of the strategic goals of this initiative. Collecting items related to your team, engaging with your team in a new way. For me, say the Red Sox win the division in a couple months, I want to buy something that symbolizes that. These will be event-based things—those moments in sports that happen that you want to remember and cherish, and have a sense that you were there, even if only digitally.""  Lucid Sight co-founder Octavio Herrera said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that they are hoping the game can eventually reaching out a broader range of users, not just the tech savvy people.  ""The game will roll out in stages. So yes, for version one you will need ether, you will need MetaMask, it will be a little bit difficult to get into. But I do think people will open up Coinbase accounts, buy some ether, and transfer it to MetaMask, in order to collect these things they'll enjoy so much,"" he said.  This is not the first time pro sports are experimenting crypto and blockchain technology.

According to a Fortune article published July 12, Cohen has invested in cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Autonomous Partners through his VC firm Cohen Private Ventures.  Autonomous Partners was founded last December by Arianna Simpson, a venture capitalist with a history in the bitcoin space, including a time at bitcoin wallet startup BitGo. Her crypto fund has already secured investments from big names including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Union Square Ventures and Craft Ventures.  While the size of the new investment was not revealed, it's not the first time Cohen Private Ventures has invested in Simpson's projects. In 2015, her venture fund, Crystal Towers Capital, also received an investment from the firm.  Simpson told Fortune that Autonomous Partners is currently concentrated on smaller, ""next generation"" cryptocurrencies, though it invests to some extent in major cryptos like bitcoin and ether.  She also suggested that among blockchain's many use cases, two were not in doubt:  ""It's still up in the air if people want to do a number of thing on the blockchain. We're still figuring out what needs one and what doesn't. But It's clear they want to trade, and they want to play games.""  Her primary concern in the nascent space appeared to be regulation – a reason she will not touch XRP in case the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules it a security.  ""I think the whole space is still waiting for a bit more clarity,"" she told the news source.  Cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds have rapidly grown in number over the last year as entrepreneurs have moved to satisfy the increasing demand from traditional investors.  According to data from Autonomous Next, of an estimated 251 crypto hedge funds with $3.5–5 billion in assets under management, 175 of them were established as recently as 2017.

42380993,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Bjz,1531490407,Chinese Tech Firm Probed Over Launch of Crypto-Mining Video Console,"Leshi Internet, a Chinese video streaming provider with a history of financial troubles, is being questioned by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange over its subsidiary's move into the crypto space.  Lerong Zhixin, a smart TV maker owned by Shenzhen-listed Leishi, announced a plan on Wednesday to partner with a blockchain startup to launch a video streaming console that can be used to mine cryptocurrency.  At a launch event this week, the subsidiary claimed that, since the new product integrates a distributed network, users will be rewarded with tokens by allowing their idle broadband to be shared with other users connected to the blockchain.  Following the announcement, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange – which is administrated by China's Securities Regulatory Commission – sent Leshi a formal enquiry on Friday, demanding details about the firm's blockchain resources and manpower, as well as its partner's technical capacity.  The exchange also challenged the firm over potential regulatory issues regarding the process of cryptocurrency mining in China.  Where the questions are leading, effectively, is to ascertain if Leshi indeed has the technology to deliver the promised product or it is taking advantage of blockchain hype to boost its stock price.  Since the initial announcement, Leshi's share price increased by as much as 5 percent over the last two days.  Although the gain may not be as notable as previous similar cases of firms seeing stock spikes after pivots to blockchain, the news comes at a time when Leshi is regaining its financial health after years of debt and financial troubles.  Launched in 2004 as a video streaming service, Leshi made a series of attempts to expand over the past few years in order to compete with international streaming giants like Netflix. It was later reported to be in financial deep water by media outlets in China and elsewhere, after which its share price declined from as high as $26 in 2015 to around $0.50 at the moment.  In September 2017, Leshi's founder and its holding company LeEco were put on a a credit blacklist by regulators in China, public data shows.

42381000,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93BqH,1531486821,US Judge Delays Crypto Fraud Ruling Pending CFTC Response,"A federal judge has postponed any decision on a crypto fraud case brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against alleged scammer Patrick McDonnell.  Judge Jack Weinstein of the Eastern District of New York wrote in a court order Thursday that the CFTC must file ""proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and [a] post-trial brief"" by July 27.  In particular, Weinstein wants the commission's lawyers to support how they calculated damages and civil monetary penalties. Once that is filed, McDonnell will have two weeks to respond. A hearing on the matter will occur on Aug. 23.  McDonnell is accused of defrauding investors of $457,393 through a crypto trading advisory service called Coin Drop Markets and the affiliated CabbageTech Corp, according to charges filed by the CFTC in January.  During the course of the hearing, multiple witnesses claimed that they had sent McDonnell thousands of dollars in both fiat and crypto, but did not see any promised returns.  The case has already resulted in one landmark ruling that cryptocurrencies are commodities, and therefore may fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. However, in his preliminary injunction, Weinstein raised questions about the agency's jurisdiction over the case, which the agency sought to answer during this week's hearing.  And, despite the charges, McDonnell's defense focused more on whether the CFTC has the jurisdiction to regulate his business than on refuting its arguments. Indeed, on Monday he argued that the statute being cited was not created for ""just straight fraud. It was created for fraud with market manipulation, specifically.""  He told CoinDesk that he did not want to be distracted by the charges, preferring to look at the jurisdictional question.  McDonnell explained:  ""I really haven't [focused on the charges] because their argument is irrelevant ... if I walked over and shot a guy in the head, we all know I murdered that guy, but in terms of how I'm being charged under statutory law ... Why sit there and get caught up in their fairy tale and their book of fiction?""  The ruling has already been cited in another case earlier this year, when lawyers for Maksim Zaslavskiy claimed that the U.S. government can't claim cryptocurrencies are commodities and securities at the same time. They pointed to Weinstein's ruling as evidence that a cryptocurrency is a commodity, not a security.  Zaslavisky is being sued for securities law violations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. His case will proceed to a jury trial early next year, when the court will decide whether or not his companies – RECoin and DRCW – were selling unregistered securities.

Since spinning off from venture capital giant AngelList last October, New York-based CoinList has been able to make a spot on its website a coveted place for serious projects, even in a crowded market for compliant coin offerings. So, on Monday, the wider world of token entrepreneurs and investors took notice when the company opened registration for its fifth sale.  The new entrant? TrustToken, a platform that aims to simplify trading real-world assets on a blockchain.  TrustToken hopes to be a one-stop shop for those who want to launch such efforts, supplying the means for them to do everything from creating a legal entity for the asset and interacting with the fiduciary agent responsible for it, to fulfilling regulatory requirements and interacting with the blockchain.  The trust token being sold then acts much like insurance does for traditional securitization. The smart contract will require that a certain amount of trust token be set aside for any given asset. Those doing so will take liability for the asset, guaranteeing it on behalf of its holders.  Finer points aside, though, the addition of TrustToken is notable in that it follows just four previous sales held on the site: sharing economy platform Origin; live-streaming mobile app Props; decentralized web protocol Blockstack; and the token for cloud storage, Filecoin (whose creator, Protocol Labs, collaborated with AngelList to launch CoinList).  So, even with the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S. remaining, TrustToken may be a sign that things are again starting to accelerate.  After a long lull following its Props sale in early 2018, TrustToken marks the second sale to go up in the space of a month.  ""CoinList Capital conducts a really thorough diligence process,"" CEO Andy Bromberg said, speaking to its latest project selection.  Further, he went on to highlight the team members' strong pedigrees, prior experience and the promise of its business model, telling CoinDesk:  ""The net of all that is we're excited to offer this opportunity.""  Trust token sale  So, while not the largest raise on the platform, TrustToken is seeking a big ask from investors in what's turning into a bear market year for cryptocurrencies broadly.  With the listing, TrustToken aims to raise another $61 million selling 435 million of its ethereum-based trust tokens. (The company has previously raised $20 million in backing from major investors, including BlockTower Capital, Danhua Capital and Andreessen Horowitz).  Registration for the sale (which will include know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks) will remain open through July 17 and then sale will begin on July 18. The team has not set an end date for the sale, but it won't raise more than its goal.  Still, it's important to note that money will be used by the team to prove out its model of asset tokenization, one where the token is used to decentralize a crypto method of underwriting. The more it raises, the more new tokens it can launch to prove out and refine the model.  Once it has refined its model for tokenizing assets at scale, it will open up its platform for institutions to tokenize their own assets, with the eventual goal of letting anyone create a token that represents their own property.  ""We start with asset tokenization, but we think it's really going to unlock human potential, and we think the last big thing to unlocking human potential is actually having democratized financial assets,"" TrustToken CEO Danny An told CoinDesk.  Tokens at stake  Right now, the company is best known for TrueUSD, a stablecoin based on the U.S. dollar that the company says can actually be redeemed for government-backed monies, but the sale itself is for the trust token, which makes this kind of offering possible.  Under this model, trust token would be necessary for the creation of assets like TrueUSD. Provided it raises enough funding, it plans to replicate TrueUSD with the euro and yen, as it further refines its model.  ""Whenever you're doing mini-IPOs of assets all across the world with different legalities and language, you kind of need a standard way of insuring that it's a trustworthy asset,"" An said.  For high-volume assets, like a stablecoin, stakers would be remunerated with transaction fees, while for lower-volume assets, such as real estate, stakers will be paid out of inflation in the tokens representing that asset.  As an example, if piece of land were represented by 100 TrueLand tokens, and the smart contract said that stakers would be paid 3 percent each year, three new tokens would be created annually and divided up among those guaranteeing the land for TrueLand holders.  With a stake in place, that signals for investors looking for opportunities that an asset has merit. ""Trust token is a way to essentially affirm where it's worth it or trustworthy to send money to,"" An explained.  Path ahead  Despite these big goals, though, An's team is proceeding cautiously and refining its model in house first.  Following the release of the stablecoins it creates, his team plans to create tokens for real gold and silver reserves. Because it is providing the liquidity for each of these products, An explained, each new token dramatically increases the company's workload, so it's cautious about overstating expectations.  In the next one or two years, it expects holders of trust tokens to be able to participate in staking, but it's unforeseeable how soon it will be able to open up its platform for other entities to create new asset-backed tokens.  For participants in the CoinList sale, the token itself should become available to buyers sometime between January 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.  ""We are essentially a securitization company, so we are waiting to be one of the last followers on SEC clarity on utility tokens,"" An said.  He added:  ""Our company interacts with basically every regulatory agency so we are very legally conservative.""

42381001,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Bu3,1531479599,Bitcoin Price Shows Green Again After $6K Defense,"Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp recovery from two-week lows hit yesterday has raised the odds of a stronger rally towards $6,400, technical studies indicate.  As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,245 on Bitfinex.  BTC was expected to drop below $6,000 in the last 24 hours as the bears were on the offensive following an inverted flag breakdown.  However, the intraday oversold conditions likely put a floor under bitcoin prices at the two-week low of $6,080, helping it chart a solid rebound to $6,283 (today's high).  While it is too early to call a bullish reversal, the change of fortune has saved the day for the BTC bulls. Moreover, the probability of BTC's price charting a picture-perfect inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern would have dropped sharply had BTC found acceptance below $6,000.  Hourly chart  The above chart shows BTC created a falling wedge pattern over the last four days, as represented by lower highs and lower lows. Prices crossed the wedge resistance yesterday with strength (backed by a pick-up in volume), signaling the pullback from Monday's high of $6,820 has ended.  The falling wedge breakout also validated the bear-to-bull trend change indicated by the bullish price-relative strength index divergence (higher low on the RSI).  So, BTC will likely find acceptance above the immediate resistance $6,270 (50-hour moving average) and rise towards the descending 100-hour MA, currently located at $6,404.  While the hourly chart has adopted a bullish bias, the daily chart is still biased to the bears, so the bulls are cautioned against being too ambitious.  Daily chart  The 5-day and 10-day MA are trending south, implying a bearish bias, while the relative strength index (RSI) is holding below 50.00, also indicating the bears are in control.  View  BTC could attack the $6,400 mark, but further gains are ruled out for now as the descending (bearish) 5-day MA and 10-day MA are located at $6,366 and $6,500, respectively.  That said, if BTC manages to close (as per UTC) today above 10-day MA, then the doors would open for a re-test of the Monday's high of $6,820.  Bearish scenario: A failure to produce a significant move higher despite the bullish price RSI divergence and the falling wedge breakout would shift risk in favor of a drop to a recent low of $5,755. The downside move will likely gather pace if BTC fails to hold above $6,080 (previous day's high) over the weekend.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42380997,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93BlF,1531474200,University Researchers Turn to Blockchain to Preserve Cultural Heritage,"A team from China's Tsinghua University has filed a patent application detailing a role for blockchain technology in protecting cultural heritage.  According to a patent filing submitted in April and revealed on Friday, three faculty members of the university have developed a concept for a system that can store and share digital versions of culturally important objects using a blockchain.  The three inventors – including Tan Jiajia, a postdoctoral researcher and Lu Xiaobu, the head of the university's Academy of Art and Design – explain in the document that the system primarily consists of two parts.  The first involves a 3D computing model that can scan a culturally important object in order to provide it with a form in the digital realm. In the second stage, the system automatically stores each object's data on a private blockchain via a cryptographic process called hashing.  By including other cultural heritage holders (such as museums) as participating nodes, they say the blockchain platform could eventually grow into a consortium in which each party will obtain a shared ledger of cultural heritage data and be able to update it with their own archive.  On top of that, the patent filing adds, the system will produce a hash for the full ledger on the private blockchain whenever it gets updated, which would be further transacted to a public blockchain for enhanced visibility.  The team writes in the patent:  ""Based on the unique design of blockchain for exchanging information, the digital identify of each cultural heritage can be transferred among different parties at lower costs with higher efficiency, so that we can enlarge their economic and social values.""  While the document does not disclose exact details on how the private blockchain would be developed, the inventors indicate that their early stage exploration had been based on Tencent's Trust blockchain platform – a product the internet giant announced in April of last year.

42380992,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Bdh,1531468851,Robinhood's Plan to Win the Crypto Exchange War? Kill Trading Fees,"As a new entrant into the cryptocurrency field, Vlad Tenev, co-CEO of online investment brokerage Robinhood, is following a time-honored business strategy: Undercut the competition.  Except he's taking it to an extreme.  Launched early this year, Robinhood Crypto is differentiating itself with zero-fee transactions, with the ultimate goal of doing away with the concept of trading fees in the market altogether.  Framing this effort as a force for good in line with his company's namesake folk hero, Tenev told CoinDesk he wanted to prevent consumers looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, especially young millennials, from getting ""ripped off with 4 to 5 percent transaction fees"" on ""sketchy foreign exchanges.""  And while offering zero-cost trades to consumers may give Robinhood an edge right now, in his mind, it's only a matter of time before this becomes commonplace.  ""Some people just are comfortable with the old ways but that's becoming less and less over time. I think with transaction fee-based trading you'll have the same story,"" he said, adding:  ""Over the next couple of years, the vast majority of people that are interested in these services will begin to understand that you're not getting much from paying those fees.""  The fee-free business model has already served Robinhood well in its flagship business, Robinhood Financial. Founded in 2013, the company originally dealt in traditional investment products such as stocks and options, competing with discount brokerages like E-Trade and Charles Schwab.  From the outset, and continuing to this day, Robinhood offered these services on a no-commission basis.  Instead, the company primarily makes its profits through collecting interest on cash and securities held in customers' accounts, as well as through optional premium account memberships such as Robinhood Gold. It currently services over 5 million consumers and has contributed mightily to a pricing war among brokerages that has reportedly driven incumbents' fees down nearly 40 percent.  In crypto, however, it's unclear how Robinhood intends to make money over the long term.  For now, the company is treating this activity as a way to get consumers to open accounts that will hopefully benefit its core business. ""The primary goal of the crypto business is to just get people into the overall ecosystem so we're intending to break even on that business for the foreseeable future,"" Tenev said at a recent conference in New York.  In that regard, the early results were promising, he said: ""We had over 1 million people joining the waitlist in the first couple of days.""  Lay of the land  While Robinhood's no-fee model may make it an appealing alternative for many retail crypto investors, the competition is formidable, even in the very limited field of user-friendly onramps for consumers bewildered by most crypto exchanges.  When asked by CoinDesk who he considers his main competitors in the crypto-trading space to be, Tenev said it would be ""any consumer-oriented company that allows people to trade cryptos or even just buy cryptos,"" specifically naming Coinbase as one of the ""legacy guys.""  On the one hand, Coinbase charges anywhere between 1.5 percent to 4 percent, depending on the user's payment method, location and other factors, plus a spread on the exchange rate. So, it might be vulnerable to a cut-rate rival such as Robinhood.  However, until recently Robinhood only allowed trading in the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, bitcoin and ethereum – though it just added litecoin and bitcoin cash – and it operates in just 17 U.S. states. Coinbase, on the other hand, offers a similar variety of choice (four cryptos, with a fifth in the works) and operates in nearly all 50 states and internationally with 20 million users, four times Robinhood's total user base.  The other competitor Tenev mentioned, Square's Cash App, only offers bitcoin purchases, but it does so in 47 states. Square does not charge a fee for this service, though it takes a spread on the exchange rate depending on the transaction size and market volatility. All told, Square Cash has 7 million users, who primarily use the app to send each other dollars.  Aside from costs, however, Robinhood also touts its ability to do all one's trading – stocks, options, ETFs and now crypto – in one place, and its capacity to handle large order volumes, a notorious shortcoming in the crypto exchange space where multi-day outages are not unheard of.  ""We were able to sustain the customer orders,"" Tenev explained during the CBInsights conference speaking to the period in late January when several exchanges were down for days at a time.  Looking ahead  Moreover, Tenev said Robinhood is just getting started in crypto. Despite its current role as a sort of marketing funnel for his company's flagship brokerage, he has a grander vision for the young crypto business.  ""This is a product that could also stand on its own and is valuable independent of the broader Robinhood ecosystem,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We're passionate about cryptocurrency and we want to be stewards of the market and we're going to keep investing in it. We're going to be hiring lots and lots of people, building out the crypto team… So we're investing in it for the long haul.""  Indeed, in a funding round last month, Robinhood raised $363 million to expand its cryptocurrency trading services beyond the states it currently services, in order to slowly but surely become ""the largest or one of the largest crypto platforms out there,"" as the other co-CEO, Baiju Bhatt, put it in an interview with Fortune.  Robinhood Markets, the parent company to Robinhood Crypto, has other big ambitions as well; it has been reported to be in talks with regulators about advancing into the banking space.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Tenev also hinted at someday allowing initial coin offering (ICO) token trading on Robinhood, explaining there was ""nothing in principle"" that he would oppose about it and that in this event, ICO tokens would be treated ""like any other tokens on our platform.""  In the long run, Tenev said that when no-fee trading becomes the norm, both in crypto and in traditional investing, Robinhood will ""have to figure out how to stay relevant and innovative as the market leader.""  Of course, that's a bit of a humblebrag, considering that Robinhood is still a relatively new player, both to stock brokerage and especially crypto. Tenev's essentially predicting he'll become the kind of dominant incumbent his company now challenges, then ""conceding"" that position will be hard to defend.  He concluded:  ""The competitors are going to be different five years from now, I pretty much guarantee it...Five years from now, it'll be us versus the startups.""

42380998,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Bp1,1531462556,OKCoin Exchange Launches in US Offering Fiat-to-Crypto Trading,"Cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin has launched a branch in the U.S. market offering trading services between U.S. dollars and several major cryptocurrencies.  According to OKCoin's website on Friday, the exchange has already launched the new offering and is now accepting U.S. dollars deposits and withdrawals, as well as trading against bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ethereum and ethereum classic.  For the new offshoot, the company filed a money service business (MSB) registration with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in November 2017. The document shows that the legal entity behind the exchange is called OKCoin USA Inc. and is based in Mountain View, California.  However, OKCoin states on its website that the fiat-to-crypto trading service is currently limited to investors in California – a limitation indicated in the initial MSB filing.  The news follows a report weeks ago revealing a similar move by Huobi, which launched a purely crypto-to-crypto trading service this month for all 50 states in the U.S. through a partner entity dubbed HBUS.  Earlier this year, HBUS also filed an MSB registration with FinCEN. However, Li Lin, co-founder and chief executive of Huobi, noted at the time that registering with FinCEN does not resolve all of the possible regulatory issues that come with operating within the U.S.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, both OKCoin and Huobi were once two of the three major crypto exchanges in China before the notable trading ban issued by the People's Bank of China in September 2017.  Following the regulatory clampdown, the exchanges shifted their businesses overseas with a focus largely on crypto-to-crypto trading.  See OKCoin's MSB registration below:  OKCoin US Inc.

42381003,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93BrX,1531454435,Why Litecoin's Creator Is Buying Into a Bank (And How It Could Go Wrong),"One of the most unusual and potentially transformative deals in the cryptocurrency space started as an argument on social media.  Back in April, Charlie Lee, the creator of litecoin, was exchanging barbs on Twitter with Derek Capo, the CEO of payment processor TokenPay. But their fight quickly turned into a friendly exchange of direct messages, in which the two crypto enthusiasts realized they shared a common problem: In a word, banking.  Both the Litecoin Foundation, the non-profit that promotes the sixth-largest cryptocurrency and where Lee is a managing director, and Capo's Virgin Islands-based startup had encountered difficulty securing bank accounts – a longstanding problem for the industry.  ""We had lots of trouble"" on that front, Lee told CoinDesk.  Capo elaborated: ""Some banks, they close down bank accounts if they get a whiff of anything to do with crypto. We saw a lot of competitors with similar offerings get cut off because they didn't own the bank and they didn't have control.""  But Capo was working on a solution for TokenPay by trying to buy a bank. And he realized this plan, if successful, could address another problem for Lee.  ""Why don't we talk about having a litecoin debit card so that you'll have a real solution?"" Capo recalled telling him. ""Because, you know, they had been trying very hard to have a litecoin debit card... I said, why don't we talk?""  That is how the Singapore-based Litecoin Foundation ended up owning 9.9 percent of WEG Bank AG, an until-now obscure German financial institution, in a surprise transaction revealed this week.  But the foundation didn't put money in; TokenPay previously acquired the stake and traded it to the non-profit in exchange for future technical support. TokenPay also acquired another 9.9 percent (the maximum allowed in Germany without prior regulatory approval) of WEG and is seeking the green light to buy up to 80 percent. (The price was not disclosed.)  If all goes according to plan, not only will TokenPay and the Litecoin Foundation have a reliable banking partner, they would also transform WEG into an on-ramp for consumers worldwide who want to trade fiat for cryptocurrency or pay for goods and services with crypto.  But owning a bank, by itself, won't necessarily solve crypto's banking problem, according to compliance experts who've worked in both fields. Even if the regulators bless the pending takeover, Capo and Lee may face new challenges operating in a heavily regulated industry where ""coin"" is frequently treated as a four-letter word.  The roadmap  Undaunted by regulatory hurdles, Capo and Lee have ambitious plans to usher in a new wave of crypto banking services.  Stepping back, while transacting in cryptocurrency may be frictionless, converting from dollars or euros to crypto and back is anything but. Buying crypto through an online exchange can mean registering a credit card with an exchange platform, then waiting days, sometimes longer, to complete the transaction.  Meanwhile, most of the merchants that accept crypto are wary of the price volatility and generally rely on a payment processor like BitPay to convert it to fiat. All these options incur processing fees along the way.  That's why Capo wants to offer crypto debit cards and the ability to convert litecoin to euros directly through a traditional bank account, to make it a smoother experience for crypto users transacting in a fiat-dominated economy. He hopes to offer such services within nine months of receiving regulatory approval for the acquisition.  ""Connecting cryptocurrency to fiat rails is very useful,"" said Lee, who told CoinDesk he aims to join the WEG board as the Litecoin Foundation's representative (a move that would make him possibly the first person to simultaneously hold the titles of ""cryptocurrency founder"" and ""bank director"").  ""We will have a say in influencing the bank to work on crypto projects,"" he said.  Eventually, after tackling debit cards and payment processing, Capo and Lee plan to integrate banking services directly with TokenPay's decentralized exchange (DEX) platform, eFin, which offers peer-to-peer trading between cryptocurrencies.  If traders pass all the know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) demands for a crypto bank account, they will be able to seamlessly cash out TokenPay's own token, known as tpay, from the exchange as fiat, plus buy or sell cryptos like litecoin without delay.  ""eFin will have LTC. We will help them with it technically,"" Lee said. ""And they will also airdrop [eFin] tokens to litecoin users.""  In addition to the promise of technical expertise and litecoin's relatively stable popularity among cryptocurrency fans, Capo said he gave the nonprofit equity in the bank based on Lee's massive online following, a marketing boon, and professional connections.  ""Litecoin has a very influential leader, someone who's been around for a very long time,"" Capo said in describing Lee, an alumnus of the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.  Challenges ahead  Yet even if they obtain a banking license, Capo and Lee are not guaranteed unlimited liquidity.  Located in the town of Ottobrunn (population: 21,378), WEG was previously a property management bank that offered loans to housing associations. After TokenPay acquires a majority stake, the plan calls for the bank's CEO, Matthias von Hauff, to stay involved as WEG transitions to a retail bank with more consumer-facing products and services.  But such a tiny institution likely would likely rely on outside organizations – larger global banks, the German central bank, or SWIFT – to be able to move large amounts of fiat around the world, according to Simon Taylor, a former Barclays banker and co-founder and director of the U.K. fintech advisory firm 11:FS. If those partners became squeamish about crypto in general, they could cut off WEG's access to fiat, Taylor cautioned.  ""The really, really big banks tend to be the ones that connect you through the global corridor to the U.S. dollar, they're the ones that get the big KYC fines,"" Taylor said, adding, with regard to the WEG acquisition plan:  ""I don't think it's going to achieve what they want it to achieve. I get the temptation to buy a bank. But buying a bank doesn't give you what you think it gives you.""  Joe Ciccolo, president of the compliance service provider BitAML Inc., said regulators would probably expect extra diligence on WEG's part if it were to become a crypto-focused bank.  ""On its own, running a bank and implementing AML anti-money laundering] across a broad range of products and services is difficult to begin with,"" Ciccolo said. ""This is going to be a much higher barrier to entry than one would associate with traditional AML.""  The idea of integrating a decentralized exchange into a bank gave Ciccolo the most pause. He described DEXs as ""nails on a chalkboard for regulators,"" who have taken years to wrap their heads around bitcoin. If Capo and Lee plan to pull this off, Ciccolo said, it will require significant investment in educating regulators on an ongoing basis and constant communication with larger banks.  Acknowledging the challenges, Capo said the first and most costly step of converting WEG into a crypto-savvy bank will be restructuring all of its KYC and AML processes to create a new crypto-centric model.  ""We're being conservative because we want to build this bank so it will be around for a long time,"" he told CoinDesk, concluding:  ""The infrastructure is there, we just might have to potentially modify it for crypto-based services.""

42381002,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Bsn,1531450809,Bitcoin Price Defends $6K As Upside Potential Builds,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be up slightly at the start of Friday's session, but it remains to be seen if it can build traction above $6,000.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now down 37 percent from its May 5th high at $9,996 according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, though it's rebounded to a crucial support zone at $6,235, according to Bitfinex data.  The figure is notable, as it could be argued bitcoin needs a daily close above the previous low at $6,070 to abort bearish outlook for the coming week. This would provide greater confidence to the market as a whole, and could possibly spark another minor bullish revival seen over the last eight days.  And so far in today's session, it appears a bullish reversal pattern might be playing out.  The inverse head and shoulders pattern as reported by CoinDesk yesterday continues to remain in play as the bears were unable to push the right shoulder below the neckline located at $6,064, adding to the strong possibility of a head-and-shoulders reversal.  Daily chart  Provided the H&S pattern stands, the Fibonacci Retracement tool (taken from previous high on May 5 to July 12 bottom of the current bullish reversal candle) shows significant resistance awaits at $6,400, $6900, $7,021 and $8,046.  The 55 exponential moving average (red line) also remains well above the current price, which suggests the troubled crypto remains bearish in the long term until prices start to crash through the crucial $7,000 resistance zone.  Further, the channel between $6,070 and $7,012 remains an incredible uphill battle for the world's most infamous digital cryptocurrency.  Relative Strength Index (RSI)  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily so far offers some solace to back the current H&S reversal which is currently bouncing from the 41.8 point line, previously seen as resistance.  If it holds above and remains within the channel (between 41 and 53) another attempt to push toward previous resistances at $6,472 could be possible.  View  Bitcoin risked falling below the current inverse H&S neckline around $6,073 but has since recovered slightly to keep the pattern in play.  RSI has yet to dip significantly - adding room for further upward momentum  Acceptance below $6,000 would invalidate bullish technical setup.  Bulls would like acceptance above $6,400 to abort short-term bearish perspective.  Disclosure: The author holds USDT at the time of writing.
