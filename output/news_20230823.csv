16455330,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548583,1692831654,Which Top Meme Coins Have Held Their Value Best Amid The Crypto Market Crash?,"The performance of the top meme coins in the space has mostly mirrored the broader market crash triggered by Bitcoin’s decline toward the $25,000 level. However, while all of these digital assets have suffered losses during this time, some have held up better than others, leading to fewer losses on their part compared to their competitors. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) Leads Meme Coins This meme coin has surprisingly seen the best performance following the crash compared to its counterparts. While most top meme tokens have recorded double-digit losses, Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) managed to keep below the 10% loss level, coming in with only single-digit losses. Related Reading: SHIB Burn Rate Jump 1,100% Amid Expectations Of Shibarium Relaunch As data from the coin tracking website Coinmarketcap shows, BABYDOGE’s price decline over the last weeks came in 5.97%. This is in stark contrast to others that have come in above 10%, making BABYDOGE the meme token that has held its value best through the crash. Dogelon Mars (ELON) Performs Well Dogelon Mars (ELON) is another meme coin that has put up a tremendous fight against the bears in the last week. Just like BABYDOGE, the token came in with 10% losses in the last week, although by a much narrower margin. The meme token is down 7.85% on the weekly chart, showing impressive resistance. And unlike BABYDOGE which is up 0.63% in the last day, Dogelon Mars (ELON) is seeing losses of 3.35% during this time period, putting it on par with other meme tokens struggling on Wednesday. DOGE price sitting at $0.0629 | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com Dogecoin (DOGE) Holding Firm While Dogecoin saw significant losses following the crypto crash last week, the leading meme coin has held its own, with its losses currently falling below 10%. DOGE’s losses on the weekly chart came out to 9.76%, ranking it third when it comes to meme tokens that have held their value. Following in the same step as BABYDOGE, Dogecoin is starting to see gains on the daily chart. The cryptocurrency is seeing small gains of 0.61% at the time of this writing. Nevertheless, with a market cap of $8.9 billion, it remains the largest meme coin in the industry. How Other Meme Coins Are Doing The three meme coins listed above are the only meme tokens that have seen losses below 10%. Others such as Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), FLOKI (FLOKI), and Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) have all performed way worse with losses of 15.71%, 16.23%, 19.12%, and 21.18%, respectively. Related Reading: AVAX Price Bucks Under The Pressure Of Upcoming $102 Million Token Unlock However, some of these tokens are beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel.

42409844,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPylO,1692825850,"Bitcoin Climbs 3% to $26.6K; SOL, NEAR, ADA Lead Crypto Market Gains","Bitcoin (BTC) climbed more than 3% to above $26,600 Wednesday afternoon, its highest price this week as crypto markets pared some of the losses booked in last Thursday’s tumble.  Ether (ETH) advanced 3.5%, inching closer to the $1,700 level.  The gains for both were roughly in line with the CoinDesk Market Index’s (CMI) 3% rise.  Layer 1 blockchain Solana’s SOL jumped nearly 7% during the day as webshop platform Shopify integrated Solana Pay, allowing USDC stablecoin payments for customers.  NEAR, native token of the Near Protocol, added more than 6% after crypto lender Nexo integrated the network into its platform.  Among larger alternative cryptocurrencies – so-called altcoins – Cardano’s ADA, Polkadot’s DOT, and Binance’s BNB each gained 3%-5% during the day.  The gains in crypto mirrored a big move higher in traditional markets, with both the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 surging more than 1% alongside a 13.5 basis point decline in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to 4.19%.  Following the market close, chipmaker giant Nvidia reported sizable earnings and guidance beats, sending its shares higher by 7% and boosting AI-related tokens like Fetch.AI’s FET which rose 9.5%, while AGIX and Render’s RNDR each gained about 5%.  What’s next for BTC price?  Despite today’s market-wide gains, most digital assets trade significantly lower than a week ago following a double-digit percentage pullback on Thursday, which sent bitcoin at one point plunging below $25,000.  The downtrend for digital assets may continue for weeks, said John Glover, chief investment officer at crypto lender Ledn and former managing director at Barclays.  “Both the technical and fundamental outlook for risk assets, including BTC and ETH, are pointing to softer prices in the next weeks,” Glover noted in an email. “When the techs and the fundamentals align, the market prices tend to follow.”  The lack of liquidity and participation on the market currently does not support higher prices, Don Kaufman, co-founder of TheoTrade, pointed out in an interview with CoinDesk TV.  “Liquidity has become a critical concern. I do not believe bitcoin can sustain higher prices without more active market participation,” Kaufman said. “We have seen evidence of fast, unrelenting moves in recent trading sessions, much of which can be traced back to lack of market participation.”  However, crypto investment firm Pantera Capital differs, forecasting that bitcoin likely won’t stay at these depressed price levels for much longer.  “Bitcoin recently experienced the longest period of negative year-over-year returns in its history, lasting 15 months,” Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera, posted on X (formerly Twitter). “Our view is that we’ve seen enough – there’s just so long markets can be down.”",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC | SOL | NEAR,ADA | BTC | MARKET | SOL | NEAR,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/23/bitcoin-climbs-3-to-266k-sol-near-ada-lead-crypto-market-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19018eb549ac96bf7414eedb18d27a75d68e56bc-2630x1494.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16451346,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548601,1692824418,"Whale Moves 2,910 Bitcoin (BTC) To Exchange Amid FBI Warnings, A Bearish Signal?","Substantial Bitcoin (BTC) transfers have been reported again, often setting the stage for market speculation. Over the past 24 hours, there have been two significant BTC transactions. This transaction has sparked debate within the crypto community, especially since it comes shortly after the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) warned crypto firms that funds associated with North Korean hacker organizations, Lazarus Group and APT38, are on the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Teetering On The Edge: Here’s Why BTC Could Plunge Below $26,000 A Potential Bitcoin Sell-Off On The Horizon? Earlier today, Whale Alert’s notifications drew attention to a roughly 4,800 BTC (approximately $124.95 million) transfer between two undisclosed wallets. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 4,800 #BTC (124,954,585 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/Zz4W6H9Z5d — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 23, 2023 Within two hours, another post from the platform reported the movement of 2,910 BTC, valued at close to $76 million. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 2,910 #BTC (75,810,489 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/Jlw4lUhGnq — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 23, 2023 What caught the eyes of many was that this large sum was directed to Coinbase, one of the leading US cryptocurrency exchange platforms. It is worth noting that, historically, such transfers to exchanges have occasionally heralded selloffs, thereby causing speculations about a potential dip in Bitcoin’s value. BTC, North Korean Affiliations, And The FBI Warning While significant Bitcoin movements aren’t uncommon, the timing of these transfers has coincided with a pressing alert from the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), as mentioned above. The agency has warned crypto platforms of movements associated with the North Korean hacker groups, Lazarus Group and APT38. The Bureau also conveyed concerns that North Korea might try to liquidate Bitcoin. The funds allegedly totaling nearly $40 million, linked to these cybercriminal factions, have been shifted in the past day alone. The alert underscored the importance for private sector entities to vigilantly examine the blockchain data connected with these addresses. The statement noted: Private sector entities should examine the blockchain data associated with these addresses and be vigilant in guarding against transactions directly with, or derived from, the addresses. However, it’s important to note that so far, there has been no clarification that a direct connection has been established between the Bitcoin transactions reported by Whale Alert and the North Korean hacker-linked BTC movements. Yet, the coincidental timing of these significant transfers cannot be ignored. Should both sets of movements be inclined towards selling, Bitcoin’s price could experience a notable impact that could potentially result in the asset’s further decline.

Nvidia reported Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion versus consensus estimates of $11.19 billion, according to FactSet data. The company's Q2 earnings per share was $2.70 beating estimates of $2.08. The chipmaker also said it expects third quarter revenue to be about $16 billion (plus or minus 2%) versus estimates of just $12.59 billion.  ""Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,"" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia in a press release. ""The race is on to adopt generative AI,"" he added.  Tokens such as FET, GRT, INJ, RNDR and AGIX all were up more than 4% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the CoinDesk Market Index's (CMI) 3% advance.  Today's result follows Nvidia's blowout first quarter results from last May which revealed an extremely bullish outlook for revenue tied to AI. This sentiment, coupled with increasingly AI mainstream reach with the likes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, spilled over onto AI-related cryptocurrencies, sending them soaring, even though they've fallen back over the summer along with the rest of the market.  Nvidia's shares rose more than 7% in U.S. after-hours trading after gaining about 3% during the regular session. The stock is higher by more than 200% this year, according to TradingView data.

With the integration, users will be able to connect Solana-centric crypto wallets, like Phantom, and settle payments on-chain with merchants using USDC.  While USDC, one of the most popular dollar-linked stablecoins, is the first payment option to be enabled via the integration, other crypto assets will follow in the future, a representative of the Solana Foundation told CoinDesk.  ""When thinking about this integration, we chose a stablecoin because merchants and consumers ""think in dollars,” Josh Fried, head of commerce business development at the Solana Foundation told CoinDesk. ”It creates a much simpler entry point when pricing is in a currency consumers and merchants naturally understand.”  When paying with USDC, transactions will be settled almost instantly as opposed to most credit card payments which can take several days to clear, Fried said.  Solana Pay went live in early 2022 to help merchants accept crypto payments, with Checkout.com, Circle and Citcon supporting the protocol.

The increasing cost was a point of contention at a bankruptcy hearing on Wednesday, with the creditors’ committee decrying the current rate of spending.  “They've now moved to a pace of almost $50 million a month in fees, with literally hundreds of lawyers, financial advisors and bankers working on them practically full time,” said Kris Hansen, a lawyer from Paul Hastings representing the creditors’ committee. “Every dollar spent in the case is essentially a dollar that creditors don't receive.”  A report filed two months ago by a fee examiner who worked for another law firm that looked at the charges in the first seven months of the case – totaling $200 million – noted the fees were “remarkable,” but it also praised the professionals digging through the “smoldering heap of wreckage” to recover creditors’ money.  The staggeringly complex bankruptcy is also complicated by the necessary side negotiations with other collapsed crypto giants, such as the recent deal with Genesis that FTX’s Alameda Research could claim $175 million in that company’s bankruptcy. And the books at FTX were notoriously problematic from the start, with FTX’s Chief Executive Officer John J. Ray III – the person in charge of the wind-down – having said the records were riddled with lies and obfuscation from the previous FTX management.  The representatives of the bankrupt exchange insist they’ve worked “tirelessly” and that the process remains on track.  But Hansen – who argued the process to potentially reignite an FTX 2.0 is dragging and overly secretive – also said the debtors’ group hasn’t made enough of an effort to maximize returns on the company’s cash and crypto assets while the case goes on.  “Every day counts,” he said.

One of the largest marketplaces in the world, the cooperation will enable millions of businesses and customers to use digital assets for their purchases. Related Reading: Solana In Turbulence: Analyzing The Death Cross And What Lies Ahead Solana Enters The Mainstream With Shopify Cooperation? Speaking with the media outlet, Josh Fried from the Solana Foundation highlighted that the Pay supported by stablecoin USDC is the first to integrate with the marketplace. This digital asset was chosen due to its low volatility and familiarity with the US dollar. However, in the future, other cryptocurrencies could become a part of the integration, including the native currency of the Solana ecosystem SOL. As Techcrunch noted, Shopify is one of the prominent marketplaces with $444 billion worth of global economic activity or 10% of the total US e-commerce. Thus, the Solana ecosystem will have the capacity to reach millions of users looking for alternative payment options when shopping online. Fried stated the following regarding the new integration: Some people argue the killer app for crypto hasn’t arrived, but it has: it’s payments. (Everyone) should be doubling down on this. The Solana Foundation member also highlighted the benefits for merchants who decided to adopt the new features on Shopify. Legacy payment rails cost merchants between 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction, compared to SOL’s $0.00025, which is “practically fee-free.” In addition to these benefits, Fried believes the new integration can help businesses launch loyalty programs and other services by leveraging SOL’s ecosystem. The report clarified that crypto bands, including Mad Labs, Helius, MonkeDAO, and others, have already adopted the integration. Fried called Solana Pay the ideal feature for payments for the reasons stated above and added: You need speed at the point of sale for merchant payments. No one wants to sit on a website to wait for wallet transactions. Similarly in a point of sale in a store, can you imagine waiting three minutes for your payment to go through? No one wants to do that. Shopify, eBay, and even e-commerce giant Amazon are warming up to crypto in some capacity. Shopify and its CEO, Tobias Lütke, have been taking steps to integrate with the nascent industry. In January, Lütke joined crypto exchange Coinbase and its board of directors.

42409847,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPyvJ,1692820384,The Protocol: Coinbase Blockchain's Viral Use Case Puts Focus on Optimism's Tech,"A lot of the buzz in blockchain tech circles this year has been over the push toward secondary ""layer-2"" networks atop Ethereum being built on ""zero-knowledge"" cryptography, or ZK – seen by many experts as superior to the ""optimistic rollups"" that currently dominate. So the question is why the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz are choosing OP Stack, modeled after Optimism's optimistic rollup, to build their new networks. Margaux Nijkerk dives into the question in this week's feature.  We're also covering:  How the arrival of a viral crypto-fueled social marketplace called Friend.tech has quickly energized Coinbase's new Base blockchain.  Binance faces deadline on euro withdrawals.  Shiba Inu community's ""Shibarium"" blockchain aims for restart after troubled debut.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  PRICE OF POPULARITY: Coinbase, the big U.S. crypto exchange, is getting a fast education, as one of the first big publicly traded companies to run its own blockchain. Its new Base project, a layer-2 network atop Ethereum, just launched this month, and already one of its new applications, Friend.tech, has gone viral, quickly attracting more than 100,000 users and generating more than $25 million in fees. Friend.tech, which allows users to purchase shares of X (Twitter) influencers, saw a rapid spike in activity (see chart above) after announcing on Aug. 18 that it had scored seed funding earlier this year from the crypto-focused venture-capital firm Paradigm. Friend.tech’s early success has helped drive up key metrics on the Base network, driving its total value locked (TVL) past $200 million and at one point pushing transactions per second above those of Ethereum as well as rival layer-2 projects Arbitrum and Optimism. According to FundStrat, Base has accrued nearly $4 million in fees, $2.5 million of which is retained by Coinbase; it works out to $30 million extra revenue on an annual basis. One question is whether Base can retain the growth once this hot ball of money bounces to the next crypto craze. “Friend.Tech’s speculative nature,” writes Galaxy Research, “highlights ongoing questions over Coinbase's role in moderating a chain that today is ‘decentralized’ in name only.”  TAKING PROFITS? Blockchain data shows that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin withdrew 1,000 ether (ETH) (worth $1.67 million) from the DeFi lender Maker and then deposited 600 ETH ($1 million) on Coinbase, the crypto exchange, according to the X account @Lookonchain. It’s not clear why Buterin transferred the ether, but typically such moves are seen by analysts as a precursor to a sale. The price of ETH is up 39% year-to-date, after a recent market slide. According to CryptoSlate, “the wallet known as “vitalik.eth” was created seven years ago and contained 3,993 ETH (worth $6.5 million) as of press time.”  BINANCE BLUES. The world’s largest crypto exchangesowed confusion after mistakenly announcing on social media that euro transactions were no longer available. Its banking partner in Europe, Paysafe Payment Solutions, subsequently cleared up that withdrawals and deposits would still be available until Sept. 25. But Binance has not provided a timeframe for what happens after that. The exchange faces investigations and regulatory suits in several jurisdictions, including France and the U.S. Separately, Binance.US struck a deal with the payment startup MoonPay to restore customers’ ability to deposit dollars, suspended in June after the company lost ties with various banking partners.  ALSO:  Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov were arrested and charged with money laundering and sanctions violations tied to their work with the privacy mixer, which allegedly ""facilitated more than $1 billion in money laundering"" for North Korea's Lazarus Group.  An El Savadoran entrepreneur hasinvented a $1,200 Lightning Network-enabled ATM that reduces costs of fiat-to-bitcoin conversions compared with other Bitcoin on-ramps.  Bitcoin’s hashrate keeps hitting all-time highs.  Deposits or ""total value locked"" in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are now at their lowest level since February 2021.  Curve crisis shows pitfalls of decentralized risk management.  Will Sam Bankman-Fried's ""blame the lawyers"" strategy work?Protocol Village  Protocol Village  Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.  Starkware, Israeli company behind Ethereum layer 2 blockchain StarkNet, said in a press release that they would be open-sourcing their cryptographic software tool, STARK Prover, which has been renamed Stone, on Aug. 31.  Shibarium, new layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum for Shiba Inu community and its SHIB coin, plans to reopen the network after its much-hyped launch was marred by network issues and a faulty bridge.  Maple Finance, a crypto credit marketplace, is returning to Solana after suspending all lending pools in January following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.  WhiteBIT, a Ukrainian crypto exchange, announced the launch of WB Network, an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.Money Center  Money Center  Deals and grants  Coinbase agreed to acquire a minority stake in Circle Internet Financial, which will bring issuance and governance of the popular USDC stablecoin fully in-house. Previously, the stablecoin was issued by a consortium of the two companies, called Centre, which will now be dissolved.  Stellar Development Foundation has joined Bytecode Alliance, a nonprofit focused on advancing WebAssembly (Wasm), a “software format from Web2 that functions well with multiple coding languages,” characterized as an “alternative to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for smart contracts,” according to a statement from the team.  Data and tokens  Near Protocol’s native token NEAR jumped in price after an announcement that the network was integrated into the crypto exchange Nexo.  Balancer, one of Ethereum’s top decentralized crypto trading projects, saw its total value locked (TVL) – the amount of deposits on the protocol – fall by $100 million, after disclosing the existence of a critical vulnerability and urging some customers to withdraw their tokens. On Wednesday, the project posted on X that “over 97% of liquidity initially deemed vulnerable is now SAFE,” but $5.6 million “remains at risk.”  Terra, the layer 1 blockchain at the center of 2022’s crypto downturn following the collapse of its native algorithmic stablecoin, LUNA, said its website was compromised over the weekend by hackers attempting phishing attacks on visitors.  BNB chain exploiter liquidated for $30M on Venus Protocol.  Exactly (DeFi lender on Optimism) hit by $12M bridge exploit.  Solana claws back in DeFi  Solana – one of the hardest hit blockchain projects in 2022 partly due to its reputation as one of the ""Sam coins"" with ties to Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading firm, not to mention the revelation by CoinDesk that much of the activity in the ecosystem was faked – might have regained some of its footing. According to a recent report from the analysis firm Delphi Digital, Solana’s “developer ecosystem has consolidated but remained resilient, and the core protocol has shipped meaningful code.” This year, Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has jumped 96%, according to the report, with improving prospects for fast adoption of applications built on the network.  EigenLayer postcript  Loyal readers will recall that last week's feature in The Protocol, by Sage D. Young and yours truly, highlighted the growing conversations over EigenLayer, a project focused on ""restaking"" – essentially a way of repurposing ether (ETH) staked on Ethereum's proof-of-stake network to secure additional projects. The story noted that EigenLayer keeps raising its capacity, and the limits keep getting maxxed out immediately – seen as a sign of demand (or at least speculation). The story noted that another capacity increase was due on Aug. 22. Well, that happened, and the project immediately hit the new caps, as reported Wednesday by our Oliver Knight.

16447389,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548592,1692817230,Rarible To Stop Aggregating Orders From These Three NFT Marketplaces – Here’s Why,"Non-fungible token (NFT) aggregator Rarible has plans to cease aggregating orders from marketplaces OpenSea, LooksRare, and X2Y2. The decision comes after OpenSea decided to shift to an optional royalty model. On Thursday, August 17, OpenSea disclosed that royalties – pay cuts from secondary sales – will become optional for new NFT collections after August 31, 2023. Meanwhile, royalty fees for NFT collections that currently utilize the Operator Filter – a feature that enforces creator royalties – will become optional after February 29, 2024. Although the optional royalty model has always been a source of debate in the NFT community, many marketplaces embrace it – with X2Y2 and LooksRare introducing zero royalty fees for artists as far back as 2022. Rarible Throws Support Behind NFT Creators And Artists On Tuesday, August 22, Rarible announced – via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it will no longer aggregate orders from OpenSea, LooksRare, and X2Y2 by September 30. According to the NFT aggregator, this decision was taken because of its “unwavering support for NFT creators and artists.” Related Reading: Lacoste Unveils Exclusive Ethereum-Based Virtual Store For NFT Holders Alex Salnikov, co-founder of Rarible, said in a statement: The principle of royalties is at the heart of decentralization – a continual affirmation of a creator’s value in every transaction. We stand in solidarity with creators and artists. That’s why we will no longer support marketplaces that neglect royalties. The Rarible co-founder stated that by making royalties optional, the value and compensation for creativity are also being stripped off. “Decentralization offers the opportunity to dispel the stigma of the “starving artist,” and enable the continued growth of projects through true ownership and ongoing earnings,” he noted. Salniko urged the NFT community to become more active in defining the future of Web3. Pressure Mounts On OpenSea This news is another potential setback for OpenSea, especially as Rarible is not the first NFT entity aiming to cut ties with the one-time largest digital asset marketplace due to its proposed zero-royalty shift. On Friday, August 18, Yuga Labs – creators of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club collection – declared that it had begun the process of sunsetting support for OpenSea’s SeaPort for all “upgradable contracts and new collections” before February 2024. Despite the seemingly waning interest in the collection, Bored Ape Yacht Club is still one of the most significant contributors to the total trading activity on OpenSea. It ranks as the top collection on the marketplace, with a daily trading volume of 1,440 ETH (approximately $2.37 million). Hence, losing this blue-chip collection – and other Yuga Labs’ creations – will likely affect OpenSea’s performance and position in the market. According to a new Messari report, Blur remains the dominant marketplace, accounting for about 60% of the total NFT trading volume.

42409829,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPyB1,1692816318,"DAI Stablecoin Surpasses $5B Market Cap on Higher Yield, Lifting Spark Protocol","DAI’s market capitalization jumped by near $1 billion this month following the introduction of reward rates as high as 8%.  The increased payout bit into issuer MakerDAO’s profit expectations, though, prompting Maker to cap the rate at 5%.  MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin has returned to growth, driven by rejuvenated demand for the token after boosted reward rates for holders.  The market value of all DAI in circulation surpassed $5 billion for the first time since April as crypto investors pounced on interest rates as high as 8%. This follows an extended decline, with DAI’s market cap shrinking to as low as $4.4 billion in late July from a peak above $10 billion early in 2022, according to CoinMarketCap data.  The growth also boosted decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Spark, which leverages Maker’s credit facility and integrates DAI. The protocol’s total value of assets locked (TVL) increased by near tenfold over the past month to $430 million, according to DefiLlama.  Aiming for a turnaround, Maker founder Rune Christensen laid out plans last month for a higher interest rate regime to make the stablecoin more attractive to crypto investors by tapping into protocol revenues generated by reserve assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds to pay out the reward.  The so-called Enhanced DAI Savings Rate (EDSR) offered initially an 8% annual reward on deposits, and was set to adjust dynamically as more and more investors made use of the promotion.  DAI saw nearly $1 billion in inflows after introducing the EDSR in early August.  Is DAI’s growth sustainable?  However, questions linger about whether the growth can be sustained and new users would stick around for long.  The extra payout has drastically bitten into Maker’s profits, Kunal Goel, analyst at Messari noted in a report. “Higher rates on higher deposits ballooned the protocol’s interest expense [and] has dried up profit expectations,” he wrote. The too-high rate also opened up opportunities for arbitrage, Goel added.  Maker lowered the maximum rate to 5% this weekend to fix both issues.  That prompted some large investors to ditch DAI, including addresses controlled by Tron founder Justin Sun which redeemed some $200 million worth of tokens, WuBlockchain reported.  The Maker-adjacent Spark protocol TVL also declined to $430 million from over $600 million through the week, DefiLlama data shows.",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/23/dai-stablecoin-surpasses-5b-market-cap-on-higher-yield-lifting-spark-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba50ee381949695713b092da9b6310f95c3672c7-1191x670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409842,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPyi5,1692815293,Hacked Crypto Exchange Cypher Plans to Hold Public Token Sale,"Solana-based decentralized exchange Cypher plans to hold a token sale soon as part of its efforts to recover from a debilitating hack earlier this month.  In a series of blog posts, contributors said Cypher will use the proceeds of the sale to fund development and fill the project’s depleted treasury. Cypher lost upwards of $1 million in various assets on August 7 when a hacker drained much of the protocol just as it was catching fire.  The expedited initial decentralized offering (IDO) plan (originally slated for end of September) will see Cypher attempt to plug the hole by issuing a debt token to investors who lost their deposits to the hack. They’ll be able to get their money back from the protocol as it grows, the blog post said.  Cypher’s new token issuance plan will test whether the protocol can recapture the heady momentum of late July and early August, when airdrop hunters piled into one of the fastest growing protocols in the Solana ecosystem.  It could also showcase where the Solana ecosystem and its investors stand on new token issuances. The blockchain hasn’t seen a major IDO in a long time.  The sale’s tokenomics are uncommonly tilted toward public investors. According to Cypher’s posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, over 45% of tokens will be sold to the public, with 23% earmarked for the team, 11% for investors, 1.2% for advisors and 12% for growth incentive programs.  Another 7.3% will go toward airdrops of the token. It’s not clear how Cypher wil manage its airdrop, which many of its newer customers expected to be based on their activity, as measured by a points system that preceded the Aug 7 hack. Regardless, it will airdrop 50 million tokens to depositors who lost money to the hack.  The protocol will refund impacted depositors at a rate of 31 cents on the dollar, using the funds that had not been stolen.  Cypher is still trying to get the hacked funds back from the Aug. 7 attacker, the blog post said. It has managed to freeze $600,000 worth of crypto in centralized exchanges. “The return of these funds will be predicated on the cooperation of these CEXs and seizure warrants being issued by law enforcement,” the blog post said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SOL | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/23/hacked-crypto-exchange-cypher-plans-to-hold-public-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/821516925059437a8bed0f067aa9bf28473eea8c-4447x3335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Has Registered A Large Increase A few days back, a crash shook both Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market, as the BTC price plummeted from above $29,000 to below $26,000 instantly. In the days since then, the asset has failed to show any signs of recovery, either, as its value has only continued to move sideways, as the chart below displays. Looks like the value of the asset has continued to consolidate around the lows | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Bitcoin is trading around $25,800, suggesting a decline of 11% during the past week. This weekly performance of the number one asset in the sector is worse than some of the other top coins, like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA). It’s currently unclear whether the asset has hit its bottom, or if more decline is on the horizon, but if on-chain data is anything to go by, the latter may be more likely. As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the exchange reserve has risen during the past few hours. The “exchange reserve” here refers to a measure of the total amount of Bitcoin currently being stored inside the wallets of all centralized exchange platforms. When the value of this metric goes up, the investors are depositing a net amount of the asset to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons holders may transfer their coins to the exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this trend can cause bearish implications for the cryptocurrency’s price. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Show A Repeat Of The March Rebound? On the other hand, decreases in the indicator’s value imply the holders are taking their BTC off these central entities. Such a trend may be a sign that the investors are accumulating currently, which can naturally be bullish for the cryptocurrency in the long term. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange reserve over the past week or so: The value of the metric seems to have been going up during the past day | Source: CryptoQuant The graph shows that the Bitcoin exchange reserve has registered a sharp uptick in the last few hours, implying that investors have been depositing big to these platforms. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Indicator Is On The Verge Of A Bullish Breakout The chart shows that the indicator also rose during the buildup to the crash, but the sharpness of the growth being observed this time is on another level. In the lower graph, the quant has attached the data for the individual reserves of Coinbase and Binance, as well as for all spot and derivative platforms. It’s apparent that most of the rise has come from the derivative side of the market, with Binance seeing the largest spike. Investors use spot exchanges for selling, so the fact that most of the deposits have been towards derivative platforms may imply that investors are just looking to open up new positions on the futures market, which can also lead to more volatility. Still, the direction of it could go either way. Nonetheless, the spot exchange reserve has also observed a rise (although much smaller in scale), suggesting that a selloff might still be possible.

42409849,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPys0,1692813553,Will SBF’s ‘Blame-the-Lawyers’ Strategy Work?,"News emerged today that Sam Bankman-Fried has settled on a legal strategy ahead of his criminal trial this October, and it amounts to this:  The lawyers made me do it.  “Sam Bankman-Fried intends to argue he was acting in ‘good faith’ in loaning funds to FTX and Alameda executives, in setting Signal messages to auto-delete and in setting up a set of North American entities because he was following the advice of lawyers, including law firm Fenwick & West,” Nikhilesh De, CoinDesk’s regulatory editor, wrote Thursday.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  De reports on a letter from SBF’s lawyers, published Wednesday, that details this so-called ""advice of counsel"" strategy. The letter says the defense ""intends to elicit evidence that Mr. Bankman-Fried was aware that Fenwick lawyers as well as in-house counsel at FTX ... were involved in reviewing and approving decisions... which gave him assurance he was acting in good faith.""  SBF is accused by federal prosecutors of “multiple schemes to defraud,” including wire, commodities and securities fraud, and he faces decades in prison if found guilty.  His emerging strategy defense is certainly clever in theory, and aligns with some of the other messaging that SBF has been making since the spectacular collapse of FTX last November. The 31-year-old fallen crypto king has been presenting himself as young and hapless, too callow to have orchestrated any great evil. As he tells it, he was simply out of his depth, a creature molded by older, more experienced collaborators – like his lawyers at Fenwick & West, a mid-sized firm specializing in advising tech startups.  The question is whether this blame-the-lawyers strategy will work.  CoinDesk reached out to several defense attorneys and crypto-specialist legal minds for comment.  Ira Lee Sorkin, a defense lawyer best known for advising Bernie Madoff, said the ""advice of counsel"" strategy was fairly common in white-collar cases and could be productive for him. The prosecutors have to show that SBF intended to defraud, so a strategy to show that he acted on outside advice, rather than independently, could be useful.  But it comes with risks for SBF’s team. For one, his former lawyers at Fenwick & West could well be called upon as witnesses by the prosecution, an eventuality with an uncertain outcome. “It can be precarious because you are putting people who have advised you in the firing line,” Sorkin told CoinDesk.  The judge would also have to decide whether the advice SBF was given is covered by attorney-client privilege or whether it could be fully revealed in court. That privilege is typically between lawyers and a company, not between the lawyers and SBF as an individual, lawyers told CoinDesk. So FTX's current management would decide whether to waive its right to confidentiality in releasing relevant documents.  Attorneys at the Curtis law firm said SBF may have difficulty getting hold of the documents it needs to show that SBF acted on outside advice.  ""If he’s not able to get the physical documents, it raises the question of how he will be able to prove that he received advice from counsel and that he relied on it. This is where witness testimony may come into play,” said Kaitlyn Devenyns, a white-collar litigation associate at Curtis.  Moreover, SBF has to show that he read and acted on the advice. ""Even if SBF can get the evidence he wants, he still needs to establish that he actually read or received the advice before he can claim that he acted on it,"" said Elisa Botero, a partner at Curtis and head of the firm’s digital assets and blockchain technology group.  He can negate the ‘intent’ element required to prove the case against him  Joseph Tully, a criminal defense lawyer at Tully & Weiss, thinks the “blame-the-lawyer” strategy is a good one for SBF.  “[He] can’t deny that he did the actual acts that constitute the crimes [but] by saying he was just following the advice of his lawyers, he can negate the ‘intent’ element required to prove the case against him. If an accused can negate any element in a criminal case, the whole charge falls apart,” Tully told CoinDesk via email.  “The only possible issue that this brings up is that he would waive his otherwise confidential communications with his lawyers and everything, or most everything, that he and his lawyers discussed would be discoverable to prosecutors.”  Joshua Klayman, U.S. head of fintech, blockchain and digital assets at Linklaters, said the strategy’s success or otherwise would come down to whether SBF consistently followed the advice he was given. “In my view, it would be premature to take a view concerning the likelihood of success,” she told CoinDesk in an email response.  “With this type of defense, I would expect that this would involve a highly facts-and-circumstances-specific inquiry, including with respect to the substance and form of the advice allegedly given and whether any such alleged legal advice was followed without variation and in good faith.”  Tully agrees with Klayman. “If the lawyers did look over everything and gave him this advice, [SBF’s] fine. However, if there’s anything in the communications that says otherwise, he’s sunk,” he said.  It’s notable on this score that SBF has been known to disregard legal advice before, not least from numerous lawyers who’ve said he should remain quiet while he awaits trial.  Given the drama and scale of SBF’s alleged crimes, his trial is likely to be extensively covered in both the specialist and mainstream press. If the latest news is anything to go by, we can expect the lawyers in the case to play a pivotal role, both in directing strategy and becoming part of it.

42409845,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPyem,1692810886,Nvidia's Make-or-Break Earnings Could Be Huge for AI-Tied Crypto Tokens,"AI-related tokens such as FET, GRT, INJ, RNDR and AGIX may move after Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday.  Shares of crypto miners such as APLD, IREN, HUT, and HIVE may also see some impact.  Giant chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) could help determine later today if the artificial intelligence frenzy is real or just another bubble ready to burst – and take AI-related crypto tokens on a wild ride.  Scheduled for after the U.S. stock market closes Wednesday, this is Nvidia's first quarterly report since blowing the roof off of Wall Street's estimates in May and revealing an extremely bullish outlook for revenue tied to AI. This sentiment, coupled with increasingly AI mainstream reach with the likes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, spilled over onto AI-related cryptocurrencies, sending them soaring.  However, most AI-related tokens that surged after that report quickly lost their gains.  Read more: AI Crypto Tokens Lose Steam as Post-Nvidia Earnings Hype Wears Off  Nonetheless, tokens such as Fetch.ai (FET), The Graph (GRT), Injective (INJ), Render (RNDR) and SingularityNET (AGIX) are still higher year-to-date, suggesting investors remain intrigued by the intersection of crypto and AI. The sector got a modest bump in July after Elon Musk unveiled his ChatGPT competitor.  If the chipmaker can prove that AI is becoming a major moneymaker, that wouldn’t just be a boon for the tech firms that are adopting the technology en-masse, but also for AI-related crypto tokens' sentiment, at least in the short term.  Today's earnings could also show how AI may change corporate strategy at crypto miners. While the equipment they use is fine-tuned for crypto and cannot necessarily be shifted over to processing AI, their expertise and physical space in data centers could help them dive into AI.  Miners like Applied Digital (APLD), Iris Energy (IREN), Hut 8 (HUT) and Hive (HIVE) have already started to revitalize their data centers to accommodate AI and other computing services as mining has become less profitable during the prolonged bear market. As investors have also been rewarding the shares of some publicly traded miners for pivoting into AI, depending on how the guidance from Nvidia goes, the prices of these mining stocks could also be affected.

Solana (SOL), one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies, is down by 11.50% in the last seven days and 16.17% in the last month. Interestingly, popular crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen has posted a puzzling prediction on Solana, drawing much similarity between the token’s current price movement and historical price data of fellow altcoin Cardano (ADA). SOL To Close 2023 With Losses? According to an X post on August 23, Benjamin Cowem believes Solana’s price movement might be mirroring Cardano’s price trajectory in the last crypto cycle. Related Reading: Solana Cuts Saga Price By 40%, But Case For New SOL Yearly High Increases Based on the weekly charts of both assets, Solana presents a ranging market quite identical to Cardano’s price movement for most of 2019. In fact, in both charts, these ranging markets are preceded by a bearish trend. Good chance $SOL sweeps the lows, just like $ADA did last cycle. pic.twitter.com/KHJEPdV6qU — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 23, 2023 Analyzing this data, Cowen notes that SOL has recently encountered resistance at the $26 price zone, which is similar to Cardano’s trouble in crossing the $0.11 hurdle in mid-2019. The analyst predicts that if Solana is indeed mimicking Cardano’s price action, it will likely experience a downward trend for the rest of 2023. According to Cowen’s predictions, SOL could fall as low as $10 in 2023, just as Cardano plummeted to $0.028 in early 2020. If these projections hold true, the SOL market could lose over 50% of its value in the coming months. However, it is worth stating that Cowen’s price analysis does not spell all gloom for SOL investors. Upon falling to the $0.028 price zone in 2020, Cardano embarked on a bullish run, gaining by over 7,600% in the next two years. If Solana follows the same price pattern, the altcoin could trade as high as $1,500 in 2025. Investors should remember that predictions are not guaranteed and, thus, should be considered as investment advice. Solana, Among Others, Faces TVL Decline In other news, the Solana network has recorded a 4.5% decline in its Total Value Locked (TVL) over the seven days based on data from DefiiLlama. According to the DeFi analytics site, the majority of the DeFi ecosystem appears to be under siege, with total DeFi TVL having dipped below $40 billion and is currently valued at $37.56 billion. Related Reading: Cardano Holder Resilience Tested As ADA Fends Off Bearish Onslaught Aside from Solana, other prominent networks such as Ethereum, Cardano, and Polygon have also seen their TVL plummet by 11.08%, 6.54%, and 8.89%, respectively.

On Wednesday, The Times of Israel reported that police accused crypto businessman and former Beitar Jerusalem FC owner Moshe Hogeg of raising $290 million from investors under false pretences. Police Recommend Charging Hogeg With Fraud After a two-year investigation, the Israeli police have recommended that crypto businessman Moshe Hogeg be charged with fraud, money laundering, theft, and sex crimes. Police accused Hogeg of raising $290 million from unsuspecting investors from Israel and worldwide for four cryptocurrency projects. The police, citing a “wide range of evidence,” allege Hogeg and several of his partners used the funds for personal interests from 2017 to 2018. The Israeli police also found evidence of sexual offences and “serial violations of women’s privacy.” According to reports by Bloomberg, police questioned 180 witnesses, collected 900 pieces of evidence, and seized some of Hogeg’s assets and funds. Hogeg Accused of Financial Crimes The Times of Israel reports that police have accused the investor of committing various financial crimes, including money laundering, forgery, tax violations, aggravated fraud, theft by an authorized person, conspiracy to commit a crime, and false registration of corporate documents. Police have submitted their recommendations to Israeli prosecutors, who will determine if he will be prosecuted. Hogeg and seven others were arrested in 2021 on suspicion of involvement in fraud and sex crimes. Hogeg and the others were released under house arrest a month later.

It won't last, he argued.  ""Our view is that we've seen enough,"" Morehead wrote. ""There's just so long markets can be down.""  As of June 12, Morehead said, the price of bitcoin had been negative on a year-over-year basis for 15 consecutive months (starting Feb. 8, 2022). Prior to this, the longest period had been less than a year (Nov. 14, 2014, to Oct. 31, 2015), he continued.  It's notable that bitcoin is, as of Wednesday, up more than 20% year-over-year, even after last week's tumble from the near-$30,000 level.  As for possible positive catalysts for a market surely in need of one, Morehead notes that July's positive court ruling on the XRP token for Ripple Labs still stands, as do ""endorsements"" from BlackRock, Fidelity and other asset managers in the form of their spot bitcoin ETF applications.  And don't forget about the upcoming April 2024 halving at which the BTC block reward for mining fresh blocks will be cut in half. Morehead isn't buying the efficient market hypothesis that the halving is so widely known that the its effect has already been reflected in pricing.  ""If the demand for bitcoins stays constant and the supply of new bitcoins is cut in half, this will force the price up,"" said Morehead. His models suggest bitcoin bottomed for good late last year, should hit around $35,500 by the April 2024 halving and nearly $150,000 by late 2025.  Bitcoin retakes $26,000 level on Wednesday as rates plunge  Weak economic data out of Europe early Wednesday sent previously surging interest rates sharply lower, with 10-year government bond yields in Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. all lower by 12 to 20 basis points.  U.S. stock indexes are higher, led by the Nasdaq Composite's 1.5% advance. The S&P 500 is ahead by 1%.  Bitcoin is up 2% to $26,400, roughly inline with the gain for the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI).

42409826,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPy4P,1692808973,"Tornado Cash Devs Charged With Helping Hackers Launder $1B, Including Infamous North Korean Attacks","Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov face allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations. The Department of Justice arrested one of them, Storm.  The DOJ alleges more than $1 billion in transactions moved through the mixing service, which tries to obscure who is behind crypto transactions.  Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov were charged with money laundering and sanctions violations tied to their work with the privacy mixer that ""facilitated more than $1 billion in money laundering,"" including ""hundreds of millions"" for North Korea's Lazarus Group. The DOJ has already arrested Storm.  The mixer, which obfuscates the origin of funds transacted through it, was sanctioned last year by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control after allegations that Lazarus had laundered the funds from multiple crypto hacks through it. OFAC sanctioned Semenov as well on Wednesday, alongside eight Ethereum addresses he allegedly controls.  In a statement, U.S. Attorney Damien Williams said Tornado Cash and its operators ""knowingly facilitated"" money laundering.  ""While publicly claiming to offer a technically sophisticated privacy service, Storm and Semenov in fact knew that they were helping hackers and fraudsters conceal the fruits of their crimes. Today’s indictment is a reminder that money laundering through cryptocurrency transactions violates the law, and those who engage in such laundering will face prosecution,"" he said.  In a statement, Brian Klein of Waymaker LLP, an attorney for Storm, said the case hinged on a ""novel legal theory.""  ""We are incredibly disappointed that the prosecutors chose to charge Mr. Storm because he helped develop software, and they did so based on a novel legal theory with dangerous implications for all software developers. Mr. Storm has been cooperating with the prosecutors’ investigation since last year and disputes that he engaged in any criminal conduct. There is a lot more to this story that will come out at trial,"" he said.  Hard to kill a decentralized service like Tornado Cash  The U.S. government's sanctions against Tornado Cash, which began last year, have highlighted how difficult it can be to completely shut down a ""decentralized"" service. Programmers have borrowed from Tornado Cash's open-source code to spawn new programs with similar functionality.  The core blockchain-based software, or ""smart contracts,"" that power Tornado Cash also remain possible to use on Ethereum. However, using these smart contracts is technically illegal in the U.S., and key blockchain infrastructure providers like Infura and Alchemy – used by many of the apps that interface with the Ethereum blockchain – have censored access to the Tornado Cash app in accordance with the sanctions.  According to the Department of Justice's Wednesday indictment, Storm and Semenov designed Tornado Cash with various privacy features despite knowing that their service would be used for illicit purposes. Moreover, the DOJ alleged they maintained control over Tornado Cash, which they could have used to implement transaction monitoring or other anti-money laundering features, despite publicly saying they could not actually control it.  Alexey Pertsev  The indictment also makes frequent references to Alexey Pertsev, another co-founder, who was arrested last year in the Netherlands, where he currently awaits trial on money laundering allegations.  The three founders created an optional compliance tool to track deposits and withdrawals, but made it opt-in. The tool did not collect any anti-money laundering or know-your-customer information either, the DOJ alleged.  ""The defendants and [Pertsev] recognized that they did not incorporate KYC or AML programs as required by law, and so they made misleading public statements to minimize their ownership and control of the Tornado Cash service, and their operation of the Tornado Cash service as a business from which they expected to generate substantial profits,"" the indictment said.  This recognition included a message that Storm sent Semenov saying they ""should never ... talk as if we own tornado,"" the DOJ said.  KuCoin, BitMart, Axie Infinity  The DOJ further alleged that the defendants knew their service was being used to launder funds from hacks and other thefts, seeming to reference the KuCoin and BitMart hacks from 2020 and 2021, respectively. A later section walked through the Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge hack.  Employees representing the exchanges had reached out to the developers, but they declined to ""offer any assistance,"" the filing said.  The DOJ also spoke to the TORN tokens tied to Tornado Cash, citing messages from Semenov saying they needed to pump the token's price. After Tornado Cash was sanctioned the first time, Storm distributed $2.6 million in an unnamed stablecoin to each of the founders and told them to transfer the funds to new addresses.  ""Tornado Cash has been used to launder funds for criminal actors since its creation in 2019, including to obfuscate hundreds of millions of dollars in virtual currency stolen by Lazarus Group hackers,"" a Treasury press release said Wednesday.  Wednesday's arrests come barely a week after a federal judge ruled that crypto investors' and developers' rights had not been infringed by OFAC sanctioning Tornado Cash.  UPDATE (Aug. 23, 2023, 17:10 UTC): Adds detail throughout.  CORRECTION (Aug. 23, 2023, 17:42 UTC): Corrects to say that only Storm was arrested.

Bitcoin Active Entities Is Trying To Escape Network Stagnation Range In a new post on X, Jamie Coutts, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, has discussed the BTC active entities metric, and how it has a strong relationship with the coin’s price. The “active entities” here are a measure of the unique total amount of Bitcoin addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the blockchain. Naturally, both senders and receivers are counted by the metric. When the value of this metric rises, it means that an increasing number of users are engaging with the network. Such a trend is a sign of growing adoption for the asset. On the other hand, declining values of the indicator imply that interest in the cryptocurrency may be waning, as fewer addresses are becoming active on the blockchain. The analyst has pointed out that the active entities metric has a high r-squared value with Bitcoin. The r-squared values of the different BTC-related metrics | Source: @Jamie1Coutts on X From the table, it’s visible that the r-squared value for the active entities is 0.55. What this means is that 55% of all fluctuations in the cryptocurrency’s price can be explained by this variable. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Show A Repeat Of The March Rebound? There are only a few metrics with a higher r-squared value, making the active entities an indicator with one of the strongest statistical relationships with BTC. “Importantly, this is also a stable relationship over time (ex the wonky pre-2012 data),” Coutts notes. Looks like the r-squared value of the indicator has been quite stable since 2012 | Source: @Jamie1Coutts on X Now, here is a chart that shows how the Bitcoin active entities have changed during the history of the cryptocurrency: The trend in the metric's value over the years | Source: @Jamie1Coutts on X As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin active addresses have stagnated around each of the cycle lows, but in the periods between them, it has seen a rise, although the pace has been getting slower over time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dip Worth Buying? What Market Sentiment Suggests Since 2021, the indicator has been inside a rather long phase of stagnation, as the indicator has been unable to escape out of a particular range. It would appear, however, that things might be starting to change for the better. The indicator's value has been on the rise in recent days | Source: @Jamie1Coutts on X The CMT explains that it’s looking like a TA-style breakout so far, but it’s not yet fully clear whether the Bitcoin active entities have truly escaped the stagnation range. If the metric can manage to stay above the range for the next few weeks, it might be a confirmation that the extra entities that have started trading on the network are truly planning to stick around, and hence, that constructive adoption is finally picking up for Bitcoin.

Experts suggest investors should not avoid what this new platform has to offer. So, let's explore current opportunities available in the crypto market. Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives Solana (SOL) gains high liquidity while the token trades at $21.91 Recently, Solana (SOL) shared great news. It is now listed among the top liquid altcoins on Coinbase. According to Kaiko, Solana (SOL) has more than $3 million in liquidity. Such flexible liquidity makes the assets convertible. Hence, Solana (SOL) users can convert assets into cash without any market price impact. Furthermore, some data also suggests that Solana (SOL) is more liquid than XRP and DOGE. Despite this, Solana (SOL) couldn't save itself from the market downturn. Moreover, the SEC lawsuit also declined its value. The token dropped by 11.08% in the past week. Additionally, the total Solana (SOL) token volume has been over 35% down in the past 24 hours. Currently, it is trading at $21.9, a 0.98% rise in a day. Further, the price forecasts suggest the Solana (SOL) token may trade at $21.63 on average. Polygon (MATIC) may join Avorak's AI: the token trades at $0.5798 Polygon (MATIC) is among the platforms that support Blockchain and AI pairs. Moreover, it has all the qualities an AI project needs to enter blockchain. In fact, Polygon (MATIC) officials believe that it has ideal testing space for AI development. Hence, rumors on collaboration between Polygon (MATIC) and Avorak's AI platform are spreading. Furthermore, the crypto platform has a scalable network that can test AI solutions. Polygon's (MATIC) scalability may play a great role in AI growth across the network. The rapid and cheaper transactions of Polygon (MATIC) also make it easy to deploy AI solutions. Moreover, platforms like Coinbase ensure investors access Polygon (MATIC) easily. Hence, support from big exchanges can assure longer success for Avorak's AI solution. It may help Polygon (MATIC) gain the needed talent and resources for developing the AI platform. It may also help Polygon (MATIC) flip its price downturn. Currently, the Polygon (MATIC) token is trading at $0.5798, a 0.31% drop in a day. Experts suggest a price rise of $0.72 in later months, for Polygon (MATIC). Everlodge (ELDG) may rule the real estate industry The real estate industry is thriving with a market size of more than $7,063 trillion. But buying real estate needs a big financial commitment. This is where Everlodge comes into the picture. It is a unique blockchain-based property marketplace. Users can invest in vacation homes and hotels, and share ownership. The platform enables investment services through NFT minting and timeshare. But, investors don't need to pay for the entire property. The platform divides the property's NFT into smaller fractions. Thus, anyone can buy the cheaper equity of the NFT. Moreover, these NFTs have direct links to real properties. Thus, their worth is bound to rise in the future. The platform's native token, ELDG, also brings various advantages to its holders. These include the following: ● Discounts on trading costs● Staking rewards● Vacation giveaways Furthermore, the ELDG tokens’ presale is now underway, starting at an initial price of $0.01. Market forecasts suggest a 30 times increase in token price on the launch date. So, sign up early, as tokens are selling fast.

42409850,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPyyc,1692805500,Bitcoin Dreams Are Coming True in Argentina and Turkey,"Right before the volatility in digital assets late last week and the breakout of bitcoin (BTC) to the downside due to rising interest rates and low market liquidity, Javier Milei made global news by unexpectedly winning the Argentinean primary election.  A libertarian candidate and member of the ""La Libertad Avanza"" party, Milei is a Bitcoin advocate, saying it “represents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector.” He also calls for the abolition of the country’s central bank, which, he says, ""is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax.” While it’s unsurprising that a candidate in a country infamous for inflation (currently estimated above about 100% annualized) would have a critical view of the central bank, it does raise questions more broadly about the global experience for cryptocurrency holders.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  When we hear that “Bitcoin is too risky,” as citizens of the U.S. and as holders of dollars we must remember that this simple statement comes from a position of substantial privilege, specifically “exorbitant privilege.” First termed by French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in the 1960s, exorbitant privilege refers to the unique benefits that the U.S. enjoys due to the widespread use of the dollar in international trade, finance and as a global reserve currency. Some of the benefits from the global ubiquity and near-insatiable demand for dollars are the U.S. government’s ability to print dollars with minimal consequence and to borrow at lower interest rates than other countries, many with checkered financial pasts (like Argentina). Global reserve status also simplifies monetary policy decisions for the U.S., as the Federal Reserve is the de facto global central bank, setting the tone for other central banks to follow similar rate policies to defend their exchange rates. Or, as John Connally, President Richard Nixon's Treasury Secretary, bluntly put it to a group of European finance ministers: “The dollar is our currency, but it's your problem.”  So, how has the bitcoin investment experience been for global holders outside of the local dollar system? Over the past five years, most bitcoin holders outside of the U.S. experienced greater gains in bitcoin (see Figure 1 below), due to the depreciation of their local currencies relative to the dollar as a consequence of the U.S. interest rates going up in addition to the 31% return of bitcoin relative to the dollar (see orange bar for bitcoin vs. USD return for comparison). Bitcoin over the past five-year period has been stronger than a stronger dollar.  Figure 1: Average five-year return of bitcoin holders by foreign currency. Source: CoinDesk Indices Research, FactSet.  Notable outliers over the period include Argentina (providing context for Milei’s primary election success) and Turkey (whose leader recently came around to reinstating traditional economic theories after a foray into “Erdoyanomics” in pursuit of the stimulative effects of lower interest rates). With five-year realized inflation for Argentina and Turkey at 60% and 33%, respectively, BTC holders in Argentina and Turkey have been able to preserve their purchasing power and mostly weather the political and economic conditions within their countries by leveraging a decentralized and digital store of value.  Pretty neat, huh?  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  BUFFETT RULE: Berkshire Hathaway Chair Warren Buffett, describing his firm’s investment objective, said nearly four decades ago: “We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.” With the obvious caveat that this is not investment advice: There sure is a lot of fear out there in crypto. Bitcoin (BTC) just somewhat mysteriously (no, it probably wasn’t Elon Musk’s doing) plunged the other day. It’s left the market in the most oversold condition since the Covid Crash in early 2020. A buying opportunity? You tell me!  COINCIRCLE: While PayPal is no Mastercard or Visa, it’s also no slouch in payments. A major potential use case for stablecoins is paying for stuff. So, PayPal’s experience in the paying-for-stuff business is highly relevant as the company enters the stablecoins game, creating a real risk for the big incumbents USDT (from Tether) and USDC (which has been overseen by both Circle Internet Financial and Coinbase – until now). News broke this week via CoinDesk that Circle and Coinbase are dissolving the partnership that had governed USDC; Circle is bringing USDC fully in-house, with Coinbase remaining associated by getting (apparently by paying no cash, per the CoinDesk story) a minority equity stake in Circle. Coinbase downplayed any fears of PayPal. “I really do believe PayPal grows the pie for us,” a Coinbase executive told CoinDesk’s Ian Allison, who broke the news. I guess we should watch the stablecoin market cap leaderboard.  HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL: Despite the massive gains this year in bitcoin and other digital assets, it’s hard to argue these are wonderful, comfortable times for crypto. The blow-ups of last year continue to weigh on the space, regulators are on the prowl, etc. Nevertheless, there is a pretty clear sign of optimism: People keep launching new blockchains. What this actually means or will amount to is really hard to say. One of them – Sei – is built for low-latency applications such as trading … just like Solana, Sui and Aptos before it. None of those have exactly upended how Wall Street works.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2023/08/23/bitcoin-dreams-are-coming-true-in-argentina-and-turkey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afab0eda7060ea34d827b32ce2718992a0cfe36c-3400x2267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42409852,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPz5E,1692805500,The Thermodynamics of Crypto Investing,"The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only altered in form. The same law can be appreciated in investing, where risk and return are never created or destroyed, just transformed through an investing cycle. You may also have heard the popular crypto meme, “Everyone buys bitcoin at the price that they deserve.” These two statements are saying the same thing, just in slightly different vernacular: As the various structural risks of crypto investing change over time, the opportunities for returns change, too.  Once upon a time, when bitcoin (BTC) came to life, there were many risks. One of the first primordial ones was “existential risk.” Back in 2014, it was not clear if bitcoin was going to make it, especially after the Mt. Gox hack. This was the baffling “funny money” era, when an unsuspecting pizza lover spent 10,000 BTC (now worth about $300 million) for a pair of pies. As the market eventually reduced its assessment of existential risk, the value of bitcoin rose, finding a new price equilibrium for new investors who no longer needed to worry about that particular risk.  Then there was “financial/funding risk,” i.e., whether enough capital would be mobilized into this asset class to lead the imagined technological revolution. This risk was ultimately reduced by massive inflows of venture capital, which reached over $50 billion in 2021 to 2022. As another dimension of crypto’s multivariable risk calculus was removed, the price jumped once more. In 2023, we would argue that regulatory risk is the next domino to fall. While, at times, progress may be shrouded in fog, we believe that crypto will work through this risk (as we’ve already seen outside the U.S.) and usher in the next transformation of risk.  Many risks still remain, of course, which is why investors still have the chance for outsized returns – though as each risk falls, returns become incrementally smaller.  So, if this risk-return energy is not destroyed, what does it become? As regulatory risk takes center stage, we see a continually transforming landscape for digital alpha investing. Consider:  Offshore market makers are decreasing volume, which affects quantitative market-making and high-frequency arbitrage trading strategies.  Government lawsuits that target altcoins as potential unregistered securities affect the viable universe of token selection alpha for fundamental investors.  Rules around qualified custody affect all on-chain strategies, where today’s cutting edge of financial engineering and market structure innovation live.  In other words, while each incremental return opportunity for crypto beta is less significant than the prior, the opposite is happening for crypto alpha: The reduction of these later-stage risks is paving the way for extraordinary financialization and institutional adoption. Yet, this transformation creates an “allocator’s dilemma.” You can’t just offhandedly invest with the largest funds as a sure-fire path to success. Instead, we are currently in an exceptional era for capacity-constrained smaller funds, which have a unique opportunity to outperform. But, of course, that won’t last forever as the thermodynamics of crypto investing continue to transform. Astute institutional investors would be well-served to consider what kind of stake they want to have in this moment of transition.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jeff Park,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/23/the-thermodynamics-of-crypto-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb5270c981e5794c30fe1da14541ee8d75c4ca50-5064x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum (ETH) brings the Shapella upgrade while the token trades at $1,681.37 Ethereum (ETH) users are seeking constant upgrades to the network. They believe that the platform must adopt new technologies to stay relevant. Thus, users are excited about the addition of the Shapella upgrade on Ethereum (ETH). Furthermore, investors seek price rises for Ethereum (ETH) tokens via this upgrade. But, some experts suggest that Ethereum (ETH) may face selling pressure, which will drop its price. But, the platform's co-founder said investors may lock in more ETH with the price drop. As a result, the Ethereum (ETH) token may suffer a low supply. It is yet to see how the upgrade impacts Ethereum (ETH) in the coming weeks. Currently, Ethereum (ETH) token is trading at $1,681.37, a 1.07% rise in a day. Additionally, experts predict Ethereum (ETH) to reach $2,139.42 in the next few months.

42409827,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPyEK,1692804600,Coinbase’s Chosen Blockchain Brand Sees Zero Threat from Zero Knowledge,"In recent months, there’s been a clear trend among big crypto companies – including Coinbase, Binance, and a16z – looking to start their own “layer-2” blockchain solutions atop Ethereum: They’ve chosen OP Stack, from the team that created Optimism, to provide the open-source software building blocks for their new networks.  On the surface, it might seem like a surprising pattern, since many top Ethereum aficionados have predicted that the most promising layer-2 blockchains would be built not using the OP Stack’s “optimistic rollup” technology but with a fundamentally different setup known as “ZK rollups,” powered by zero-knowledge cryptography. A key difference is the speed of finalizing transactions: With ZK rollups, it’s almost instantaneous, whereas with optimistic rollups, the process can take minutes or even days.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  This dissonance – between the recent commercial track record and the widely held vision for the future – raises the question of whether OP Stack is merely an interim solution for companies that want to start their own layer-2 blockchains now, hinging on the assumption that eventually the industry will pivot toward ZK technology. Or maybe there’s a flaw in the common wisdom that ZK tech will eventually dominate?  The short answer might be that ZK rollups are still seen as the best solution for scaling Ethereum, in the long run.  “I’d say they choose the OP stack because it is easy to spin it up and there is no need to arrange a hardcore ZK team for this,” said Mikhail Komarov, CEO of Nil Foundation, a research and development firm designed to expand the reach of ZK technology and adoption. “Once there is an easy way to spin-up ZK-rollup stack, they will migrate to that.”  What’s less understood, perhaps, at least according to the Optimism team, is that the OP Stack will eventually allow builders the flexibility to pick and choose between various attributes. Those include whether to adopt proofs used with ZK rollup technology instead of implementing optimistic fraud proofs.  Optimism’s flagship network, OP Mainnet, is the second-biggest layer 2 blockchain, according to the website L2Beat. And though it’s an optimistic rollup, builders using OP Stack could go in a different direction.  The OP Stack or Zero-Knowledge?  Ethereum layer 2s, blockchains that are built on top of a base blockchain and enable faster and cheaper transactions, have quickly released new scaling products to the market over the last six months.  Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, has said previously that while optimistic rollups have been around longer, rollups that are powered by ZK technology will eventually overtake them.  The recent launch of crypto exchange Coinbase’s ‘Base’ layer 2 is built using Optimism’s OP Stack, a type of customizable blockchain framework that lets developers build their own chains using the optimistic rollup technology. Crypto venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is also working with OP Stack to come out with their own rollup client solution, and Binance’s BNB chain came out with an Ethereum-compatible testnet blockchain using the stack's technology.  To observers who read the glowing predictions for zero-knowledge technology, the choice of OP Stack might seem like choosing a canal over a railroad.  Several ZK-based networks, which employ a type of scaling technique that uses zero-knowledge proofs, were hailed as possible game-changers as they’ve come to market this year. Contenders include Polygon’s zkEVM or Matter Labs’ zkSync era, while Matter Labs, Polygon, and Starkware have their own zk-proof-based packages – again, for developers to build their own blockchains on the blueprint – hitting the market.  One trade-off is that ZK rollups tend to be more technically complex, and many of the projects that use them are considered to be in a more immature state of development, when compared with optimistic rollups. Another downside of ZK-based systems is that they tend to be computationally intense – requiring specialized hardware, and consuming more energy.  Coinbase Base  Jesse Pollak, head of protocols at Coinbase and the creator of Base, told CoinDesk that picking the OP Stack was “a very considered decision,” but that Base’s goal is to eventually be secured by ZK validity proofs (which the OP Stack will enable.)  The team at Base argued that the latest upgrades to the OP mainnet, in addition to the OP Stack being an MIT open-source license (which is seen as one of the most “liberal” open-source licenses, meaning that developers can reuse the code in almost any way possible), allowed the company to start building right away, without having to consult anyone or even alert OP Labs ahead of time.  “We basically think about OP Stack as the ball platform, which will start with fault proofs, but will be upgraded over time and have multiple fault proofs, and then ZK proofs (validity proofs) that run alongside the fault proofs until we kind of have the best configuration of provers for the network to optimize for security and kind of faster finality,” he said.  It’s worthy to note though that currently the Optimism mainnet does not use fraud proofs, which are used to verify the state of transactions and key to the security of a blockchain.  Indeed, with OP stack, the blockchains will be compatible with multiple proofs, meaning that those looking to build will be able to implement fraud proofs (for optimistic rollups) or validity proofs (for ZK rollups.)  OP Labs, the company behind Optimism, has gotten some heat in the past about not having fraud proofs securing its mainnet, including from the CEO of Offchain Labs, Optimism’s competitor and the company behind the Arbitrum blockchain, who tweeted: “Without fraud proofs, Ethereum provides zero security.”  Karl Floersch, CEO of OP Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview that “we 100% support multiple proof systems. We're talking about a modular proof system. That modular proof system supports fraud proofs of various types and supports validity proofs of various types.”  Floersch believes that given how easy it is to build with Optimism, those looking to build their chains will opt for the OP Stack over their competitors.  Time will tell as ZK-based blockchain frameworks mature and come to market.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | OP | ZK,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/23/coinbases-chosen-blockchain-brand-sees-zero-threat-from-zero-knowledge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d440d5f409f528ab5c458211111623d35397c246-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409846,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPyoh,1692803460,DeFi Shrinks to Multiyear Low as the Crypto-Fueled Future of Finance Falters,"The supposed future of finance is going backward.  The amount of money stashed in decentralized finance, or DeFi, protocols has dwindled to the lowest level since February 2021, according to data compiled by DefiLlama. Specifically, total value locked, or TVL, has slumped to $37.5 billion, slipping below the previous post–bull market nadir of $38 billion set in December.  Proponents say DeFi will usher in a whole new way of doing finance, shifting conventional ways of moving and trading assets onto blockchains. Hype around that idea drove TVL up to a late 2021 peak of $177 billion. Then came the dramatic crash last year as crypto prices sank and scandals scared people away from the space. This year, the U.S. government's crackdown on crypto has made traditional finance players nervous about DeFi, fearful they might run afoul of regulations.  Several protocols have lost more than half of their locked value in the past month alone. Optimism-based decentralized exchange, or DEX, Velodrome has experienced a 58% decline in TVL. Balancer, one of the largest liquidity protocols, has seen its TVL drop by 35% to $641 million.  Why is DeFi decaying?  The past few days have been rough for crypto as a whole, with bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum's ether (ETH) – which underpins much of the DeFi market – embarking on double-digit percentage declines.  Typically, when the largest crypto assets fall, traders pull liquidity out of more speculative assets like those within DeFi to mitigate risk. That certainly played out last year, when bitcoin slumped 77% from its all-time high while several altcoins plunged by more than 95% from records.  However, DeFi has fared worse than ETH this year. ETH is up about 40% since December even as DeFi TVL has shrunk, suggesting DeFi's issues are specific to it, not its key token.  Some have alluded to the DeFi's sensitivity to yields on U.S. Treasuries.  ""Fundamentally, it's due to U.S. Treasury yields being up and DeFi yields, which are higher risk, giving lower rewards,"" Doo, co-founder of StableLab and Asia Lead at MakerDAO, told CoinDesk. ""When yields were increased to 8%, we saw DSR [Dai Savings Rate] deposits increase by four times.""  ""There is a wider issue with liquidity as well and this can be verified by looking at overall volumes of major decentralized exchanges,"" Doo added. ""Both Curve and Uniswap see lower trading volumes, which also translate to less liquidity and also interest in the market. It also leads to yields being lower, which reinforces such.""",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/23/defi-shrinks-to-multiyear-low-as-the-crypto-fueled-future-of-finance-falters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/430c34949eee3a1dea6635458536ca22d73dd78f-1538x784.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The process requires a user to give his iris scans in exchange for a digital ID known as global ID and get free Worldcoin tokens as part of plans to create a new identity and financial network, and the Kenyan government saw this as a security risk. Joint Ad-hoc Committee Investigation In Kenya Kenya’s National Assembly Speaker Rt Hon. (Dr.) Moses Wetang’ula, has ordered the Joint Ad Hoc Committee to investigate the activities of Worldcoin and report back to the House within 42 days. Related Reading: The $20 Billion Delay: Appeal Court Pushes Back Decision On Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF The Joint Ad-hoc Committee’s investigations on Worldcoin kicked off on Monday after the movement was set afoot following a meeting to outline its Terms of Reference, and to determine potential experts and witnesses to appear before the legislators during its investigation. Gabriel Tongoyo, head of the 17-member committee, stated that the potential experts and witnesses to appear before the legislators will include The Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, the Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury, The National Intelligence Service (NIS), the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), and the Ministry of Health. These experts and witnesses will have to enlighten the legislators on the relationship between Worldcoin and crypto trading in Kenya, and the potential health hazards resulting from the reported iris scans. Also, the office of the Attorney General, the Registrar of Companies, and the Data Commissioner are expected to answer MP Gabriel Tongoyo’s questions on the legal framework of the operations of Worldcoin in Kenya. This is to ensure that due diligence was taken in the registration process of Worldcoin in Kenya. The committee has been given this very limited time to provide all the answers needed by the Legislators, as local media have reported that more than 350,000 Kenyans have signed up for Worldcoin in exchange for a free $49 worth of WLD tokens valued at 7,000 Kenyan shillings before the operation was suspended. WLD price struggles amid regulatory pressures | Source: WLDUSDT on Tradingview.com Worldcoin Fails to Meet Privacy Laws Worldcoin’s collection of biometrics data in exchange for its tokens reportedly failed to meet regulatory requirements in Kenya due to the requirement that disclosure of personal information should only be done in critical circumstances. Immaculate Kassait, the Data Commissioner for Kenya stated that Worldcoin had not been upfront about its objectives during the registration process. The Kenyan Capital Markets Authority also indicated that Worldcoin’s activities in the country were carried out without regulatory supervision, and this led to skepticism among the citizens in sharing their data with Worldcoin. Related Reading: Rumors Of Robinhood Listing XRP Take Center Stage On Crypto Twitter Due to this, the Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki gave the order to suspend every operation of Worldcoin in the country because of security concerns. Eliud Owalo, the digital counterpart of Kithure Kindiki, has also shared a few warnings about Worldcoin. According to recent reports, a raid on Worldcoin’s facility in Nairobi was carried out two weeks ago by the Kenyan police, leading to the seizure of documents and equipment from the facility for the purpose of accessing the data that has been collected by Worldcoin so that proper investigations can be conducted. However, Worldcoin stated that the company was willing to work with the authorities and outlined how it would restart its operations following the implementation of crowd-control measures.

Investors are now eyeing the charts as SOL grapples with this pattern once again, raising questions about its future trajectory. For the uninitiated in the intricacies of technical analysis, the Death Cross is akin to a storm warning on the horizon. It emerges when a short-term moving average dives beneath a long-term moving average, signaling potential tumult ahead. The last instance when Solana encountered the Death Cross was back in 2022, and the aftermath was far from favorable – a considerable downtrend that sent ripples through the crypto market. Fast forward to the present, and Solana finds itself at a crossroads once more. As of now, SOL is valued at $20.84 according to CoinGecko, reflecting a 1.4% gain over the last 24 hours. However, a more concerning figure emerges when considering the seven-day performance, which showcases an 11.1% slump. These numbers underscore the significance of the pending death cross and the apprehensions it invokes. SOL market cap at $8.4 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Bearish Solana Trends And Lingering Uncertainties Analyzing the market structure on the 1-day chart reveals a bearish picture for SOL. The cryptocurrency recently established a lower high at $25.68 coupled with a lower low at $22.23 on August 5. Subsequent weeks witnessed the gradual formation of a downtrend, amplifying concerns among traders and investors. Further technical indicators add weight to the concerns. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) has been painting a discouraging narrative as well, with declining demand for SOL evident through the formation of lower highs since mid-July. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) At June Lows Again – Prospects For Bullish Recovery? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) depicts a recent bearish momentum, hinting at potential further declines. Additionally, the moving averages stand on the cusp of signaling a dip, adding to the prevailing unease. Meanwhile, bearish mood prevailed in the market, based on Open Interest. Even though SOL was at long-term support, the drop in OI over the last 10 days was significant, and it has not reversed the downturn. Source: Coinglass Potential Impact On Investor Sentiment And TVL Despite Solana’s current Total Value Locked standing at a noteworthy $243.85 million, the looming death cross looms as a destabilizing factor. Past experiences have shown that such ominous patterns can erode investor sentiment, potentially leading them to seek safer investment options. Related Reading: AVAX Network Activity Down – Will The Planned Token Unlock Bring Back The Energy? Consequently, the TVL could face downward pressure as investors contemplate safeguarding their capital amidst uncertain times. As the crypto community holds its breath, the coming weeks will undoubtedly be critical for Solana.

42409839,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPyYA,1692797188,Curve Crisis Shows Pitfalls of Decentralized Risk Management,"When decentralized finance, or DeFi, took off in 2020, it was pitched as an antidote to the failings of legacy finance.  Decentralized lending was supposed to be DeFi’s killer app – a way for people to borrow and lend digital assets instantaneously on blockchains, without banks or credit scores. As centralized crypto lenders like FTX crumbled last year as a result of bad actors and financial mismanagement, DeFi lending “blue chips” like the Aave protocol – the largest decentralized lender – kept on ticking, bolstering DeFi’s pitch as an improvement to traditional finance.  Crypto markets are slumping, but Aave continues to boast $4.6 billion worth of user deposits, according to DefiLlama – money pooled by people around the world to help facilitate bankless borrowing on Ethereum and other blockchains.  But a few weeks ago, a $70 million hack on Curve, one of the largest decentralized crypto exchanges, revealed cracks in the DeFi promise. The hack set off a Rube Goldberg-esque series of events that pushed DeFi lending to its limits – threatening to send the price of a key DeFi asset into a downward “death spiral,” and raising critical questions about whether community-driven financial platforms are equipped to manage risk.  The limits of overcollateralized lending  DeFi is powered by smart contracts – blockchain-based computer programs that allow people to directly transact with one another. The reliance on code is supposed to make things quick, cheap, and broadly accessible, allowing people to lend, borrow and swap tokens without banks.  The money loaned out by DeFi lending platforms like Aave, Frax and Abracadabra is pooled from a “decentralized” community of individual depositors, each of whom earns a cut of the interest paid by borrowers. The risk of big positions is also spread between these people; if a borrower can’t pay off their debt, these lenders are the ones left holding the bag.  DeFi lenders have fewer tools than banks do to judge creditworthiness, so they tend to have strict over-collateralization requirements – meaning borrowers must put up more value in collateral than they take out as loans.  Recent events have shown the limits of high collateral for staving off risk.  Over several months in 2023, Curve exchange founder Michael Egorov borrowed around $100 million across several different decentralized lending platforms. As collateral, he put up over $200 million worth of CRV, Curve’s native token.  DeFi lenders are programmed to automatically liquidate a borrower’s collateral if it falls to a certain price – meaning they sell it off to the open market. Egorov’s lenders thought they had enough CRV collateral to cover themselves in the event of a potential default.  However, when a hack siphoned $70 million from Curve last month – dragging the price of CRV down 20%, closer to prices where Egorov’s collateral would have been auto-liquidated – the exchange founder’s DeFi lenders realized they might soon be saddled with millions of dollars in bad debt.  Read more: Curve Founder’s $168M Stash Is Under Stress, Creating a Risk for DeFi as a Whole  In granting Egorov’s loans, lending smart contracts had apparently failed to account for Egorov’s full collateral position, which was stashed across several disparate lending protocols, and therefore difficult to account for programmatically. Altogether, Egorov had put up a hefty one-third of all circulating CRV as collateral. If a lender liquidated even a fraction of this amount, the whole market for CRV – a relatively illiquid but systemically important DeFi asset – would have collapsed.  “When a founder of a project wants to lend a huge portion of a token’s supply, you're never going to be able to liquidate very rapidly,” said Sacha Ghebali, a data analyst at crypto analytics firm TheTie. “You need to have limits there.”  Briefly, a sort of Mexican standoff ensued between some of Egorov’s biggest leaders as they weighed liquidating the Curve founder early in an effort to avoid being the last ones stuck with worthless CRV.  Egorov wasn’t ultimately liquidated; he managed to pay down some of his loans with the help of big-money “whales,” like Tron founder Justin Sun, who had a vested interest in keeping DeFi afloat.  Even still, the Egorov situation “put a chink in the armor of DeFi protocols in showing that you can have bad debt, you can have credit losses in over-collateralized loans – provided that the collateral is not liquid enough,” said Sid Powell, the CEO of Maple Finance, an institution-focused DeFi lending company.  Challenges for decentralized risk management  Every lending platform has rules baked into its code meant to protect against systemic-risk scenarios like the CRV fiasco. Broadly, the rules govern what assets can be borrowed, and in exchange for what kinds of collateral. Requiring over-collateralization is a primary method for managing risk, but not the only one.  In an emailed comment to CoinDesk, an Aave spokesperson took pains to specify that Egorov’s $60 million Aave lending position was made in Aave V2, an older version of the platform, and wouldn’t have been possible in the newer Aave V3 protocol, which “has risk parameters which limit this exact scenario to the point where bad debt is extremely unlikely.”  Banks hire professional managers to set these kinds of risk parameters. Aave and other DeFi lenders kick this responsibility to their investors.  Aave’s risk parameters are set by the Aave DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization – people who hold the platform’s AAVE token. The setup is pitched as a way for Aave’s stakeholders to democratically govern how their money is borrowed.  While an Aave spokesperson told CoinDesk that “the Aave DAO is known for conservative management,” some experts say the Curve crisis showed that risk management is too complicated to be handled by a DAO.  “More than 500 different parameters are talking to each other on the Aave protocol – it could be collateral factors, liquidation sensors, oracles, interest rates,” said Paul Frambot, CEO of the DeFi lending protocol Morpho. “You have votes to change those risk parameters constantly.”  “The Aave paradigm is not built to scale with such an amount of complexity,” said Frambot, who has worked to introduce new kinds of risk management systems with Morpho. In addition to DAOs being slow to make decisions, “you have to have a Ph.D. in risk management to really understand these things.”  Leaving it to the professionals  If the Curve situation illustrated anything, said Frambot, it’s that DeFi lending protocols should not be viewed as autonomous pieces of computer code, but as systems that rely heavily on human decisions. ”The Aave protocol is in fact more of an on-chain fund with decentralized and open rails,” said the Morpho founder. “What they're doing is letting users deposit money, and then they manage the risk of this position.”  According to Aave’s spokesperson, “The DAO has various risk-mitigation, third-party services” to make risk “assessments and recommendations, but it is ultimately up to the DAO to decide how to respond to potential risks.”  Frambot says risk management is too tedious and complex for a DAO to handle, meaning power naturally concentrates into the hands of large “delegates” and risk management firms.  Firms like Gauntlet and Chaos, two of Aave DAO’s main risk management partners, have proprietary tools to measure risk and propose parameter changes. “Literally every day, risk managers are pushing risk parameters that are completely trusted and opaque – like we have no idea how they're calculated,” said Frambot. “Yet you know the DAO is going to greenlight it” because it comes from a trusted brand.  Of the 303 proposals since December 2020 that have made it to a formal Aave DAO governance vote – typically these follow a “snapshot” community poll in the Aave forums – only 8% have been outright rejected. Of the 262 proposals that have been approved and executed by the Aave DAO, 233 passed with unanimous approval. The bulk of them involved risk parameter changes.  Aave DAO decisions also tend to be driven by just a handful of “delegates” – individuals and organizations that are given permission to vote on behalf of other AAVE-holders. In each of the past five Aave DAO votes, more than half of the final vote tally came from the three largest delegates.  “There's a bit of demagoguery to being a delegate,” remarked Dean Tribble, CEO of Agoric, a company building a DeFi-focused blockchain. “People are rewarded for voting along with the majority, and that's why you get these big swings – 100% vote kinds of things. Or, a loud minority can have an outsized impact.”  The Curve fiasco demonstrated the capriciousness that can result from this kind of system.  In June – more than a month before the Curve exchange was hacked – Gauntlet proposed freezing CRV in Aave V2, arguing Egorov’s massive CRV collateral risked becoming bad debt. Aave’s community voted unanimously against the proposal, which would have prevented Egorov from increasing the size of his CRV position.  When Gauntlet reintroduced its CRV freeze proposal in July, days after the Curve hack, the community voted 100% in favor.",NEGATIVE,AAVE | CRV,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/23/curve-crisis-shows-pitfalls-of-decentralized-risk-management,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9308f599f966cfafa038bfd44fbfb182006b6aba-1441x940.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The revelation highlights the potential misuse of digital currencies for illicit purposes. N Korea exploiting crypto financial freedom The flagged Bitcoin wallets are under scrutiny for their alleged ties to activities that breach US sanctions. Authorities have consistently emphasised the significance of monitoring and controlling digital currency transactions to deter malicious actors from exploiting the financial freedom that crypto offers. North Korea's alleged involvement in crypto-based activities isn't new. Over the past few years, the nation has been frequently cited for its purported engagement in cyber-attacks, aimed at accruing cryptocurrencies to bypass economic restrictions. According to the FBI, these findings serve as a stern reminder of what it sees as the double-edged nature of the crypto world. While the digital currency landscape offers remarkable opportunities for legitimate transactions and investments, it can also be a playground for entities with ulterior motives. Reacting to this, some experts in the field advocate for more robust tracking mechanisms, saying that these mechanisms would not only identify suspicious wallet activities but also ensure that cryptocurrencies remain a secure and transparent medium for genuine users. Crypto should not be scapegoated It should however be noted that the wallets contain the proceeds from hacks that were carried out over the past year. The wallets currently have 1,580 bitcoins between them according to a report by CoinTelegraph earlier today. By its nature, cryptocurrency is already transparent, and this has enabled the FBI to pinpoint the hackers’ transactions. This really can’t be said for cash, which enables more or less complete anonymity for hackers. Using crypto as a scapegoat and then imposing a suffocating regulatory strait jacket is just going to harm an extremely innovative industry. With the world’s economies severely battered and on the brink of meltdown, crypto financial innovation is sorely needed. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42409833,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPyRY,1692795600,Blockchain Security Firm Quantstamp Hopes to Battle Flash Loan Attacks With New Service,"Blockchain security platform Quantstamp is hoping to quell the increasing threats of flash loan attacks with a new service that claims to catch exploits before they go off, the company told CoinDesk.  The Economic Exploit Analysis service detects common attack pathways used by exploiters through automated tooling before protocols get hacked. The service has been released in collaboration with researchers from the University of Toronto.  In the first half of 2023 alone, an estimated $207 million worth of tokens were stolen through flash loan attacks.  A flash loan is an uncollateralized loan provided by a smart contract that can be taken out for as short as a single transaction. In these attacks, hackers leverage flash loans to borrow substantial funds and manipulate DeFi protocols into unexpected states that developers may not have anticipated.  Flash loan attacks can drain the entire total value locked (TVL) of a DeFi protocol, and their complicated nature combined with DeFi’s composability means these attacks often evade conventional audits.  “DeFi has the potential to change the global financial infrastructure for the better, but its success requires preempting threats like flash loan attacks. We developed this tool to provide DeFi protocols an extra layer of security on top of audits,” said Martin Derka, head of new initiatives at Quantstamp, in a note to CoinDesk. “As DeFi evolves, security measures need to evolve with it. Services like Economic Exploit Analysis give us an edge against hackers.”  The Quantstamp service is available for both deployed and undeployed protocols.

16434875,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548540,1692793839,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits New All-Time High As BTC Price Moves Sideways,"Bitcoin price has been trading sideways in the past weeks, significantly declining from the $29,000 support. This bearish pattern spread panic among traders but has not deterred miners. Instead, Bitcoin mining participants appear to have increased. This is evident in the increased mining difficulty, which soared to a new record high. According to available data, Bitcoin mining difficulty surged 6.17% in the last week, alongside a spike in network activity on August 22. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Spikes Up Amid Nosediving Prices While BTC price tanked by over 10% in a 7-day period, miners’ confidence remains at its peak. According to data from btc.com, this uptick marks the sixth-largest increase in Bitcoin mining difficulty in 2023. For context, Bitcoin mining difficulty measures the difficulty and time it takes to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. Related Reading: AVAX Network Activity Down – Will The Planned Token Unlock Bring Back The Energy? The Bitcoin network adjusts mining difficulty periodically depending on the number of miners onboard. The next difficulty adjustment date is about two weeks aways, with the estimated rate at 16.05%. Furthermore, the hash rate increases as more miners compete for limited Bitcoin block rewards, increasing mining difficulty. Therefore, the uptick in mining difficulty suggests Bitcoin’s bearish price trajectory has not affected miners’ profitability. Increase In Hash Rates Reflects High Investor Confidence In Bitcoin Hash rate and mining difficulty correlate; therefore, as the Bitcoin mining difficulty increases, the hash rate follows a similar trend. Although calculating the hash rate is tricky and challenging, the ongoing figure is about to break the existing record high of 538.05 EH/s. In an August 22 report: CryptoQuant analyst MAC_D attributed the increased hash rate to high confidence in BTC and ETH network reliability and security among investors. MAC-D wrote: Recently the prices of BTC and ETH have fallen by 10%. However, the network security and reliability have increased. He also identified two plausible reasons behind the uptick in the hash rate. Firstly, the analyst explained that Bitcoin’s hash rate increased during the recent price decline. He said the observation depicts that miners became more active amid the downtrend. Secondly, MAC_D mentioned that staked ETH has increased despite the decline in Ether price. Nonetheless, the analyst believes the fall in price suggests BTC and ETH have become undervalued. And according to him, this presents an opportunity for bullish investors to accumulate more assets in anticipation of the next bull run. This assumption must have prompted miners to increase their mining capacity, increasing the hash rate and difficulty. And data from the on-chain analytics platform Glassnode supports these claims. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Analysis: Key Price Levels And Metrics To Watch According to Glassnode data, there has been a slight increase in the number of BTC in the portfolios of mining firms. As of August 22, miners’ BTC holdings hovered over 1.83 million Bitcoin. This figure represents a 0.08% increase from the value at the beginning of August.

42409853,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPz1v,1692792895,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hovers Below $26K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, dropped just below the $26,000 mark on Wednesday after trading in a tight range over the past 24 hours and hitting a weekly low of $25,500. The cryptocurrency rebounded slightly from the low, but remains down 9% over the last seven days as markets await developments from the central bankers’ meeting at Jackson Hole on Friday. “It is possible that any semblance of dovishness from Jay Powell on Friday could help inspire a recovery. Beyond that, we also have a potential ruling in the Grayscale case to look forward to,"" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote in a note. Farrell said he thinks the market is closer to a local bottom rather than top, given the absence of industry-specific catalysts and a decline in liquidity.  BNB, a cryptocurrency closely linked to Binance, fell to its lowest in more than a year after a report regarding fresh risks over Russia sanctions added to already mounting regulatory and legal pressure on the crypto exchange. The token sank to as low as $204 on Tuesday afternoon, its weakest level since June 2022's crypto market crash. It's since pared some of those losses, currently changing hands at $214, down about 7% over the past week. This latest decline happened after the Wall Street Journal reported that Binance was facilitating Russian users' ability to move money abroad despite widespread international sanctions.  Australia will not be making any decision on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for some years due to several unresolved issues that surfaced at the end of the pilot project, the country's central bank announced on Wednesday. ""Given the many issues that are yet to be resolved, any decision on a CBDC in Australia is likely to be some years away,"" the report said, with the caveat that the project did not set out to provide a complete assessment of the costs, benefits, risks and other implications of introducing a CBDC. ""Instead, it was more narrowly focused on exploring how a CBDC could be used by industry to enhance the functioning of the payments system.""  Chart of the day  The chart shows daily changes in prices for BNB, a cryptocurrency closely tied to the digital assets exchange Binance.  Prices have recently tanked amid growing regulatory scrutiny and investor concerns about a distressed BNB-backed loan, nearing key support level at $200.  A potential break below $200 might prove costly as the next major price floor is seen directly at $130.

The ETH/BTC pair chart suggests that Ether is in a favorable position to outperform Bitcoin. Ether has formed a potential five-wave structure, indicating a solid long setup and the potential for higher prices. Produced by Ryan Wilday with Avi Gilburt and Jason Appel With this article, I wanted to follow Jason's article , 'Where's Bitcoin Going in the Second Half of 2023?'. However, I will discuss where Ethereum (ETH-USD) is going in the coming months. Jason discussed how the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) market has ignored a plethora of bad news, yet has marched steadily upward. At its peak in July, it reached just over a 100% return from its November 2022 low. How many assets and indices can claim the same? Ether is in a similar state to Bitcoin, but a couple of indications suggest it can outperform Bitcoin with respect to return during the rest of 2023. In the background, the altcoin market is quite weak. Even our ""favored"" altcoins project lower before they are likely to reverse. Ether is often considered a bellwether for the altcoin market. But Ether is unique among altcoins, in that it has followed Bitcoin to new all-time highs with each major cycle. Of all altcoins, 99.99% have not been able to make new all-time highs in their second major cycle. Ether's correlation to Bitcoin is quite high, whereas other altcoins only correlate to Bitcoin during the later stages of each cycle. Ether should be considered unique among altcoins as an investible asset. Most altcoins are just trades, in our experience. Lastly, before I get to the crux of this article, I remind you that we are traders at heart. We give levels in our articles that show where our view changes. These levels should not be confused for statements that something can go up or down. That is true, an asset can go either up or down in price, but our levels more tactically important. We recognize that no trader can win 100% of their trades. We use our levels to define the risk-to-reward of our trades. If the levels discussed are breached, our view changes, and likely our position. Ether's Higher Low The year 2022 was brutal for crypto. As Bitcoin fell from $65K in November 2021, it ushered in a year-long downtrend that dropped 77% from Bitcoin's value into its low of $15,500 in November 2022. Ether had a similarly difficult year, dropping nearly 82%. However, Ether halted its drop in June 2022. While Bitcoin was putting in a lower low in November 2022, Ether held a low that was 22% higher than its June low. This was an early hint that the entire crypto market would start to turn higher. However, more importantly, this divergence was an indication that Ether was ready to outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Daily (Motivewave Software) ETH/BTC The second indication that Ether should continue to outperform Bitcoin is the ETH/BTC pair chart. This chart, similar to a Forex pair can be used as the price of Ether in Bitcoin basis, or the price or Ether price in the US dollar, divided by Bitcoin's price in dollars. Since Ether's high low in November 2022, this pair has been in a downtrend. That is to say, Bitcoin caught up to Ether since the November low. However, zoomed out, I have this pair coming into a very important support at 0.055 with the multi-year target in the 0.10 region. As ETH/BTC is much closer to this support level than the ultimate target, the risk-to-reward favors Ether in swing trade. While I personally favor Bitcoin as a long-term investment which I hold in cold wallets, my swing trading accounts slightly favor the accumulation of Ether. Zoomed out on both charts, my target for Bitcoin in the current cycle is $125K, as long as Bitcoin trades over $18K. My target for Ether is nominally $10.5K for Ethereum. That isn't a perfect 0.10 relationship, but it takes only a small variation for there to be such a relationship. ETHBTC 1D chart (Motivewave Software) The Next Few Months Jason focused on the next few months in Bitcoin while I zoomed you out to the big picture for Ether, as outperformance is most likely to be evident over many months. Now I want to zoom us in, as Ether has a very similar setup to Bitcoin. That is natural, as the two often show such setups in tandem. Off of its very important November low, Ether has formed a potential five wave structure. This structure can be interpreted as wave 1 of a C wave, or the first of a third in impulse. Ether is a solid long setup. The difference between the two is that the former reflects the potential that the move off the 2018 low has been a diagonal, not an impulse. The reality is the 5 year bull market shows characteristics of both. So I am tracking both potentials. Regardless of how one sees structure in the macro sense, five waves off the November gives us support at $1250, the .764 retrace of said five waves. In micro, the large drop on August 17th is viewed as wave-iii of © of circle-ii. Resistance for wave-iv is $1700. A sustained move over that level would be the first indication the bottom may be in. But as long as $1700 holds, I expect a final drop to $1470. The target for this setup is dependent on where the final bottom lies. But based on a bottom at $1470, this setup can take Ether to between $4700 and $5600 before a larger pullback. Ethereum, 6H chart (Motivewave Software) Tactically speaking, I am slowly scaling into this drop. I will avoid taking aggressive positions until a reversal is evident. Provided an impulsive reversal shows, a swing trade in Ether will be the backbone of my crypto trades in the latter months of 2023. Note that if Ether sustains under $1250 the next support levels below are $675 and $300. So that would preclude holding aggressive long positions. Conclusion In this article, I have discussed how Ether should be a higher performer. This applies in the immediate swing setup, forming with support at $1250 and a target of $4600+. Ether should also outperform Bitcoin into the latter days of 2023. It started to run ahead of Bitcoin in November 2022. The ETH/BTC is due for an important reversal, which should propel Ether's performance above Bitcoin's. Finally, my cyclical targets for Bitcoin and Ether suggest Ether is due for outperformance. As always, this can change at any time, but I have expressed what levels must be maintained for this to continue-and I discussed my personal tactics for capturing this potential.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4630343-ethereum-is-set-up-to-outrun-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/16433898.jpeg

16433833,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/yuga-labs-to-end-support-for-openseas-seaport-protocol-from-2024,1692791880,Yuga Labs To End Support For OpenSea’s Seaport Protocol From 2024,"Yuga Labs, the creators of the hugely popular NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), have announced they will be removing support for OpenSea’s Seaport Protocol from February 2024. OpenSea has made over $100 million in fees from collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club, BAKC, Mutant Apes, and other prominent NFT collections. Yuga Labs To Block OpenSea Yuga Lab’s decision to block OpenSea comes after OpenSea announced its decision to disable mandatory royalties for existing collections. OpenSea announced a slew of changes in a blog post published on the 17th of August. OpenSea had stated in its update, “We launched our Operator Filter so creators could restrict secondary sales to web3 marketplaces that enforce creator fees. But we relied on opt-in by the entire ecosystem, which didn’t happen. So we’re making a few changes to our approach to creator fees. Starting on Thursday, the 31st of August, 2023, we’re moving to optional creator fees on OpenSea in an effort to better reflect the principles of choice and ownership that drive this decentralized ecosystem.” Yuga Lab’s collections on OpenSea comprise nearly $5 billion worth of all-time traded value. Out of this, the Bored Ape Yacht Club alone has generated around $2 billion. The announcement makes Yuga Labs the latest NFT project to come out in opposition to OpenSea’s controversial decision. Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre, stated in a post on X, “Yuga Labs will begin the process of sunsetting support for OpenSea’s SeaPort for all upgradable contracts and any new collections, with the aim of this being complete in February 2024 in tandem with OpenSea’s approach. “For as much as NFTs have been about users truly owning their digital assets, they’ve also been about empowering creators. Yuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work.” A spokesperson for Yuga Labs stated that the company would be moving towards disallowing OpenSea’s marketplace to trade any of its collections as they phase out royalties. Move Panned By NFT Community OpenSea’s sudden move has, not surprisingly, angered the NFT and digital art communities, with artists expressing their anger and disbelief at the decision. They have also criticized OpenSea’s lack of respect and appreciation for the creators from whom it had profited off for years. One of the most prominent investors in OpenSea, Mark Cuban, has also criticized the move, posting on X. “Not collecting and paying royalties on NFT sales is a HUGE mistake by OpenSea. It diminished trust in the platform and hurts the industry.” The company has also changed its OpenSea Pro fee structure and will be levying a 0.5% fee on listings and offers on the platform starting the 31st of August. At present, the 0.5% listing fee is only applicable in specific instances where the creator royalty is set to below 0.5% or if the collection does not meet specified thresholds. The move could drive users to Blur, which recently surpassed OpenSea as the leading NFT marketplace by trading volume. Collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks play a crucial role in contributing to the success of NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea. According to data from Ninjalerts, Yuga Lab’s 30-day trading volume is 80% of the size of OpenSea’s at $52.8 million. Meanwhile, OpenSea’s 30-day volume is around $66.7 million. “Yuga’s 30d volume is 80% the size of OpenSea’s. This is the leverage that IP has over NFT Marketplaces. The NFT Marketplaces are dead without the most important IP Will this lead to walled garden marketplaces by IP owners? That’s much more complicated, so I’m not sure. Distributors can also create walled gardens. Is there any upside for OpenSea to work as an “Authorized Reseller” that maintains royalties for the top IP? Probably? It will be very difficult for these IP creators to make good marketplaces.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Circuit Court of Appeals was expected to give a ruling on Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 22 following its failure to do so on August 18. However, the crypto community would have to wait longer as the court has once again failed to make a decision. Court Delays Spot Bitcoin ETF Decision For The Third Time According to a tweet by Grayscale’s Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm, the appeal court failed to make a decision regarding his company’s lawsuit against the SEC. However, he pointed out that there were no rulings for that day in what might be a move to quench any notion that the court was intentionally stalling the case. Related Reading: Rumors Of Robinhood Listing XRP Take Center Stage On Crypto Twitter This marks the third delay of the much-anticipated verdict, as the court had previously been expected to give a decision on August 15 and then August 18. So it remains uncertain when a decision could come next as legal experts had earlier projected the court to give its verdict this month. Grayscale’s lawsuit against the SEC dates back to last year when the company reportedly tried to persuade the Commission to convert its $20 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a Spot Bitcoin ETF, which the SEC rejected. Following the rejection, Grayscale sued the regulator, arguing that it had acted indiscriminately by not giving its request the same treatment it does to similar investment funds. Grayscale believes that Spot Bitcoin ETFs should be approved like Bitcoin futures ETFs. In its final oral argument in March, the crypto firm argued that the SEC’s disapproval order against it was contradictory. It emphasized the regulator’s inconsistency in denying a Spot Bitcoin ETF while approving a Bitcoin futures ETF. The company further argued that both investment vehicles pose the same risk of fraud and manipulation. It also stated that the pricing of both futures and spot bitcoin markets are “99.9% correlated,” which means they are subject to the same risk. As such, since the SEC found the CME’s surveillance sharing agreement sufficient enough to protect against the risks in the futures market, it should be able to deem it sufficient to approve Spot Bitcoin ETFs. BTC struggles to hold bears at bay | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Why Grayscale’s Case Could Be A Game Changer Grayscale is one of several financial firms that have applied to the SEC to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Interestingly, the company filed this application while it awaits a decision from the court regarding its lawsuit against the SEC. Related Reading: Is Binance Really Selling Bitcoin To Prop The Price Of BNB? However, considering that the SEC has remained reluctant to approve these applications, a verdict in favor of Grayscale could potentially force the hands of the Commission to finally approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Such a verdict will undoubtedly be a boost for the crypto industry as it would pave the way for institutional investors to have direct access to crypto assets, something which could further spur the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.

CBDCs are digital currencies backed by national central banks, and have caught Citibank's attention due to their promise for quicker and more efficient settlements for securities firms. With securities transactions being a critical pillar of the global financial system, any improvement in settlement speed can have profound implications. CBDCs can potentially minimise delays, reduce costs, and mitigate the risks associated with traditional settlement methods. Citibank recognises the potential of CBDCs to transform not just securities but other facets of banking as well. Its move resonates with a broader trend where financial institutions globally are turning their attention to digital currencies, particularly CBDCs, to streamline operations and enhance customer experiences. However, while the prospects of CBDCs are promising, their full-scale implementation in securities settlements demands meticulous planning. Ensuring interoperability with existing systems, regulatory harmony, and the technological infrastructure to support vast transaction volumes are some areas that require thorough attention. Opinion The Citibank survey highlights some of the perceived advantages of a central bank being able to wield its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Of course, what wouldn’t be a quicker settlement process than what already exists? The survey findings point to institutions turning to CBDCs as well as other digital currencies in order to improve their overall capabilities. However, the key with alternative digital currencies will be whether institutions will be allowed a choice. Global financial bodies and regulatory agencies are at last acknowledging the innovations brought to finance by cryptocurrencies, but this is always overshadowed by their perceived ‘risks’ to the financial and banking system. It needs to be made very clear. The only chance for the existing system, at least as far as governments and central banks are concerned, is a widespread implementation of CBDCs. Only with this kind of control will central banks be able to impose any kind of financial stricture they desire upon the citizenry. The total control this would bestow to a central bank would allow it to ‘switch off’ from the system any individuals who do not follow the bank’s rules. Many who might see this would perhaps think that this is a fantastical and dystopian future that can only be read about in science fiction books. Nevertheless, it can be seen that China has a social credit system already in place that allows the government to blacklist and punish individuals who do not toe the line. Given the unbelievably disastrous state of all fiat-based economies across the world, total control of finances by governments and their central banks must be put in place to extract the last wealth of the people in order to prolong the fiat monetary system.

42409878,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQDaa,1692787801,Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Uptick Fails to Inspire Bullish Positioning in ETH Options,"Ether puts expiring in both the short and long terms continue to trade at a premium relative to calls, indicating persistent speculation of a price decline.  Bitcoin options are maintaining a long-term bullish bias.  The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio rose more than 2% last week, contrasting with its record of taking losses during bouts of risk aversion.  Still, options data tracked by Amberdata show a stronger bearish outlook for ether, with traders hedging against potential price weakness over the one-week, one-, two-, three- and six-month timeframes. Meanwhile, traders remain bullish on bitcoin over the long run.  The short-term and long-term ether call-put skews, which measure the implied volatility premium for calls relative to puts, hovered well below zero at press time. That's a sign of relatively higher prices for puts, the options used to protect against price drops.  Puts are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, while a call buyer is bullish.  In bitcoin's case, the one-week, one- and two-month skews show a bias for puts, while the rest show preference for calls.  The persistent bias for long-term BTC calls perhaps stems from the belief that the top cryptocurrency would be the first beneficiary of an eventual positive flip in the macroeconomic environment.  ""BTC continues to be 'the' macro asset for the crypto market and could also see some strong inflows as the macro environment shifts,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said. ""Many large investors will continue to prefer BTC exposure for its liquidity, market cap, and relative stability. So, we could see some ETH outperformance on the ETF narrative, but BTC could again outperform once macro investor funds start to take crypto positions.""  Besides, bitcoin is set to undergo its fourth mining reward halving early next year. Historically, the programmed halving of the pace of supply expansion has paved the way for major bull runs.  Both bitcoin and ether took a beating last week, with the former falling over 10% while the latter lost around 8%, CoinDesk data show. Analysts attributed ether's outperformance to several factors, including expectations for a launch of ETH futures-based exchange-traded funds and hedging activity of market makers.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/23/ether-bitcoin-ratio-uptick-fails-to-inspire-bullish-positioning-in-eth-options,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1820368dbf46cb6d80d46f9a07c9d96d2966155-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16430186,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548528,1692785438,Elon Musk’s Latest Tweet Boosts Dogecoin By 4%: Is It Time To Buy DOGE?,"Once again, the crypto world is abuzz today with another unexpected movement in Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price, thanks to a tweet from the iconic Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. This has become a consistent phenomenon, where virtually every Elon Musk tweet hinting at or referencing Dogecoin prompts a flurry of activity from DOGE enthusiasts, regardless of the subtlety or directness of the tweet’s content. This morning, the catalyst for the sudden upswing in DOGE’s value was a simple tweet from Musk. He shared a logo animation of the “X” logo, created by one of Twitter’s most renowned DOGE influencers, @DogeDesigner. Interestingly, Musk shared the video without comment, only tagging DogeDesigner as the creator of the video. Nonetheless, this nod was enough to stimulate DOGE bulls into driving up the cryptocurrency’s price by an impressive 4%. Another Elon Musk $DOGE pump! #Dogecoin is up 4% because of this tweet from Musk. * From: DogeDesigner @cb_doge https://t.co/IN4dk8q3jN — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) August 23, 2023 Dogecoin Price Analysis Yet, it’s critical to delve deeper into the charts for a more holistic view. Before Musk’s tweet, DOGE faced resistance just shy of the 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart. As we’ve seen in the past, such sudden pumps can be ephemeral. At press time, Dogecoin was already giving back some of its gains, standing at a mere 2% increase from the pre-tweet levels. Nevertheless, the effects of the tweet on the DOGE chart cannot be overlooked. The 4-hour chart reveals that Dogecoin surpassed the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level due to Musk’s stimulus. The onus is now on DOGE enthusiasts to maintain the momentum and hold above the $0.0626 price point. If achieved, there’s potential for DOGE to rally towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement mark at $0.666. That said, investors should brace for considerable selling pressure, especially at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which stands at $0.0732. Related Reading: Dogecoin Proof Of Stake Discussion Heats Up As Lead Dev Chimes In Looking at the higher timeframe, the 1-day chart paints a more somber picture for DOGE. Despite Musk’s latest tweet, Dogecoin remains ensnared in a persistent downtrend. This downtrend, defined by a descending trend channel, has been unwavering since December of the previous year. Recalling recent events, DOGE faced a rejection at this channel’s upper trendline in late July and has been on a steady southward trajectory ever since. Alarmingly, key support levels provided by the 200-day EMA and other significant moving averages have been breached. Related Reading: Dogecoin Power Play: Robinhood Faces $16 Million Whale Exodus – Details Given the present chart patterns, there’s a looming possibility of DOGE revisiting its yearly low at $0.05593. In a worst-case scenario, a slide to the descending channel’s lower boundary at $0.053 might be on the cards. However, should DOGE staunchly defend this key price level, it could signal an enticing entry point for prospective investors. For any meaningful recovery, it will be imperative for DOGE to swiftly rebound from this low, ideally targeting levels above $0.058.

BlockFi has claimed that, by its estimates, legal battles with FTX and Three Arrows Capital could cost its customers up to $1 billion. BlockFi Looks To Stop FTX And 3AC Repayment BlockFi claimed in a 21st August filing at the New Jersey bankruptcy court that its own creditors must not be pushed to the back of the line because FTX’s creditors were harmed thanks to the exchange allegedly misappropriating the $5 billion that BlockFi had initially lent it. In an attempt to safeguard the interest of its creditors, BlockFi has stated it will actively look to block attempts by FTX and Three Arrows Capital to claw back billions to pay off their own creditors. The crypto lender argued that its bankruptcy directly resulted from the fraud perpetrated by FTX and 3AC. BlockFi stated in its filing, “FTX seeks to recover on over $5 billion of claims filed against the BlockFi estates at the direct expense of the ultimate victims of FTX’s fraud: BlockFi’s clients and other legitimate creditors. To prevent further injustice to the creditors of BlockFi’s estates, the Court should disallow the FTX Claims under the doctrine of unclean hands.” FTX had also given $400 million to BlockFi in June 2022 in an attempt to remedy the situation. This was in addition to purchasing BlockFi equity pursuant to a loan agreement, the filing added. However, BlockFi has stated that this was not a standard loan agreement. Instead, the crypto lender has stated that it was an unsecured, 5-year term which was also well below market rates. It further added that repayments were not due until the firm would supposedly mature. BlockFi called FTX’s investment a gamble, one that BlockFi’s creditors should not be held liable for. BlockFi stated in its argument, “Just because FTX’s fraudulent actions caused FTX’s bet to fail does not mean BlockFi’s creditors are now somehow liable to refund the purchase price.” BlockFi Owes Billions To Creditors Several estimates have shown that BlockFi reportedly owes up to $10 billion to over 100,000 creditors. This figure includes $1 billion to three of its largest creditors and $220 million to bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Three Arrows Capital’s creditors have reportedly expressed considerable frustration with the slow pace of bankruptcy proceedings. BlockFi has argued that Three Arrows Capital, like FTX, was not entitled to repayment and claimed that the crypto hedge fund used fraudulent means to borrow the funds. Three Arrows Capital had previously taken loans from BlockFi, on which it subsequently defaulted. This led to the foreclosure on the collateral, leading to what liquidators have described as a $220 million preferential payment to BlockFi. BlockFi’s creditors have also accused the company of ignoring several warnings and red flags when dealing with FTX and its sister concern Alameda Research, just months prior to the FTX collapse. The creditors claimed that the CEO of BlockFi ignored advice from BlockFi’s risk management team, which had stated that Alameda Research’s balance sheet primarily consisted of FTX’s own FTT token. However, the CEO dismissed such concerns and urged the risk management team to get comfortable with Alameda Research being a borrower similar to Three Arrows Capital. “As early as August 2021, BlockFi’s risk management team was advised that Alameda’s balance sheet was largely comprised of ‘~7bb unlocked FTT and 11bb total including locked tokens based on unaudited financials. This set off alarms at BlockFi. Mr. Prince dismissed the concerns, urging the risk team to learn to ‘get comfortable [with Alameda] being a three arrows size borrower, just with FTT and other collateral types instead of GBTC shares.” However, BlockFi’s creditors settled with the company last month on moving ahead with a repayment plan. BlockFi collapsed just weeks after FTX, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on the 28th of November. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The FTX founder was making an appearance in court after spending ten days in jail and also raised complaints about the food being served in jail. SBF Pleads Not Guilty To New Fraud And Conspiracy Charges The new charges, all related to fraud and conspiracy, were handed down on the 14th of August after prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried had used over $100 million of stolen customer funds and assets to donate to electoral candidates and politicians. The court had revoked his earlier bail after the United States Department of Justice alleged that the former CEO had repeatedly tried to influence witnesses and interfere with a fair trial through public shaming and harassment. This was Bankman-Fried’s first court appearance since his bail was revoked on the 11th of August. Since then, SBF has been in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn. According to data from the Federal Election Commission, Bankman-Fried had reportedly given over $40 million in political donations in 2022. Other big donors from Bankman-Fried’s circle included Ryan Salame, former co-CEO, and Nishad Singh, the former director of engineering at FTX. Federal Election Commission data showed that Salame had donated over $23 million almost exclusively to Republican candidates and related PACs. Meanwhile, Nishad Singh had given around $8 million during the 2022 midterm election cycle. Complaints About Jail Food During his hearing, lawyers representing SBF informed the federal court that jail authorities had failed to provide him with a vegan diet as he had requested. Mark Cohen, the lawyer representing the former billionaire, stated that the lack of adequate food at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Centre was hampering Bankman-Fried’s preparations for his trial, which is set to begin in October. Mr. Cohen also told the court that his client was not provided with the attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) drug Adderall. He also added that his client’s supply of Emsam, used to treat depression, was running low. Judge Sarah Netburn assured Mr. Cohen that she would ask the United States Justice Department’s Bureau of Prisons, which is in charge of running the jail, to address concerns related to SBF’s medication. She added that while she was reasonably confident that the prison offered vegetarian food, she was unsure if vegan food was available. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Prisons released a statement saying all inmates had access to appropriate medicines, healthcare, and hot meals. It further added that the facility ensures the provision of nutritionally healthy meals and follows the requirements of a national menu that is analyzed to ensure all dietary requirements are met. Following the hearing, Bankman-Fried sought support from his mother, speaking to her at length. “After the hearing, Bankman-Fried spoke to his mother, Stanford Law School Professor Barbara Fried, across the low partition between the courtroom well and the galley.” Preparations Underway For October Trial Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried and his legal team are working hard in preparation for his trial, set to begin in October. Lawyers representing SBF had even requested that he be allowed to stay out of jail on weekdays, arguing that this would allow them to focus on building a defense for the disgraced FTX founder. The judge refused to grant this request. However, on the 22nd of August, Bankman-Fried was granted a short release from prison from 8:30 am to 3 pm. During his release, he was present in a supervised courtroom with his lawyers as they prepared for the upcoming trial. Meanwhile, the jury has also been issued guidelines by prosecutors on how to approach the trial. According to the guideline, the jury has to treat each of the seven charges differently. They were also requested not to let their verdict on one charge influence their decision on any of the other six charges. FTX was the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, valued at around $32 billion. However, its bankruptcy sent shockwaves through the crypto and financial world and impacted several projects.

Beyond High Beta Equity And FTX,"Summary Traditional finance had two dominant perspectives on cryptoassets as 2022 drew to a close. Some saw bitcoin and the like as merely stand-ins for high beta equity market exposure. The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and other equity market indices has shifted conclusively from positive to negative in 2023. Whatever the cryptocurrency narrative was following last year’s bear market, the negative correlation between Bitcoin and equities debunks the premise that crypto is nothing more than high beta equity exposure. Introduction Traditional finance had two dominant perspectives on cryptoassets as 2022 drew to a close. Some saw bitcoin and the like as merely stand-ins for high beta equity market exposure. Others believed that FTX-related reputational damage had rendered the asset class toxic and uninvestable for the foreseeable future if not for all time. But crypto’s performance in the first half of 2023 has proven the lie to both these characterizations and revealed an asset class with resilience. Simplistic Narratives Conceal the Value The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and other equity market indices has shifted conclusively from positive to negative in 2023. This confirms what we should have already known. Bitcoin and equities are fundamentally different assets. Yes, both are influenced by central bank liquidity. But unlike equities, Bitcoin is not so dependent on the whims of the larger economy. It has no dividend payments, income, or yields but functions instead as a pure store of value and an alternative monetary system. As such, the perception of Bitcoin as high beta equity is overly simplistic and ignores its underlying value. Bitcoin and Equity Markets Are Uncorrelated Glassnode and Sound Money Capital Cyclical Cleanse Cycle Complete The recent FTX-inspired crypto bear market served its purpose: It flushed out the speculative traders, liquidated leverage, and forced the weak miners to capitulate. As a result, long-term crypto investors consolidated their Bitcoin holdings. These are not bubble chasers or “dumb” money; they are investors who understand the technology and are less prone to panic selling. Percentage of Bitcoins Held by Long-Term Investors Tends to Rise in Equity Bear Markets Glassnode and Sound Money Capital This cleansing process is typical of Bitcoin bear markets. As the speculators pull back, the currency’s internal fundamentals rather than global activity and risk appetite drive its price movements. This has helped sever the correlation between Bitcoin and the equity markets. Allergic Reaction? Look Closer The FTX debacle led many conventional investors and regulators to question crypto’s legitimacy. Many long-time skeptics were convinced that vindication had finally arrived. But investment decisions should not be based on sentiment and perception — unless we are using them as contra-indicators. Rather than initiating a crypto death spiral, the FTX collapse triggered something more akin to an allergic reaction in the investment world. This called for analysis and examination not knee-jerk reactions. Those that looked deeper benefited as Bitcoin has rallied more than 80% since. Indeed, given the headwinds and the added regulatory challenges, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other decentralized applications have held up extraordinarily well amid extreme volatility. Now even BlackRock is taking a closer look. BlackRock Reduces the Reputational Risk of Crypto Allocations BlackRock’s recent SEC application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) demonstrates that the cryptocurrency market isn’t going anywhere and that the most prestigious investors recognize its potential. Whether it receives approval or not, the world’s largest asset manager is knocking on the SEC’s door. Sooner or later, a spot Bitcoin ETF will launch and another avenue for institutional crypto allocation will open up. FTX cost a lot of investors a lot of money and many VCs were burned by the experience. As a result, reputational risk became a key motivator, or de-motivator, in crypto-related investment decisions. The thinking among managers went something along the lines of, “No one will take me seriously if I mention crypto. I could even lose my job. It isn’t worth the risk.” But with BlackRock’s potential entry into the sector, this narrative could reverse. Under the reputational cover of the world’s largest asset manager, a fiduciary obligation may emerge to consider allocation. Perhaps market participants can now focus on crypto’s use cases rather than the noise. The Use Cases As the crypto market burned off its speculative froth, the value of these assets revealed itself: Properly secured crypto assets provide a hedge against the inherent challenges and shortcomings of the conventional financial system. During the 2022 banking crisis, for example, many depositors stared down the threat of near-total capital loss as banks struggled to cover deposits. But such illiquidity risk is a constant with traditional banks: They are eternally reliant on central bank backstops to counter potential bank runs. Bitcoin holders are not. Sudden value dilution is another threat embedded in traditional financial systems. A centralized authority can always devalue a currency. To “solve” the 2023 banking crisis, for example, the FDIC and the US Federal Reserve stepped in to raise insurance limits and guarantee all deposits. Such actions undermine the dollar’s value relative to real assets over time. Indeed, the bias towards fiscal and monetary expansion in traditional financial markets may help explain Bitcoin’s remarkable 70% annualized returns since 2015. The Next Stage of the Crypto-Adoption Cycle Whatever the cryptocurrency narrative was following last year’s bear market, the negative correlation between Bitcoin and equities debunks the premise that crypto is nothing more than high beta equity exposure. The subsequent winnowing process within the crypto market has renewed the focus on internal fundamentals. But as investors struggle to value cryptoassets and crypto technology more generally, volatility will remain. The pace and precise direction of crypto’s adoption cycle is uncertain and hard to predict. That’s why investors should heed last year’s lessons and look beyond initial reactions and media narratives and seek to understand the underlying technology and its potential uses. Next Bitcoin Halving: May 2024 Sound Money Capital BlackRock’s interest in a Bitcoin ETF is not an outlier. Crypto’s integration into conventional finance and portfolio allocation will only gather speed in the months and years ahead. There will always be skeptics. But amid changing dynamics and greater institutional interest, the value proposition is becoming clearer. As Bitcoin’s supply growth is cut in half in May 2024, a more exuberant phase of the crypto adoption cycle will likely commence again.

42409868,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQD3W,1692777413,Thailand’s New Pro-Crypto Prime Minister Was an Active Crypto Investor,"Real estate developer Srettha Thavisin has been appointed the next Prime Minister of Thailand as the Pheu Thai takes control of the country after a controversial election.  Prior to a life in politics, Srettha was the CEO of real estate developer Sansiri which was an active participant in the country’s digital asset sector. In 2021, Sansiri took a 15% stake in Thailand-based digital asset service provider XSpring, which operates a crypto broker in conjunction with Krungthai Bank as well as a licensed ICO portal.  A year later, Sansiri launched its “SiriHub Token” on XSpring, a REIT-like structure that provides dividends from Sansiri Campus, one of the company’s major developments.  A national airdrop  Central to Srettha’s campaign has been a promise for a national ‘airdrop’, where every Thai citizen will receive 10,000 thai baht ($300).  The 10,000 baht (THB) would be given to every Thai citizen 16 years and over, and can only be spent within four-kilometers of their home, a party spokesperson explained to the Bangkok Post.  The airdrop will use a form of national token, not an existing digital asset or cryptocurrency. Vendors will be able to convert it to cash at designated banks.  This project has had its share of critics because of the sheer cost, estimated to be at 500 billion THB ($14.3 billion) and the use of blockchain technology when there are existing digital banking initiatives already in use in Thailand.  “While I want to see an adoption of Blockchain here, using blockchain and tokens for this campaign is an overkill,” Udomsak Rakwongwan, the co-founder of FWX.finance, a decentralized derivatives platform, told CoinDesk. “The majority of Thais are already using Paotang, a digital banking wallet tailored for government initiatives. This may be simpler and easier to implement compared with a potentially more complex blockchain.”  Udomsak anticipates that the new administration will continue to put forward more lenient crypto regulation which will lead to a surge in Thai crypto projects.  “Thailand's crypto landscape is evolving rapidly,” he says, pointing to Sansiri’s involvement with ICOs.  Bipartisan crypto holdings  Although Srettha likely sees little in common with Pita Limjaroenrat, the leader of Thailand’s Move Forward Party, which won the popular vote but failed to get their leader nominated as Prime Minister, the two politicians are both fans of crypto.  As CoinDesk reported in July, Pita, disclosed that he owns bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and BNB.

16425216,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548508,1692776721,Bitcoin Market Analysis: Key Price Levels And Metrics To Watch,"As the Bitcoin market navigates the choppy waters around $26,000, there are several metrics to keep an eye on. After hitting a low of $25,374 yesterday, the bulls have managed to push the price back up, although the market remains in a vulnerable state following last Thursday’s price crash. Currently, the Fear and Greed Index for Bitcoin sits at 37, which is indicative of strong fear permeating the market. Typically, such a low level on this index suggests that market participants are apprehensive about the near-term future, often leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts where the selling pressure increases. An In-Depth Look At Bitcoin CVDs & Delta Renowned analyst Skew has highlighted the role of Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) in understanding the current market dynamics today. “BTC Aggregate CVDs & Delta reveal limit spot sellers here with shorts pushing for control.” This means that even as traders are looking to buy at market prices (takers), those willing to sell are setting limits, adding a ceiling to any short-term bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Chicken Game: Why Losing This Level Could Send BTC Back To $20,000 The specific price point to note here is $26,100. “This level has acted as a magnet for limit sellers,” Skew notes, “and is backed by the pattern seen in spot CVD versus price so far.” In other words, spot takers are being absorbed by limit sellers at this price, constraining upward movement. Perpetual CVD (Perp CVD) also deserves attention as it “moves lower in line with longs closing out and new shorts coming in.” This suggests that traders are not only covering their long positions but also opening new short positions, in line with the current bearish price action. Examining specific exchanges like Binance and Bybit gives further granularity to the analysis. According to Skew, “Longs got rinsed in that sweep below $25,800, thereby marking that level as a key pivot point.” Open Interest (OI) on Binance saw a reduction of 6,000 BTC, and Bybit OI was down by 3,000 BTC – all in long positions that were liquidated. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Show A Repeat Of The March Rebound? The liquidation of longs at these levels presents a clear risk for any bullish scenarios. “Clear risk for longs is below $25,800,” Skew asserts, making it an essential level to watch for traders who are net long. MacroCRG, a renowned market analyst, added to the analysis that large amount of longs were liquidated again during yesterday’s BTC dip: “More pain for #Bitcoin longs as another $300M+ of open interest was wiped out overnight by a downside sweep. When will it end?” However, there could be a silver lining, as Skew puts it: “Likely to see apes rage shorting this soon.” But so far, Bitcoin’s open interest (OI) remains flat after Thursday’s flush. OI currently stands at $10.88 billion (after being above $14 billion). BTC’s OI-weighted funding rate has already turned positive again at +0.0060. If the value turns negative for several days, as it did before the March 2023 rally, it could be a sign that a short squeeze is on the cards. However, after Thursday’s crash, the metric remained in negative territory only for a short time. BTC Short-Term Holders and Velocity On-chain specialist Axel Adler Jr. points out that the short-term Bitcoin holders (STH) cohort has decreased their holdings by a significant 400,000 BTC. This mass exodus has put considerable selling pressure on the market, rendering many STHs “underwater” and thereby less likely to engage in bullish behavior. Moreover, Adler emphasizes the BTC Velocity metric, stating, “At the beginning of this year, the BTC Velocity metric dropped to its minimum level.” This extremely low velocity indicates not just low volatility, but also a lack of market participant activity – a concerning sign for any imminent bullish turn. Therefore, Adler concludes: Taking into account these two factors, as well as the fact that the STH cohort has traditionally been the primary player creating volatility in the BTC market, recovery after this drop will require more time than usual and may take an indefinite period. At press time, BTC traded at $26,114.

16425384,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/balancer-discloses-critical-vulnerability-affecting-its-v2-pools,1692776711,Balancer Discloses Critical Vulnerability Affecting Its V2 Pools,"Liquidity protocol Balancer has disclosed that it has discovered a critical vulnerability that has impacted over 100 of its v2 pools spread across eight different blockchains. The team at Balancer has posted a list of the impacted pools on its GitHub page while also activating its emergency subDAO. Critical Vulnerability Discovered Balancer announced the discovery of the vulnerability in a post on X (formerly Twitter), stating that it had initiated emergency mitigation features. The protocol also urged users to withdraw funds from the impacted pools. “Balancer has received a critical vulnerability report affecting a number of V2 Pools. Emergency mitigation procedures have been executed to secure a majority of TVL, but some funds remain at risk. Users are advised to withdraw affected LPs immediately.” The protocol stated that the issue had been mitigated in about 80% of the impacted pools. Meanwhile, the remaining 20% of the impacted pools represented around 4% of Balancer’s total value locked (TVL). Balancer stated in its forum, “Balancer Labs received a report of a critical vulnerability affecting a number of pools. We were able to mitigate over 80% of these; the remaining funds at risk represent about 4% of Balancer TVL.” Funds Remain Safe The protocol also assured users that, at this point, the vulnerability had not been exploited, and all funds remained safe. Balancer added that pools labeled mitigated were safe but still urged users to migrate to safe pools or withdraw for the time being. The team also urged liquidity providers to exit their positions from impacted pools immediately. Jeff Bennett, a software engineer at Balancer Labs, said in a post, “We believe funds in the mitigated pools (labeled ‘mitigated’) are safe, but nevertheless strongly recommend timely migration to safe pools or withdrawal. Pools that could not be mitigated are labeled ‘at risk.’ If you are [a liquidity provider] in any of these pools, please exit immediately.” Users have heeded the warnings from the protocol following the discovery of the vulnerability. As a result of users withdrawing liquidity, the protocol’s total value locked dropped by nearly $100 million amidst the rush of withdrawals. Balancer has also stated that it would be conducting a thorough post-mortem of the vulnerability and would publish details about it and how it was addressed soon. This is not the first time Balancer has asked users to pull liquidity from its pools. In January, the protocol had advised liquidity providers to pull liquidity citing “ongoing issues. Balancer’s Native Token Registers Significant Drop The unfolding situation unsurprisingly had an immediate impact on the market. As a result of the discovery of the vulnerability, Balancer’s native BAL token registered a drop of over 4%. However, the value has recovered with the protocol moving swiftly to mitigate the vulnerability and communicate with users. Currently, the token is trading at around $3.51, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Spencer Hughes, a Blockworks Research Analyst, observed that the discovery of the Balancer vulnerability demonstrated the fact that smart contract audits cannot guarantee complete safety. However, he added that these audits never claimed to be a hundred percent foolproof. “With ~$830M TVL, a Balancer exploit would have left one of the most prominent DEXs for dead. Emergency SubDAOs are definitely very important for all DeFi protocols, and it is great that they were able to act before anything malicious could occur.” The Curve Hack While Balancer has moved fast to mitigate any potential damage, the DeFi space has been reeling from a spate of exploits. Recently, an exploit in the Curve Finance platform put over $100 million in crypto at risk, significantly amplifying concerns around the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. At the heart of the exploit was a re-entrancy bug that was found in Vyper, a programming language critical to Curve’s system. The vulnerability allowed hackers to drain several stablecoin pools on Curve, leading to a significant disruption of the price and liquidity of several DeFi services. Other major exploits in the DeFi space include the Ronin exploit, which saw the Ronin Network lose a staggering $622 million. The exploit was a result of a breach in the Ethereum sidechain. BadgerDAO also fell victim to hackers, losing around $80 million to hackers. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42409873,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQD6p,1692771803,"Australia's CBDC Likely Some Years Away, Central Bank Says","Australia will not be introducing a CBDC for some years due to several unresolved issues it found after a year-long research project.  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) conducted use case research around the payments system.  Australia will not be making any decision on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for some years due to several unresolved issues that surfaced at the end of the pilot project, the country's central bank announced on Wednesday.  ""Given the many issues that are yet to be resolved, any decision on a CBDC in Australia is likely to be some years away,"" the report said with the caveat that the project did not set out to provide a complete assessment of the costs, benefits, risks and other implications of introducing a CBDC. ""Instead, it was more narrowly focused on exploring how a CBDC could be used by industry to enhance the functioning of the payments system.""  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) started the research project last year. The DFCRC is a 180 million Australian dollar (US$124.3 million) program funded by industry partners, universities and the Australian Government. It was set up to research the opportunities arising from asset digitization and CBDC use cases.  The report said that in a way a ""CBDC could be viewed as an enabling complement to, rather than substitute for, private sector innovation.""  The findings revealed that an Australian CBDC could support offline electronic payments and ""enable 'smarter' payments"" or complex transactions which would be more economical and less risky. Other findings showed that the tokenization of assets on DLT platforms had several benefits. The report also said that there was potential for privately issued stablecoins that were fully backed by CBDC.  However, the report focused on the need for further research due to a range of legal, regulatory, technical and operational issues.  Cryptographic keys were required to perform actions on the pilot CBDC platform but finding affordable and adequately secure solutions for key management was a challenge for companies that did not have capability operating on other DLT networks, the report said.  The research also found that integrating a CBDC platform with industry use case applications was challenging and this has implications for potential deployment models.  Lawmakers and individuals across the world have been concerned about the potential surveillance aspects of CBDCs and the privacy question remained unanswered for Australia too.  ""The design decisions required to effectively support the variety of needs for privacy and data sharing are challenging, and the technologies to implement those requirements on a single CBDC platform are also complex, warranting further research,"" the report said.

This is probably a headwind that could suppress rallies.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell over 10% to $26,200 last week, its weekly worst performance since FTX fell apart in November.  With the sell-off, 88.3% of the supply controlled by short-term holders, or entities with wallets that do not hold coins for more than 155 days, is now in an unprofitable position with unrealized losses, according to data tracked by Glassnode.  In other words, of the 2.56 million bitcoin ($66.5 billion) held by short-term holders, around 2.26 million bitcoin have an acquisition cost higher than the going market rate.  This tends to happen following ""'top heavy markets' such as May 2021, Dec 2021, and again this week,"" Glassnode's weekly newsletter published on Monday said.  A top-heavy market is one that is likely to have a tough time chalking out gains – in this case, due to potential liquidation by short-term holders facing losses.  That's already happening. Per Glassnode, more coins held short-term are flowing into exchanges – something known as loss dominance. Investors typically move coins from personal wallets to exchanges when intending to liquidate position or use them as margin in derivatives trading.  ""This week, we saw the largest loss dominance reading since the March sell-off to $19,800. This suggests that the [short-term] cohort are both largely underwater on their holdings and increasingly price sensitive,"" Glassnode noted.  Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said the unrealized losses of short-term holders are one of the critical problems for the market right now.  ""The real problem is the current fragile market set-up for BTC, because short-term holders are underwater in both price and narrative,"" Solot said in an email.  ""Almost 90% of short-term holders (< 155 days) are suffering unrealized losses, which often correlates with selling pressure,"" Solot added, explaining that the recent optimism around prospects for U.S. approval of spot bitcoin ETFs has shifted to “still decent odds of approval but delayed"" amid rising bond yields and tighter liquidity conditions.

Currently oscillating between the $26,000 level and the $25,800 mark, it is edging closer to a crucial support level at $25,400. The significance of this threshold cannot be overstated for BTC bulls, as it holds the potential to halt the ongoing decline. Bitcoin Faces Crucial Levels, Analyst Warns Of Potential Dip Bitcoin finds itself at a critical juncture as it tests a crucial support level, according to renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez. The analyst points to the critical support level of $25,400, which serves as a make-or-break threshold for BTC bulls. Related Reading: By The Numbers: Deciphering XRP’s Lost Momentum Amid The SEC Lawsuit According to his analysis, a breakdown below this level could trigger further downside momentum, potentially leading to a dip to $22,650 or even $20,590. While cautioning about potential downside risks, Martinez also highlights a key resistance level that Bitcoin needs to overcome for a bullish trend reversal. The $28,830 mark emerges as a crucial hurdle that BTC must surpass to shift the market sentiment in favor of the bulls. A successful breakthrough above this resistance level could trigger renewed buying interest and potentially ignite a sustained upward move for Bitcoin. However, as depicted in the chart above, Bitcoin briefly lost its crucial $25,400 support on August 17, dipping below the $25,100 mark. The breach triggered an immediate response from Bitcoin bulls, leading to a swift recovery and reclaiming of the $26,000 level. Nevertheless, what is certain, is that BTC has struggled to consolidate above this line and continue its upward momentum. However, many market participants view this as a potential consolidation phase for Bitcoin, a pattern that has occurred historically after significant declines. These consolidation phases are often followed by a resumption of the bull run, as evidenced by previous instances. For instance, on March 11, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline from its first yearly high of $25,000, only to recover and conclude a one-month uptrend on April 14 at $30,900. Similarly, on June 14, after falling from its initial yearly high to the $25,000 mark once again, Bitcoin recovered and surged to achieve another yearly high at $31,800. These historical instances suggest that the current price action for BTC is within the realm of normal. It follows a pattern of temporarily dampening investor hopes and then, under favorable circumstances, rebuilding confidence and propelling investors to new heights of optimism.

42409863,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQCwu,1692766477,What Happens to Football NFTs Now That Panini Lost Its License?,"NFL Players Association terminated its deal with Italian collectibles company Panini three years early in favor of rival Fanatics.  Panini might chose to keep its NFT markets open, though there probably won’t be a mint happening anytime soon.  An escalating legal war between two top sports card companies is prompting questions about how digital collectibles like NFTs fit into the mix.  This week the NFL Players Association terminated its deal with Italian collectibles company Panini S.p.A three years early in favor of rival Fanatics.  “Effective immediately, Fanatics has the exclusive right to make NFLPA-branded trading cards,” the statement reads. It’s almost certainly focused on the multi-million dollar market for cardboard sports cards. What’s less clear is how this sudden reneging could impact Panini’s pro-football-themed NFTs.  The NFL Players Association did not immediately respond to an email from CoinDesk.  Fanatics has made its mark in the trading card business via licensing deals with the MLB, NBA, and NFLPA, and purchasing Topps – another trading card company – for $500 million, leading to an ongoing legal conflict with Panini.  But what does this mean for the minted NFL NFTs?  Not a lot, explains Ross Feingold, special counsel at Taipei-based Titan Attorneys-at-Law.  The first sale doctrine, explains Feingold, outlines that the owner of a legal copy of a copyrighted work has a right to display, lend, sell, or even dispose of that copy without the permission of the copyright owner.  “I could draw a mustache on Shohei Ohtani on [a baseball card], and then put it on eBay and sell it,” Feingold said. “Fanatics can't come after me for infringement.”  So don’t expect the Panini-minted NFTs to vanish anytime soon. The company didn't immediately return a request for comment from CoinDesk.  The trading card industrial complex spent a lot of time in court in the 1990s as licenses and limits of the first sale doctrine were tested. Feingold points to a few pivotal cases from that time as creating the legal framework that will guide arguments in court, should a dispute over NFL NFTs ever make it before a judge.  Over the years, and up into the early 2010s, there have been a number of court cases that have investigated the intersection between the right of publicity – the ability for an individual to have the exclusive rights to monetize their likeness – intellectual property ownership of team logos, and the right of first sale.  Feingold points out that trading card companies used to simply ignore intellectual property conventions and licenses, leading to a wild west of trading cards that might have had the blessing of the players’ association, but not the league, vice versa, or none of the above.  A Continually Evolving Legal Issue  As Attorney Paul Lesko argued in his Law of Cards column from 2013, this is anything but a cut-and-dry field.  There have been several notable lawsuits, such as Kareem-Abdul Jabbar v. Upper Deck and Buzz Aldrin v. Topps, Lesko writes, which have taken place but have not provided clear guidance on when manufacturers must pay for the inclusion of athletes or celebrities in their products.  Lesko points to a 2013 decision from the Ninth Circuit, involving Electronic Arts related to its NCAA Football series of video games, which has furthered the debate, and, arguably, it might ultimately support unlicensed use in the trading card industry.  The court's reasoning, Lesko writes, emphasizes the importance of reporting factual data and historical events and differentiates this from other commercial uses, like video games, where the likeness of individuals is employed without explicit permission.  If there’s one takeaway, it’s that the right of publicity in the trading card industry is a complex and highly litigated matter, and the uniqueness of different right of publicity laws in all 50 states creates a minefield.  NFTs Might Make Things Specifically Complicated  Generally speaking, the first sale doctrine would prevent these now-unlicensed NFTs from vanishing into the ether.  But what if the first sale doctrine regarding NFTs itself was something that’s not yet iron-clad?  A February 2023 paper from legal scholar Joshua Durham, published in the Wake Forest University Journal of Business & Intellectual Property Law, argues that the NFT landscape is evolving faster than the law.  “There is no “digital first sale” doctrine. So NFT creators could legally claw back secondary sales, under current law, leaving you with nothing,” he wrote on X.  In the digital world, a first-sale doctrine requires that the same file can’t exist twice. In crypto parlance, the file can’t be double spent – which blockchain prevents.  But the law hasn’t caught up with the times.  The U.S. Copyright Office has rejected the idea of a “digital first sale” due to the impossibility of confirming the deletion of the original file.  “Policymakers have concluded that since digital transmissions required reproducing a copy of a file (the work), digital transmissions infringed on the exclusive right of reproduction,” Durham writes. “A digital distribution of a reproduced copy was thus unlawfully made, and beyond the scope of the first sale doctrine.”  In theory, NFTs would offer a true digital first-sale, but “any unscrupulous NFT creator may invalidate all secondary sales of their NFTs through the outdated reading of [the law],” Durham writes.  Will Anything Actually Happen?  Given how the sports card market has typically played fast-and-loose with traditional understandings of copyright law and monetization, which has in turn opened up a legal gray area, Feingold doesn’t think much will happen.  Panini might even keep its markets open, though you probably won’t see a mint happening anytime soon.  “If Fanatics claims damages because of these NFTs, what are the damages? What did they take from you?” he said. “There's always been an aftermarket for sports cards, like buying Mickey Mantle rookie cards. That's the whole point of any collectible.""  Hypothetical damages would be dependent on the success of the business, which on-chain data suggests is far behind its paper counterpart.  ‘Signed’ NFTs of Dallas Cowboys’ Tony Romo are going for a floor price of $6 on Panini’s NFT marketplace while their paper-based equivalents have an opening ask of $600 on eBay.  In January, CoinDesk reported that Fanatics is selling its 60% stake in sports-focused NFT company Candy Digital. Is it that they want to hit a kill switch entirely on the vertical and vanish these NFTs entirely?  Or, they could continue business as usual – license be damned – Feingold muses, and later pay out a settlement.  It’s happened before.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/23/what-happens-to-football-nfts-now-that-panini-lost-its-license,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b36b34a79be7f903acffb9759ccf3b38bdb3d1f-3264x2448.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although bulls are optimistic, it hasn’t been smooth sailing for these traders, and bears have been active, shaving gains and putting buyers on the backpedal. Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Continues Market Recovery As Network Whales Triple Holdings As it is, the path of least resistance, looking at the price action from 2023 peaks to date, is southwards. XRP Bears Are Unyielding Presently, XRP is down 45% from July 2023 highs. Though prices are higher relative to last week’s lows, the coin remains under immense selling pressure. Looking at price charts, XRP prices are trending inside the August 17 trade range, a bear candlestick, suggesting that sellers have the upper hand unless there is a significant spike above $0.60 with rising volumes. This could ignite demand, lift sentiment, and allow buyers to resume the uptrend. The ruling by Judge Analisa Torres on July 13 went against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) claims that XRP is a security. In late 2020, the SEC alleged that Ripple, the blockchain company that uses XRP in one of their payment solutions, raised billions by selling the token, violating securities laws. Ripple’s executives, including Brad Garlinghouse, were also sued. Last month’s landmark ruling, in favor of Ripple and its executives, reignited demand, but the momentum appears to be fizzling since bears have completely peeled back gains. What’s Next For XRP? According to coin trackers, XRP has a market cap of $27 billion and is technically the fourth largest cryptocurrency excluding Tether (USDT), when writing on August 22. The coin is more liquid than Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin at this valuation. It is only trailing Ethereum, Bitcoin, and BNB. Its gap with BNB is narrowing to around $5 billion. The woes around Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, with regulators and banks, especially in the United States, could heap more pressure on BNB. In that way, the coin may drop in valuation, allowing XRP to be the third-largest network in the world. Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Continues Market Recovery As Network Whales Triple Holdings While price action in the daily chart predominantly points to bears, the recent bounce from lower prices after the dump on August 17 may signal strength. Whether buyers will build on this development and resume the uptrend in the direction of the July 13 bar remains uncertain. What’s also clear is that trading volumes are relatively low compared to the wide-ranging bar of mid-July that still shapes the current preview.

These rumors come as the XRP price falls to pre-judgment levels, sparking hope that it could trigger a reversal. XRP Rumors Has Crypto Twitter In A Frenzy Rumor has it that an anonymous insider has confirmed the potential listing of XRP, the native token of Ripple, on Robinhood, an American financial trading platform, before the end of 2023. The rumor was started on August 22 by a crypto user on X (formerly Twitter) who goes by the username @25hoursawake. The whispers of Robinhood listing XRP have sent shockwaves in the crypto community and numerous crypto investors and enthusiasts have taken to Twitter to air out their respective views and opinions on the speculation. Related Reading: Diamond In The Rough: Solo Bitcoin Miner Secures $160,000 Block Reward Robinhood is renowned for its meticulous listing process, and according to an X user Crypto Asset Guy, Robinhood has a reputation for not just listing any type of cryptocurrency. The trading platform puts considerable effort and time into its crypto listing procedure to ensure only the highest-qualified cryptocurrencies according to their standards are integrated into its platform. Alternatively, the crypto and stock trading platform is also known for delisting cryptocurrencies without a second thought, if said cryptocurrency faces any form of regulatory or significant market challenges. As the crypto space eagerly discusses the ramifications of Robinhood potentially listing XRP, some enthusiasts argue that integrating XRP tokens into the platform would have a positive outlook, exposing the digital asset to a wider audience and increasing investments in Robinhood. Token price falls to levels before Judge Torres's ruling | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Other individuals have pointed out Robinhood’s affinity for restricting trades and transactions during high market volatility. This has led to doubts about the platform’s ability to provide uninterrupted access to XRP users’ digital assets. Commenting on the rumors of Robinhood listing XRP, Crypto Assets Guy stated that if the speculations prove to be true, then the crypto community should look forward to a surge in investments and market trends. He emphasized that Robinhood may have insights on XRP, unbeknownst to the public. “If the rumors are true and Robinhood lists $XRP by the end of the year then prepare for a MASSIVE uptrend. Robinhood is known for being very tedious when selecting which crypto to list. So if they are getting ready to list XRP they must know something,” he said. Additionally, the outcome would undoubtedly increase the cryptocurrency’s mainstream adoption. Analyzing The Potential Effect Of A Robinhood Listing Ripple has been in an ongoing lawsuit with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for almost three years now. The lawsuit was thought to be finalized after XRP took a win following Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling which stated that programmatic XRP sales are not to be considered a security.

Just a few days ago, Binance lost another payment processing partner after Checkout.com terminated its contract with the crypto exchange. And now, another rumor that appears to be spreading is that Binance is selling Bitcoin on the spot market to sustain the price of its native token, BNB. Is Binance Really Selling Its Bitcoin To Buy BNB? The rumor originated from a post made by @WhaleChart on X (formerly Twitter), claiming that Binance is allegedly selling Bitcoin on the spot market to support the price of its own token, BNB. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Leaves Shibarium Launch Troubles Behind As Wallet Count Crossed 10 Million BREAKING: Binance is allegedly selling Bitcoin to support the price of their own token BNB — Whale (@WhaleChart) August 22, 2023 This rumor seems to be gaining ground since the tweet first went live, especially as the price of BNB continues to struggle in the market. This is because as one of the biggest holders of both Bitcoin and BNB, Binance is in a unique position to manipulate the market if it wanted. However, this remains only a rumor as there are currently no signs the crypto exchange is manipulating the price for short-term gains in BNB. Additionally, data from Coinmarketcap shows that the prices of both cryptocurrencies have been falling together in the past week, with Bitcoin also down by 11.20% in a 7-day timeframe. This will not be the first time such allegations are being brought against the exchange. Binance has faced similar claims in the past, with crypto analyst JW claiming Binance was selling Bitcoin to prop up the price of BNB in June of this year. Token price falls in tandem with BTC | Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview.com Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), however, denied the allegations, dismissing them as an attempt to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). 4. Binance have not sold BTC or BNB. We even still have a bag of FTT. It is amazing they can know exactly who sold based on just a price chart involving millions of traders. FUD. 🤷‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/M3MUH2bFRE — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) June 13, 2023 Whether or not the theories are true, Binance has surely been under intense scrutiny, but it continues to stand strong as the biggest exchange in the world. BNB and other cryptocurrencies that rely on the BEP20 and BEP2 token standards are very dependent on Binance, as news surrounding the exchange has led to price pumps and dumps in the past. But there has been no solid evidence that the exchange has been manipulating the prices of any of these tokens. Related Reading: Gemini Hits Back At SEC Lawsuit With Dismissal Filing The price of BNB has seen a drastic reduction in the past few days as the entire market goes through corrections signaled by BTC falling by more than 8% in a couple of minutes last week. As a result, BNB has seen its price drop to $209.44, a reduction of 12.33% in the past few days. To combat a further price drop, the BNB Chain had to manually liquidate a $200 million position on the Venus DEFI protocol, which would have been liquidated after BNB dropped below $220. At the time of writing, BNB is the fourth biggest crypto with a market cap of $32.2 billion.

The cryptocurrency is trapped between major players waiting and positioning for the next move; which side will prevail in this battle? Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Data Suggests Price Is Top Heavy, What It Means As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $26,000 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, the cryptocurrency recorded a 12% correction which has severely impacted other assets in the sector, notably XRP and Binance Coin (BNB), which recorded losses north of 15% in the same period. Retail Traders Likely To Push Bitcoin Price Lower? In a report from Bitfinex Alpha, an analyst points out the influence of the derivatives sector on the spot Bitcoin price. Last week, BTC’s volatility was compressed, declining into historical lows, but a negative delta (high selling pressure) persisted, moving the price lower. At the time, Bitcoin dropped enough to trigger a liquidation cascade, which was potentially worsened by a prominent trader being forced out of their position on a crypto exchange, the report speculated. The chart below shows that Open Interest in the derivatives sector followed BTC’s price action. This market dynamics left Bitcoin in its current state. Analysts from Material Indicators called it a “game of chicken” between prominent players waiting to see if enough liquidity will be added to support the current levels or if the selling pressure will return. The analysts indicated that the BTC price orderbook is the thinnest in 6 months while adding the following: (…) we are seeing small amounts of bid liquidity ladder up from $20k closer to the active trading zone, but no liquidity of any size (new or moved) has been stacked into the range defending price from a Lower Low. Needless to say, printing a LL in this TF has macro implications. Printing 2 LLs would push #BTC down to sub $20k levels. Material Indicators showed that when the price of Bitcoin broke below critical support, most of the selling was done by relatively small traders. However, whales likely used small selling orders to reduce slippage and push prices down to current levels.

Just a month ago in the middle of July, Bitcoin crossed over $30,000 and many investors saw this as the start of another bull run. However, things seem to have taken a turn, as the price of Bitcoin has plateaued since then. The asset is currently struggling to find a push in price, and it would seem this sentiment has flowed into digital asset funds. According to the weekly report published by digital asset manager CoinShares, Bitcoin outflows from institutional accounts have resumed in the past week. Outflows From Digital Asset Investment Products Outflows from digital asset investment products have spiked in recent weeks to register a three-week run of outflows. This would indicate that institutional investors might be avoiding volatile cryptos. This comes two weeks after a brief period of inflows, where Ripple’s partial victory in court and recent US inflation data led to inflows in digital asset products. Related Reading: Dogecoin Proof Of Stake Discussion Heats Up As Lead Dev Chimes In However, data shows that outflows resumed last week, and it appears that the euphoria that followed Ripple’s partial triumph against the SEC has dissipated. Digital asset investment products saw $55 million in outflows last week, with Bitcoin leading the charge with outflows of $42 million. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum registered $9 million outflows, while Polygon, Litecoin, and Polkadot saw outflows of $0.9 million, $0.6 million, and $0.5 million, respectively. On the other hand, XRP and Cardano saw an increase in their respective inflows of $1.2 million and $0.1 million. In terms of region, Canada had the most outflows of $35.9. million, and Germany followed with $11 million. BTC price falls below $26,000 support | Source: BTCUSD On Tradingview.com Rise In Bitcoin Outflows Bitcoin outflows from exchanges suggest big investors may be losing faith in the popular cryptocurrency. One factor that fueled this outflow is speculations going around that the SEC might not actually approve applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. As a result, total assets under management (AuM) declined by 10% to close the week at $32.3 billion. Related Reading: Gemini Hits Back At SEC Lawsuit With Dismissal Filing The speculations come as the SEC has delayed making a decision on Spot Bitcoin ETF applications multiple times. Each postponement casts more doubt on whether they will ever approve one and an outright rejection from the SEC will most likely lead to the price of Bitcoin falling to $20,000 and digital asset investment products registering more outflows.
