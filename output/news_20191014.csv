42382825,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7TN,1571091607,CME Says Bitcoin Futures Gaining Interest From Big Investors,"CME Group, the Chicago-based exchange operator, said its bitcoin futures contracts grew in popularity last quarter, with the number of open contracts up 61 percent from a year earlier because of growing demand from institutional investors.  Open interest, or the number of outstanding positions, rose to 4,629 contracts, up from 2,873 in the third quarter of 2018, CME said Monday in a statement. And despite the quarter's 25 percent drop in bitcoin price, according to CoinDesk, the open interest in the CME's contracts was down just 1 percent from second-quarter levels.  The average daily volume of contracts traded during the quarter was 5,534, up 10 percent from the year-earlier period. It was the equivalent of 27,670 bitcoin, or $289 million, according to the exchange.  ""Institutional flow remained strong, with 454 new accounts added, compared with 231 added in the third quarter of 2018,"" CME said. Entities holding more than 25 bitcoin, used as a proxy for large investors, rose to 47, from 45 in the second quarter and 34 in the third quarter of 2018.  CME debuted its bitcoin futures in 2017 and outlasted a rival offering from another exchange company, Cboe Global Markets, which aborted its own contract earlier this year.  But the CME faces new competition from Bakkt, a startup sponsored by Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange, which debuted a new bitcoin-futures contract in September, aiming to attract institutional investors who might want to make bets on the cryptocurrency.  Some 50 percent of the CME's bitcoin-futures trading volume during the third quarter was outside the U.S., with 26 percent coming from the Asia Pacific region and 21 percent from Europe and the Middle East, according to the exchange.

42382829,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7av,1571090400,Facebook-Led Libra Forms Governing Council After Big-Name Departures,"GENEVA — Twenty-one organizations have signed the Libra Association charter, days after a slew of high-profile defections from the cryptocurrency project started by Facebook.  The Libra Association also named its board of directors and formalized the consortium's executive team following a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.  Facebook  still remains a key player in the project with Calibra CEO and former Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus taking a seat on the five-person board. Other board members include Katie Haun, a general partner with Andreessen Horowitz; Wences Cesares, CEO of Xapo; Patrick Ellis, general counsel at PayU; and Matthew Davie, chief strategy officer of Kiva.  Bertrand Perez, Dante Disparte and Kurt Hemecker will take leadership roles in the association’s executive team. Hemecker, Perez and Marcus are all PayPal alums.  In addition to Calibra, the association consists of Coinbase, Xapo, Anchorage, Bison Trails, Creative Destruction Lab, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Ribbit Capital, Union Square Ventures, Breakthrough Initiatives, Illiad, Vodafone, Farfetch, Uber, Lyft, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women’s World Banking, Spotify and PayU, according to a press release. No previously unknown members were listed.  The announcement comes following a number of major departures. When the Libra Association debuted in June, Facebook touted a roster of 28 major firms. However, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Booking Holdings, eBay, Stripe and Mercado Pago, announced their withdrawals from Libra over the past week, with some citing concerns over the regulatory backlash faced by the project.  Still, the Libra Association said Monday that more than 1,500 entities have expressed interest in joining the project, with 180 meeting the organization’s membership criteria. A two-thirds vote by the 21 board members is required to actually add any new members.  In June, Facebook said a consortium of 100 companies would back the cryptocurrency project at launch. No update was shared Monday regarding those plans or the current target launch date.  Barely begun  Facebook announced this summer a bold vision for a cryptocurrency that could be used by unbanked individuals worldwide.  As initially envisioned, the token’s governance will be overseen by the Libra Association, a consortium of 100 companies who will vote on technical decisions for the cryptocurrency using the Libra Investment Token, which would double as a security allowing holders to earn any interest accrued from the basket.  The stablecoin was designed to be backed by a basket of fiat currencies, later announced to be comprised of the U.S. dollar (50 percent), the euro (18 percent), the yen (14 percent), the British pound (11 percent) and the Singapore dollar (7 percent).  Financial regulators and policymakers around the world immediately announced their opposition to the project, citing fears that Libra could destabilize the global monetary order. Ministers in France and Germany said they were against Libra, India announced that Libra may not even be legal in the country and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) called for a moratorium on the project until all regulatory questions could be cleared.  However, Calibra’s Marcus has maintained that these fears are misplaced. He testified before the U.S. Congress in July, trying to assuage the concerns of both the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee. (Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will head to Capitol Hill next week for the same purpose.)  More recently, Marcus wrote in a letter that Libra would welcome regulatory oversight, and that the project was not looking to replace the dollar.  This has not stopped a raft of questions regarding Facebook’s intentions or Libra’s potential ramifications. Prior to their announced departures from the Libra Association, the CEOs of Visa, Mastercard and Stripe were contacted by U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who wrote that the companies could come under increased regulatory scrutiny should they continue their participation in the project.  Technical development  It is unclear when Libra will actually launch.  While Facebook initially targeted an early 2020 launch date, recent statements by Zuckerberg have put this timeline into doubt. However, it appears that any delay to the launch will be a result of its regulatory issues, rather than technical concerns.  Zuckerberg said during a quarterly earnings call in July that the company would take ""however long"" it needs to convince regulators not to interfere with Libra. In September he alluded to the possibility that the project could take years to launch.  From a technical perspective, Facebook has been secretive about what has been built so far. Since June, the team has not publicly stated what progress or drawbacks it has seen, despite open-sourcing some of Libra’s codebase.  It also remains unclear whether the team building Libra consists solely of Calibra employees, or whether individuals from other members of the association have joined in the effort.  What is known is that Facebook set up a team in Geneva, Switzerlandhttps://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/facebook-s-cryptocurrency-gets-a-warm-welcome-in-geneva/45053980, and previously listed blockchain-related positions in Menlo Park, California and Tel Aviv, Israel.

42382820,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7S7,1571086206,SEC Draws on Investor Communications to Halt Telegram Token Launch,"To justify halting the launch of Telegram's long-awaited $1.7 billion blockchain project, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relied heavily on communications obtained from investors.  In September, the regulator contacted U.S.-based investors, requesting information about what details were being shared by the company to support the TON token offering, according to Yakov Barinsky, CEO of the crypto investment firm HASH CIB, who consulted for some of the funds that invested in TON.  ""I know that the SEC reached out to them asking how the deal was arranged, what information TON shared, what documents have been circulated and whether there was any omission of information,"" Barinsky told CoinDesk, declining to name his clients.  Last Friday, when the SEC sued Telegram  Group, Inc., demanding that it stop TON's launch, its lawsuit included specific details the regulator gleaned from TON investors.  SEC lawsuit  Based on a close reading of the lawsuit, information gathered from the U.S.-based investors is included, revealing unknown details of the token offering, which had been conducted in secrecy, with investors specifically prohibited from talking publicly of their involvement.  The SEC cited a ""pitch to one United States-based investor around January 2018."" To attract the investor, ""Telegram spoke of its “A+ engineering team” and the “chance for 0x-50x returns on the investments.""  The SEC used the specifics shared by that investor to bolster its conclusion that the offering was breaking the law.  It said the investor purchased:  ""$27.5 million worth of Grams in early 2018 for tokens that had no use and would have no use at the time of launch, demonstrating its intent to profit from the potential increase in value of Grams.""  Two other investors CoinDesk spoke to said they were not pitched ""0x-50x returns,"" suggesting that Telegram's pitch varied, case by case, which could have been another red flag for the regulator.  The SEC halted the TON sale with an emergency restraining order against Telegram Group, Inc., and TON Issuer, the two issuers of Telegram's tokens listed in the Regulation D filing with the SEC in February and March 2018.  The regulator said Telegram failed to register a securities issuance and ""committed to flood the U.S. capital markets with billions of Grams by October 31, 2019"" — the deadline for TON's launch.  According to the restraining order, Telegram ""has refused to accept service of an administrative subpoena by the Commission.""  Major venture funds, including Lightspeed Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Benchmark, had invested in the ambitious project that raised $1.7 billion from 171 investors worldwide last year.  According to the SEC's lawsuit, out of 2.9 billion TON tokens, or ""grams,"" more than 1 billion went to 39 U.S. buyers who invested a combined $424.5 million, or almost 25 percent of the total raised.  TON: 'Surprised and disappointed'  Telegram pushed a different version of the story, as it emailed investors shortly following the SEC's motion. In a short email seen by CoinDesk, the company claimed the team had been trying to engage with the regulator, but to no avail:  ""Telegram has attempted to engage with and solicit feedback from the SEC for the past 18 months regarding the TON blockchain. We were surprised and disappointed that the SEC chose to file the lawsuit under these circumstances, and we disagree with the SEC's legal position.""  The notice went on to say Telegram is working on the ways to resolve the situation, ""including but not limited to assessing whether to seek to delay the launch date.""  According to an investor who spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity, a delay is likely.  ""The fact that the SEC went active so close to the mainnet launch tells us that they estimated this project's potential as high and potentially disruptive to them, considering the quality of TON's tech and a very broad user base, which would allow Telegram to make gram's circulation really wide-spread,"" the investor told CoinDesk.  Barinsky, in turn, believes the moment gives the investors an opening: if the launch is delayed, Telegram will have to negotiate with the token buyers about it, and the investors can bargain for better deals.  TON was scheduled for launch on Oct. 31. Earlier this month, Telegram requested its investors generate their public keys using TON's software and share them with Telegram to receive tokens.  Lightspeed and Sequoia did not respond to CoinDesk's requests for comment. The SEC declined to comment.

42382831,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7cB,1571083221,Grayscale Wins Approval for First Public Digital Currency Index Fund,"Grayscale Investments has received regulatory approval to list what it calls the first publicly-traded digital currency index fund.  Following assent from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Digital Large Cap Fund (DLC) will be listed on over-the-counter markets and trade under the initials GDLCF.  The DLC is Grayscale’s fourth publicly-quoted investment product, after Bitcoin Trust (OTCQX: GBTC), Ethereum Trust (OTCQX: ETHE), and Ethereum Classic Trust (OTCQX: ETCG). Eventually, Grayscale aims to list on the public market all ten of its investment products that are currently open to accredited investors. The new product is available to all investors with access to U.S. securities.  “The bitcoin trust is one of the most liquid securities on OTCQX market daily,” Grayscale managing director Michael Sonnenshein told CoinDesk.  “To our knowledge, this is the first diversified digital currency offering going on the U.S. public market.”  The idea behind the DLC is to give investors broad-based exposure to cryptocurrencies with one vehicle, Sonnenshein said. The fund has seen a 74.8 percent return, year-to-date.  The DLC exposes investors to the largest cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization at any time. The fund targets upwards of 70 percent of the digital currency market. As of Sept. 30, 2019, that was 80.3 percent bitcoin, 9.9 percent ethereum, 5.8 percent XRP, 2.2 percent bitcoin cash and 1.8 percent litecoin. To account for changes in cryptocurrency market caps, the fund components are rebalanced on a quarterly basis, potentially removing existing digital assets and adding new assets. The fund is a passive investment vehicle that is not actively managed.  In addition to market cap, other factors like liquidity, operational requirements, and the availability of custodial solutions are considered when picking cryptocurrencies for the fund.  Grayscale, the oldest and largest digital currency asset manager with $2.2 billion assets under management, opened the funds to accredited investors in Feb 2018. There were about 3.2 million shares of DLC outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2019.  Investors buy shares in the private placement investment vehicle, which is backed by actual cryptocurrency. The valuation, made at 4:00 p.m. EST. each day, is based on the Digital Asset Reference Rate provided by institutional trading technology firm, TradeBlock.

Speaking on CNBC, Mnuchin said that if Libra wouldn't meet US money-laundering standards via the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, it could open them up to enforcement actions.  “I think they realized that they’re not ready, they’re not up to par,” Mnuchin said. “And I assume some of the partners got concerned and dropped out until they meet those standards.”  Mnuchin said he met with Libra representatives on multiple occasions to reiterate his stance on regulatory enforcement of the stablecoin.  Six major Libra backers - Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay and Mercado Pago along with PayPal - withdrew from the Libra Association, a nonprofit organization designed to govern the new cryptocurrency.  On Friday, a Visa spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association’s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.”  The withdrawals were followed by a draft report from the G7 working group on the global stablecoins, evaluating projects like Libra as a potential threat to the international financial stability due to regulatory challenges.

By assigning vehicles unique identities that store data such as ownership and histories on a blockchain, the industry initiative aims to remove the need for a human when settling tolls and parking fees.  Founded in May 2018 by multiple major car manufacturers, MOBI has been working to enable the sharing of road data between manufacturers, a step towards developing self-driving cars.  As Nikkei writes, participating vehicles would eventually be able to automatically pay expenses once plugged into other networks such as charging or refueling stations.  MOBI is also looking into incorporating cryptocurrencies. One such system involved compensating users in crypto for putting energy back into the power grid following an outage.  A number of automakers are looking at blockchain for facilitating processes such as payments and data sharing, especially for the not-so-distant future where automated vehicles have become the norm.  This summer, CoinDesk reported how Daimler – parent company of Mercedes-Benz – partnered with blockchain firm Riddle & Code to produce a hardware wallet for automobiles. Looking long term at solutions for self-driving vehicles and car-sharing platforms, the firms' wallet would also create a cryptographic identity for vehicles.

42431102,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzo7h,1571062508,"Thrill-Seeking Drives Investors to Trade Crypto, Study Finds","Investors who trade cryptocurrency also tend to take bigger risks in the stock market, suggesting they are seeking dopamine more than diversification, according to a recent study.  The paper, titled ""Are Cryptocurrency Traders Pioneers Or Just Risk-Seekers? Evidence From Brokerage Accounts,"" appeared in the September issue of Economic Letters, stating that cryptocurrency traders' behavior is ""driven by excitement-seeking.""  ""We find that when engaging in cryptocurrency trading investors simultaneously increase their risk-seeking behavior in stock trading as they increase their trading intensity and use of leverage,"" the paper says.  Researchers Matthias Pelster from the University of Paderborn, Bastian Breitmayer of Queensland University of Technology and Bond University's Tim Hasso used individual-level brokerage data to assess the impact of cryptocurrency trading on investor behavior in the stock markets.  The sample period was from Jan. 1, 2014, to Dec. 31, 2017, consisting of 668,067 individual investors.  The study found that on average, traders execute 16.8 additional stock trades and increase their use of leverage by 13.4 percent within the first 10 days after initiating their cryptocurrency activities.  Notably, traders in the age group of 35 to 44 years old increased their leverage the most, followed by 25- to 34-year-old traders.  Wild ride  The pattern of behavior could be associated with the fact that cryptocurrencies are far more volatile and unpredictable than stocks.  For instance, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, often moves by more than $1,000 in a matter of just a few minutes. That sudden price volatility is rarely seen in the equity markets.  Also, as the U.S. Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) stated last week in rejecting a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the bitcoin market is prone to market manipulation. So, the uncertainty element is high in cryptocurrencies as compared to stocks.  Hence, it's not surprising that stock traders are more likely to take more risks in equities after dabbling with cryptocurrencies.  The researchers also observed that the increase in risk-seeking in stocks is particularly pronounced when volatility in cryptocurrency returns is low.  That conclusion undercuts the popular narrative that bitcoin is a new safe-haven asset.  After all, if traders viewed cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment avenue or a safe haven asset, then their stock trading behavior should have remained unchanged.

The five cryptos are already traded on its platform.  Speaking on launch, CEO Brendan Callan said the product simplifies crypto investment for retail users:  “Trading a basket of cryptocurrencies means our users are freed from the hassle of constantly monitoring the markets. CryptoMajor therefore streamlines the trading process and protects our customers from unanticipated and adverse market movements.”  The product is targeted at customers seeking to enter the nascent crypto market, Callan said, but who ""don’t want to risk too much overexposure.”  Under its previous owner, Global Brokerage, Inc, FXCM notably lost its license with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in addition to receiving a $7 million fine, for trading against its own customers in 2017, according to the Financial Times.  After two of the company’s founders were banned from the U.S. financial industry, the London-based company exited the U.S. market. It's now majority owned by Leucadia Investments, part of the Jefferies Financial Group, according to the FXCM website.

Zug and its Silicon Valley-esque moniker are 30 minutes' drive south of Zurich. But if a new partnership between Zug's crypto lobbyists and Zurich's tourism czars pans out, the Crypto Valley could soon expand northwards.  Zurich is full of financial traditionalists – the city headquarters a third of Switzerland’s banks. Alongside well-established legal and health services, it hosts a wide population of tech-minded individuals, including 150 blockchain-related companies.  The growth is because of Crypto Valley Association (CVA) which has been fostering growth of the Swiss crypto space. The organization, an association of fintech ventures and individuals, has lobbied Swiss regulators for years – putting forward 14 different draft laws.  CVA Executive Director Alexander Schell said:  “We’re not just waiting for things to happen. We’re actively involved in proposing regulation.”  CVA has now partnered with Zurich Tourism, the region’s marketing wing, to bring blockchain awareness, tourism and business to Zurich. The pair even signed a memorandum of understanding “to grow the Swiss blockchain ecosystem.”  “We’re trying to establish an ecosystem of law firms, banks, startups, and other players who might be interested in this space,” Schell said. “We can make the best circumstances for them and the best prerequisites for businesses to be successful.”  Zurich Tourism will focus on bringing in cyber newcomers with internationally minded conferences and events.  Through hosting conferences for international audiences and reaching out to existing businesses in the tech-minded city, Vanessa Reis, Relationship Manager of Zurich Tourism, said that the relationship will find success.

42431116,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzoTh,1571050916,"Bitcoin Faces Drop Below $8,000 Despite Beating Price Resistance","View  Bitcoin has crossed the 20-day moving average (MA) hurdle but remains in bearish territory below the long-term resistance of the 200-day MA.  Daily and weekly charts indicate scope for a drop to $7,750.  A UTC close above the 200-day MA at $8,718 is needed to weaken the bearish case.      Bitcoin appears likely to drop below $8,000, despite having scaled a widely tracked technical resistance level.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading above the 20-day moving average for the first time since mid-September. The MA line was crossed multiple times over the weekend, but on each occasion the breakout was brief.  At time of writing, BTC seems to have found more solid acceptance above the 20-day MA, having defended the level at $8,252 during the Asian trading hours on Monday.  The move above the 20-day MA is good news, according to popular analyst Josh Rager.  Rager is also expecting bitcoin's price volatility to rise soon, as the Bollinger bands have converged sharply over the last few days. A low-volatility period, as seen in the last two weeks, often ends with a big move on either side.  While some traders may anticipate a big move to the higher side, given the price has scaled the 20-day MA, the technical charts remain bearish. Further, prices are still holding well below the key 200-day MA, which has acted as strong resistance over the last 2.5 weeks.  Daily and 4-hour charts  BTC carved out a large bearish outside bar reversal candle on Friday (above left), signaling an end of the recovery rally and shifting risk in favor of a drop below $8,000. That candle is still valid with prices holding well below the high of $8,820 hit on Friday.  As mentioned, the cryptocurrency is trading well below the 200-day MA at $8,718 (above left). BTC has failed to close above the long-term average multiple times since Sept. 27, dampening prospects of a stronger recovery rally and making it the level to beat for the bulls.  Above right, the 4-hour chart is reporting a failed double bottom breakout and a rising channel breakdown – a bearish setup.  Weekly chart  BTC ended last week on a positive note, but faced rejection at the 5-week MA, reinforcing the downward sloping average's bearish bias.  The 5- and 10-week MAs continue to trend south this week, while the relative strength index (RSI) is holding bearish below 50.  All-in-all, BTC risks falling below $8,000 and extending losses, possibly to the 100-week MA support at $7,760, in the short term.  The bearish case would weaken if prices find acceptance above the 200-day MA at $8,718, but that looks unlikely at press time.

As reported in The Korea Times, Cyworld shut down on Oct. 1 without warning, leaving clink investors uncertain if their holdings continue to have any value. Adding to the mess, two Korean exchanges that actually list the little known token, CoinZest and BitSonic, are considering removing support.  Launched in 1999 and popular in the mid-2000s with some 32 million users, Cyworld's user base fell during the subsequent rise of Facebook and Twitter.  To try and turn its fortunes around, Cyworld conducted an initial exchange offering (IEO) on CoinZest in January, raising around $400,000. The company had been bleeding employees and funds for some time, having ceased its global service in 2014 to focus solely on South Korea.  Clink ecosystem image via clink.cyworld.com  Since the site's closure, Cyworld CEO Jeon Jae-wan and other company executives have not been available for comment. Some clink holders are considering filing a lawsuit against the firm and its CEO, the Times says.  As of press time, each clink token was worth $0.00033266 and had a little over $10 in 24-hour trading volume according to data provider CoinGecko. Clink holders are reportedly expected to lose over 1 billion won ($842,600) if the company doesn't turn the situation around.

Writing in a company blog Saturday, Coinbase UK CEO Zeeshan Feroz said the exchange is one of the very first firms to receive the license from the central bank, following a Dublin office opening a year ago.  The license will also help open up EU and European Economic Area (EEA) markets for Coinbase customers, Feroz said.  Speaking on the announcement, state-sponsored business development agency IDA Ireland – which was set up to attract foreign investment to Ireland – called the move a net positive for the local financial industry  As CEO Mike Shanahan put it:  ""Coinbase’s choice of Dublin for this operation reinforces the strength of Ireland as a destination for financial services companies, providing a consistent, certain, pro-enterprise policy environment for businesses to grow and thrive.""  Coinbase was granted a U.K. e-money license by the Financial Conduct Authority in March 2018, allowing the exchange to operate as a money service in the country.  While the U.K. is currently an EU member state, its government is currently attempting to leave the economic bloc via the so-called Brexit in coming weeks or months. If it goes ahead, the separation would render Coinbase's local license of limited benefit.

42431108,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzoHh,1571040055,Zcash’s Halo Breakthrough Is a Big Deal – Not Just For Cryptocurrencies,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      An underappreciated, sideline payoff from cryptocurrency R&D is that it also generates advances within the sector’s component technologies.  The most important are occurring within the field from which the term “cryptocurrency” derives. Cryptography – essentially, the study of mathematical secrets – is as old as the exploration of ciphers in ancient times. But in the past 10 years, thanks largely to the invention of bitcoin and censorship-resistant money, it’s seen an explosion of activity.  That’s especially in the sub-field of zero-knowledge proofs, which enable the verification of facts that are derived from a secret the verifier cannot access. These advances matter because zero-knowledge proofs offer the tantalizing prospect of people transacting in confidence without accessing potentially compromising information about each other. Its potential goes beyond the narrow realm of cryptocurrencies to face the ultimate challenge of the Internet age: achieving security with privacy.  This is why a breakthrough by the Electric Coin Company, the startup behind zcash, is rich with potential. ECC had already been an engine of progress for cryptography by advancing the use of zk-SNARKS, another cryptocurrency-inspired addition to the zero-knowledge proof toolkit, with which zcash produces a provably auditable blockchain without revealing users’ addresses (a disclosure note: Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company, is an ECC investor).  But the company’s recent announcement of Halo, a “trustless recursive” version of zero-knowledge proofs that provides a massively scalable solution to the field’s unwieldy reliance on “trusted setups,” is arguably bigger. If the discovery by ECC researcher Sean Bowe holds up to scientific scrutiny, it could one day unleash a host of powerful, real-world applications for the digital age that go far beyond cryptocurrency.  Might it even achieve the impossible: lowering the heat that zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox and his cofounders relentlessly receive for the 20% founder fee built into the cryptocurrency’s protocol, a deal that has delivered them millions of dollars’ worth of tokens since the launch in 2016? The founders justify the fee on the grounds that it both pays for maintenance and rewards research and development to strengthen the protocol. For now at least, this looks like a discovery that ECC can flag as money well spent – not just for zcash, but for the entire crypto ecosystem.  A proof of proofs  Halo allows a user to both prove that no one involved in the initial establishment of a large-scale zero-knowledge proof system has created a secret backdoor with which to later amend the code and that that secure state has existed over the course of ongoing updates and changes to the system. Until now the risk of fraud at setup meant that zero knowledge proofs often required elaborate, costly procedures at the outset to instill confidence in users. (A prime example was the zcash genesis “ceremony” – recorded live on YouTube and documented in an entertaining episode for NPR’s Radiolab – when various founders and outside particiapants based in multiple locations went to extraordinary lengths to jointly and securely create the initial key pair and then demonstrate that none of them would ever have access to the private key.)  As such, zero-knowledge proofs were too cumbersome for anything other than privately proving small one-off facts. Repeating the inefficient, time-consuming trusted setup over and over again was costly. To be sure, one-off trustless solutions known as “bulletproofs” have been around since 2017, but they lack the recursive quality needed to verify the ever-accumulating information within a large, growing changing database.  Halo gets around this problem by establishing an accumulated “proof of proofs,” such that the latest mathematical output contains within it a proof that all prior claims to the relevant secret knowledge have themselves been sufficiently proven through a similar process. In a dramatic compression in computational requirements, all that’s now needed to verify the veracity of the entire database’s current state is a single mathematical proof. (The way Wilcox explained it to me, the process sounded similar to the efficiency gains of Merkle tree structures, which aggregate previously hashed information into a single root hash output.)  Cheap full nodes  The scaling benefits of this lightweight proofing system were illustrated with a mid-September demonstration by the EEC team using the bitcoin blockchain. They generated a proof of the current block’s proof-of-work integrity that also contained proofs of the integrity of every preceding block, all the way down the chain to Satoshi Nakamoto’s genesis block of January 3, 2009.  In light of the fraught debates in the bitcoin community over full nodes, decentralization and block sizes, this sounds like game-changer material. While there will still need to be nodes that read the full blockchain to identify transactions, the overall task of verifying the integrity of a blockchain could become a much less costly problem for the network as a whole. Ordinary users could achieve the ease-of-use and efficiency they need but do so with their own full verification nodes. It would thus negate the need for so-called SPV wallets, which rely on others to verify on the user’s behalf and so create a trust problem. For the network, the result could be greater decentralization at a lower cost.  The ECC is planning to integrate Halo into the zcash blockchain as a Layer 1 scaling solution. If it works, the zcash network might much more cheaply handle significantly larger amounts of on-chain data. This is a markedly different approach to the scaling problem from the Layer 2 model favored by bitcoin supporters of the Lightning Network, where scale is achieved by taking transactions off chain. If it works for zcash, one wonders whether bitcoin cash developers will be tempted to integrate it into their protocol to lower the cost of maintaining the larger blocks they adopted in the contentious 2017 fork from Bitcoin Core.  Bigger visions  But it’s the potential for non-cryptocurrency solutions that makes Halo an especially exciting prospect. Wilcox even claims Halo “may turn out to be a building block for the next generation of the Internet and other such social infrastructure.”  In a conversation, he pointed to the vulnerabilities of large, ever-changing centralized databases such as that of the famously hacked credit scorer Equifax, as well as those of different states’ DMV outlets and of siloed medical record custodians. All must share information with other parties but struggle with the risks of doing so. “Now instead of them spitting out copies of a full report of the data, they keep the only copy but spit out zero knowledge proofs,” Wilcox said.  The ideal, however, would be to dispense with the centralized record-keeper entirely. Wilcox thinks Halo-like zero-knowledge proofs will pave the way. Taking the prior example one step further, he said, “What if instead of me saying ‘here is a proof that Equifax says I haven’t had any defaults over the last 10 years,’ I can say ‘here is a proof from all the 100 people that have lent to me over the past 10 years and each of them attests to me not having defaulted?”  Getting to such a utopia won’t happen quickly. Regulation, corporate incumbency and behavioral inertia will continue to pose resistance. And, to be clear, Bowe’s mathematical proof still needs to be subject to rigorous peer review.  But even if holes are found in the current iteration, they will be patched. Better versions will emerge.  The process of follow-on research that this discovery will unleash in all areas of the digital economy is undeniable. And if the world isn’t ready for such a radical reorganization of how we manage sensitive information, it will eventually be moved to adopt such changes by the relentless buildup of vulnerable databases and the ongoing attacks against them by increasingly sophisticated hackers. That’s a trend that led Juniper Research to recently assert that cybercrime will cost the global economy a stunning $5 trillion a year by 2024.  The world badly needs fixes for these giant challenges. Cryptocurrency developers are doing as much as anybody to find them.

In a letter to G20 finance ministers and central bank governors on Sunday, the FSB’s chair Randal Quarles said the G7 working group is delivering an assessment report on opportunities and challenges posed by global stablecoins.  While the G20 leaders previously admitted crypto assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability, the introduction of global stablecoins could pose “a host of challenges” to the regulatory community, the chair said in the letter.  The regulator presents a range of issues stemming from stablecoins, including data privacy and protection, AML/CFT and KYC compliance, tax evasion, fair competition and market integrity.  While the letter does not point to any particular stablecoin as an example, major economies have been voicing their concerns over the anticipated issuance of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency.  According to a report from BBC on Monday, the draft report on stablecoin from G7 working group warns that even if Libra's backers can address such concerns, the project may not get approval from regulators.  ""Addressing such risks is not necessarily a guarantee of regulatory approval for a stablecoin arrangement,"" the G7's draft report says.  Pressure has been building up for Facebook since major payment companies such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal and Stripe withdrew from the company’s Libra project.  The FSB will later submit an official issues note on global stablecoins to the October 2019 G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting this week. “The G7 working group will be handing off work on regulatory issues to the FSB, and we have already begun work in this area,” Quarles said.  The assessment came after the G20 Leaders asked the FSB to advise them on additional multilateral responses as needed, given recent developments in stablecoins.

New York-based Lukka invented the first crypto tax calculator and is the first data services firm to help monitor fund performances and prepare auditable financial statements for crypto assets on a daily basis, CEO Jake Benson told CoinDesk.  “In a super volatile market, having daily liquidity is really advantageous,” Benson said, noting same-day reporting offers more protection for investors compared to monthly NAV reporting, which is the most common practice in the industry.  Lukka is testing out the new service on the Hashdex Digital Assets Index Fund ( HDAIhttps://www.hashdex.com/index/), which is a passive fund that follows its own index of 13 digital assets, including 75.5% bitcoin and 10.15% ethereum.  While the new service reduces the duration of reporting process, it would be able to price and audit underlying assets in an investment vehicle more accurately thanks to their patented technology, Benson said.  There are two key processes that currently challenge fund managers to evaluate digital assets including data collection from a variety of venues and data normalization, according to Benson.  “In the crypto industry, getting transactional data is a pretty intensive exercise,” Benson said.  Digital assets venues, ranging from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, OTC desks to blockchains, require different data capture processes.  ""We have an entire team of technologists and quality control just focused on maintaining connectors to all the different transactional venues to assemble the data,"" he said.    “When we're aggregating data, it's not just pulling down a fix fee from prime brokers      We are managing 30 to 40 different connectors.”    Normalizing crypto data is another challenge for the industry since there is not any standard identifier in this industry yet, Benson said, noting his firm has created reference data to solve the problem for institutional investors.  “I think everybody in the industry should be excited about this because it's just a representative milestone of the industry growing up,” Benson said.  Indeed, the industry is eager to implement same-day NAV reporting.  “Same-day NAV reporting is definitely a step in the right direction for not only launching funds, but also having investors be comfortable with buying them,” Kostya Etus, portfolio manager at CLS Investments, told CoinDesk.

The financing round was led by the quasi-government agency Korea Technology Finance Corporation (KOTEC). Another six investment companies, including T.S.

Proceeds will be used to launch its digital identification service “my-ID” and expand a group of expected clients called my-ID Alliance, which currently consists of 27 companies.  That client group has a range of companies and organizations including banks, security firms, e-commerce companies and manufacturing companies.  The service will be launched during the first half of 2020 for commercialized uses, the company said.  Founded in 2016, the fintech firm initially designed an ID service based on blockchain technology for non-face-to-face openings of banking accounts, the company said in June.  The South Korean financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, included the firm’s my-ID’ service into the ‘Innovative Financial Services and Regulations Sandbox.
