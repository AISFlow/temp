The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s attack on the project brought a drastic decline that no one expected. However, amid the ongoing case, XRP showed resilience, leading supporters to commend it as an asset to watch. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Down 4% As Developer Accuses Terraport Of Rugpull Even though the price has seen some pullbacks and rallies, the trend aligns with the fluctuations in the overall crypto market due to environmental factors. But today, the global market cap is up by 0.06%. XRP surpassed the first five assets with a 2.33% price gain in 24 hours. XRP Price Gains Even With Declining Network Activities The current price outlook for XRP is positive. The controversial asset trades above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. XRP price is $0.4814, with a 2.33% increase in 24 hours. Its seven-day price gains also show an addition of 5.89% in the same time frame. The hourly price change is also green, and CoinMarketCap data indicates the asset recorded a price change of 2.87% since yesterday’s closing price of $0.4803. The difference between XRP’s opening and closing price indicates an uptrend since April 28, and continuing today. There’s hope for more gains as it remains above its SMAs. However, the trading volume is declining by 48.86% in 24 hours. This indicates the traders’ uncertainty, given the upcoming summary judgment by Judge Torres. XRP Technical Outlook The Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator computes the closing price of XRP in the nearest days. Since XRP is trading above its 50-Day and 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA), there are strong bullish signals in the market in the coming days to weeks. For the past 39 days, March 21, 2023, there have been persistent Buy signals from the 200-Day SMA, while the 50-Day Buy Signal occurred in the last two days, April 27. As such, the XRP price may experience more rallies, resulting in price volatility for the asset. On the other hand, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) value of XRP is 49.02 at the time of writing. Its upward movement shows that the indicator is gradually approaching the overbought region (above 70). Thus, there would be a possible price rise for short and long-term trades. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential XRP’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below the signal line, confirming the asset’s current price drop. However, the faded histogram bar represents possible price growth in the nearest days. The asset’s support levels are $0.3074, $0.3622, and $0.4105, while its resistance levels are $0.5527. XRP is trading below its $0.5527 resistance. If the bullish pressure continues, the asset could break through this resistance level. According to the abovementioned indicators, XRP has a promising price outlook for the coming days and could extend to weeks. Thus, expect more rallies.

12195936,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529217,1682772042,Cosmos (ATOM) Price Displays Intense Momentum – What’s Driving The Rally?,"Cosmos (ATOM) demand has risen these past few days, resulting in a significant performance. According to CoinMarketCap data ATOM price has fallen to $11.69 after gaining momentum. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Down 4% As Developer Accuses Terraport Of Rugpull The current market cap of ATOM is $3.3 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $100 million. However, the trading volume is still down by 31.18%, indicating reduced network activity. Reason Behind The Surge In Cosmos? Cosmos is a constantly growing network of interconnected blockchains created with developer-friendly application components. Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is the technology that connects these apps. The SDK platform Cosmos offers allows programmers to produce top-notch decentralized apps (dApps). Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential Other developers have also constructed applications on top of it, such as MM Finance and VVS Finance. Cosmo’s (ATOM) recent price surge could be attributed to its influx of developers topping that of Ethereum. The other reason for the ATOM price increase might be the announcement from dYdX that it is building an independent blockchain on the Cosmos ecosystem instead of Ethereum. Also, Bitcoin price soared above $29,000, pushing the market cap of all cryptocurrencies to surpass $1 trillion. Many crypto assets, including ATOM, recorded price growth due to correlation to BTC. ATOM Price Action Below is the technical analysis of ATOM price action on the 4-hour trading timeframe. And also the possible resistance and support zones. Cosmos has broken through the short-term resistance level of $11.69 and is currently trading between $10.571 and $15.484 support and resistance levels. ATOM must break through the $15.484 primary resistance level to confirm the bullish momentum. However, the bears are trying hard to break the $10.571 support level but couldn’t due to the high bullish momentum. If the bull’s strength is not strong enough to push ahead, the bears might take over the trend and cause a trend reversal. What Do The Technical Aspects Suggest? ATOM’s 50-Day SMA’s change in direction caused the market’s structure to change. If the bullish momentum doesn’t pick up, the trend may change to a potential bearish market. The 50-Day SMA established a Death Cross by crossing below the 200-Day SMA, indicating a potentially bearish signal and suggesting a selling opportunity. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis indicator enables traders to determine the momentum and strength of the price movement of an asset within a period. At the time of analysis, the RSI of ATOM/USDT is at 61.74 above the neutral zone. Therefore, this shows that ADA is neither in the overbought nor oversold zone. However, the buyers are building momentum to take ADA to the overbought zone while the seller pushes it down despite weak momentum.

12195123,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529208,1682769925,Cardano Network Transactions Surge Despite Market Downturn,"Cardano (ADA) is in a downtrend as it sheds some of its recent price gains. Despite the price decline, it is experiencing a surge in transaction volume on the network. The network holds the enviable reputation of being a developer’s hub, with several exciting projects launched on its network. However, it is still subject to the general economic factors influencing cryptocurrencies, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Crypto Analyst Reviews ADA’s Performance A crypto analyst on Twitter, Elite XBT, noted that Cardano transaction volume has increased since the start of 2023. However, he stated that market volatility had put the price under significant pressure. According to the chart, the transaction volume fell below 10B ADA in January 2023. However, it has risen above 20B ADA and possibly reclaimed its 50B ADA at its all-time high (ATH) value last year. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Down 4% As Developer Accuses Terraport Of Rugpull According to another analyst, the increase in transaction volume is a function of increased activities from the whales and institutional holders. He believes the increased volume is a bullish sign and supports ADA’s swing into an uptrend. Also, Input Output Global (IOG), responsible for Cardano’s research and development, shared its weekly development report. The report revealed that Cardano’s network had processed 65.4 million transactions within the past week. Notably, Cardano surpassed 4 million wallets on its network in March 2023. It indicates the continued growth potential of the Cardano network as more investors sign up. Twitter user Alexander Legolas also believes that the current trend would shift from bear to bull as the protocols and upgrades become more attractive to users. What Next For ADA? ADA is still trading in the red today, forming a second consecutive red candle on the daily chart. The bears have returned to push their price down in the last two days. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 51.24 in the neutral zone. Notably, the indicator is moving downwards due to bearish pressure. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential ADA’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) has dropped below its signal line, a bearish sentiment. However, despite its price slump, ADA has remained above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). It implies that its short and long-term outlook remains bullish, and the decline might be a brief retracement for consolidation. The $0.3512 support will prove critical to prevent a further decline and might act as a price pivot to resume the uptrend. However, ADA must overcome the $0.4186 resistance to continue its uptrend. ADA will likely resume its uptrend in the coming days based on the positive activities and increased transactions on its network to fuel the rally.

LTC started the year trading at $70 on January 1, 2023. It moved to $80 by January 10 as the bulls seized control. The crypto traded at $100.44 on February 1 for the first time in 2023. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Down 4% As Developer Accuses Terraport Of Rugpull However, market volatility has forced the asset to retest its old lows and is currently trading in the $89-$90 price range. A closer look at the daily chart would reveal its price action and next possible moves. Litecoin Price On An Uptrend LTC has formed a green candle on the price chart today, a slight recovery from the bearish trend noticed on the chart on April 28. However, today’s price change is not by a wide margin as it remains a sideways trend despite its gains. LTC is trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a short and long-term bullish sentiment for the asset. Its Relative Strength Index is 48.18 in the neutral zone. Also, the indicator is moving sideways, reflecting the sideways trend on the daily chart. Litecoin has found strong support at the $88.25 level preventing further price decline for the asset. Other critical support levels are $65.39 and $47.5. Its resistance levels are $94.35 and $103.42. The $90 price level is a psychological resistance level that Litecoin is testing today. The coin will likely pivot off the $88.25 resistance level to trade above the $90 price level if the bulls prevail. However, the sideways trend might persist in the short term. Litecoin Halving Historically Bullish Litecoin undergoes halving every four years as a fork from the original Bitcoin blockchain. The Litecoin halving event occurs every 840,000 blocks and will drop LTC miners’ rewards from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential Blockworks reports that Litecoin historically pumps six months before its halving occurs. LTC peaked at 320% gains approximately 45 days before each halving, then gave up most of those returns a month after the halving event. NEWS: Litecoin halvings coincide with major price changes — but different from bitcoin.https://t.co/zDyxpS8YkI — Blockworks (@Blockworks_) April 24, 2023 LTC ended the year after each halving, gaining between 80% to 110% on its pre-halving price. Therefore, this event seems to promote positive price action for the asset. Although the hype around halving usually affects price action, other macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and regulation, also affect trends. However, halving events always usher in price volatility and uncertainty. The aim is to reduce the circulating supply of the token and increase scarcity. Given its historical data, the halving event will occur around August 2023 and may affect Litecoin in one way or another.

12193154,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529183,1682764941,USTC: Will Proposal To Re-Peg Stablecoin Push LUNC To $1?,"In one of the most catastrophic events to ever hit the crypto industry, the prominent algorithmic stablecoin TerraClassicUSD (USTC) – formerly UST – became depegged from the US dollar around a year ago. As a result, the Terra ecosystem crumbled, leading to uncontrolled minting and supply of Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens. However, in the latest developments, the Terra community is looking to approve a proposal to revive the ecosystem and restore USTC’s value peg with the US dollar. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Down 4% As Developer Accuses Terraport Of Rugpull USTC Re-Peg Proposal On Saturday, 22nd April, a Terra community member known as RedlineDrifter submitted a proposal that aims to re-peg stable coin TerraClassicUSD to the dollar. This proposal will enforce a re-pegging mechanism that implements divergence fees on USTC trades that slip below or rise above the peg. In this mechanism, the accrued fees will be used to repurchase the asset. This re-pegging plan proposes the implementation of various mechanisms, including divergence fees, USTC buybacks, and a swap and staking mechanism. What’s more, RedlineDrifter emphasized how these mechanisms will help maintain USTC’s value once it restores parity with the dollar. The re-pegging proposal looks set for approval, according to the figures from ATOMScan. As of this writing, 49.11% have voted in support of the proposal, while only 6.63% of the total votes are not in favor. That said, it is worth noting that 44.24% chose to sit on the fence. The votes are expected to end later today. Source: ATOMScan One major aspect of the proposal that the community will be hoping also goes through is the approval by centralized exchanges (CEXs). This is due to the fact that the proposal would require CEXs to enforce divergence fees on USTC sell orders below or above $1. Once the proposal gets the necessary approval, the L1 team will decide on a reasonable timeframe and will launch the re-pegging mechanism in four phases. How LUNC Is Faring So Far While USTC reacted to the recent development with a 10% price jump, LUNC has been somewhat subtle with its response. The cryptocurrency has experienced a 2.43% price increase in the past 24 hours and only a 2.9% rise in the past week. That said, a broader look at the LUNC’s market performance shows that the coin’s current price is an obvious improvement from the previous week’s slump. Between 15th April and 22nd April, LUNC lost more than 11% of its value, per CoinGecko data. Since the USTC re-peg proposal was put forward, there have been heavy discussions surrounding the resurgence of LUNC. This is mainly due to the inclusion of a mechanism to reduce the circulating supply of the token. This would involve using 45% of accrued USTC profit from the divergence fees to swap for LUNC. Hitting $1 is the target for Terra Classic (LUNC), but that would require extensive efforts from all ends, starting with the USTC re-peg mechanism. As of this writing, LUNC trades at $0.00011200, with a $663 million market cap. This means it would take a staggering 892,757% price rally for LUNC to hit the target of $1.

In the last week, ICP has taken center stage, recording the biggest gains among the major coins in the market. ICP Shows Its Mettle In Crypto Ranking According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Internet Computer token recorded an 18.25% gain over the last seven days, outperforming every other token in the top 50 crypto rankings within the same period. The web-affiliated altcoin initially began the week trading around $5.6 on Sunday. ICP showed no significant price action in the early days of the week but soon followed the Bitcoin price rally gaining by about 20.3% in the last two days. In this month of April, the Internet Computer token has been a focal point of investor’s interest, surging by about 24% to trade above $7 for the first time since February. Although it has fallen from such heights, the altcoin appears to have resumed its bullish trajectory following last week’s stunning performance. Related Reading: XRP May Rally Over 10% Upon Breaching Two Critical Levels At the time of writing, the ICP coin is trading at $6.32, having gone up by 5.16% in the last 24 hours. During this period, the Internet Computer coin has also recorded a 40.14% jump in its trading volume, hitting a value of $93.88 million. However, it must be said a lot is still desired from the ICP token, as its current market price represents a staggering 58.2% decline from its year-to-date (YTD) value, according to data from Coingecko. ICP Trading at $6.34 | Source: ICPUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Emerges As the King Of Assets,10X Growth Over Gold During US Banking Crisis ICP’s ckBTC Gains Ground, As Plans To Launch ckETH, Others Are Revealed Aside from the Bitcoin market-led surge, Internet Computer’s rise has also been driven by the announcement of the Chain-key Bitcoin (ckBTC), an ICRC-1- compliant token backed by Bitcoin 1:1. According to DFINITY, developers of ICP, the ckBTC token acts as a bitcoin twin enabling users to conduct fast, secure, and low-fee bitcoin transactions on the Internet Computer blockchain. The ckBTC distinguishes itself from other cross-chain derivatives tokens as its operation requires no centralized custodians, bridges, or traditional cloud providers operating a fully decentralized system. So far, this innovation has received much reception as 61.2628 ckBTC tokens (worth $1.795 million) have been minted on the ICP blockchain following the launch of the token four weeks ago. Source: Internet Computer Dashboard Moreover, ICPSwap, an affiliate account of the Internet Computer, has announced the upcoming integration of Ethereum and all ERC-20 tokens with the Internet Computer ecosystem.
