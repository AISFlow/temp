25870086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603542,1713308436,"XRP Price Set For 3,000% Rally To $22, Analyst Predicts","Crypto analyst Crypto Egrag has provided an update on his recent analysis, where he predicted that XRP would experience a significant price decline. Having called that correctly, Egrag has now predicted what the next move will be for the crypto token. XRP Price Could Rise To As High As $22 Egrag mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP’s next move “could be between 1000% and 3000%.” He acknowledged that the current market conditions might make it hard for anyone to envisage XRP seeing such a move. However, he added that the chart indicates that XRP would rise to between $10 and $22 if historical moves from 2017 or 2021 repeat themselves. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners To Lose A Whopping $10 Billion Following The Halving – Here’s Why Source: X Egrag also noted that XRP had hit the lower target he had predicted for the crypto token, suggesting it was well primed for such a parabolic rise due to this price correction. In his earlier analysis, the analyst had predicted that XRP could drop to as low as $0.44, which it eventually did on April 13. Since then, the token has recovered and is looking to break the $0.50 resistance level in preparation for its parabolic rise. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Lunc Maxi’s recent analysis also echoes sentiments similar to those shared by Egrag Crypto. The crypto analyst shared XRP’s daily chart and noted that it looks exactly like 2017 and “even had the same drop.” If XRP’s current price action follows 2017, then there is a greater likelihood of XRP hitting $22 than just stopping at $10 since Egrag’s chart showed that a similar move to 2017 will take the crypto token to that price level. XRP’s Short-Term Price Target In a subsequent X post, Egrag suggested that XRP might be headed to $1.4 in the short term. While he admitted that there could be further price declines before this move occurs, he added that XRP bulls have shown that they are willing to match the selling pressure from the bears. Therefore, it shouldn’t be long before the bulls take control and cause XRP’s price to surge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Weekly Golden Cross: Why This Analyst Believes The Bull Rally Is Far From Over He further urged XRP holders not to be deterred, stating that these price dips are “just opportunities for your bids to be filled, and these bids could be life-changing opportunities.” XRP’s rise to such price levels would indeed be life-changing for XRP investors. However, considering its unimpressive price action so far, it remains to be seen if the crypto token will attain such heights. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.49, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

However, one memecoin has been jumping on the roofs and assuring everybody hears it meow. Cat in a dogs world (MEW) is a new player in the memecoin market, having been out for less than a month. In this short time, the token has left its clowder behind and joined the high ranks of the top ten memecoins by market capitalization.` Related Reading: Dogecoin Usurped: These Memecoins Overtake DOGE In Active Trader Count From The Roofs To The Ocean The memecoin started remarkably, with a 267.54% growth during its first week. However, MEW is not immune to the crypto market dynamics, as its rally has slowed down with the corrections of Q2. During the latest Bitcoin correction, MEW experienced a price drop of over 52%, going from trading at $0.00402 to as low as $0.00189 over the weekend, as seen in the chart below. A whale didn’t miss the chance to profit from the dip and bought 479.6 million MEW on Sunday. MEW's perfomance followed Bitcoin's movements closely during the price correction. Source: Coingecko According to Lookonchain data, a whale withdrew 10,438 SOL, worth around $1.54 million, from Binance to buy MEW. The whale bought the cat-themed token at an average price of $0.0032, doubling its investment in 48 hours. At the time of this writing, the whale’s holdings are worth $3.12 million, and it has made over $1.56 million in profits. Moreover, after the first whale transaction, the token’s price began to recover from the drop, surging over 119% from its lowest point during the weekend as Monday started. Major Exchange Listing Boosts The Memecoin MEW continued its upward trajectory after being listed on one of the largest crypto exchanges by volume. On Monday, OKX announced the listing of popular token dogwifhat (WIF) and cat in a dogs world. After the announcement, the cat-themed memecoin’s price surged 38.22% before retracing to the support zone of $0.00450 as the day closed. Nonetheless, MEW stole WIF’s hat, as the dog-themed sensation registered a 15.2% drop in the last 24 hours.

Several cat memecoins launches offered massive gains to investors during the first days of Q2. Despite many of those gains being driven by the Solana memecoin frenzy, it appears that MEW holds stronger than others among the clowder. As Tuesday started, the token began to soar again, skyrocketing 21.3% in just one hour. MEW’s market activity also rose 17.7% in the past day, with a daily trading volume of $227.6 million. Similarly, the token has become a hot topic, according to CoinMarketCap data. In an X post, the crypto data platform revealed that MEW was third as the most mentioned token in its CMC community.

Brown, according to Bloomberg, said that his concerns would have to be addressed before he would fully get behind a stablecoin law, however.  Congress has for years struggled to get any new laws passed for cryptocurrencies, providing greater clarity sought by both critics and proponents of digital assets. Stablecoin legislation may, nonetheless, be the lowest-hanging fruit given that stablecoins strongly resemble other regulated products like money-market funds, and there's a strong incentive to create guardrails since they own important conventional assets like U.S. Treasuries.  Brown's reportedly tentative support to advance legislation could be an important sign progress can be achieved. His Democratic Party controls the U.S. Senate and thus sets legislative priorities.

BTC’s Next Price Target Expected At $650,000 In an X (formerly Twitter) post published on Monday, Willy Woo, a popular analyst and crypto expert with over 1 million followers, predicted Bitcoin’s next price target, fueled by the growth and demand of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Send 800 Million DOGE To Exchanges, Dump Incoming? According to Woo, Spot Bitcoin ETFs could propel the price of BTC to $91,000 at bear market bottoms, while during bull market tops, the cryptocurrency could skyrocket as high as $650,000. It’s important to note that at the time of writing, Bitcoin haD not even reached $100,000, and is trading at $63,408, according to CoinMarketCap. Woo has explained that BTC’s surge to this exponential level can only be possible when ETF investors completely utilize their capital. He highlights that a total capital deployment typically takes time, emphasizing that his price predictions are not constrained to the current crypto market cycle. The crypto analyst also predicted that BTC will eventually flip gold’s market capitalization as the asset manager’s capital is deployed. Basing his forecast on gold’s 12-year bull run after the launch of its ETF, Woo disclosed that Bitcoin could have a similar bullish trend soon. How Bitcoin Will Surge To $650,000 To efficiently explain his predictions, Woo provided a brief but clear insight into the potential impact Spot Bitcoin ETFs could have on the price of Bitcoin. He provided “back-to-envelope calculations” that could be used to fully understand how BTC could surge to $650,000. During his calculations, the crypto analyst estimated the total capital managed by asset managers at $100 trillion. He mentioned that the current allocation recommendation was 2% for Bitcoin, and given the total amount of assets managed, it would mean $2 trillion could potentially flow into BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Go On Buying Spree As Market Crash Leaves Retail Panicking Presently, Bitcoin holds about $561,159,959 of investments that can be measured on-chain. By adding the potential inflow from asset managers, the total investment in BTC would rise to $2.56 trillion. Woo also introduced a Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which compares the total market capitalization of Bitcoin to the amount of funds invested into it. The crypto analyst claimed that historically, this ratio usually surges by 5x during bull market tops and by 0.7x during bear market bottoms. Based on this ratio, Woo calculated the potential market capitalization of BTC, estimating a price of $12.8 trillion during bull tops and $1.8 trillion during bear bottoms. Dividing this total market capitalization by the amount of Bitcoin in circulation would position BTC’s price per coin at $650,000 and $91,000 respectively.

42390986,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRlJF,1713295952,"Spot Bitcoin ETF Hype Dies Down, Normalcy Sets In","Spot bitcoin ETF flows have slowed after weeks of heavy buying.  Only IBIT, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, continues its streak of consecutive daily positive flows.  This is a normal development within the ETF space, an expert said.  The initial euphoria for the spot bitcoin ETFs has seemingly dampened and reality is slowly kicking in with inflows recently unable to keep up with the still speedy pace of exits from Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).  The result is that in the week ended April 12, the spot ETFs as a whole saw a net outflow of 1,766 bitcoins.  On last Friday and again on Monday, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) had inflows of $0, breaking its streak of daily additions that started at launch on January 11. That leaves BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as the only spot bitcoin ETF left that's experienced an unbroken string of inflows since the vehicles began trading.  For most of the remaining funds, including the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR), among others, zero inflows and even the occasional outflow has become the norm.  This is not out of the ordinary, said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in a post on X. He points out that around 83% of all ETFs on the U.S. market saw zero inflows on Monday, for example.  Seyffart explained that the creation and redemption of shares of an ETF only takes place when a large enough mismatch in supply and demand exists and the cost to do so is lower than hedging. In the case of the bitcoin ETFs, these creation units range anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 shares. “Minor mismatches will see the market makers handle trading of shares just like they would a stock,” Seyffart wrote.  The recent slowdown doesn’t however mean that traders need to get used to lower flows. While the initial sentiment for the ETFs in the first few weeks of existence certainly resulted in volume higher than any other ETFs have seen before, traders could see more significant positive flows in the future.  “There is surely potential for a resurgence in inflows,” said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, which converted its bitcoin futures fund into a spot bitcoin ETF in March.  “Many banks, endowments, and pension funds worldwide are only now beginning their due diligence processes before considering strategic allocations to BTC through newly launched ETFs,"" Kerbage continued. ""As these large financial institutions make decisions over the coming months, it is likely that inflows will increase once again, potentially reaching new milestones for what has been one of the most successful ETF launches in US history.”  Turning to Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which continues to see outflows of 1,000 or more bitcoins on a daily basis, Seyffart isn't anticipating a reversal. “I do not really expect inflows into GBTC as it’s currently constructed,” he told CoinDesk. “With GBTC at a 1.5% expense ratio, I would be surprised if GBTC saw any net inflow days and shocked if it saw sustained inflows over any time period.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/16/spot-bitcoin-etf-hype-dies-down-normalcy-sets-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/368d36f6af1ca6b5b4d00f8e69ef32feec28c15c-4480x2520.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Sold Huge In Past 4 Months As analyst James Van Straten explained in a post on X, the long-term holders have massively reduced distribution during the last ten days. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors carrying their coins since more than 155 days ago. The LTHs comprise one of the two main divisions of the BTC sector, with the other cohort known as the “short-term holders” (STHs). The STHs are naturally the investors who bought within the past 155 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Next Major Demand Zone At $56,000: Brace For Impact? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell at any point. As such, the LTHs represent the more committed part of the BTC market. The STHs, on the other hand, are fickle-minded hands who may sell at the first sight of any FUD or profit-taking opportunity. As such, selling from the STHs is usually not that noteworthy. However, Selloffs from the LTHs can be something to watch for, as they rarely occur. One way to track the behavior of these Bitcoin cohorts is through the total amount of supply they carry in their respective combined wallets. The chart below shows the STH and LTH supply trend over the past year. How the supplies held by these two cohorts have changed during the past twelve months | Source: @jvs_btc on X As displayed in the above graph, the supply of Bitcoin LTHs increased through most of 2023. At the same time, the supply of STHs naturally decreased. Something to note here is that this increase in the LTH supply didn’t mean that these HODLers were buying then. Instead, some STHs bought 155 days ago and have finally held long enough to qualify for the cohort. Thus, there is a 155-day delay between accumulation and the increase registered in the LTH supply. When it comes to selling, though, no such time lag exists, as the LTHs who transfer coins on the blockchain immediately eject from the group and become part of the STHs. The chart shows that this trend of the supply of these diamond hands going up flipped this year, and the LTHs have been selling instead. In the past four months, these investors have distributed 700,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Showing Different Behavior From Past Cycles, But Why? This excludes the selloff from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has constantly been bleeding coins since the US SEC approved the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. These coins had also matured enough to become part of the LTHs. Recently, as the price has gone through some bearish action, the LTH supply has flatlined, implying that the selling from these HODLers has finally stopped, at least for now. Given this new trend, it now remains to be seen how BTC’s value develops from here. BTC Price Following the latest drawdown in Bitcoin, its price has dropped towards the $63,200 level.

Taking to X, the trader argues that Bitcoin has yet to breach the Golden Ratio Multiplier’s Cycle Top, currently sitting at $79,591. Supposedly, the analyst continues, this target price increases the longer it remains unchallenged. Bitcoin Traders Need To Be Patient So far, BTC is trending lower and is technically within a bear breakout formation following sharp losses on April 13. As the coin struggles for gains and is boxed inside the bear bar, the odds of further upswings like those registered in Q1 2024 remain muted. Related Reading: Elon Musk Latest Tweet: How Much Did Dogecoin Gain From It Today? However, even as BTC bulls are muted, the analyst emphasizes the prices are “respecting data points” despite prices dumping lower and taking longer to break higher. Most traders expect prices to rise higher following March 2024’s impressive surge. However, the analyst believes traders need to have patience. Looking at how BTCUSDT prices are unfolding, it is clear that momentum is fading, and participation is low. CoinMarketCap data shows that trading volume on the last day is flat, at $46 billion. Overall, trading volume–a measure of engagement and trader interest– has dropped since mid-March, when the coin soared to all-time highs of approximately $74,000. Whales Are Keeping Off From The Market Parallel data from IntoTheBlock reveals that addresses holding at least 0.1% have also been slowing down in their accumulation, making the drop even more severe. According to a CoinDesk report, when BTC fell on March 19, prices bounced strongly on March 20 following aggressive buying pressure whales. IntoTheBlock data showed they bought 80,000 BTC, forcing prices back to over $71,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Fire Sale?

The fact that whales appear to be keeping off could suggest that they expect prices to drop even more.

42390984,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRlE7,1713290269,What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving,"On April 19, or whenever a bitcoin miner mines block number 840,000, the amount of bitcoin {{BTC}} entering into circulation will halve from about 900 a day to 450. This event, colloquially known as the halving (sometimes halvening), looms large in the Bitcoin mindshare, one of those things that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Perhaps because it only comes around on Leap Years (so far), bitcoiners tend to look forward to the halving more than most crypto holidays like Bitcoin Pizza Day or the anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto publishing the white paper. But it won't be around forever.  This roundup is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.  Once all 21 million bitcoins are mined, the halving will have served its purpose and cease (likely in 2140). Why did Nakamoto make it this way? No one knows. Just like there's no real insight into why he chose a 21 million cap or Jan. 9 as launch day. There are many, many guesstimates that try to make sense of these seemingly arbitrary elements of Bitcoin's design. Because if there's one thing certain about Bitcoin, it's that it tends to split opinions.  And so, with an event as anticipated as the halving there are certainly things to argue over. Is it ""priced in"" (meaning will the reduction in supply of bitcoins entering the market cause a rally)? Will the reduced revenues drive bitcoin miners bankrupt? Will this time be any different?  CoinDesk turned to the crypto community to get their say:  Priced in?  Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital:  I am a longtime halving nihilist. The halving is *what it means* for bitcoin to be deflationary. It's been priced in since the first time someone bought bitcoin because it has a fixed supply. The timing of the halving has been baked in since Bitcoin was first launched six years ago.  People drawing charts and rainbows and all this nonsense over an event that has deterministically happened four times (on an asset that already goes up almost every single year) is pseudoscientific nonsense. But whatever, it's a good story.  Austin Campbell, assistant professor at Columbia Business School:  As bitcoin gains more of a foothold in traditional finance, events that were drivers of past cycles like the halving will cease to have as much of an impact, if any. Portfolio allocators think in multi-year and multi-decade terms, and the impact of events like the halving will be muted as this market segment grows, just like any market growing from new to mainstream sees volatility due to small idiosyncratic events decrease as liquidity and scale increase.  Azeem Khan, co-founder of Morph:  My personal opinion is the halving is likely priced in. We’ve seen institutional capital inflows for months now since the bitcoin spot ETF was approved. And even before that we were seeing a lot of liquidity enter the market without seeing traditional signs that retail was buying with things like Coinbase being the number one app in the App Store. To me, that indicated it was already institutional money coming in. They’re not dumb and have likely been buying ahead of this. Larry Fink didn’t get to where he is by accident.  My personal philosophy in this space has tended to be that when everyone agrees something is going to happen, it generally doesn’t. Similar to when we had Elon being a clown on SNL pumping $DOGE in 2021 and everyone had agreed it was going to $1, it dumped.  The investing approach I abide by has always been to dollar cost average. Pick an amount you’re willing to lose, set an auto buy for that amount of whichever assets you’ve done your research on, continue to buy over the long term every X period, and never look at the price. If you’re investing with a long term approach in mind, this will help you beat out 99% of the noise you see from gambling addicts, some of which turned out to be the lottery winners of Crypto Twitter when zooming out through the years.  Not priced in  Edan Yago, founder of Sovryn:  Definitely not priced in. Not even close. This is the most important halving since the first. This halving will bring new assets to Bitcoin in the form of Runes and the coming cycle will see Bitcoin Rollups add scalability and programmability to Bitcoin. Bitcoin block space will go from cheap to the scarcest computing resource in the world.  Ogle, founder of Glue:  I think this halving is distinct from prior ones because of the significant increase in capital coming into the market because of the ETF approvals. So you have a reduction of supply because of the halving itself, combined with increased demand from the ETFs — basic economic principles say this should result in a higher price. My guess is the halving has partially been priced in, but I don't think people quite realize the magnitude of buy pressure that is coming in via the ETFs — and that buy pressure is in my view going to significantly impact the price of BTC upward.  Uncle Rockstar Developer, core contributor to BTCPay:  Given the historical data — 9,575% increase post-2012, 3,233% post-2016, and 667% post-2020 — it's not a question of if the BTC/USD price will rise after this halving, but rather by how much. Feel free to quote me on that.  This time it’s different (or not)  Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at Tyr Capital:  Bitcoin remains a viable doomsday asset in 2024, as its correlation to gold recently increased, and investors continue to diversify away from traditional financial assets. The ETF is currently spearheading this doomsday rally and we should expect $120,000 to be hit in the coming months as global geopolitics continues to deteriorate and the middle classes continue to find ways to protect their wealth.  We believe that price action ahead and post-halving is going to be different from past events as there are new variables affecting bitcoin. The combination of an uncertain geopolitical situation, choppy U.S. spot ETF flows, record leverage and recalibration of the U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy is going to create an explosive combo and lead to extremely volatile market conditions. We would not be surprised to see BTC trade as low as $55,000 and as high as $75,000 in the coming couple of weeks. We remain very bullish into year-end though and consider $120,000 to be a realistic target.  Roger Ver, creator of Bitcoin Cash:  Nothing special happened for the last three halvings. I don’t expect this time to be any different.  See also: The Bitcoin Halving Really Is Different This Time  Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of Komodo Platform:  The biggest difference between the 2020 halving and the 2024 halving is skyrocketing institutional demand. Prior to the previous halving, institutions were on the sidelines. The market was dominated by retail investors. Since then, the market dynamic has drastically shifted. As one example, MicroStrategy didn’t make its first BTC purchase until August 2020. As of April 2024, the company reportedly holds 214, 246 BTC (roughly $13.625 billion). Of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, around 12.27% currently belong to publicly traded and private companies, ETFs and countries.  Adam Blumberg, co-founder of Interaxis:  The halving will have likely an impact on the price, as we have greater demand than ever from ETF investors, bitcoin hodlers and even corporations, and we're coupling that with decreasing new supply. We'll also see impact on miners who have tremendous capital and electricity outlays, and will get their production cut in half.  Impact on mining  Colin Harper, researcher and writer for Luxor Technology’sHashrate Index:  This halving could be unprecedented with regards to how it affects Bitcoin's total network hashrate. It's plausible that we see no hashrate come offline after the halving, or that we will see the smallest decrease in network hashrate after any other halving event in Bitcoin's history. Mining margins won't be as good after the halving as they are now, obviously, but they won't be horrendous. And if the new Runes fungible token protocol makes a significant impact on transaction fees, then margins will be healthy enough to keep miners with higher costs online for longer than not.  For comparison, Bitcoin's hash rate declined 15% after the 2020 halving, 5% after 2016's halving, and 13% after 2012.  See also: Why Bitcoin Halving Calculators Are Out of Sync  Joe Downie, chief marketing officer at NiceHash:  This halving is different, we will likely see less volatility than previous ones, for a few reasons: one is that Bitcoin mining is far stronger than it has ever been before in terms of hashrate, another is the level of legitimacy Bitcoin has gotten recently due to institutional funds and ETFs, plus the fact that a lot of people are in “wait and see” mode. This makes for a far more stable basis for BTC to hold its current value and gradually increase over the course of this year. There may be some short term volatility during the following week or two after the halving, but I expect things to stabilize quickly after that.  Troy Cross, professor of philosophy at Reed College:  There are two sides of the halving story: price impact and mining impact. On the price side, I don't have anything to say. The ""supply shock *should* be priced in, but every time I have thought that and every time I've been wrong. I won't pretend to read the collective psyche. With everyone anticipating that everyone else is irrational and *not* pricing it in, who knows what will happen?  I tweeted recently about the U.S. government’s holdings of bitcoin, over 200,000 bitcoins, and much of it Silk Road seizure. In terms of the impact on supply, that's at least as important as the halving event.  But on the mining side, the halving does get me excited.  The halving will force miners to seek out even cheaper power than they already have. Some miners will go under, selling off their equipment to those with more efficient operations.  The breakeven point for profitably running an ASIC will nearly drop in half. Miners will start curtailing more often, particularly their older machines.  What happens next depends on bitcoin's price action, but if prices do not rise dramatically, we will see a dip in hashrate while ASICs find cheaper homes, and then mining will settle into its ""dung beetle"" role, consuming only wasted, stranded energy.  The differences between a cost-sensitive consumer of energy like bitcoin and traditional data centers or AI data centers--or really any other electricity consumer--are already clear, but after the halving, bitcoin's flexibility — shutting down whenever electricity prices rise — and its opportunism, finding pockets of currently-stranded energy, bottlenecked by transmission constraints, will be even more dramatic.  Maria Bustillos, founder of Flaming Hydra, a part of the Brick House co-op:  I just hope this finally, FINALLY gets people reckoning the gigantic difference in environmental costs between PoW and PoS blockchains.  Effects on adoption  Peter Todd, founder of OpenTimestamps and Bitcoin Core developer:  The halving is one of the dumbest parts of how Bitcoin was designed. If you're going to reduce subsidy over time, the right way to do it is gradually, rather than shocking the system every four years. Fortunately fees are getting higher, so the risk of havings is reducing. Hopefully this one goes alright.  Fortunately fees are getting higher, so the risk of havings is reducing. Hopefully this one goes alright.  Zooko Wilcox, founder of Zcash:  I’m interested in the Bitcoin halving because of supply effects. I have come to frankly detest that part of the markets which is independent of fundamentals. You know what I mean: hype, narrative, people buying when they see something go up and selling when they see something go down. The Keynesian Beauty Contest, the Greater Fool Theory. Memecoins. Memestocks. Pump and dumps. Insider trading. Misinformation/disinformation/FUD. I was always naturally against such stuff, but my long painful experience in the crypto world has made me hate it.  Bitcoin’s and Zcash’s assured supply limits is the very opposite of that — the thing that no amount of hype or misinformation or mass mania can touch. And it’s interesting to think about the difference between talking about the supply of Bitcoin and Zcash being 21 million, versus talking about it being the ongoing addition to the supply from mining.  Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital:  The Bitcoin halving is the programmatic mechanism that creates and enforces bitcoin’s most famous quality: its scarcity. While this fourth halving reduction in new daily issuance from ~900 BTC to ~450 BTC is small in absolute terms and relative to BTC’s daily float of $10-$25 billion, nonetheless prices are set on the margin. But beyond any supply impact – which I believe is marginal – this is the first halving in which major U.S. asset managers are educating on Bitcoin, and there’s no better Bitcoin education than learning about the halving. It’s a narrative event first – a quadrennial market moment – and a supply event second, though I think both aspects will be impactful.  Tatiana Koffman, general partner at Moonwalker Capital and author of the Myth of Money newsletter:  The most significant impact of the Bitcoin halving is its influence on the energy input and mining difficulty of Bitcoin, which inherently supports a higher baseline price for the cryptocurrency.  This phenomenon can be closely likened to gold mining, where the principle of scarcity plays a crucial role. As more gold is extracted, the remaining reserves become increasingly scarce, making it more challenging and costly to find and extract new deposits. This requires more investment in exploration and advanced machinery for mining and processing the gold.  See also: Will the Next Bitcoin Halving Be Another Hype Cycle?  Similarly, Bitcoin's scarcity is engineered through a difficulty adjustment algorithm that halves the mining rewards roughly every four years. This not only reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced but also adjusts the mining difficulty to maintain a steady rate of block creation, regardless of the total computational power on the network. This mechanism ensures that as Bitcoin becomes scarcer, the effort and cost to mine it increase, supporting its price over time.  The halving mechanism is fundamental to preserving Bitcoin's integrity as a store of value. It underscores the cryptocurrency's deflationary nature, which is critical for its long-term valuation and the security of its network. By intentionally reducing the influx of new Bitcoins, the halving events reinforce Bitcoin's status as a digital equivalent of gold, making it a potentially attractive option for future generations looking for reliable value preservation in the face of inflationary fiat currencies.  Bradley Rettler, philosophy professor at the University of Wyoming:  The bitcoin halving has two purposes. The first is to attract attention, thereby drawing ever more people into the network. The second is to reassure people that the rules are still in charge.  Anil Lulla, co-founder of Delphi Digital:  I think the halving is always just a great marketing event built into Bitcoin every four years. It obviously has an impact on its supply, but more than that it gets everyone to pay attention to the asset and how it works. I think this halving is extra special because of two things (1) The ETF and (2) the Bitcoin Renaissance happening right now. The ETF is straightforward and widely covered, so I’ll focus on (2). Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s. I don’t think the Bitcoin ecosystem has had this much excitement around it in years. It’s driving a lot of attention, experimentation and innovation to Bitcoin at a time when it’s much needed.  Burak Tamac, adjunct professor at Montclair State University:  The Bitcoin halving reduces barriers to adoption in three key ways:  1. The concept is not only easy to understand, but we need something to contrast when learning new concepts.  2. Comparing the halving to fiat money supply highlights the direct contrast between the two. However, these two factors alone won't drive rapid mass adoption. This is where the third point becomes crucial:  3. It is also very easy to explain. New bitcoiners can quickly understand and convincingly share the concept with others.  What distinguishes this halving is that not only bitcoiners but also major financial institutions have been educating their clients about its importance.  Institutional interest  David Zane Morris, editor of the Dark Markets newsletter:  I expect a price rise after the halving, largely thanks to the new ETFs. There are a lot of new investors who are still learning the nuances of Bitcoin, and there is now a very easy way for them to buy into sentiment or narratives. That lack of friction is the truly new factor here, and I expect it to matter.  James Wester, a tech analyst at Javelin Strategy:  This halving is definitely coming at an interesting time as we are still figuring out the effects of the bitcoin ETFs on demand. That makes it harder to determine how much of the halving is effectively priced in. That said, all of the issues that have gotten us here still remain--the ETFs, institutional interest--so it is reasonable to believe that demand will continue to drive the price up in the longer term.  Aubrey Strobel, advisor to Trust Machines, Lolli and Pubkey:  Consider this — in just a span of three or four months, we've witnessed the launch of 11 bitcoin ETFs, with four of them marking the most successful debuts in history. The combined capital in these ETFs has already exceeded 50% of the assets under management (AUM) in gold, a milestone achieved in a fraction of the time it took for gold to reach its current status over 20 years. Now, with only 450 new bitcoins entering the market daily, coupled with significant investments from major asset managers like Fidelity, Blackrock and also Michael Saylor, the demand-supply dynamics are evident. It's simple math to anticipate the trajectory ahead.  What critics say  Molly White, author the Citation Needed newsletter:  Although responsible investment advisers will often warn that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", that's largely the kind of thought process that goes into predictions for the halving. ""Number went up last time, so number go up again"". More sophisticated explainers might delve into supply and demand, suggesting that the gradual closing of the bitcoin faucet amid roughly steady demand is what drives prices higher. Either way, some people are piling into bitcoin in belief of guaranteed double-your-money returns, if not better.  These folks might do well to be a bit more cautious.

I can't think of a single thing about Bitcoin in the past four years I'd actually feel excited to write about. even stuff like Lightning slowly whimpering out should've been old news in 2020.  Bennett Tomlin, head of research at Protos:  The Bitcoin halving serves the important function of reducing the incentives to waste energy on Bitcoin and ensuring that many poorly run bitcoin miners will once again be forced to confront the challenging economics of their businesses.  Bitfinex'ed, Tether critic:  It’s not events that dictate price in crypto, prices in this market are determined by the heads of the market, notably Tether and their co-conspirators.  If you want a quote from an influential person, Giancarlo Devasini, the CFO of Tether.  “Illiquid markets such as bitcoin are easy prey for manipulation”, being as the primary trading pair is Tether and not the U.S. dollar, the prices are whatever he wants them to be.

42390991,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRlt9,1713289770,Is the Bitcoin Rally Over? Reasons to Stay Bullish on BTC Despite Correction,"Crypto correction has clobbered investor sentiment, but there are still plenty of reasons to stay bullish on digital assets, analysts say.  Leverage wipe-out made the market ""much healthier,"" a K33 analyst said.  Bitcoin halving may have positive impact on price with spot BTC ETFs reaching a wider audience, an LMAX Group strategist noted.  Stock market weakness could weigh on crypto assets, but drop would be short-lived with other narratives at play, macro analyst Noelle Acheson said.  Crypto markets took a sizable gut punch over the weekend, sending investors' sentiment to the basement from euphoric highs only a few weeks ago.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} tumbled below $62,000 on Tuesday, lower by more than 15% from its latest record price above $73,000, while altcoin darlings solana {{SOL}}, pepe coin {{PEPE}} and dogwifhat (WIF) suffered 40%-50% setbacks from recent highs.  Despite the sizable drawdown across the board, there are still a handful of reasons to be bullish on digital assets even if prices cool off further or chop sideways for a while.  Bitcoin halving effect  Bitcoin will undergo its fourth halving later this week, a recurring event in roughly every four years when the newly issued supply of tokens – the rewards for miners – will be cut in half. Historically, bitcoin's price didn't move much around the time of halving, but the event preceded parabolic rallies.  ""As far as the halving event goes, we’ve been in the camp where we don’t expect there to be much additional upside momentum,"" said Joel Kruger, a market strategist at LMAX Group, adding that ""this is a known event that has been well telegraphed by the market.""  However, with spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) listed in the U.S. from traditional finance giants like BlackRock and Fidelity starting ramping up their sales machines to financial advisors and wealth managers introducing bitcoin to a broader investor base, this halving might bring some tailwinds for bitcoin's price.  ""At the same time, we do believe there is some room for a rally when considering this is the first bitcoin halving that will be playing out in front of a much wider audience, now that the bitcoin spot ETFs are up and running,"" Kruger pointed out.  ""The halving event could therefore get these investors more excited about bitcoin, as they are forced to take a deeper dive, which could then translate to the desire to take on even more exposure,"" he added.  Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, last week noted BlackRock advertising its bitcoin fund IBIT on financial news outlet Bloomberg's homepage.  Defying macro turbulence  While momentum on crypto markets faltered over the past weeks, the catalyst that eventually kickstarted to correction last Friday stemmed from macro events. Traditional markets turned jittery on increasing fears of military escalation between Israel and Iran, while bond yields and the U.S. dollar rose sharply as investors priced out rate cut expectations amid strong U.S. economic data and rising concerns of sticky inflation.  Noelle Acheson, macro analyst and author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, pointed out that the earnings yield on the S&P 500 is now below that of both 3-month and the 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which could foreshadow further downside for U.S. equities. The relation should be the other way, to compensate investors for the higher risk in owning stocks rather than bonds, she explained.  ""If [the stock market] drops sharply, BTC and other crypto assets could get temporarily hit as well,"" Acheson said.  However, ""the crypto drop would be short-lived, though, as other ongoing narratives – store of value, halving, currency hedge, new use cases, growing adoption – will encourage accumulation at lower levels,"" she added.  Acheson said that there might be some potential good news on the short-term that would offer relief from rising yields that squeezed risk assets recently, although it's not very likely.  ""The Federal Reserve could revert to insisting that rate cuts are imminent, which should temper the rise in yields,"" she said. ""I'm not expecting this, but if it happens, risk assets should do well.""  Leverage wipe out  Massive liquidation events on derivatives markets often mark the bottom for asset prices, wiping out excessive leverage and cleansing the market from exuberance. Crypto markets endured one of their most brutal leverage flush, liquidating over $1.5 billion of bullish bets on Friday and Saturday combined.  ""The market is now much healthier,"" Vetle Lunde, senior market analyst at K33 Research said. ""Both open interest and funding rates have been drastically reduced, reducing the likelihood of liquidation cascades onwards.""  ""This, accompanied by a bitcoin holding firm above $60,000, is a robust signal,"" Lunde added.  The events are reminiscent of last August's action, when BTC plunged from $28,000 to near $24,000 with liquidations nearing $1 billion across all digital assets. Following the largest daily drawdown since the FTX crash, prices hovered in a range for almost two very dull months until October's breakout above $30,000 to much higher prices.  Typical bull market pullback  With BTC pulling back 16% from its recent all-time high in March, the current drawdown is in line with typical drawdowns of previous bull markets.  The 2016-2017 and 2020-2021 bull cycles all had multiple 20%-30% pullbacks before continuing to much higher prices. ""Few understand how normal corrections like these are in bull markets,"" crypto analyst On-Chain College said in an X post.  Despite the current nervousness, hedge fund QCP Capital said Tuesday that it continued to see consistent, sizable demand for BTC and ETH calls for longer-term expiries out to March 2025, signaling that market participants still expect higher prices coming.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/16/is-the-bitcoin-rally-over-reasons-to-stay-bullish-on-btc-despite-correction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0275c126142cc779b48ca93b5686aee965f56a46-4592x2583.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This list has been making the rounds in the crypto community due to the top 5 alone being worth billions of dollars. But perhaps, what is more interesting is how much of this money has now been deemed inaccessible. 3 Of The Top 5 Crypto Rich List Lost Forever Arkham took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the top 10 richest individuals in crypto ranked by the net worth of their wallet holdings. But the most interesting bits actually lay in the list of the top 5 richest individuals, which included the likes of Tron’s Justin Sun and Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Weekly Golden Cross: Why This Analyst Believes The Bull Rally Is Far From Over According to the data shared by Arkham, Justin Sun emerged at the top of the list with a wallet balance of $1.1 billion, followed by Rain Lohmus, the Chairman of LHV Bank, whose wallet is worth $793 million. Next in line is Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, with a wallet balance of $782 million. In fourth place is Stefan Thomas, a software engineer whose wallet holds a considerable $452 million. And then last but not least is James Fickel, with a total wallet net worth of $446 million. Altogether, these crypto millionaires and billionaire, hold a total of $3.5 billion. However, not all of this money is available to the owners. As Arkham notes in its report, two out of these five individuals are no longer able to access their wallets anymore. The first of these two is Rain Lohmus who had invested $75,000 during the Ethereum ICO. Lohmus’s allocation came out to 250,000 ETH, which has appreciated greatly over time. However, he can no longer access the coins. According to Lohmus, he had lost access to his Ethereum wallet and was unable to find the key to the wallet. Given this, the coins are presumed to be lost forever, but Lohmus has offered a 50-50 split to anyone who can access the wallet and recover the funds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Goes Pro: UFC Winner Wants $300,000 Bonus Paid In BTC Another individual whose coins are deemed lost is Stefan Thomas. Thomas is infamous in the crypto space for throwing out a flash drive that held the private keys to a wallet containing over 7,000 BTC over 10 years ago. Since then, Thomas has led efforts to excavate the landfill where he believes his trash was sent to, in an effort to recover the flash drive and recover the coins. However, he has run into various issues, such as the city not allowing him to excavate the dump site. The other three on the list still have access to their wallets and are still involved in the crypto space to varying degrees.

42390974,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRkTx,1713284409,'DePIN' Is Venture Capitalists' Latest Crypto Obsession. Can It Match the Hype?,"Venture capitalists have pumped billions into the DePIN sector already, with some dedicating entire funds to DePIN protocols.  Although DePIN projects currently have a combined market capitalization of tens of billions of dollars, the industry faces one of the oldest challenges in crypto: relatively few customers.  Analysts point out that DePIN projects that have serious potential are ones where demand for the underlying service is clearly identifiable, meaning that the customers already exist.  So much of the cryptocurrency industry lives in the ether, figuratively or literally: data moving around blockchains, lines moving up or down on price graphs and other largely intangible things.  But a hot emerging trend that has venture capitalists salivating promises a direct tie to the real world: running infrastructure with blockchains. Projects like the Helium protocol, which drives a wireless network with a token-powered ecosystem, or Filecoin's data-storage platform.  The not-so-catchy term for all this is decentralized physical infrastructure networks, which usually gets shortened as DePIN. A catchy amount of money has already been invested, a sign venture capital firms see potential. According to a Crypto.com report, the top DePIN projects have raised more than $1 billion combined.  ""We believe DePIN is a category that has the potential to host a killer app with a billion users,"" Pranav Kanade, a portfolio manager of VanEck's digital assets alpha fund, said in an interview. ""These users would be using public blockchains without necessarily realizing they are interacting with a crypto product.""  Yet for all the obvious interest from the VC community, DePIN faces one of the oldest challenges in crypto: relatively few customers.  Read more: 5 Years After the $500K Ethereum Wager Between Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song, Who Won?  DePIN projects collectively have tokens worth tens of billions of dollars. But how much revenue are they, as a group, generating? Something like $15 million a year, said Rob Hadick, a general partner at Dragonfly, a crypto venture capital fund. ""Most of the protocols aren't constrained by supply, but by a lack of demand,"" he said in an interview.  Nonetheless, DePIN is quickly shooting up the list of crypto buzzwords.  What is DePIN?  DePIN projects are blockchain-based and operate physical hardware infrastructure in a decentralized way. They often use token reward systems to incentivize users to help build out their networks. The sector covers a wide range of areas including wireless connectivity, data collection, computing and data storage to name a few.  Traditionally, infrastructure like a wireless network is completely centralized; giants like AT&T, Deutsche Telekom or China Mobile are in full control of their telephone networks and their customers pay a fee to use their service, and that's as far as users' clout goes.  Helium's DePIN-driven network, on the other hand, is decentralized; members of the public can set up hotspots and get rewarded with HNT tokens for helping run the wireless network. Other DePIN projects have similar community-driven systems.  The total market capitalization of all DePIN tokens exceeded $25 billion as of February, according to Crypto.com research. Computing, storage and artificial intelligence accounted for the majority of that.  While that is an eye-catching amount, that market cap is not pumped up by a flood of retail investors' money, according to Christopher Newhouse, a decentralized finance, or DeFi, analyst at Cumberland Labs. Instead, DePIN is so far a playground for large institutions and VCs, he added.  ""This could be a good opportunity to get involved and pick up a few DePIN-related tokens while people aren't watching,"" Newhouse said in an interview.  For retail traders, there are myriad other distractions at the moment – bitcoin {{BTC}} hitting a record high and meme coins posting huge rallies, to name just two. ""There is a very retail-driven frenzy for hot coins,"" Newhouse said. By comparison, it can be harder to buy DePIN tokens since they're not broadly available on retail-friendly exchanges.  Newhouse said he was examining a few liquid DePIN tokens, including Nosana {{NOS}} and Render {{RNDR}}. ""But some of the most interesting ones like io.net haven't even launched a token yet.""  Solana's role  Render, io.net and Nosana – which run decentralized computing networks, or platforms to which people can contribute computing resources that others can use – are all built atop the Solana {{SOL}} blockchain. About 20 DePIN projects are, according to the Solana Foundation. One of the most prominent ones, Helium {{HNT}}, last year abandoned its own blockchain in favor of Solana's. (Despite Solana's own history of outages, it is more reliable and stable than Helium's was, according to Helium blog posts.)  Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FundStrat, many are there because Solana makes it easy for them. ""A lot of these DePIN projects would have been required to build on a high-throughput chain with no adoption or to build their own,"" he said. ""Now that Solana has entered the fold as a legit place to build, this has solved the infra problem.""  One key advantage Solana has over other layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum {{ETH}}: It has the bandwidth to relatively inexpensively handle a high volume of transactions, rather than needing to pass them off to a more-efficient layer-2 blockchain. It's famously expensive and sluggish to do transactions on Ethereum, giving rise to the bundle of layer 2s in its ecosystem; Solana has gone a different route.  Hivemapper, a decentralized mapping network that rewards contributors with its native token HONEY, is built on Solana. According to co-founder Ariel Seidman, there were three reasons Hivemapper chose it: low transaction fees, ease-of-use and the quality of the ecosystem.  ""DePIN tokens become immediately usable in DeFi apps on Solana as opposed to perhaps being built on an L2 and needing to have interop tools to interact with apps on ETH mainnet or other L2s,"" said Farrell. ""I think Helium Mobile has demonstrated how to effectively build both sides of a network,"" he added. ""Supply and demand – I think that's what was missing from"" the layer-1 blockchain it had built. ""This is a good proof of concept that other projects can build off of,"" Farrell said.  Venture capital interest  DePIN projects have attracted a significant amount of attention from venture capital funds.  Borderless Capital, for instance, has been investing in projects since 2021 and was an early backer of the Helium network. It runs a dedicated DePIN fund that has done more than 30 investments in the space and has raised money from the likes of Jump, Telefónica and OKX.  Borderless Capital noted in their DePIN investment thesis that adoption and usage of these networks (including Helium) are still at very early stages. Borderless told CoinDesk that it is in the process of creating the $100 million DePIN Fund III to support the growing DePIN ecosystems in Solana.  ""We see a lot of potential in the intersection of Crypto+AI, mobility, mapping, wireless networks and digital resources, where DePIN has a competitive advantage in terms of efficiency that translates into better and cheaper services being built for the end consumer,"" said David Garcia, managing partner at Borderless.  Dragonfly's Rob Hadick thinks that while DePIN interest amongst VCs is here to stay, there is an issue to be tackled with the lack of users on said protocols.  ""Investors spend a lot of their time imagining how crypto and blockchains will bring about a new financial or social paradigm,"" Hadick said. ""But the hot DePIN projects look and feel more tangible, making it easier to drum up excitement.""  That said, these projects currently generate very little revenue. ""This means that their token mechanisms don't solve the core problem of having to execute traditional go-to-market strategies in very competitive verticals filled with entrenched incumbents,"" Hadick said, adding that no DePIN project has accumulated a notable number of users. ""It's unclear how this momentum sustains until, or if, we see someone buck that trend.""  Anand Iyer, founder of Canonical Crypto, an early stage VC, said they are seeing the true utility of decentralized hardware come to life as the computing needs for AI surge.  ""Companies and protocols like Akash Network and Ritual are leading the way here and we expect to see more players leveraging decentralized networks for non-crypto use cases,"" Iyer said.  Risks and challenges  According to Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at FRNT, DePIN projects pose a higher risk for investors compared to more established investments like exchanges, mining or staking infrastructure. He noted: ""Incentivizing the development of physical infrastructure is another level of commitment towards a project.""  A large proportion of DePIN projects use tokens as a form of reward to incentivize users to crowdsource and build connected real-world physical infrastructure.  ""The use of tokens with questionable long-term value to incentivize the development of what can at times be costly physical infrastructure can be a tall order,"" Savic said. ""DePIN is higher along the risk curve in a space where risk abounds.""  Brian Rudick, a strategist at GSR, echoes Savic. While he thinks there will be several DePIN projects that make a breakthrough, the key determinant will be the quality of the product or service provided.  ""In theory, DePIN projects can pass through their lower infrastructure build costs to customers to spur demand,"" he said. ""However, in practice, the DePIN products or services offered can be of lower quality than incumbent solutions that were optimized over decades, negating this cost advantage.""  AI-related DePIN projects like Render, as well as decentralized cloud marketplaces like Akash, are ones to watch, according to Rudick.  A Crypto.com report also points out that price volatility could pose a challenge for DePIN projects. Most rewards for DePIN networks are paid out in the platform's own token, which means price fluctuation in these tokens could impact the earnings for contributors over time, the report said.  ""Major volatility may discourage ongoing involvement if rewards are seen as an unreliable revenue stream,"" said the report.  Most DePIN projects follow the burn and mint equilibrium model, a format that requires both supply and demand to work. The model uses a two-token system: contributors earn tokens and consumers burn tokens upon using them for payments – sustaining an economic equilibrium.  Pranav at VanEck's digital assets liquid fund splits a DePIN's project likelihood of success into two categories. The first: projects that take the ""build and they will come"" approach. These need to scale the supply side of a network with token incentives, which inflates the token supply.  ""Only if the supply of that service reaches a critical scale can the demand side be addressed. These projects tend to be highly speculative, and in many cases, the demand doesn't exist, making it difficult to find users,"" said Pranav.  He said he doesn't believe this bucket of DePIN projects will succeed in the long-run, as the demand (token burn) is unclear, and the token supply schedule ends up being ever-inflating.  Projects that do have potential, according to Pranav, are ones where demand for the underlying service is clearly identifiable, meaning that the customers already exist. The end goal of these types of protocols is usership that will be using public blockchains without actually realizing they are interacting with a crypto product, according to Pranav.  ""This approach would allow the DePIN project to build an economic moat against its legacy centralized competitors,"" Pranav explains. ""We believe these projects have a higher likelihood of success, as they can balance token supply and demand much earlier in the lifecycle of the token's existence.""

The post read: With the historical tendency to produce -30% pullbacks, what happens to the landscape if BTC does head down for a -30% correction and into the $51,000? Cold Blooded Shiller drew attention to a previous post offering investors insights on taking advantage of this development when it happens. Shiller is confident that BTC might undergo the correction mentioned above, and the impact on altcoins would likely be around -50%. The expert believes some investors are eager to profit in the bull cycle but neglect the risk involved in this period. “I keep referencing buy anywhere you want with risk management that supports -30% downside and ensure you can keep buying more,” he stated. Thus, the analyst has stressed the need for investors to be well organized and understand what constitutes an opportunity-filled environment in a bull market.

42390980,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRkyj,1713282705,Bitcoin Miners Must Optimize to Survive,"On or around April 19, the fourth Bitcoin halving will take place, cutting in half the rewards miners receive for solving a block on the Bitcoin blockchain. The halving event is programmed into Bitcoin's protocol every 210,000 blocks and occurs roughly every four years. It is designed to limit the digital asset’s total supply and establish a fundamental scarcity. Therefore, efficiency is critical for bitcoin {{BTC}} mining companies to remain competitive as the 2024 halving approaches and even as the following halving in 2028 is considered.  To prepare, bitcoin miners must examine three key areas of their business: power, operations and software.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.  Adam Sullivan is CEO of Core Scientific, a bitcoin mining firm.  Power is bitcoin miners' single largest cost item and it bounds the ability to bring hashrate online. By nature of the highly competitive market, miners only target low-cost and stranded power. Optimizing the efficiency of mining operations is extremely important and is driven mainly by the energy efficiency of the Bitcoin mining machines in a company’s fleet. To compensate for the revenue cut, miners are improving average fleet energy efficiency by replacing older, less efficient miners with the latest and most efficient miners. Overall, more efficient fleets will improve margin profiles and competitive positioning within the industry.  See also: The Halving Highlights Why Bitcoin Needs to Upgrade  Another way that miners can cut power costs is by relocating to locations with lower power prices, many of which are in developing economies. However, developing economies tend to have less reliable electrical grids, frequently driven by less reliable transmission infrastructure, increasing the likelihood of power interruption and downtime for miners. Lower power pricing with greater downtime may offset the benefits of establishing operations in those locations. Companies can also extend the lifespan and value of their machines by having different types of power contracts within their portfolio, allowing them to allocate machines based on their efficiency.  In addition to maximizing the energy efficiency of machines, miners must also work to maximize the utilization of their energized hash rate to ensure that they earn the highest quantity of bitcoin possible and generate the highest return on their investment. Maximizing hash rate utilization depends on the quality of a company’s mining infrastructure and the ability of its data center operations teams to maintain fleet performance at the highest productivity levels possible. Data centers should be located, designed and operated to maximize the performance of the machines for as long as they are profitable and minimize downtime, using the latest technologies and approaches.  See also: The Rise of ASICs: A Step-by-Step History of Bitcoin Mining (2020)  As bitcoin mining companies scale their operations, their ability to manage a growing fleet of mining equipment becomes a critical enabler of efficiency and hash rate utilization, particularly when their operations span multiple geographic locations. Software solutions that provide fleet management and optimization for hundreds of thousands or millions of miners enable efficient, scaled operations across time zones and borders. Combined with energy management software that provides control of a mining fleet in response to changes in power pricing, bitcoin mining companies depend on software to optimize operations and maximize profitability.  Bitcoin miners who have not optimized their existing infrastructure, built their own high-performing data center team, developed their own software stack, and managed their power contracts effectively will face a difficult period after the halving. They will be highly vulnerable to larger players who have the infrastructure to dramatically improve their operations. As a result, the bitcoin mining industry will likely see consolidation as miners with access to more capital continue to expand their operations opportunistically. To remain competitive, it is even more important for smaller miners to prioritize efficient, productive operations.  By design, bitcoin is a finite resource, and mining for bitcoin will be increasingly competitive with each succeeding year. By reallocating existing sites and resources to support other forms of compute, miners can effectively future proof their power allocations as they shift their mining operations to locations that will be profitable in 2028 and beyond.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Adam Sullivan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/16/bitcoin-miners-must-optimize-to-survive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58f28335b10816eedb7dfb4bd07a146a3f6b6cf9-4266x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390983,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRl8z,1713282333,What the History of Linux Says About the Long Road to Decentralized Storage Adoption,"The evolution of computing has been marked by a series of paradigm shifts, from mainframes to personal computers, and now to the cloud. Currently, the common path to deploying web infrastructure is to be a paying customer of a large company like Amazon or Google, and write infrastructure as code to spin up a constellation of interoperable services on their machines.  Claudia Richoux is the founder and CEO of Banyan, a decentralized file storage system built on top of the Filecoin network.  However, the current dominance of cloud hyperscalers, with their lion’s share of the world's computation, is not a natural monopoly.  Instead, it's a temporary state, as the open-source community works tirelessly to cook up a decentralized solution that will revolutionize the industry once again. A decentralized solution will allow users to freely move between service providers instead of being locked into one entity, which means more price competition and freedom for businesses to negotiate on terms with their cloud providers instead of the current state where they’re deeply entangled with and dependent on them.  The lessons of Linux  To understand the potential of a decentralized cloud, we need only look at the history of the Linux operating system. It took a decade for the Bells Labs developed software Unix to evolve into Minix, and another decade for Minix to become Linux. Finally, after yet another decade, Linux saw widespread enterprise adoption, becoming the obvious choice for developers.  Today, Linux open source software dominates the market, running on 80% of public servers and 100% of supercomputers. It's what all devs inevitably choose when they spin up an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), a service by Amazon that allows users to run applications in AWS’s public cloud.  Linux's success was built on the power of compounding, shared, open development gains. Operating systems are monumental and intricate, requiring millions of hours of specialized labor, research and testing to create competitive ones from scratch. However, after years of government-funded and hobbyist-fueled incubation, Linux reached a usable state, and the benefits began to multiply.  As companies started using and depending on open-source operating systems, these massive operating system kernel codebases, or the the core of a computer's operating system, became “the commons,” and people pitch in to improve it. Everyone who uses Linux kernel searches for bugs. Some even contribute patches.  Open-source codebases are hard to kill  In other words, open source software support can be cheaper than closed-source software support plans, just because the cost to create the product itself is so much smaller. The cost of Linux to a business is denominated in fractional developers lending a hand, or in support plans (for companies without in-house kernel expertise).  See also: Is the Computing Sector Surfing the AI Surge?  In contrast, the cost of building and maintaining a custom operating system is astronomical, requiring the controlling entity to cover the entire lifetime cost. This necessitates a high cost of consumption to make the endeavor economically viable. If multiple closed operating systems compete, each must fund its own development and find sufficient market share to recoup their substantial investments. This explains the state of the market today to a substantial extent.  The cloud is another operating system  The ""cloud"" as we use it today on hyperscalers is simply another operating system, a tool for abstracting away when and where jobs run, their resources and how they interact. Whether it's a managed database, an open-source Kubernetes cluster or running a program on your computer, both clouds and operating systems are highly sophisticated and complex resource managers, schedulers and security providers.  The cloud operates at a much larger scale, making AWS, GCP, Azure and DigitalOcean the mainframe computers of our time, independently maintained within each company.  So, where is our open-source contender? OpenStack was developed by Rackspace and NASA in the 2010s as an open-source cloud stack intended to be deployed to any datacenter to turn it into your own AWS. It has been said to be dead (for reasons I’ll discuss later), but is still under active development by companies (mostly Chinese) that use it instead of AWS due to government infrastructure restrictions.  One thing we notice first is that open-source codebases are hard to kill because their knowledge and power are encoded in git repositories, not in fallible human processes. OpenStack will never actually be dead, even if the original business models based on it are long gone. This means that open-source contenders have a lot of chances to win, because they can just keep resurrecting.  Righting the wrongs from our last try  OpenStack ""failed"" because every single company wanted to have their own distribution of the software to control the development roadmap. This led to fragmentation and competition rather than collaboration. Most major vendors released their own OpenStack distributions, fracturing the ecosystem, and then fought for market supremacy (which prevented development and progress).  Lack of standardization across OpenStack distributions made it difficult for users to deploy and manage clouds consistently. Additionally, the complexity of OpenStack made it challenging to install and operate, especially compared to more polished public cloud offerings from Amazon, Microsoft and Google.  See also: Internet 2030: The Future and How We Get There  Without a strong central governing body, it was hard to drive a cohesive vision and rally the community around shared priorities. Many companies that initially supported OpenStack later reduced their investments or pulled out entirely.  How do we avoid failing again? This time, we have a secret weapon: nodes, consensus, block rewards, public goods and ecosystem alignment research. Node distribution is a mostly solved problem after 15 years of running blockchains, so the lack of standardization is something we can defeat.  By figuring out the right public goods mechanisms and how to align users, we can unite people around protocols instead of encouraging endless forking, competition and defection. Governance and shared roadmaps are a problem we’ve been continuously hacking on, and we're getting there because the shared state and shared value of blockchains bind communities together and force them to collaborate (in ways that easily-forkable open-source repositories simply don’t).  We have the financial primitives and the collaboration tooling nearly ready to work. We already have promising starts, but we must keep working.  The road to the winning end-state  We’re closer than we realize to a decentralized cloud go-to-market, which could bring hundreds of billions of dollars to the ecosystem if we really capture the market the way Linux did. Cloud markets are also growing at 11% annually — and what can AI adoption do but accelerate that? It makes bitcoin ETFs look like lunch money.  There are some gaps holding us back from winning right now, though, and the place we’re the most sorely lacking is sensible product decisions. The current state of Web3 attempts at decentralized cloud services are questionable, with limited product-market fit. Most people use these protocols only to game their token incentives, which is unfortunate.  On the bright side, speculation can drive product improvement and growth cheaply, as long as we listen to user feedback and use reward mechanisms with care.  Look closely at projects like Banyan, Estuary and ArDrive, and ask yourself if you'd choose them over Dropbox, especially if your job depended on it  We may not need to reuse OpenStack directly, but we need to build something similarly usable (and similarly reliable, which is the difficult part). We will have to blend our home-grown incentive structures with Web2 and cloud hyperscaler monitoring, compliance and security technologies in order to succeed. We need to design hybrid centralized/decentralized SLAs (service level agreements — the contracts between you and a cloud storage provider). We need to secure it with a buffet of reliability incentives, security attestations, zero-knowledge proofs, fully homomorphic encryption, computation fraud proofs, governance protocols and more.  See also: What Is Decentralized File Storage and How Does it Work?  Most of us in this segment have prototypes and MVPs, shallowly cargo-culting Web2 cloud products’ successes, instead of thoroughly attempting to rival the incumbents by working with users and adapting to their needs. However, technically or theoretically doing storage or computing or CDN-speed delivery is not enough, which is where most of us are. This will not attract paying users, token inflation will run out, and you will die.  The thing that attracts paying users will be doing the product iteration cycle, evolving our offerings to meet their needs and going to market like a Web2 cloud company.  Go watch a YCombinator video or two. Choose to do the hard thing. Fortunately, the Web3 community is almost infinitely patient to test and give feedback, because we all want (need?) this to work. We're competing with a mature and intimidatingly well-funded industry, and it's going to be uphill for a few more years.  Look closely at projects like Banyan, Estuary and ArDrive, and ask yourself if you'd choose them over Dropbox, especially if your job depended on it. Now think about how much work needs to be done to get there.

Bitcoin Has Next Major On-Chain Support Around $56,000 According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, BTC’s recent drawdown has meant that it may end up having to rely on the price range around $56,000 for support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Showing Different Behavior From Past Cycles, But Why? In on-chain analysis, a level’s potential as support or resistance is based on the total number of coins that the investors last acquired there. Below is a chart that shows what the various price ranges around the current spot price of the cryptocurrency look like in terms of this cost-basis distribution. The data for the BTC acquisition distribution across the various price levels | Source: IntoTheBlock on X In the graph, the size of the dot represents the amount of Bitcoin that was purchased inside the corresponding price range. It would appear that the $63,000 to $64,890 level is currently thick with investors. To be more particular, 1 million investors acquired 530,000 BTC inside this range. Generally, whenever the asset retests the cost basis of any investor, they may become more likely to make some kind of move, due to the importance the level holds for them. Investors who were in profits just prior to the retest may be willing to make further bets, believing that if this level was profitable in the past it might be so again in the future. Naturally, this buying effect would only be relevant for the market if a large amount of investors acquired coins inside a tight price range. The $63,000 to $64,890 range qualifies for this. The range should have acted as a support point for the coin, but BTC has recently slipped under it, possibly suggesting that this support level may have broken down. As IntoTheBlock has highlighted in the chart, the next major range of potential support is the $55,200 to $57,100 range. Thus, should the current drawdown continue, this may be the next relevant range. “While this doesn’t mean that Bitcoin has to go this low, it is good to keep this range in mind while price is exploring recent lows,” notes the analytics firm. A decline to the average price of this range ($56,000) would mean a drawdown of almost 10% from the current spot value of the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebounds After Nearing Cost Basis Of Short-Term Whales Before this level, though, there is another interesting on-chain level that BTC could end up revisiting.

This group’s Realized Price has been at an important level historically during bull runs, as the asset has often found support at it.

These token unlock events are known to be a recipe for high volatility because of what could happen in the aftermath of their occurrence. $107 Million Arbitrum Tokens Set To Be Unlocked Data from TokenUnlock shows that 92.65 million Arbitrum tokens (3.49% of its circulating supply) are set to be unlocked on April 16. 56.13 million ($65.10 million) of these tokens will be distributed to the team, future team, and advisors, while the remaining 36.52 million ($42.36 million) will be distributed to investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Send 800 Million DOGE To Exchanges, Dump Incoming? Token unlocks are usually followed by a wave of massive sell-offs from the beneficiaries, which causes the token’s price to drop. As such, Arbitrum’s price could also suffer the same fate once these tokens are distributed. However, this won’t be the first time, considering Arbitrum suffered a significant price decline during its last token unlock on March 16. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Arbitrum’s price, which closed the previous day at above $2, dropped to $1.8 on March 16. However, it is worth noting that the magnitude of this month’s token unlock is nothing compared to last month’s, when 1.11 billion Arbitrum tokens (41.89% of its circulating supply) were unlocked. Therefore, the impact of any potential sell-off on the market might not be as severe as the last time. Despite that, Arbitrum still risks dropping below the $1 support level for the first time in a long while, as it is currently hovering around that price range. Other Token Unlocks To Watch Out For $76.96 million worth of Axie Infinity (AXS) tokens (7.6% of circulating supply) will also be unlocked this week on April 17. 3.10 million of these tokens will be distributed as staking rewards, while 6.08 million and 1.69 million tokens will be distributed to the team and ecosystem fund, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners To Lose A Whopping $10 Billion Following The Halving – Here’s Why Meanwhile, like Arbitrum, Apecoin (APE) is another token that risks dropping below $1 with its upcoming token unlock on April 17. $18.57 million worth of Apecoin tokens (2.48% of circulating supply) will be unlocked, with most of these tokens going to the Yuga Labs founder.

42390979,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRktb,1713275700,"Max Boonen's PV01 Tokenizes $5M Treasury Bill, Plans to Look at Corporate Bonds","PV01 completed its proof-of-concept issuance of a tokenized bond, a U.S. treasury bill, with market makers B2C2, BlockTower Capital and Keyrock investing.  Tokenization of real-world assets like bonds have become a booming sector in blockchain industry.  The company ""hopes"" to facilitate a tokenized corporate bond sale of a crypto firm ""in the next few months,"" Boonen said.  Tokenization company PV01, helmed by founders of crypto market maker B2C2, has completed its first tokenized bond sale under English law, the team said Tuesday, marking a crucial step towards a goal of creating a bond market on blockchain rails – including corporate debt.  The asset was a tokenized version on the Ethereum blockchain of a single U.S. Treasury bill worth $5 million issued on April 8 and redeemed a week later, with market makers B2C2, BlockTower Capital and Keyrock investing in PV01's ""proof-of-concept"" issuance.  Bermuda-based PV01 emerged from stealth a year ago under the leadership of Max Boonen and Flavio Molendini, founders of B2C2, joining the race to bring real-world assets (RWA) such as Treasuries and bonds to blockchain to make transactions cheaper, faster and more transparent. Tokenized RWAs could swell to $10 trillion as more traditional finance players adopt blockchain technology, digital asset manager 21.co forecasted last year.  Bringing debt markets on-chain could also have helped prevent the credit meltdown of the crypto industry in 2022 with the implosion of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and lender Celsius Network, with public ledgers revealing the amount of debt accrued in the system and showing who owed debt to whom, Max Boonen, co-founder and CEO of PV01, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  The market for tokenized Treasuries boomed over the past year, surpassing $1 billion, with asset management giant BlackRock recently joining the competition with Securitize.  What distinguishes PV01's approach from rivals is that its token represents the bond itself with the entire lifecycle of the asset taking place on-chain, while most competitors create tokens as a wrapper of a money market fund. This eliminates an intermediary layer in the tokenization process, a necessary design choice for PV01's future plans to expand to corporate bond tokens issued fully on-chain, Boonen explained.  The tokens are transferable between buyers and sellers, allowing the trade and set prices on secondary markets without the need for redemptions.  ""The market makers are very keen to provide over-the-counter liquidity for the Treasury bond tokens, because one of their big objectives is to be able to use the tokens as collateral to support their trading activity,"" Boonen added.  After completing the first issuance, Boonen said that PV01 plans to scale its tokenized Treasury offering in the short-term and expand to corporate bond issuances in the medium term.  ""In the next few months, we hope to do [an issuance] with a well-known crypto player where they issue a bona fide corporate bond"" on-chain, Boonen said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/16/max-boonens-pv01-tokenizes-5m-us-treasury-bill-with-plans-to-look-at-corporate-bonds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb7dfe2e082afd86487f319ea1b70e97992aade7-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

X Layer, previously known as X1, makes use of Polygon's Chain Development Kit (CDK), a customizable toolkit that lets developers build their own chains by making use of zero-knowledge technology.  The news comes as other major cryptocurrency exchanges have pursued their own layer-2 networks over the past year. In August, Coinbase launched its “Base” blockchain, which is built with Optimism’s OP Stack. Kraken is reportedly also interested in creating its own layer-2 blockchain.  In a press release, OKX said its developers will be contributing to CDK’s codebase, and that X Layer will connect to Polygon’s wider ecosystem via the AggLayer. AggLayer is a Polygon offering that aims to unify liquidity across various chains spun up using the project's technology.  “OKX’s 50 million users now have an easy path to onboarding to X Layer and all the other chains connected to the AggLayer,” Polygon Labs Chief Executive Officer Mark Boiron said in the release.  X Layer, which launched on testnet in November, will allow users to access over 170 decentralized applications (dapps), with more slated to launch soon.  “We envision X Layer and other layer-2 chains as the highway infrastructure of the Web3 world, with dApps as the marketplaces and self-hosted wallets as the vehicles that take you there,” OKX Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said in the press release.

42390982,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRl3r,1713274443,OG Bitcoin L2 Stacks Is Getting a Major Overhaul,"Amid a rekindling of Bitcoin development fervor, layer-2 network Stacks is looking to reinvent itself. As early as April 16, the major player in the Bitcoin L2 sector will kick off the release of its so-called Nakamoto upgrade, in the works for years – designed to dramatically increase the project's speed.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.  It’s a defining moment for the blockchain project that has been in development for nearly half a decade, but officially launched its mainnet in 2021. In short: Stacks is an attempt to scale Bitcoin by creating a dedicated chain for cheaper and faster transactions and Ethereum-like smart contract programmability, but maintains Bitcoin’s strong finality and security powered by miners.  “In a way, [Nakamoto is] sort of fulfilling the original intent of Stacks,” Stacks creator Muneeb Ali said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to a message Stacks developers encoded into the network’s Genesis block that cited an idea Satoshi Nakamoto had about a universe of blockchain’s that “share” computational power with Bitcoin. “Now that will be possible.”  The upgrade comes at a time of exploding interest in Bitcoin L2s, largely driven by the “Ordinals revolution” that began last year that made it possible to launch a number of never-before-seen tokens – from meme coins to NFT-like “inscriptions” – on a blockchain once thought to be in development hell.  See also: Casey Rodarmor: The Bitcoin Artist  Alongside BTC’s dramatic 50% rise since the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January, Stack’s native token, STX, has risen over 70%. The token has gained over 250% since the launch of the Ordinals Protocol, pushing it into the ranking of the top 30 largest tokens.  So what is the Nakamoto upgrade?  The Nakamoto upgrade is a way to decouple Stacks from Bitcoin in one sense while also bringing the two networks closer together.  Like many L2s, Stacks ultimately settles transactions run on its own network directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, meaning that while Stacks transactions were technically faster and cheaper than Bitcoin transactions, they could only be considered irreversible when Bitcoin miners finally add a block to the blockchain (i.e. every 10 minutes).  Nakamoto, which will kick off at Bitcoin block height 840,360, will address this problem of slow settlement speed essentially by introducing a form of parallel processing that allows Stacks miners to produce multiple blocks in between Bitcoin blocks.  This will work due to a modification in Stack’s consensus mechanism, which is a blend of proof-of-stake and mining called “proof-of-transfer.” In essence, instead of burning energy like bitcoin miners, Stacks induces an economic cost to maintaining the blockchain by having Stacks miners buy bitcoin and send it to a predetermined address, which is then distributed to Stacks validators; in return, miners get STX.  After Nakamoto, the network’s validators (called stackers) will still receive BTC for validating blocks and Stacks miners will still receive STX, but the process speeds up. What’s changed is the introduction of “tenures,” or a period of time that individual miners are assigned to produce multiple blocks that then ultimately resolve down to the Bitcoin.  Read More: Bitcoin Halving Has Crypto Miners Racing for 'Epic Sat' Potentially Worth Millions  Under development  Nakamoto has more or less been under development since Stacks released its mainnet, after which the network was running at capacity in a matter of months. “Users were complaining that they want to use this thing but the block times are just extremely slow,” Ali, who has a Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University. “It made it crystal clear.”  By December 2022, Stacks developers had released two white papers proposing network changes: one for Nakamoto and one for a separate upgrade planned for later this year, the “trust minimized” bridge called sBTC to make it easier to port over BTC into the Stacks economy.  See also: Bitcoin First, Not Only | Opinion  In the spirit of decentralization, Ali said, no author names were added to the papers. Upwards of 30 engineers from a number of Stacks related entities contributed to the effort.  The rollout of sBTC will trail Nakamoto by two to three months, according to the current roadmap estimations. And while not as big of a technical overhaul of the Stacks network itself, the ability to bridge over BTC onto Stacks may be an even bigger deal for the network’s economy.  Although smaller both in terms of total value locked and the number of available applications than on chains like Ethereum and Solana, Stack’s decentralized finance (DeFi) economy is arguably the most mature pertaining to Bitcoin. But apart from yield games or decentralized exchanges, Ali said he’s particularly interested in seeing a Stripe-like payments system launch to finally make commercial Bitcoin applications realistically possible, now that people won’t have to wait 10 minutes to know whether their $5 coffee order went through.  “What I'm feeling the most proud of is this may be a massive improvement to Bitcoin UX for normal people,” Ali said. “People want a way to use their BTC.”  See also: Props Shutdown Throws Reg A+ Funding Model Into Limbo",POSITIVE,BTC | STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | STX,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/16/og-bitcoin-l2-stacks-is-getting-a-major-overhaul,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67400a5db8c7bc37fb0b379cfaadb8acb0cbc751-3362x1804.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390976,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRkZ5,1713273345,Exploding Gold Sales at Pawnshops Offers Lesson for Bitcoin Bulls,"There are plenty of reasons to be bullish on gold, but the evergreen bear case on the precious metal is that it's never really consumed. Every ounce of gold that's been mined since the beginning of time is still here.  To wit is a Bloomberg story over the weekend reporting on a flood of customers rushing into a Brooklyn pawnshop with their valuables to cash in on gold's recent run to a record price above $2,400 per ounce. ""People are using gold as an ATM they never had,"" owner Gene Furman, who is seeing three times the normal traffic of sellers since the metal's rally began in earnest two months ago, told Bloomberg.  Buyers appear to have gone on strike at these prices as well, with the U.S. Mint posting March American Eagle gold coin sales that were roughly 10% of the level hit a year prior.  Whither bitcoin?  There are clear differences between gold and bitcoin {{BTC}}, but they share many similar properties. Among them is that bitcoin, too, is never truly consumed and all that's ever been mined is still with us (though some may be unavailable due to lost private keys).  Mostly thanks to boosted demand from the spot ETFs, bitcoin by mid-March had risen nearly 70% for 2024 to a new record above $73,000. The rally has stalled since, with the price now more than 15% below that all-time high. The reasons for the pullback are up for debate, but for the last month, sellers have overwhelmed a modestly slowed but still quick pace of buying by the ETFs.  While bulls like to point to just 900 bitcoin being mined per day (and with the bitcoin halving this week, that will be trimmed to 450 per day) versus ETF demand often numbering in the thousands per day, the math doesn't necessarily lead to ""number go up."" The circulating supply of bitcoin is nearly 20 million and at a high enough price, there have been plenty of willing sellers just as happy to cash in as those rushing to Gene Furman's pawnshop.  Just yesterday, in fact, an early crypto enthusiast moved 50 bitcoin mined in 2010 worth $3 million at current prices to crypto exchange Coinbase, likely with intent to sell. That follows December's move from an address that had been dormant for 13 years of more than 1,000 bitcoin worth $40 million to a trading desk.  The last word on gold and possibly bitcoin goes to Tobina Kahn, president of House of Kahn Estate Jewelers. ""It's very busy and we are getting more calls than ever before about clients wanting to bring in their jewels,"" she told Bloomberg. ""I'm telling the clients to bring them in now, as we are at unprecedented levels.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/16/exploding-gold-sales-at-pawnshops-offers-lesson-for-bitcoin-bulls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e83ed3c77b09119b6f00c9fcc99749721c317d58-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25847229,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603478,1713272406,"‘We Sold Everything Last Night’, Reveals Crypto Research Firm","Markus Thielen of 10x Research unveiled a significant shift in his crypto strategy in response to mounting financial pressures and market instability, as detailed in an investor note released earlier today. Thielen, an influential figure in the analysis sector, cited a concerning outlook on risk assets, which encompasses both technology stocks and cryptocurrencies, primarily driven by unanticipated and ongoing inflation rates. According to projections from Bank of America, US CPI headline inflation is expected to reach 4.8% by the November 2024 election. Over the past three months, month-over-month CPI inflation has averaged 0.4%. An acceleration at this speed would mean the rate is more than twice the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2% by November. Why 10x Research Sold (Almost) All Crypto And Risk Assets In light of this, 10x Research’s decision to divest from risky assets was catalyzed by an adverse shift in economic indicators. Notably, the US bond market is currently projecting fewer than three Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, a significant adjustment from earlier more optimistic forecasts. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the majority of market participants now think that a rate cut by the Fed will not come before the mid-September FOMC meeting. Additionally, the 10-year Treasury Yields have reached a peak of 4.61% this month, marking the highest rate since November 2023, further complicating the investment landscape for risk assets including technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Altcoins Price Decline As Crypto Liquidations Near $900 Million In The Past Day “Our growing concern is that risk assets are teetering on the edge of a significant price correction,” Thielen stated in the note. “We sold all our tech stocks last night as the Nasdaq is trading very poorly and reacting to the higher bond yield. We only hold a few high-conviction crypto coins. Overall, we are bearish on risk assets.” The bearish stance is further supported by the disappointing performance of US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite the SEC’s approval of nearly a dozen such ETFs in January, which initially spurred a surge in Bitcoin prices, the influx of capital has markedly slowed. This month, the five-day average net inflows into these ETFs plummeted to zero, a stark contrast to the nearly $12 billion that flowed into these investment vehicles earlier in the year. Thielen’s comments also touched on the broader implications of the upcoming Bitcoin network’s quadrennial halving, scheduled for April 20. This event will reduce the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin by 50%, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. While such halvings have historically spurred bullish sentiment and price increases due to a perceived scarcity of Bitcoin, Thielen suggests that the current market conditions might dampen any potential rallies. “It is essential to understand that trading is a continuous game with high-conviction opportunities. The key is to keep analyzing the markets and uncovering those opportunities when the odds are in your favor. There are times when we advocate for a total risk-on approach and when the priority is safeguarding your capital, enabling you to seize opportunities at lower levels,” Thielen stated. Related Reading: Nervos Network CKB Token: The Market Disruptor With 75% Uptrend, Outshining Top 100 Cryptos In a notable exchange with Matthew Graham of Ryze Labs, Thielen defended his firm’s trading strategy amid criticism for what was described as erratic decision-making. Graham pointed to recent fluctuations in 10x Research’s stance on Bitcoin, citing a research note from early April that predicted a potential rally to $80,000, followed by a more cautious view and the recent sell-off. Thielen responded, “Actually, no. We have been cautious since March 8, and when the triangle breakout failed, we worked with the $68,300 stop loss. This is simply risk-reward trading.” This defense highlights the volatile nature of crypto trading and the necessity for agile strategies in response to rapidly changing market conditions. Thielen concluded, promising a strong re-entry into the market under more favorable conditions: “Will buy back with both hands at 52,000 – promise.” At press time, BTC traded at $63,045.

The offering comes as real-world asset (RWA) tokenization continues to become more popular with some predicting the market will grow to as large as $10 trillion in this decade. Tokenization is a process whereby a digital representation of a real world asset – a home equity loan in this instance – is issued on a blockchain.  The Homium loans are currently live in Colorado, with plans to expand to other states. As part of securing the loan, homeowners commit a portion of their home’s price appreciation. For investors, i.e., those funding the loan, they receive a tokenized asset tracking the price appreciation of a pool of shared appreciation home loans issued on Homium.  The aim is to help free up trapped home equity and address housing affordability issues in a variety of scenarios, according to the press release. Homium is also offering an investable asset to institutional investors via digital securities backed by homeowner equity.  “Homium is building a valuable new asset class for institutional investors, providing a new source of uncorrelated, inflation protected return in their core portfolios,” said Tommy Mercein, CEO of Homium.  The company also raised $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Sorenson Impact Group and Blizzard, Avalanche’s ecosystem fund.  Avalanche allocated $50 million to purchase tokenized assets created on its layer 1 in July last year.

Grant, the current global head of regulatory affairs at JST Digital, takes on the role months after Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of the global Binance exchange, stepped down as chair of the board following the global exchange's multibillion dollar settlement with various U.S. regulators on money laundering and sanctions violation allegations. Binance.US was not a party to these settlements.  In a statement, Grant said, ""the American digital asset industry is at an inflection point, and I am excited to help guide the future of one of the country’s most influential and customer-centric crypto platforms.""  Grant spent more than three decades working in legal and compliant-focused roles with U.S. government entities, Binance.US said in a press release, with almost all of this experience coming during his tenure at the New York Fed.  The exchange is currently battling the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court as the federal regulator continues its efforts to have U.S. crypto trading platforms abide by national securities exchange rules. The SEC alleged last year that Binance.US (alongside Coinbase and Kraken, among others) are operating as unregistered brokers, exchanges and clearinghouses, a view that at least one federal judge deemed plausible in the Coinbase case.  Binance.US CEO Norman Reed, who used to be the exchange's general counsel, told CoinDesk he felt ""pretty good about where we're at now with the SEC.""  ""My view is they did not provide very clear guidance to the markets about what was, which digital assets were securities or not,"" Reed said. ""They relied on this Howey case about an orange grove that was decided in 1946 under very different factual circumstances, very different legal circumstances.""  Reed was a senior enforcement attorney at the New York Fed between 1993 and 2000, before spending six years as special counsel with the SEC and eight years at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.  ""It's, of course, true that our our trading volumes took a significant hit following the SEC's case and in our transition to a crypto only exchange,"" Binance.US COO Chris Blodgett said, adding that, ""the last two quarters have seen very strong rebounds in volume, revenue and user engagement across the platform, due in part to the ""broader market recovery.""

25847214,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4683989-applied-digital-apld-stock-blockchain-industry-growing-capacity-imply-undervaluation?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1713272343,Applied Digital: Blockchain Industry And Growing Capacity Imply Undervaluation,"Summary Applied Digital Corporation has robust demand across its businesses, and analysts expect EPS growth in 2025. The company has partnerships with large companies like Dell, NVIDIA, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan, which could bring net sales growth and attract new investors. The CEO's background in the technology industry and connections with venture capitalists may lower the company's WACC and bring business growth. Applied Digital Corporation ( APLD ) recently noted robust demand across the globe and analysts expect growing EPS in 2025. The numbers delivered in the most recent quarter were lower than expected, however management mentioned a new LOI signed with a hyperscaler for a 400 MW capacity lease. I believe that the business profile of the CEO, the exposure to the blockchain industry, and existing partners will most likely enhance future capital supply and capacity generation. There are some risks from lack of financing, lower FCF growth than expected, or intense competition. However, I believe that APLD stock does look undervalued. Applied Digital Applied Digital is a designer, builder, and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure, with three main lines of business, artificial intelligence cloud services, high-performance data center hosting, and cryptographic data hosting. Source: Investor Presentation Through its Sai Computing brand, it offers cloud services for AI applications, with significant contracts secured. As for HPC hosting, the company has expanded its capacity, and has workable expansion plans. Additionally, in crypto data hosting, the company has a strong online infrastructure with long-term contracts and growth plans. The company distributes several services via long-term contracts. It has a strong concentration of clients in its crypto data hosting business, with agreements with entities such as Spring Mud, Bitmain Technologies Limited, and others. Similarly, in AI cloud services, the company has significant concentration with only two customers. Its strategy includes long-term contracts and using a combination of third-party colocation centers and its own HPC data centers to serve clients. Applied is expanding its operations, with plans to increase hosting capacity for HPC applications up to 200 MW besides launching AI cloud hosting services through Sai Computing. It seeks to minimize risks by collaborating with leading suppliers such as Super Micro and HPE. In a recent presentation, the company noted that it has data center locations all over the country. With data centers all over the country, I believe that management tried to be close to clients to offer quality. Source: Investor Presentation Additionally, the company is securing scalable energy sites and considering vertical integration of energy assets. Its site selection criteria focus on geographic diversity and environmental impact, seeking to minimize risks and maximize energy efficiency with a focus on renewable energy. Recent Earnings Results, And EPS Expectations In the last quarterly report, the company noted lower than expected EPS and lower quarterly net sales than initially anticipated. Total quarterly revenue was close to $43-$44 million, and EPS was $0.27 less than expected. Even considering the recent stock price volatility, I believe that the quarterly report included valuable information like the LOI signed with a hyperscaler for a 400 MW capacity lease. In addition, the company noted debt repayments of approximately $52.3 million and net cash received from operating activities close to $47.9 million coming from recurring operations. I believe that more leasing capacity, lower debt, and increases in the CFO like we saw in the recent quarter could accelerate the demand for the stock. With the recent past earnings, I think that the future looks considerably better than the last EPS figures. Analysts out there are expecting an increase in the EPS in 2025. Under my best case scenario, I assumed that continued increase in future expectations of net income growth from 2025 to 2034 would imply higher stock price marks. With that about the expectations of other analysts, I believe that the words from management given in the most recent quarterly report are beneficial. The company appears to be well-positioned to grow, and notes robust demand. Among other details given in the last press release, I think that the following words are worth having a careful look at. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the robust demand we are witnessing across our business. We believe we are well-positioned to execute our growth strategy and capitalize on the increasing opportunities presented by both traditional customers and emerging HPC applications. Source: Press Release Balance Sheet As of February 29, 2024, the company reported cash worth $4 million and restricted cash of about $29 million, which I did not include to calculate the net debt. I do not appreciate that the total amount of current assets is significantly below the current amount of liabilities. With that, it is worth mentioning that Applied Digital Corp. does not seem to require a lot of liquidity to function. Business providers seem to offer certain financing as accounts payable is not small. In addition, the company appears to sign a significant amount of leasing agreements for hosting equipment, office space, and land, which appears necessary to offer digital infrastructure. The Company has entered into leases for hosting equipment, office space, and land. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company presents operating and finance right of use assets and liabilities separately on the balance sheet as their own captions. Source: 10-k Source: 10-Q With an asset/liability ratio larger than 1x, the balance sheet appears quite healthy. With that, I believe that investors may want to study carefully the total amount of debt, which is not small. Source: 10-Q There are also several contractual obligations to keep in mind. The company has obtained several loans to finance its expansion and operations. These include loans from Starion Term, Vantage Garden City, and Starion Ellendale, which finance the expansion of data centers at different locations. The company has also acquired a loan to increase liquidity and fund the AI ​​cloud services platform. These loans have different interest rates and maturity periods, and the company must comply with certain conditions and covenants. In the last quarterly report, Applied Digital reported net debt worth $143 million, including finance lease liabilities and related party loans. Under my best case scenario, I assumed 2034 FCF close to $135 million, which would imply net debt/FCF close to 1x. Source: Our Own Calculations Recent Investments In Blockchain Data Centers May Bring Exposure To The Blockchain Industry. In a recent presentation, the company reported three blockchain data centers, which are expected to serve space to blockchain mining customers. The data centers are located in Texas and North Dakota. Source: Investor Presentation The data center colocation market is expected to grow at close to 7.25% CAGR from 2022 to 2028. However, the global cryptocurrency mining market could grow at close to 12.9% CAGR from 2023 to 2032. Hence, I believe that in the best case scenario, we could expect APLD’s net sales growth to be close to these figures. Under my best case scenario, I assumed median net income growth close to 8%-9%. The data center colocation market was valued at USD 30.42 billion in 2022 and is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 7.25% from 2022 to 2028, reaching USD 46.3 billion in 2028. Source: Crypto Reporter The global cryptocurrency mining market size surpassed USD 1.92 billion in 2022 and it is projected to attain around USD 7 billion by 2032, poised to grow at a CAGR of 12.90% from 2023 to 2032. Source: Precedence Research Partnerships With Large Companies May Not Only Bring Net Sales Growth, But Also New Large Fintech Companies I believe that the number of strategic partnerships, software partners, and financial partners signed with APLD is impressive. Dell Technologies Inc. ( DELL ), NVIDIA ( NVDA ), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ( GS ), and JPMorgan ( JPM ) are working with the company. Source: Presentation To Investors In my view, APLD will most likely receive more attention from other large companies thanks to these agreements. Besides, I believe that venture funds or new investors may be willing to buy more shares because these large corporations seem to trust the data centers offered by APLD. Under my best case scenario, I assumed that both cost of debt and cost of equity may be a bit lower than that of competitors because of these partners. The CEO Will Most Likely Bring The Interest Of Venture Capitalists, Which May Lower The WACC Among the members in the executive team , I believe that Wes Cummins, the CEO, will most likely bring the attention of investors in the venture capital industry. He founded 272 Capital LP, which he sold to a large bank in the United States. Given previous expertise in the technology hardware and software industry, I believe that APLD would most likely present its financials, and make smart decisions in the coming years. As a result, I believe that we could expect a decrease in the WACC as soon as more investors conduct research about its biography. Under the best case scenario, I assumed a WACC close to 8%-9%, which I believe is conservative. Source: Company's Website My Best Case Scenario Implied A Valuation Of $8.2 Under this scenario, I assumed that recent investments in blockchain data centers, new partnerships with banks and tech companies, and the connections of the CEO will bring business growth. As a result, I expect median net income growth close to 8.1% from 2024 to 2034, driven by the demand for data centers in the blockchain industry. Note that I took into account previous cash flow statements , changes in working capital, capital expenditures, and previous net income growth. I believe that my figures are quite conservative. I assumed 2034 net income of $159 million, with net income growth of about 6.48%. I also forecasted stock-based compensation of $8 million, with prepaid expenses and other current assets close to -$4.9 million, customer deposits of $6 million, and deferred revenue of $0.2 million. In addition, with accounts payable and accrued liabilities worth -$4 million, CFO would stand at close to $166 million. Finally, assuming 2034 capex close to -$31 million, I obtained free cash of $135 million. Source: Our Financial Expectations If we also use a WACC of 8.75% , the implied net present value of future FCF would be close to $393 million. In addition, with an EV/FCF of about 14x, the implied total enterprise value would be $1.14 billion. Source: Seeking Alpha If we subtract the net debt, the implied equity valuation would be close to $1 billion. Finally, I obtained a target price close to $8.2 per share. Source: Our Financial Expectations Risks In my opinion, the company is at a stage that faces challenges in management and financial resources. Rapid growth can strain management capacity and resources. Failure to manage growth could damage reputation and limit growth. Besides, failure to identify emerging opportunities can have a negative impact. The need for additional capital is anticipated for expansion and response to competitive pressures. Finally, obtaining financing may be difficult, which could impact growth and existing operations. Issuing equity can dilute shareholders' ownership, and debt can impose financial constraints. Competitors Competition in the digital industry is intense. The company faces constant challenges from established and emerging rivals. The ability to innovate, offer high-quality services, and quickly adapt to market trends will determine the success. Additionally, pursuing strategic collaborations and attracting key talent are crucial to staying ahead. The company must anticipate and proactively respond to competitive moves to secure its position in the constantly evolving market. My Worst Case Scenario Under my worst case scenario, the action of competitors, lack of financing, alternative technologies, and data centers could diminish future net sales growth and net income growth. In sum, I believe that figures are still quite realistic, however both net income growth and FCF are a bit lower than that in the best case scenario. I believe that this case scenario is a bit less likely than the best case scenario. In a less positive case, we could have 2034 net income of $50.3 million, with net income growth close to -5.32%. I also assumed 2034 depreciation and amortization of close to $1 million, stock-based compensation of about $5 million, and changes in prepaid expenses of close to -$0.5 million. Also, changes in customer deposits of about $4 million and changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of -$1.7 million would imply 2034 CFO close to $64 million. Finally, taking into account 2034 capex of -$7 million, 2034 FCF would be close to $57 million. Source: Our Financial Expectations By assuming a WACC of 10%, I obtained NPV of future FCF close to $238 million. Besides, if we also assume EV/FCF of 11.5x, the total valuation would be close to $468 million. Finally, subtracting net debt close to -$143 million, the implied fair price would be close to $2.7. Source: Our Financial Expectations Conclusion Applied Digital Corporation recently noted robust demand across its businesses, and many analysts out there expect EPS growth in 2025. I believe that previous expertise in the technology hardware and software industry reported by the CEO and connections with other venture catalysts could bring new deals. In addition, with relevant partners and new leasing agreements such as the LOI signed with a hyperscaler for a 400 MW capacity lease, APLD could bring substantial capacity increases. Yes, the concentration of customers in some areas, intense competition, and lack of capital could damage future FCF growth. With that, I believe that APLD appears significantly undervalued at its current price mark.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4683989-applied-digital-apld-stock-blockchain-industry-growing-capacity-imply-undervaluation?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25847214.jpeg

Concurrently, Solana’s price decreased by 11% to $136.54, according to CoinMarketCap.

42391021,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRySl,1713270683,First Mover Americas: BTC Below $62.5K While Altcoins Wipe Gains,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC)fell 6% to below $62,500, while Ether (ETH) held just above $3,000. The CoinDesk 20, a measure of the world's largest and most liquid digital assets, dropped 8%. CoinDesk's Indices Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI), a daily signal communicating the direction and strength of bitcoin's price trends, flipped to neutral from bullish, signaling a weakening of upside momentum. According to LMAX Digital, as long as bitcoin holds above $59,000, the outlook remains highly constructive “with fresh record highs on the horizon."" Some altcoins slumped, with dogwifhat (WIF) sliding 18%, Ethena Labs’ ENA down 14% and Immutable X losing 16% over the past 24 hours. Solana (SOL) fell 12% and Avalanche declined 9%, erasing its year-to-date gains.  OKX, the fourth-largest crypto exchange, said its new layer-2 blockchain, X Layer, has gone live on its public mainnet, joining other major crypto companies in starting its own distributed network. X Layer, previously known as X1, makes use of Polygon's Chain Development Kit (CDK), a customizable toolkit that lets developers build their own chains by making use of zero-knowledge technology. The firm joins other major cryptocurrency exchanges that have pursued their own layer-2 networks over the past year. In August, Coinbase launched its “Base” blockchain, which is built with Optimism’s OP Stack. Kraken is reportedly also interested in creating its own layer-2 blockchain.  Bitcoin miners may have underperformed the cryptocurrency this year, but their CEOs remain upbeat as the reward halving approaches, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday. The underperformance has been caused by strong moves in spot bitcoin and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have sucked ""retail liquidity"" from mining stocks, and by concerns about the impact of the halving on miner revenues, analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are reduced, slowing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply. The next halving is due around April 19-20.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the U.S. dollar's (USD) exchange rate against the Chinese yuan (CNY).  The USD/CNY pair rose to a five-month high Tuesday as the slide in the Japanese yen weighed on Asian currencies, including the Chinese yuan.  The Yuan's depreciation means China is incentivized to keep bitcoin under pressure to discourage Chinese investors from using the cryptocurrency to move capital overseas, according to the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub.

25846102,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603467,1713270639,Elon Musk Latest Tweet: How Much Did Dogecoin Gain From It Today?,"The cryptocurrency market tends to thrive on a blend of innovation, utility, and sometimes, just a good meme. This week, the spotlight shone brightly on Dogecoin (DOGE), the Shiba Inu-themed meme coin, after a characteristically playful tweet from tech billionaire Elon Musk sent prices soaring. Related Reading: Ethereum Fire Sale? Deep-Pocketed Investor Snags Nearly 24,000 ETH At Bargain Price While the tweet itself referenced a scene from Monty Python and didn’t directly mention Dogecoin, its timing, with DOGE hovering near the cusp of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, proved to be enough to ignite a firestorm of trading activity. This latest episode serves as a stark reminder of the immense influence Musk wields over the meme coin market, and the hair-trigger reflexes of Dogecoin’s dedicated community. pic.twitter.com/wXlbpNU97H — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 15, 2024 Dogecoin Rollercoaster Ride Continues This isn’t the first time Musk has sent shockwaves through the Dogecoin world. In 2021, his enthusiastic endorsements, including a now-famous appearance on Saturday Night Live where he jokingly referred to himself as the “Dogefather,” propelled DOGE to its all-time high. However, the meme coin’s meteoric rise proved unsustainable, and prices eventually settled into a lower, but still respectable, position. Bitcoin is now trading at $62.611. Chart: TradingView Currently, Dogecoin sits comfortably as the eighth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of over $22 billion. However, there was a different narrative in the price department. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.15, down 8.4% and 22.9% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Clearly, the Musk tweet magic didn’t work this time. Or, perhaps not yet? DOGE 24-hour price action. Source: Coingecko A quick look at DOGE’s daily chart reveals a classic case of price resistance, where the coin struggles to break through specific price ceilings. This back-and-forth price action reflects the ongoing battle between enthusiastic buyers, emboldened by figures like Musk, and more cautious investors wary of the coin’s unpredictable nature. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bonanza Before The Halving? Analyst Sees Pre-Crash Buying Window No Price Boost This Time Elon Musk’s tweets have long been synonymous with skyrocketing memecoin values, yet today’s unexpected downturn in Dogecoin following his latest post underscores the volatile and unpredictable terrain of cryptocurrency markets.

42391014,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRxsr,1713268320,Solana DEX Drift to Airdrop 100M Tokens in Weeks,"Drift Protocol is conducting an airdrop of 100 million tokens and spinning up a token-based governance structure.  A surprise winner of the highly anticipated announcement is MetaDAO. Its futarchy tech is being partly implemented in Drift.  Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Drift protocol plans to launch a DRIFT governance token and airdrop the asset to its users within weeks, according to Drift's website and people familiar with the matter.  The new token follows a three-month points program that enticed traders, borrowers, lenders—and, of course, airdrop farmers—into Drift, one of the largest venues for trading perpetuals in Solana DeFi. But contributors to the protocol said most of the 100 million tokens earmarked for this airdrop will go to longtime Drift users.  Airdrops, within the world of cryptocurrencies, refer to the distribution of free tokens or coins to individuals.  Drift is the latest piece of financial infrastructure on Solana to attempt to decentralize its operations by creating a token whose holders can vote on key decisions at the exchange, like which tokens to list or when to upgrade software. In this airdrop, ten percent of DRIFT's total supply will go to its users.  Venture backers are set to get a far larger allocation of DRIFT: 22%. Massive crypto VCs Polychain Capital and Multicoin Capital, as well as a smattering of angel investors that include Solana's founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal have since 2021 poured over $25 million into the protocol's development.  Forty three percent of tokens will go toward ""ecosystem development"" that could include trading rewards, liquidity incentives and future airdrops. And 25% of tokens are reserved for ""protocol development"" payouts to Drift's contributors, according to Drift's website.  Drift protocol's developers plan for the trading service to become a one-stop venue for crypto investors on Solana. Its main product is perpetuals trading for price speculators to long and short cryptos with up to 20x leverage.  Drift also hosts spot trading and a range of exotic financial instruments that give investors exposure to high-risk, high-reward plays. Its newest product lets traders place bets on tokens that haven't launched yet, though for legal reasons it won't offer the service for DRIFT token).  ""Our goal was never to just be a perps DEX,"" core contributor Cindy Leow said in an interview. Instead, Drift Labs (the main company building the protocol) has spent over two years, tens of millions of dollars and its 25 personnel building the ""entire value stack"" for DeFi.  Some of those were stress tested during last week's crypto market crash. Lenders to Drift's insurance fund, a high interest-paying USDC vault that protects the protocol against bad debt, saw $11,600 in socialized losses during crypto's biggest multi day liquidation event since November 2021.  But the insurance fund was designed as such a backstop, and amid a wave of liquidations and bankruptcies that came with the sudden price plunge Drift held up.  ""We had $200 million in open interest"" on Friday morning, Leow said amid the market crash, and ""10% was liquidated."" She called it the biggest single day market move since December. Nevertheless ""liquidations are going fine.""  Governance Changes  Control over Drift will shift from Drift Labs to a three-pronged governance structure. At the top is a security council that will wield upgrade authority over the protocol, basically, day-to-day control. Members of this council will at least initially come from inside Drift, people familiar with the matter said. They'll need approval from Drift's ""Realms DAO,"" where token holders get to vote.  A third prong of Drift's governance, the Futarchy DAO, will operate much like the MetaDAO does. In short, traders here will get to pull the levers of decision-making by bidding up, or against, the price of DRIFT token in a pair of conditional markets.  The winning market is that which ends with a higher price: its trades settle (those in the losing market revert) and the associated decision executes.  Leow said Drift developers learned about futarchy during the mtnDAO hacker house in Salt Lake City in February and came back insistent that Drift implement its wonky notion that markets make better decisions than democracies. ""We're using MetaDAO in the background,"" she said.  Futarchy DAO decisions will address ecosystem grants: who gets money (in DRIFT tokens), for what and how much.  A press release shared with CoinDesk outlined ""new ecosystem initiatives"" including the development of trading bots, validator clients and alternative frontends – the user interface through which people access Drift's open source trading service – as possible areas of investment.  ""One idea for us is looking at how Solana has decentralized over time,"" Leow said. ""We want to invest in teams that are building frontends on their own.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/16/solana-dex-drift-to-airdrop-100m-tokens-in-weeks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ca2a217e9ac72692c7026fba0b0a3e8ee0f17a4-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The correlation between bitcoin and traditional market assets remains high, but some investors see the cryptocurrency as a viable hedge and investment option, with expectations its price could reach $120,000 in the coming months.  International politics and the search for an investment hedge could fuel a bitcoin {{BTC}} surge in the coming months, even after confidence in the largest cryptocurrency was dented by a 10% weekly drop, some traders say.  Bitcoin has long been considered a possible hedge against geopolitical events and was originally created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Some traders say the hedging narrative remains viable despite BTC being highly correlated with traditional market assets for several years.  “Bitcoin remains a viable doomsday asset in 2024, as its correlation to Gold recently increased, and investors continue to diversify away from traditional financial assets,” Edouard Hindi, the chief investment officer at Tyr Capital, said in an email to CoinDesk.  “The ETF is currently spearheading this Doomsday rally and we should expect $120,000 to be hit in the coming months as global geopolitics continues to deteriorate and the middle classes continue to find ways to protect their wealth,” Hindi said.  Crypto markets were shattered over the weekend as tensions between Iran and Israel increased alongside profit-taking ahead of the bitcoin reward halving, a technical event expected on April 20 that will cut network rewards by 50%.  Major tokens lost as much as 18% on the weekend compared to last week’s peak prices before reversing some of the losses on Monday. The slide resumed in Asian morning hours on Tuesday as Israel considered its response to Iran's firing of more than 300 drones and missiles at its territory.  Elsewhere, inflows to bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) have slowed in the past week. Data shows only one product, BlackRock’s IBIT, saw inflows on Monday, while 10 other ETFs all saw outflows.  Some market observers say bitcoin’s short-term price action will set the course for the broader crypto market in the coming weeks.  “The sell-off in US stock markets affected global risk appetite late on Monday, reversing initial positivity. The market is hovering near the lows of March,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an FxPro senior market analyst, wrote in a daily note. “This is a key moment in choosing the market’s direction for the coming weeks.

42391020,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRyNd,1713264252,"TON-Based Economy Starting to Take Root in Telegram, TON Foundation Says","Telegram's pivot to toncoin payments for advertisements and the Open League reward program are boosting the token's adoption.  TON has gained 15% this month, outperforming the broader market.  A toncoin (TON)-based economy is starting to take root in the messaging app Telegram, and that explains the token's recent outperformance of the broader crypto market, according to Justin Hyun, director of investments at TON Foundation.  TON has gained 15% this month, clocking record highs above $7, while bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, declined 11% and the CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, dropped 16%, CoinDesk data show. Open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of perpetual futures tied to TON, has increased by over 17% to $160 million in the same period, CoinGlass data show. At one point, open interest topped $200 million. An uptick in open interest alongside a price rise reflects an influx of new money and confirms the uptrend.  Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), a decentralized, layer-1 network popularly known as the TON blockchain. In February, Telegram, which has 800 million users, introduced an advertising revenue-sharing system for channel owners that pays out exclusively in TON. Telegram channels generate over 1 trillion views a month, and owners of public channels with at least 1,000 subscribers stand to receive 50% of the revenue generated from the display of ads in their channels.  ""Telegram has launched its ad platform, which only accepts Toncoin instead of fiat, choosing the principles of Web3 and paying 50% of the revenue they make from advertising back to Telegram channel owners, Hyun said in an interview over email. ""The move will mean channel owners can distribute Toncoin in giveaways to their audiences, growing awareness of TON's ecosystem even further, and over time, decentralizing the token supply to Telegram's best and brightest creators.""  Last week, TON Foundation partnered with HashKey Group, the parent entity of the Hong Kong-licensed crypto exchange of the same name, to facilitate hassle-free and seamless conversion of fiat currencies into digital assets and vice versa for its wallet users from the Asia Pacific region.  Hyun added that the Open League program, announced on April 1, is bringing users on-chain in ""unprecedented numbers."" The program is a reward strategy to encourage user participation in developing the ecosystem.  Under the program, TON Foundation is set to distribute 30 million TON, worth $188 million, to community members through quests, airdrops, and liquidity pools on TON's decentralized exchanges.  ""This strategy of focusing on developers who understand what's required to build consumer applications that engage millions of users is going to be key for the future of crypto adoption. TON is really the only hope of mass adoption for Web3 technologies. It will do for Web3 tech what the Apple Mac did for personal computing. Not a computer in every home, but crypto in every pocket,"" Hyun said.  The program aims to bring millions of Telegram users on-chain, establishing TON as the home for consumer product markets and creating a self-reinforcing flywheel for Ton-based projects. The league's pilot season caused a 47% increase in the daily active wallets and a 244% increase in the dollar value of crypto assets locked in the TON ecosystem.",POSITIVE,BTC | TON,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TON,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/16/ton-based-economy-starting-to-take-root-in-telegram-ton-foundation-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2be8a4b93c3e8682b9fd7520f951e5e931915ad-4800x2700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Bitcoin Bonanza Before The Halving? Analyst Sees Pre-Crash Buying Window However, in the face of volatility, a fascinating development has emerged: Ethereum whales, the behemoths of the crypto world, have begun to flex their muscles, showcasing strategic maneuvers that have captured the attention and speculation of the crypto community. Strategic Accumulation Amidst Turbulence As Ethereum’s price plummeted, Ethereum whales wasted no time in capitalizing on the opportunity. One notable example is the whale identified as “0x435,” which embarked on a strategic accumulation spree as the ETH price dipped. With a staggering investment of 70 million USDC, this whale acquired a hefty 23,790 ETH when Ethereum hit nearly $2,930. However, this wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision; rather, it was part of a calculated strategy that unfolded over several days, involving significant transactions and withdrawals from both centralized exchanges like Binance and decentralized exchanges.

Ethereum’s Journey Through The Storm The broader context of Ethereum’s price movement adds another layer to this unfolding saga. Ethereum’s decline over three consecutive days, from highs of $3,617 to lows of $2,850 on April 13, underscores the volatility and uncertainty gripping the cryptocurrency market. However, amidst the stormy seas, Ethereum managed to make a slight recovery, climbing back up to $3,107 at the time of writing, albeit still down 6.05% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum is currently trading at $3.107.

The best time (and hardest time) to buy is when capitulation happens. Ethereum is holding up very resiliently against altcoins and Bitcoin and could outperform its peers going forward. My target is new highs for Ethereum at $5000 by the end of the year. What a rollercoaster of a ride in the crypto world. On Friday and Saturday, the total crypto market cap fell close to -18% on geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel. Excluding Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the total crypto market cap fell as much as -25% in these two days alone. This liquidation / capitulation event is a good opportunity for traders / investors to get into crypto, especially for those who have sat out the rally so far, or have raised cash of late. My focus is on Ethereum, which is trading very resiliently during this sell-off. When we look at the daily chart below, we may observe that ETH briefly broke below key supports, but quickly reclaimed above. Price sweeping below these supports likely triggered a torrent of stop losses, and if price heads higher, these bulls are now forced to chase to re-enter. Daily Chart: Ethereum Tradingview Importantly, ETH is now trading back at levels prior to Sunday's -7% sell-off. This implies that bulls have managed to reverse relatively heavy damage. Of course, things may change rapidly, given the uncertainty of the geopolitical situation. But as of now, the technical picture is constructive. Now, when we go on to look at the ratio of Ethereum vs. Bitcoin, we may see that it is testing supports that have been in play since 2021. Weekly Chart: ETH/BTC Tradingview The price is still holding above this support, which is impressive because: a rush to safe haven given the geopolitical tension should theoretically have led to sharp demand in BTC over ETH and altcoins Bitcoin halving event is set to take place in mid-April, where the reward for miners will be cut into half to ensure the scarcity of Bitcoin Despite these bullish catalysts for Bitcoin, not to mention the issuance of Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ), the support for ETH / BTC is still holding. We could see a ""sell the news"" event after the Bitcoin halving has occurred, where Ethereum goes on to outperform Bitcoin. Next, when we look at the ratio of ETH / total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, we see that this ratio is also holding up at supports. Weekly Chart: ETH/Total3 Tradingview If we get bounces in these two ratios - ETH / BTC and ETH / Total3, we may see Ethereum outperform the majority of its crypto peers. ETH has lagged considerably in the crypto rally so far. Its 1Y performance is +75%, which is meagre compared to BTC (+143%), Solana ( SOL-USD ) +612%, Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) +108% within the same time period. Yes, the war is still brewing in the background, which adds a layer of uncertainty. But the best time (and hardest time) to go long is when there is capitulation. Another sign of capitulation would be when we look at the ratio of ETH/PAXG. Paxgold is an altcoin that aims to track the price of gold, as the tokens are backed 1:1 with physical gold. This ratio fell as much as -25% on Saturday, which means gold outperformed Ethereum by a whopping 25% on one day alone. The majority of this move has since been reversed. Daily Chart: ETH/PAXG Tradingview This tells me there was a fear-driven flood to safety over the weekend when war news broke, which led to sharp outflows from Ethereum (and other coins) into safe haven gold. The manner in which this move was quickly reversed tells me it was a knee-jerk reaction. My target for ETH by the end of this year would be for it to make new highs at $5000 - not too wild, considering BTC has already broken out to new highs. I see this as a good opportunity to scale into coins that you like. My focus is on ETH for the reasons mentioned. Do not go all in with leverage from the get-go. Take it easy and scale in slowly, being cognizant of the uncertain backdrop.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4683965-crypto-capitulation-long-opportunity-in-ethereum?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25841042.jpeg

The round was led by Brevan Howard Digital and Electric Capital, with investments from Coinbase Ventures, Kraken Ventures, Lemniscap, Franklin Templeton, Avon Ventures, Mechanism, Lightspeed Faction, Consensys, Animoca and GSR, the company said in a press release.  The fresh round of capital will be used to help launch Puffer’s mainnet. Prior to this, Puffer raised $5.5 million in a funding round co-led by Lemniscap and Lightspeed Faction.  Puffer is the second-largest liquid restaking protocol behind Ether.Fi, and is part of a class of protocols that have come out of the growing ""restaking"" field that has taken the Ethereum ecosystem by storm. EigenLayer, a restaking pioneer that launched last week albeit without some of its more highly anticipated functionality, has attracted some $12.7 billion of user deposits to become the second-biggest decentralized-finance protocol, according to DeFiLlama.  Liquid restaking protocols work by taking deposits and putting them into EigenLayer, which lets Ethereum stakers earn yield for using their ETH tokens to help secure third-party platforms known as ""actively validated services” (AVS). Puffer is an AVS on EigenLayer.  Puffer then hands out their own token, pufETH, to its users representing their deposit, allowing them to use that token for trading or for other purposes.  In March, Puffer passed $1 billion in deposits, signaling excitement for restaking even before the mainnet protocol has gone live.  “With our upcoming mainnet launch, we aim to significantly reduce the barriers for home validators to participate, while delivering the most advanced liquid restaking protocol,” said Amir Amir Forouzani, CEO at Puffer Finance. “This is a major step forward for Ethereum’s decentralization and the wider restaking ecosystem.""

Sovereign wealth funds are already likely invested in bitcoin, Canaccord said.  More companies could follow MicroStrategy’s lead and start acquiring bitcoin, the report said.  While there has been a lot of noise about how much assets under management (AUM) bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are attracting, it is now becoming obvious that these ETFs are driving additional demand for the underlying cryptocurrency itself, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a research report on Monday.  The broker held its 2024 Digital Assets Symposium last Thursday and hosted leaders from 29 crypto-related companies.  “It is becoming clear now that there is a material multiplier effect also underway from the ETFs in driving additional demand for the underlying BTC spot itself,” analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.  The broker noted comments from Swan Bitcoin, a bitcoin-only investment advisor, which said it is “seeing a multiple-fold increase in demand for an underlying spot as the ETFs drive the BTC demand curve to the right, while the BTC supply curve can’t respond in kind.”  Canaccord said that many investors, both retail and institutional, ""Find the underlying BTC spot more attractive than ETFs given potentially more ways to hedge and generate yield on HODLs over time as the asset class matures.”  In the coming months, spot bitcoin ETFs will be added to multiple registered investment advisor (RIA) platforms and large broker/dealer wirehouses, and with this added distribution, “investment advisors that could more or less ignore bitcoin will now be forced to at least have an opinion” on the cryptocurrency, the report said.  Some institutions, in particular sovereign wealth funds, are likely already invested in bitcoin, and Canaccord expects to see announcements from these types of investors in the next few months.  New FASB accounting standards, when combined with continued inflationary concerns, “could drive more enterprises to follow MicroStrategy (MSTR), at least modestly to look at BTC as an asset to hold on the corporate balance sheet,” the report added.

42391016,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRy8F,1713259826,"Tether, Circle Diverge on How to Tackle Global Patchwork of Stablecoin Rules","The influx of traditional finance into crypto and the emergence of international variations in regulations is prompting contrasting responses from stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle.  Circle admonishes what it sees as U.S. lawmakers’ inaction and wants greater alignment in crypto rules between nations.  Tether, more focused on developing countries, says it is frustrated by the slow movement of law enforcement when it comes to crimes involving crypto.  It’s an interesting question: How will Tether and Circle, the largest issuers of U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, evolve and expand as the rule-bound systems of traditional finance become increasingly enmeshed in the crypto economy?  So far these crypto power players have taken different paths.  Circle, which casts itself as the compliance-friendly option, echoes many regulators’ calls for global coordination. Tether, for its part, has adopted a hands-on, reactive approach that can be flexibly adapted for national variations, especially when it comes to fighting crime.  Rules on stablecoins should be harmonized, not balkanized, Dante Disparte, head of global policy and chief strategy officer at Circle, said in an interview.  “It’s not that those countries are making a mistake or doing something wrong; U.S. policy inaction is actually the gap,” and other countries are legislating to fill it, he said. “So that's the trend we should expect: A balkanization of the industry as more countries erect barriers and establish rules that favor having a local advantage.”  The imposition of theTravel Rule on digital asset transactions has created a standard in which the endpoints of crypto can be defended, Disparte said. “Now, imagine if there was also legislation imposed on stablecoins where the currency the stablecoin references set a floor on expectations around financial integrity, financial crime, compliance and a whole host of other standards,” he said.  Tether, which doesn’t serve U.S. customers and doesn’t intend to do so, views the stablecoin market in the image of theEurodollar – Eurodollar deposits are held outside the U.S. and thus not subject to U.S. regulation. Tether sees the future in emerging markets and underbanked countries and is formulating its own approach to law-enforcement collaborations.  The company could claim that U.S. law agencies have no jurisdiction over it, but that would be stupid, CEO Paolo Ardoino said in an interview. Tether, in fact, volunteers to work with U.S. authorities like the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as some 40 law forces around the globe, he said.  “I think the Treasury should work with stablecoins in a proactive way,” Ardoino said in an interview. “We have tools like Chainalysis to follow whatever happens on the secondary market. And, by the way, almost everywhere there are no laws that stablecoins issuers are responsible for the secondary market. But I think it's our duty to monitor them just the same.”  Need for speed  Attempting to deal with crime in a speedy, hands-on manner is a source of frustration for the crypto industry, according to Ardoino. The Tether chief says his firm takes a proactive approach compared to its competitors by collaborating directly with law enforcement, bypassing the need for a lengthy judicial process that could take up to six months, during which the funds could be already dispersed. It's better to act swiftly to freeze funds upon contact from law enforcement, he said.  'When the DOJ needs to freeze assets, they reach out to us,"" Ardoino said. (He pointed out that Tether has successfully frozen over 600 million USDt in collaboration with U.S. law enforcement.) ""We possess the capability to freeze assets with surgical precision. However, when the Treasury adds entities to the OFAC SDN list, it's instantaneous—they're gone in a minute. Ideally, they could approach us beforehand, saying, 'We're investigating these individuals, planning to impose sanctions. Could we freeze their assets before making it public?' This way, we can effectively lock down the funds.""  OFAC is the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and SDN stands for specially designated nationals.  Both firms have had their travails.A lot has been written over the years about the integrity of tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin, with a current market cap of $107 billion. The durability of Circle, whose USDC is one-third its size and with its ties to the U.S. banking system, lookedrather touch and go at one point during the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023.  Terra Lunacy  The contrast between Circle’s appeal to traditional financial values and Tether’s hands-on, reactive approach to crypto’s slings and arrows is illustrated in their reflections on the collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin and its backing currency, Luna – arguably the first step that brought down a house of cards.  Some time before Terra blew up, Ardoino suggested the project was a “bad idea,” he said. His denouncement was met with scorn: Obviously he was going to be negative about the algorithmic stablecoin, he recalls people saying at the time, because it was a competitor that was going to steal some of Tether's market.  “Of course, Terra Luna happened and Tether was subjected to a lot of pressure, with people saying they would short us into the ground and cause a bank run,” he said. “But we managed to redeem $7 billion in 48 hours; $20 billion-plus in 20 days.”  Circle’s Disparte laments crypto’s avoidable “own goals” and how it managed to acquire such a “checkered scorecard” for a relatively young industry.  “If you comported with e-money rules or money transmission rules, which in the U.S. is a state-based regime, you would have protected principal, for example, with Terra Luna. People wouldn't have broken the buck,” he said.

This decline reflects a broader waning interest in Ethereum-based NFT collections.  Despite the hype and celebrity endorsements, the Bored Apes collection has seen a substantial decrease in value, with factors such as waning retail interest and the rise of newer collections on Bitcoin and Solana contributing to the decline.  Digital artwork that was once the talk of the town is now selling at a 90% haircut compared to prices during its peak popularity in 2021, showcasing the fragility associated with viral crypto trends.  The minimum price of the non-fungible token (NFT) collection, Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC), is just over 10 ether {{ETH}} as of Tuesday, a stark drop from a lifetime average of 120 ether in May 2022.  It’s roughly the same decline in dollar terms as well. Ether was worth around $3,000 in May 2022 as it is in Asian morning hours on Tuesday – meaning a single NFT was worth over $400,000 then compared to just over $30,000 as of writing.  Data from CryptoSlam shows trading volumes have generally remained around the $1 million daily mark since 2022. Nearly 20% of the collection is held by ten individual wallets.  The decline comes alongside generally waning retail interest in Ethereum NFT collections, Google search data suggests. Meanwhile, newer collections on Bitcoin and Solana have started to gain more interest among investors.  The rise of the apes and subsequent decline  Bored Apes is a collection of 10,000 digital monkeys on the Ethereum blockchain. It features pictures of cartoon apes procedurally generated by an algorithm. Each monkey has certain traits—some more rare than others—that give it value.  Owners are granted certain benefits, such as access to a private online club or in-person events. Using the NFT for a profile picture is also prominent as a show of wealth online.  Bored Apes amassed quick popularity in the 2021 bull market, with several prominent celebrities claiming to purchase the NFTs for over $300,000 apiece. Popular rappers performed with their Bored Apes on virtual worlds, while singer Justin Bieber bought a Bored Ape deemed “rare” for over $1.2 million.  However, in June 2023, reports suggested that crypto services company MoonPay may have gifted the Bored Apes to some of those celebrities, likely denting investor confidence. MoonPay denied the claims at the time.

42391006,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRxO5,1713253185,"Bitcoin Miner CEOs Are Upbeat Ahead of the Halving, Expect M&A: Bernstein","Mining stocks have underperformed bitcoin this year.  The CEOs of these companies remain upbeat ahead of the halving citing stronger balance sheets, the report said.  Some CEOs noted the potential for consolidation in the sector, Bernstein said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} miners may have underperformed the cryptocurrency this year, but their CEOs remain upbeat as the reward halving approaches, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday.  The underperformance has been caused by strong moves in spot bitcoin and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have sucked ""retail liquidity"" from mining stocks, and by concerns about the impact of the halving on miner revenues, analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are reduced, slowing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply. The next halving is due around April 19-20.  The broker interviewed the CEOs of Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), Marathon Digital (MARA), Cipher Mining (CIFR) and Hut 8 (HUT). The companies are in a relatively comfortable financial position this cycle and so are better prepared to withstand the impact of the halving, Bernstein said.  The ""CEOs point to miner dollar revenues at all-time highs, providing a solid cushion to miners pre-halving,"" and they also noted the ""relatively low debt on the balance sheet.""  Some of the CEOs highlighted the potential for miner consolidation, the report said.  ""The CEO of CleanSpark expects the industry to consolidate to 4 leading miners and believes RIOT, MARA, CLSK and CIFR to be in the lead,"" the note said, adding that the ""CEO of MARA also highlighted a path to industry consolidation and named CLSK as their arch competitor in the race for acquisition targets.""  Another notable change this time round has been application and layer 2 development on the Bitcoin blockchain, which has led to an increase in network fees that flow back to miners as incremental revenue streams, the report noted.  Riot and CleanSpark expect to have doubled capacity by the end of the year, which will offset any impact of the halving, the report added.

Recent data from Glassnode has revealed a noteworthy development: the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio for Bitcoin has dipped below one. Related Reading: Bitcoin Below $70,000: Is $80K Still Possible, Or Is The Rally Over? This crucial metric, which compares the sell value of Bitcoin with the price at which it was bought, indicates that investors are currently realizing more losses than profits. Historically, such a dip has often heralded a potential bottoming out of Bitcoin’s price, serving as a vital signal for market watchers. Sense Of Optimism Despite Bitcoin Price Decline The past 24 hours have witnessed significant volatility in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. A sharp decline early in the day saw Bitcoin’s price plummet to approximately $64,000, worrying many investors. However, a remarkable recovery ensued, with the price steadily climbing and peaking at around $66,000. This robust rebound has instilled a sense of optimism, with a prevailing bullish sentiment taking hold as the day progressed. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.261 trillion. Chart: TradingView Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, with recent developments signaling potential shifts in capital inflows. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by Hong Kong regulators has opened the floodgates for increased institutional engagement, particularly from Asia. This move could inject fresh capital into Bitcoin markets, potentially fueling further price momentum. Furthermore, regional dynamics play a significant role in shaping investor sentiment and behavior. Varying investment trends across different regions highlight the diverse responses to prevailing market conditions. While some regions may exhibit cautious sentiment amidst volatility and geopolitical uncertainties, others may embrace Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Critical Support Levels Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo has pinpointed a critical support level at $59,000. Breaching this threshold could signify a transition into a bearish market sentiment. Conversely, there’s anticipation among investors for potential short liquidations that could drive the price upwards, potentially reaching between $70,000 and $75,000, provided that current support levels hold steady. These anticipated events hinge on market liquidity and investor reactions to the rapidly evolving price movements. As Bitcoin continues its consolidation phase near all-time highs, investors remain cautiously optimistic about its future prospects. The upcoming halving event adds another layer of complexity to the already intricate market dynamics, with expectations of heightened volatility in the days ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bonanza Before The Halving? Analyst Sees Pre-Crash Buying Window Analysts suggest that this period of lateral movement serves as a crucial stage for the redistribution of assets among investors, potentially laying the groundwork for a more sustainable recovery in the long run. The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, is navigating through a period of heightened uncertainty and volatility. The recent dip in the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio signals a potential turning point in Bitcoin’s price trajectory, while institutional interest and regional dynamics continue to shape market sentiment.

25831637,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603431,1713248419,"Why The Bitcoin Halving Matters, But Not The Way You Think: Expert","David Lawant, Head of Research at FalconX, a digital assets prime brokerage with trading, financing, and custody for leading financial institutions, recently offered an analysis on X (formerly Twitter) regarding the evolving role of Bitcoin halvings in market dynamics. This analysis challenges the traditional view that halvings directly and significantly affect Bitcoin’s price, instead highlighting a broader economic and strategic context that might be influencing investor perceptions and market behavior more profoundly. The Miner’s Diminishing Impact On Bitcoin Price Lawant begins by addressing the changing impact of Bitcoin miners on market prices. He presents a detailed chart comparing the total mining revenue to the Bitcoin spot traded volume from 2012 onwards, clearly marking the dates of the three previous halvings. This data reveals a significant shift: “The most crucial chart for comprehending halving dynamics is the one below, not the price chart. It illustrates the proportion of total mining revenue compared to BTC spot traded volume since 2012, with the three halving dates marked.” In 2012, total mining revenue was multiples of the daily traded volume, highlighting a time when miners’ decisions to sell could have significant impacts on the market. By 2016, this figure was still a notable double-digit percentage of daily volume but has since declined. Lawant emphasizes, “While miners remain integral to the Bitcoin ecosystem, their influence on price formation has notably waned.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Readying For A 12-Year Bull Run To $650,000 If Bulls Take Charge: Analyst He elaborates that this reduction is partly due to the increasing diversification of Bitcoin holders and the growing sophistication of financial instruments within the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, not all mining revenue is immediately impacted by halving events—miners may choose to hold onto their rewards rather than sell, affecting the direct impact of reduced block rewards on supply. Lawant connects the timing of halvings to broader economic cycles, proposing that halvings do not occur in isolation but alongside significant monetary policy shifts. This juxtaposition increases the narrative impact of halvings, as they underscore Bitcoin’s attributes of scarcity and decentralization during periods when traditional monetary systems are under stress. “Bitcoin halving events tend to occur during critical monetary policy turning points, so the narrative fit is just too perfect to assume they cannot influence prices,” Lawant observes. This statement suggests a psychological and strategic dimension where the perceived value of Bitcoin’s scarcity becomes more pronounced. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Showing Different Behavior From Past Cycles, But Why? The analysis then shifts towards the macroeconomic environment influencing Bitcoin’s appeal. Lawant references the 2020 discussion by investor Paul Tudor Jones who labeled the economic climate as “The Great Monetary Inflation,” a period marked by aggressive monetary expansion by central banks. Lawant argues, “I’d argue that this was a more important factor in the 2020-2021 bull run than the direct flow impact from the halving,” pointing out that macroeconomic factors may have had a more substantial influence on Bitcoin’s price than the halving itself. Future Prospects: Macroeconomics Over Mechanics Looking towards the future, Lawant speculates that as the world enters a new phase of economic uncertainty and potential monetary reform, macroeconomic factors will increasingly dictate Bitcoin’s price movements rather than the mechanical aspects of halvings. “Now in 2024, the concerns center around the aftermath of the fiscal/monetary policies that have been in place for decades but are getting turbocharged in a world that is very different from four years ago. We are potentially entering a new leg of this macroeconomic cycle, and macro is becoming a more critical factor in BTC price action,” he concludes. This perspective suggests that while the direct price impact of Bitcoin halvings may diminish, the broader economic context will likely highlight Bitcoin’s fundamental properties—immutability and a fixed supply cap—as crucial anchors for its value proposition in a rapidly evolving economic landscape.

With the bond market now projecting less than three cuts and 10-year Treasury Yields surpassing 4.50%, we may have arrived at a crucial tipping point for risk assets,” Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said in a note to clients Tuesday.  “We sold all our tech stocks last night (at the open) as the Nasdaq is trading very poorly and reacting to the higher bond yield. We only hold a few high-conviction crypto coins. Overall, we are bearish risk assets (stocks + crypto).” Thielen added.  Traders have recently scaled back pricing for 25 basis point Fed rate cuts this year to less than three from six at the beginning of the year, data from CMEGroup show.  The so-called hawkish repricing, spurred by sticky U.S. inflation and a resilient labor market and economy, has lifted the 10-year Treasury yield 40 basis points to 4.61% this month, the highest since November 2023. The sharp rise in the so-called risk-free rate has dented the appeal of investing in high-risk/high-return assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies.  ""Most of this 2023/2024 bitcoin rally is driven by expectations that interest rates would be cut, and this narrative is being seriously challenged now,"" Thielen noted, adding that inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have dried.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted nearly a dozen spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, allowing investors to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own and store it.  Since then, nearly $12 billion has flowed into these investment vehicles. However, most flows happened last quarter, powering the cryptocurrency higher, and the demand has faded this month.  The 5-day average of the net inflows into the spot ETFs has dropped to zero.  ""After an initial novelty hype, ETF flows tend to run out unless prices continue increasing—which they have not done since early March. With two—to 17% drawdowns, those investors might stay on the sidelines,"" Thielen explained.  Some observers expect the correction to gather pace once the hype surrounding the Bitcoin network's quadrennial mining reward halving due on April 20 fades. The inbuild code will reduce the per-block coin emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, effectively halving the pace of supply expansion.  Bitcoin changed hands at $62,600, representing a 42% year-to-date gain, CoinDesk data show. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market index, stood at 2119 points at press time, up 17% for the year.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/16/analyst-who-called-bitcoins-pre-halving-rally-to-70k-turns-bearish,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bd3143c1db79881218d247f8e2d6c37d47379a4-4272x2403.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto analyst Willy Woo has shared his perspective on the potential impact of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on market dynamics. According to Woo, introducing the new Bitcoin ETFs could lead to significant price targets, with projections ranging from $91,000 at the bear market bottom to $650,000 at the bull market top. The new #Bitcoin ETFs brings price targets of $91k at the bear market bottom and $650k at the bull market top once ETF investors have fully deployed according to asset manager recommendations***. These are very conservative numbers. #Bitcoin will beat gold cap when ETFs have… — Willy Woo (@woonomic) April 15, 2024 Woo’s analysis underscores the growing institutional interest in BTC, with asset managers expected to allocate a substantial portion of their funds to the cryptocurrency.

In a post on X, Woo said the coin could soar to as high as $91,000 in a bear bottom but soar to as high as $650,000 in a bull market top. However, Bitcoin will only soar to these mega valuations, assuming that leading asset managers will fully deploy their recommended allocations to the world’s most valuable crypto asset. Bitcoin In A Wide Range At spot rates, Bitcoin looks shaky. Even after the surge to all-time highs of over $73,000 in mid-March 2024, the coin has been under pressure. So far, prices are within a range. There are caps at $73,800, or an all-time high, on the upper end and around $61,000 on the lower end of its current range. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Insider Reveals Top 5 Shibarium Investment Rules As long as prices are inside this zone, the uptrend remains. This preview considers the formation established in the better part of Q1 2024 after the first spot of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States was approved. In the post on X, the analyst should note that the rise to $91,000 and $650,000 are long-term targets and not for the current market cycle. Most importantly, Woo added, it will depend on how fast and aggressively asset managers like BlackRock add BTC to their diversified portfolios. Even so, this projection excludes inflows from non-custodial wallets. Capital flows from these wallets are projected to be higher due to rising crypto adoption. Here’s How BTC Will Soar In The Coming Years In Woo’s assessment, asset managers manage around $100 trillion globally. If they decide to invest 2% of their holdings in Bitcoin as Fidelity recommends, the asset could receive around $2 trillion. Additionally, considering the coin’s value, based on on-chain movement, worth around $561 billion, the total investment would reach $2.56 trillion. Using the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, Woo said BTC could soar to a market high of $650,000 in a bull cycle. The MVRV is a metric that compares market capitalization to on-chain investment. Conversely, BTC could reach a swing low of $91,000 if the crypto market crushes. The MVRV ratio is typically 5X in bull market tops and 0.7X in bear market bottoms.

Bitcoin Miner Transfers Over $3 Million BTC After 14-Year Dormancy,"According to the on-chain analysis platform Lookonchian, a long-dormant Bitcoin (BTC) wallet dating back to April 2010, recently transferred 50 BTC, equivalent to $3.328 million. Related Reading: Breaking: Spot Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs Approved In Hong Kong Unraveling The Transaction: An Exploration of Potential Motives As reported by Lookonchian, 50 BTC mined over 14 years ago, when each block reward was 50 BTC, was divided into two transactions: 17 BTC ($1.1 million) for one wallet and 33 BTC ($2.2 million) for another. The recipient wallet receiving 17 BTC has shown patterns of frequent transactions, possibly indicating its association with a cryptocurrency exchange, particularly Coinbase. The analysis further reveals that the Bitcoin sent to this wallet was subsequently merged with funds from other wallets associated with Coinbase, suggesting a possible deposit into the exchange. A miner wallet woke up after being dormant for nearly 14 years and deposited 50 $BTC($3.28M) to #Coinbase 5 mins ago. The miner earned 50 $BTC from mining on Apr 23, 2010, and has been holding it to this day. Address: 15sxzZ4QSaoiMo5KYH9ab4xQj34yeJmKgb pic.twitter.com/DRw9U5Xy8N — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 15, 2024 On the other hand, the remaining 33 BTC were transferred to a new wallet. This could indicate that this Bitcoin may have effectively remained within the miner’s control but under a new address, a common practice to enhance transaction privacy. Bitcoin Recovery Amid Impending Halving This recent activity coincides with Bitcoin’s rebound following a sharp decline that saw its price plummet from over $70,000 to $62,000 over the weekend. However, at the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,109, marking a 0.5% increase in value over the past 24 hours. This surge in price comes amidst anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin Halving scheduled to take place in the next 5 days on April 20. Notably, the Bitcoin Halving is a programmed event that occurs approximately every four years or after every 210,000 blocks are mined. Bitcoin miners’ reward for validating transactions and securing the network is cut in half during this event. When Bitcoin was launched in 2009, the reward was initially set at 50 BTC per block. However, the reward has been halved, reducing the rate at which new BTC is created. This adjustment is designed to control the supply of Bitcoin, making it more scarce over time and ultimately contributing to its deflationary nature. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that BTC miners could face losses exceeding $10 billion due to the upcoming Halving event. As Bloomberg reported, this loss could result from several factors, including miners facing intensified competition from AI companies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bonanza Before The Halving?

Here’s why this may be so. Bitcoin Whales Are Showing Different Behavior In Exchange Inflows This Time As an analyst explained in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC whales’ movements have been different this time compared to the previous cycle. The indicator of interest here is the “exchange inflow,” which tracks the total amount of Bitcoin being transferred to wallets attached to all centralized exchanges. In the context of the current discussion, derivative platforms are specifically of interest. Related Reading: PEPE Preparing For A 54% Move? Analyst Thinks So When this metric’s value is high, it means that investors are depositing large amounts on these exchanges. Such a trend usually suggests a high demand for the services these derivative exchanges provide. Generally, extraordinary spikes in the indicator are associated with whale movements, given that only these humongous holders can cause such large shifts. On the other hand, when the metric has a low value, it suggests that the whales aren’t depositing anything significant to these platforms, a possible sign that they don’t want to take risks on the derivative side. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant, which shows the data for the Bitcoin exchange inflow for derivative exchanges: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively low in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The indicator in the above graph also has another condition attached: it only tracks the inflows coming from the whales that had been holding for at least 1 month and at most 3 months. These would be the newbie whales in the market, but not quite so new that they have only bought (those with a holding time of less than 1 month). Restricting this time range also excludes the data of the traders who make a high amount of moves in short timeframes on average. As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, the whales in this group have usually made large inflows to derivative platforms around notable cryptocurrency tops and bottoms, when speculation is at its height. Interestingly, though, the cryptocurrency has witnessed no such large inflow spikes this year even though the asset has broken past the previous all-time high (ATH). One explanation may be that the whales are not interested in making any real moves right now. However, a more likely reason may be that spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) exist now. The spot ETFs hold Bitcoin on behalf of their customers and let them gain indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency in a way familiar to conventional investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin Usurped: These Memecoins Overtake DOGE In Active Trader Count The ETFs have brought significant demand into the asset and have quickly become an important part of the market. It’s possible that, with this new investment vehicle, the usual cryptocurrency exchanges no longer have the same relevance for the asset. This could be why the pattern that held during the previous BTC cycle has seemingly disappeared from the current one.

With the price dropping to $60,000, many investors worried that the flagship cryptocurrency was in trouble ahead of the “Halving” event. Amid the correction, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff claimed that his previous predictions regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) were correct and presented the possibility of a doom drop for BTC.

According to the economist, the problem with owning these investment products was that liquidity was limited to US market hours, which would mean that investors could not sell if the market crashed overnight. As I warned if #Bitcoin starts selling off tonight, #BitcoinETF owners can do nothing but watch and wait until the NYSE opens tomorrow morning. In the meantime it will be a long night hoping that Bitcoin doesn't crash before they have a chance to sell. https://t.co/GfLtl6Wc1S — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 14, 2024 On Sunday afternoon, Schiff claimed that, as he previously warned, Bitcoin ETF owners would be helpless if the flagship cryptocurrency started selling off that night. BTC traded around $63,460 at the time of his post and recovered in the following hour to trade above the $65,000 support level. Earlier that day, Schiff had warned of a critical support zone for BTC. To the economist, breaking below $60,000 could “create a formidable triple top.” This trend reversal could lead to an “immediate downside projection” of $20,000. Following his dooming scenario, Schiff stated that, at that price, MicroStrategy would “have a $2.7 billion unrealized loss on 214K Bitcoin acquired at an average price of $34K.” Additionally, he believes that BTC’s price could increase “before it crashes.” Analysts Unfazed By BTC’s Correction Several analysts concurred that the correction was a “minor drop” in the macro picture. According to MacroCRG, Bitcoin’s chart “looks incredible.” The analyst stated: “They threw a full-on war at her and all it managed to do was wick the range low.” Similarly, trader and analyst Rekt Capital considers that BTC “successfully protected the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range as the week of the Bitcoin Halving begins.” Per the analyst’s chart, Bitcoin is at the “Last Pre-Halving Retrace” during the “Pre-Halving Rally.” If history is to repeat itself, after April 19, BTC will enter the “Re-Accumulation” phase before experiencing the “Post-Halving Parabolic Upside.” Bitcoin phases during the ""Halving"" event.

However, Jelle also set a higher target for this bull cycle. The bullish megaphone pattern on BTC’s chart “still has a pattern of $180,000” despite the recent correction, as stated in the post. The analyst claims he wouldn’t be surprised “if the meme pattern plays out once again.” The correction caused BTC to register bleeding numbers for several periods. The biggest cryptocurrency exhibits an 8.4% and a 3.1% dip in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Similarly, BTC’s market activity has decreased by 32.1% in the past day, with a trading daily volume of $42.56 billion. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has recovered 3.5% from its price 24 hours ago, currently trading at $66,275. Since the lowest point of this correction, BTC has surged 10.3%.
