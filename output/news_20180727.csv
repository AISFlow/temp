42429427,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjRh,1532723796,"10,000%: Pantera Reports Massive 5-Year Crypto Investment Return","Cryptocurrency investment firm Pantera Capital reported a more than 10,000 percent lifetime return on Friday, coming five years after its formation.  In an email, co-chief investment officers Dan Morehead (who is also CEO) and Joey Krug shared the figure as they celebrated the fund's fifth anniversary. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they're still bullish about bitcoin, particularly in the years since Pantera's launch, noting that ""the Fund's lifetime return is 10,136.15% net of fees and expenses.""  To that end, Morehead and Krug included two emails that the fund sent out in 2013 to illustrate that point.  ""We wanted to share the original logic – as it is equally compelling today,"" Morehead and Krug wrote. At the time, an email sent by Morehead predicted that bitcoin – which was trading at $104 at the time – would see $5,000 because ""bitcoin dominates cash, electronic fiat money, gold, bearer bonds, large stone discs, etc. It can do all of the things that each of those can. It's the first global currency since gold. It's the first borderless payment system ever.""  Three months later, bitcoin was trading at $253 when Morehead again touted the principles behind the cryptocurrency.  Morehead wrote at the time:  ""In my opinion, it's like deciding whether to buy Microsoft back in the day at $0.20 a share. It was hard to do when the stock was just at $0.10. In the fullness of time…clearly a great trade. I believe bitcoin right now is just like that. The world's first global currency since gold and the world's only borderless payments system (frictionless to boot) at a market cap of $3bn? Now that Silk Road is gone, a new wave of sophisticated investors are entering.""  Pantera, which has since launched its own hedge fund to invest in blockchain startups, plans to travel ""over the next months to discuss Venture Fund III and the blockchain disruption.""  ""We have organized group lunches in many cities, should you want to meet other investors who share your interest in blockchain,"" the officers wrote.

42429436,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjjh,1532718009,What Volatility? How Facebook's Historic Loss Became Crypto's Gain,"July 26 might be forever remembered as one of the darkest days in Facebook's history – or, at the very least, for its shareholders.  An otherwise unassuming Thursday, the day saw the social media giant lose more than $120 billion in market value, the biggest loss in one day for any U.S. traded company. According to Bloomberg, the loss is a direct result of the company's second-quarter report on sales and user growth figures, which fell short of analyst projections, along with months of scandals and criticism regarding data privacy.  But if the social media giant was already having its worst day ever, crypto advocates were there to make it (maybe) just a little worse.  If you're wondering how Facebook's loss could possibly be associated with cryptocurrency, the answer is simple: it all started with a comparison between the values of bitcoin and Facebook.  Of course, crypto supporters would not let it go as cryptocurrencies have long been criticized for being volatile by traditional market views.  The seemingly tenuous nature of Facebook's stock price led some to draw comparisons with the volatility seen in cryptocurrency markets. As Romain Dillet put it, bitcoin ""feels like a stable asset"" by comparison.  Interestingly, as many can still recall the feud between Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss brothers from the award-winning movie The Social Network, members in the crypto community also gave a shout-out to Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss brothers, who are now among some of the biggest crypto investors as well as co-founders of Gemini, a New York-based cryptocurrency exchange,  In the words of one observer, the reversal of Facebook's market fortunes represented a dose of ""sweet revenge.""  (The Winklevoss brothers, as CoinDesk reported Thursday, suffered a blow as the SEC once again shot down their bid to have a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed.)  Not everyone was buying the Facebook stock and cryptocurrency comparison, however.  Some Twitter users who said they believe that conflating Facebook and cryptocurrency is a meaningless exercise.  As of the time of writing on Friday, Facebook's stock hadn't seen much of a recovery, according to data from Google. Yet the plunge seems to have been arrested, offering, at the very least, a possible reprieve from the crypto-critics.

The second part of a series of upgrades to make the ethereum network more efficient and less costly in terms of fees, Constantinople will be activated sometime before October's Devcon4 ethereum conference, according to stakeholders during a core developer meeting Friday.  That said, an exact block number at which the code would go live hasn't yet been confirmed for the backward-incompatible change.  A loose roadmap for the upgrade has also been suggested. Under that roadmap, the implementation stage continues until August 13, after which there will be two months of testing, including the launch of a Constantinople-specific test network.  The upgrade will include various optimizations aimed at making the platform more efficient – and less costly in terms of fees. Constantinople is the second part of a two-part series of upgrades, following in the footsteps of Byzantium, which was activated last October.  According to the meeting, a total of four ethereum improvement upgrades (EIPs) are currently being implemented by developers. Péter Szilágyi, lead developer of Geth, the most popular ethereum client, said they have already implemented most of the changes.  ""The EIPs are mostly done,"" Szilágyi said in the meeting.  Some of the upgrades that have reached the implementation stage include EIP 210, which reorganizes how block hashes are stored on ethereum, and EIP 145, which increases the speed of arithmetic in the ethereum virtual machine (EVM). Two other upgrades – EIP 1014 for the addition of ethereum state channels, and EIP 1052, a new op-code that compresses how contracts interact – are also being worked on by developers.  Two other notable changes are still up for discussion, including a possible delay in ethereum's difficulty bomb and an EIP that could improve how gas pricing works.  At least as far as the mining difficulty question is concerned – a contentious topic that involves a consideration of ethereum's issuance model and one that has different impacts on various stakeholders – no decision has yet to be made.

CEO Anti Danilevski wrote in a blog post that the startup's team discovered some 70 million KICK tokens missing from its wallet after the KickCoin smart contract owner's private key was compromised. Several users' wallets were emptied as part of the hack, though the startup committed to returning tokens to all holders.  Danilevski said the firm first learned of the breach when users complained they could not find tokens worth around $800,000 in their wallets.  ""In order to hide the results of their activities, they employed methods used by the KickCoin smart contract in integration with the Bancor network: hackers destroyed tokens at approximately 40 addresses and created tokens at the other 40 addresses in the corresponding amount,"" Danilevski wrote.  A spokesperson from Bancor told CoinDesk that the specific function which allowed the smart contract's private key to be compromised was built by KickICO, ""and was not a prerequisite nor part of its integration of Bancor.""  The spokesperson added:  ""Whether you put this capability into your token or not is totally independent from an integration with Bancor. And if you decide to build this capability into your token, you must protect it.""  Danilevski said that KickICO has restored control over the smart contract intends to return all lost tokens to users.  The platform, which launched in mid-2017, raised 5,000 ETH in a pre-ICO funding round, followed by a raise of nearly 85,000 ETH during its public token sale. The project's partners include decentralized exchange startup Bancor as well as blockchain startups Pacatum, Coinhills and Qoin.

The software mines an undisclosed cryptocurrency once installed on a computer.  The miner ""is capable of stealthily establishing itself in a system and spreading across large corporate networks infecting both workstations and servers,"" Kaspersky reported.  Illicit crypto miners have been rapidly rising in popularity among the web's criminal fraternity, being hidden in apps and websites to quietly harness user devices to earn the hackers cryptocurrency. Now it seems the methods they use are evolving.  ""It appears the growing popularity and rates of cryptocurrencies have convinced the bad guys of the need to invest in new mining techniques – as our data demonstrates, miners are gradually replacing ransomware Trojans,"" said Kaspersky.  Principal security researcher David Emm agreed, telling ZDNet:  ""PowerGhost raises new concerns about crypto-mining software. The miner we examined indicates that targeting consumers is not enough for cybercriminals anymore – threat actors are now turning their attention to enterprises too. Cryptocurrency mining is set to become a huge threat to the business community.""  The firm's report echoes concerns shared by other cybersecurity firms.

According to a report from a industry media outlet Android Police on Thursday, the internet giant revealed its shift in stance in a recent policy update for Google Play developers.  ""We don't allow apps that mine cryptocurrency on devices. We permit apps that remotely manage the mining of cryptocurrency,"" the policy states.  The restriction comes at a time when Google and Apple are both beefing up efforts to curb activities related to cryptocurrency mining on their platforms.  In April, Google banned cryptocurrency mining browser extensions from its Chrome web store after the company discovered a ""vast majority"" failed to comply with its single purpose policy or were malicious.  And, just last month, Apple updated its mobile application policy for iOS developers to prohibit any application that can be used for mining cryptos on mobile devices.  Such moves to limit openly disclosed crypto miners come as covert versions appear to be peaking in popularity in the world of cybercrime.  Kaspersky Lab, the Russian cybersecurity company, said in a report last month that incidents of crypto-jacking – in which bad actors hijack a user's device for crypto mining – spiked by 44.5 percent over the past year.  Similarly, a Skybox Security report just days prior suggested that illicit cryptocurrency mining has now become more popular than ransomware. In a mid-year update, the firm said that crypto miners now account for 32 percent of all cyberattacks, while ransomware only makes up 8 percent.

The app, operated by China-based Cheetah Mobile, will use a two-tier security system to grant users access to their holdings, according to a press release. The first stage will have users scan their personalized and encrypted QR codes, while the second asks pre-set security questions.  ""The QR code is highly encrypted, so it can't be decrypted by scanning it with other software ... [and] SafeWallet does not store your QR code on its servers,"" a company representative told CoinDesk in an email.  The system is claimed by the firm to be more secure than traditional mnemonic phrases, while also being easier to use. In particular, the system hopes to ensure users are not writing their backup phrases down on paper, ""which can be easily lost, stolen or damaged.""  SafeWallet believes that the new system can also protect against the risks that arise if users send their passphrases to themselves using email or instant-messaging platforms, which can contain malware or otherwise leak the messages to bad actors.  While acknowledging the possibility that someone could gain access to the QR code if stored on a device or in the cloud (which the firm recommends for convenient backup access), the representative said:  ""A hacker can't access your assets with your QR code alone. They would need to know the answers to your security questions (in addition to your regular SafeWallet password). Our security questions are more specific than your average security questions, so they would be extremely difficult to guess, even if someone is very close to the user. ... You are in complete control of your assets at all times. ""  Additionally, as a safeguard against theft, private keys ""will never"" appear as text in the wallet, they said, while SafeWallet will also scan users' devices for apps containing malicious code and notify users if anything suspicious is found.  SafeWallet product head Kaiser Zhang said in a statement that the new tool means ""there is no longer any need to memorize or transcribe long mnemonic phrases or private keys.""  He added:  ""This complicated backup process has been one of the primary barriers for users of cryptocurrency wallets, and especially for those who are new to the industry. With this latest update, we are proud to say that we have finally solved this usability issue without sacrificing any of the security capabilities that SafeWallet is known for.""  Further, the company has granted third-party developers access to its security tools, allowing others to add similar security features to their own projects. As such, ""SafeWallet's innovative ID system will serve as a bridge connecting decentralized and centralized systems and resolving ease-of-use and security issues for blockchain products,"" the company claimed.

42429423,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjJh,1532692806,Why Blockchain Is Becoming the 'New Normal' In Enterprise,"Richard Gendal Brown is the CTO at R3.      After years of discussion and planning, enterprise blockchain is now becoming a reality across industries as diverse as insurance, healthcare, gold, oil and gas, finance and more. But it's worth taking a step back and reflecting on the reasons why.  Have you ever stopped to think about the difference between the way businesses function and the way the markets in which these businesses operate function?  Most businesses are centralized, with the standard corporate structure of a CEO, a board of directors and all the departments necessary in order to run effectively; yet most markets are decentralized, with no central body in charge. As a result, these two inextricably linked entities function in entirely opposite ways.  When the IT revolution began many decades ago, it was natural for companies and other centralized organizations to be early adopters of the technology: there was a competitive advantage to be gained by optimizing a firm's operations, and a command-and-control mechanism was required to get the technology adopted and working practices changed.  As a result, it's no surprise that if we now look back on the achievements of the IT industry over recent decades we see that technology platforms have mostly been deployed within firms and have mostly been used to optimize those firms alone.  However, when you raise your attention to the level of industries and markets, you see an entirely different scenario. It's really quite remarkable how little has changed in so many markets. International trade today would be easily understandable by a merchant from three hundred years ago. The mechanics of how a complex reinsurance contract is negotiated would look little different from a century ago. The list goes on.  Costs of centralization  In fact, it's only when markets have introduced centralization, such as with the creation of highly regulated centralized infrastructure in the financial markets, that we've seen a transformational change at the level of an entire industry.  The results have often been spectacular. But they have come at the cost of new intermediaries, greater risk concentration and a resulting regulatory need to ensure these new institutions do not become rent-seekers or stifle innovation once established.  Until recently, we simply haven't had the technology that would allow us to make such changes without introducing new points of centralization and control. The deepest assumptions of most of the software that exists today are that it will be deployed within a firm, that it will be controlled by that firm, and that, because it is run by or for that firm, its outputs can be trusted by people in that firm.  And so we find ourselves in today's world, where each company in a market has an insanely complex IT estate with hundreds or thousands of corporate applications, many of which do the same thing as their competitors. Except the reality is, in fact, worse.  Not only do we have a mass of duplicated systems, none of them are ever in sync. They constantly have to be reconciled and checked to make sure that every party to a deal or contract is in sync with each other.  Bitcoin's lesson  However, the advent of bitcoin taught us something very interesting – it was possible to build systems that are deployed between multiple entities, who don't fully trust each other but desire to transact with each other, and to do so without introducing a new centralized party they must all trust.  It could be a massively powerful breakthrough to apply the same logic to other areas such as legal contracts and healthcare records, or reinsurance policies and complex loans. It could be the Holy Grail for optimizing entire markets without forcing these markets to reshape themselves to conform to the badly-fitting centralized models that today's software would demand. It would be the best of both worlds and could unleash a productivity revolution.  This is what we at R3 believe is the potential of the application of blockchain technology to business. Used correctly, it offers the ability for anybody to transact directly with anybody else on an open network, with total assurance that ""what I see is what you see,"" with guaranteed privacy and scalability.  Now, thanks to enterprise blockchain technology, entire markets are in the process of being transformed and it's happening without forcing new intermediaries into the mix or driving these riotously decentralized markets into inappropriate centralized models.  Blockchain is decentralized software for today's markets, and over the next decade, it will become the new normal in industries across the globe.

42381082,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93YCf,1532689206,Bitcoin Retains Bull Bias Despite Price Drop to Below $8K,"Bitcoin's (BTC) drop below $8,000 yesterday may have tempered the positive mood in the market, but the broader outlook still remains bullish, technical charts indicate.  The overnight drop in price came soon after the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) second rejection of the Winklevoss brothers' application for a bitcoin ETF.  While the decision may have soured the sentiment in the market, the price pullback was also likely a function of overbought conditions. Notably, the short-duration price chart had warned of a dip below $8,000 yesterday.  At press time, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $7,965 on Bitfinex, having clocked a three-day low of $7,848 earlier today.  It is worth noting that BTC is still up 40 percent from the June 24 low of $5,755, despite the pullback from the two-month highs above $8,500. Thus, it is safe to say the bull market is intact.  4-hour chart  The bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) seen in the above chart may have helped trigger a correction in prices.  The drop saw the cryptocurrency beaching the rising channel yesterday, neutralizing the immediate bullish outlook and also establishing a lower highs and lower lows pattern (bearish setup).  That said, the path of least resistance remains to the upside as the 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle moving averages (MAs) are rising and located one above the other.  The pullback has also allowed the RSI to position itself in a more bull-positive way, meaning it is no longer reporting overbought conditions.  Daily chart  Investors may feel tempted to question the validity of the long-term bullish breakout discussed yesterday as BTC has fallen back into a descending channel.  However, asset prices tend to revisit key support levels (former resistance levels) immediately after a long-term bullish breakout due to overbought conditions. This is widely referred to as a ""crowding out of weak hands"" (that is, bulls with low-risk appetite) before a bigger rally.  Hence, a long-term bullish breakout remains on the cards and would be confirmed if BTC makes a weekly close (as per UTC) above $8,050 (falling channel resistance) on Sunday.  Meanwhile, BTC retains a short-term bullish outlook, as the 5-day and 10-day MAs continue to rise in favor of the bulls. What's more, BTC is also trading well above the 50-day MA and 100-day MA hurdle.  View  The short-term outlook remains bullish, despite the overnight correction in BTC prices.  The 200-day moving average hurdle of $8,557 could be put to test over the weekend if prices find acceptance above $8,000 in the next 24 hours.  On the downside, only a daily close below the rising 10-day MA of $7,718 would abort the short-term bullish view.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381065,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93XrH,1532683847,Central Bank Crypto Could Bring Economic Gains: Bank of Canada Paper,"Central bank-issued cryptocurrency can potentially bring economic welfare gains for Canada and the U.S., according to a central bank researcher.  In a working paper published Thursday, the Bank of Canada's S. Mohammad R. Davoodalhosseini states that introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) ""can lead to an increase of up to 0.64 percent in consumption for Canada and up to 1.6 percent for the US, compared with their respective economies if only cash is used.""  At the moment, Davoodalhosseini says, a key question to the ""many"" central banks currently mulling the option of issuing a CBDC is whether cash and a digital form of fiat currency should co-exist, and if so, how to maintain an ""optimal"" monetary policy.  Based on detailed modeling and mathematical calculations, the researcher argues in the paper that a country's economic welfare – at least for Canada and the U.S. – might be better off by substituting cash with a CBDC, provided implementation is not extremely costly.  He wrote:  ""Having both cash and CBDC available to agents (consumers) sometimes results in lower welfare than in cases where only cash or only CBDC is available. This fact suggests that removing cash from circulation may be a welfare-enhancing policy if the motivation to introduce CBDC is to improve monetary policy effectiveness.""  The paper further states that, by introducing a CBDC, central banks could have a higher level of flexibility in adjusting current monetary policy.  ""This is because the central bank can monitor agents' portfolios of CBDC and can cross-subsidize between different types of agents, but these actions are not possible if agents use cash,"" it says.  The paper's quantitative approach follows a previous December 2017 effort by other researchers from Canada's central bank to gauge the value of offering a CBDC over cash – work that took a more qualitative look at the pros and cons.  CoinDesk reported at the time that the researchers argued that the potential benefits of a CBDC may vary between developed and developing economies.

42381067,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Xtn,1532678421,"There's a Bigger Scam Than Anything in Crypto, It's Called KYC/AML","Edan Yago has spent the last seven years engaged in payments using cryptocurrencies, first at Zynga, then as CEO of Epiphyte and now as the founder of a stealth startup developing a meta-stablecoin platform.  Follow him on Twitter here.      The worst-kept secret in cryptocurrency is that many projects are little better than scams: they've digested billions of dollars and what's come out of the other side has been, well... use your imagination.  But what about the ever-increasing, ever-complex, ever-demanding know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) practices required of young fintech and crypto startups when onboarding customers?  These practices have cost us many more billions than all initial coin offering (ICO) scams put together – and what they have produced, in my estimation, is worse than nothing.  They have created an all-pervasive, global surveillance apparatus. A system that keeps billions in poverty, kills innovation and provides an excuse for the banking system to lock out the competition.  Financial exclusion  Stepping back, in 1970, the U.S. passed the Bank Secrecy Act, which weaponized banking and financial institutions, turning them into an unofficial secret police. From then on, anyone dealing in finance was under ever-stricter orders to monitor the activity of their customers, pass details of ""suspicious activity"" to the authorities and block financial access to undesirables.  The direct cost of this compliance to the financial companies is now in the billions every year. But that is only the smallest part of its social cost.  Similarly to the war on drugs, the U.S. has encouraged KYC/AML regulations to spread around the world. Most countries have enthusiastically adopted them, and those that tried to resist, like Switzerland, eventually bowed to intense pressure. Today most of the countries of the world are joined together – administering the least publicized, most global form of Big Brother surveillance in existence.  Privacy issues aside, these requirements have ended up excluding an ever-increasing number of groups from the financial system. Immigrants, poor people and anyone without ""appropriate"" government-issued ID is left out of the formal financial sector.  In the U.S., over 10 million people are unbanked, and millions more in the U.K. But it is the developing world that suffers most.  Entire countries have fallen victim to prejudice and a lazy risk aversion on the part of the banks. Many small countries in the Caribbean, the Pacific and Africa are almost entirely locked out of the global payments system.  An entire country, Somalia, began to starve because U.K. banks decided it was not worth the bother to bank remittance services. Forty percent of the country's population relied on these remittances – people sending their hard-earned savings home to feed their families. The U.K. banks' excuse: payments to Somalia were ""high-risk,"" a euphemism for not worth the compliance cost of dealing with people with poor documentation. Invariably, those who pay the highest cost are society's weakest.  Perhaps the greatest cost of KYC/AML is impossible to measure because it's the things that never happened. We will never know how many innovative products and solutions never came to be because they did not fit, or could not afford, the current compliance regime.  In the crypto space, we see it every day. How many services died because they could not get banking? How many startups withered because they were forced to spend precious capital on lawyers, lawyers and more lawyers?  How many fintech alternatives could not begin to operate because they could not get licensing? How many alternatives to banking would the poor, the young, all of us, have if financial companies were not forced to be an unofficial arm of law enforcement?  We will never know.  Costs vs. benefits  To justify financial Big Brother, governments do what they always do in defense of intrusive measures. They trot out an ever-growing list of Very Scary Things™.  These include drug barons, terrorists, dictators, Iranians, and, worst of all, tax dodgers. Governments have sponsored any number of studies that show that KYC/AML helps frustrate the efforts of these Money Launderers™.  And perhaps they do frustrate the odd terrorist or oligarch (though apparently not very much). However, the question that is never asked is, at what cost?  Is it worth the more inconvenient, more expensive service we are all subjected to? Is it worth the exclusion of poor or marginalized people? Is it worth the entrenchment of the banking system?  Is it worth the massive troves of private information collected by every financial company and frequently stolen by hackers? Is it worth the creation of a massive, semi-privatized, global surveillance system?  It had better be. Otherwise, what a tragic, heart-breaking waste.

42381078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Y7d,1532671259,$1 Billion Chinese Blockchain Fund Denies Report of Government Pull-Out,"A $1 billion Chinese blockchain fund launched in April has denied a report that the local government will withdraw its financial support following the leak of a recording involving a former partner of the fund.  The news report in question, published by China Business Journal on Thursday, stated that the Hangzhou city government has demanded that the Xiong'An (or Grand Shores) Blockchain Fund stop promoting itself by describing itself as a government-backed fund. The Journal added that the local government has also decided that it will not contribute further capital to the project.  If true, the news marks a notable withdrawal from the initial plan revealed in April in which the local government agreed to contribute 30 percent of the fund. So far the government has apparently allocated 30 million yuan (around $4 million), the report said.  Citing an anonymous source close to Li Xiaolai, a well-known Chinese crypto investor and a former managing partner of the fund, the news source indicated that the government's decision to withdraw came after a recording of a private meeting at which Li made controversial comments was leaked early this month – statements deemed to have had a negative impact on the company and the city government.  As reported by CoinDesk, Li resigned from his role as the fund's managing partner on July 9 following the leak of a recording where he took aim at various individuals and companies in the blockchain industry using vulgar language.  According to China Business Journal, though, Li responded that the fund ""is not suspended.""

42381077,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Y3r,1532664008,"Left, Right and Center: Crypto Isn't Just for Libertarians Anymore","While some say crypto is apolitical, others argue a technology that takes direct aim at central bank-driven monetary policy can't be anything otherwise.  Indeed, many early adopters were drawn to bitcoin's revolutionary potential and there has long been a close association between libertarianism and cryptocurrency.  CoinDesk Research took the opportunity to test this association in our Q2 State of Blockchain Sentiment Survey. Among a wide range of questions, some were aimed at discovering the political leanings of the crypto community as they relate to the technology in general, as well as to specific coins.  And the findings were surprising.        The more than 1,200 crypto community respondents broke down to 8 percent anarcho-capitalists, 24 percent libertarians, 21 percent conservatives, 9 percent centrists, 27 percent liberals, 9 percent socialists and 3 percent nihilists. While liberal came out as the largest single category, if you combine libertarian and anarcho-capitalist, they outnumbered the liberals by 5 percentage points.  These identifications were chosen to best capture distinctive world views.  For example, libertarians can be statists (i.e., they may advocate limited government, but not necessarily the abolition of all government) whereas the anarcho-capitalists want to end the state outright.        After combining categories into our composite of the left vs. right spectrum, we observe that 52 percent of the crypto community are right-wing and 45 percent identify as being on the left. While ideologies on the right appear to make up the majority, it's not as wide a majority as you might expect.        Considering crypto's origins and reputation, it's fascinating that the left makes up such a substantial minority. Two factors could explain why these results deviate from commonly-held conceptions: time and crypto partisanship by coin (or coin tribalism).  Time:  Anecdotally, libertarians made up the overwhelming majority of early crypto advocates and thus the archetype stuck with the general movement. Since then, many more people have come into the crypto world drawn by rising prices and without such strong political views. 55 percent of our Q1 survey respondents started actively following crypto in 2017. These people could be motivated by politics, but more likely came in to make money and thus held views closer to that of the general population.  Coin Tribalism:  Ideology across cryptocurrencies shows incredible variety. Our survey results found that certain political ideologies clustered around particular coins. Bitcoin most closely resembles the general population, while other cryptos take their own unique formations. Ethereum seems to have the highest percentage (55%) on the left while dash contains the highest concentration on the right (78%). XRP clusters towards the center, while monero inversely nurtures the extremes at both ends of the spectrum while also taking the mantle for highest percentage of anarcho-capitalists (36%).        Interpreting the data  We reached out to a few crypto thought leaders for reactions to these findings.  On the left, Santiago Siri, Founder of DemocracyEarth, remarked, ""it's interesting to confirm the ideological biases of the communities behind the leading cryptocurrencies of our time, although probably in crypto we might need a different spectrum: one-coin-to-rule-them-all maximalists versus free market multi-token holders.""  In the center, developer and host of Ivan on Tech, Ivan Liljeqvist, suggested that, ""the people who were involved in crypto from the beginning were mostly leaning towards anarcho-capitalism and libertarianism, however that changed last year when the hype around Bitcoin and the entire crypto market attracted many other people with different backgrounds"".  On the right, the Bitcoin Sign Guy said it's ""not a surprise that the coins with highly centralized leadership and governance rank highly on leftism and socialism.""  Chris Derose, a longtime crypto personality and host of the podcast ""Bitcoin Uncensored,"" has been raising many questions around this topic.  After reviewing our results he commented:  ""The 2016 election had major impacts on the demographics of blockchain. Bitcoin was principally a conservative movement of goldbugs and libertarians in its early years. And an unheralded accomplishment of the ethereum blockchain might be in its ability to reach progressive blockchain investors. The 2016 election forced a divide in the community, with libertarian pursuits of independence and conservative principles finding ground in the dash, bitcoin, and bitcoin cash camps - and with collectivist interests of the left finding solutions in crowdfunding and governance structures.""  The right-leaning pioneers of pre-2017 crypto are faced with leftist migrants to their tech territory. As adoption grows, this trend will most likely continue and decrease the representation of right-wingers in crypto, especially of those at the far end.  If so, the original intention of a decentralized sound money could be sidelined for Silicon Valley's next consumerist app, Wall Street's next derivative database, or Washington's facelift on monetary policy.

42381070,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93XxZ,1532656866,Accenture May Use Blockchain to Track the Quality of Shipments,"Professional consulting giant Accenture Global Solutions may be considering using blockchain to streamline and automate shipping logistics.  According to a document published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, the proposed system would determine certain types of attributes for objects being shipped and store that information on a blockchain. The proposed system will then track the objects as they are shipped from one location to another, using the data stored on the ledger to confirm the objects' status and condition.  Devices participating in the network – which could be robots or unmanned aerial vehicles, for example – can check on the integrity of those shipments as they are transported to different locations, comparing their status to the information that's already stored on the blockchain.  The information can also be tracked by driverless or other autonomous vehicles.  If an analyzing device verifies the identity of an item successfully by matching its attributes to what's already described and stored on the blockchain, it will allow the item to continue its trip, whether that places it on shelves, onto a vehicle for further transportation or is incorporated into a further manufacturing process.  If the data from the current and previous stages doesn't match, the device may order the system to return the product and halt the payment.  The system can also create alerts and messages for managers involved in the shipping process or government agencies that regulate the product. The system could even call for a manager meeting if necessary or request that an investigator check if a product was tampered or altered.  The application is Accenture's latest show of interest in blockchain applications (and not its first effort to secure intellectual property related to the tech).  Last summer, Accenture and Microsoft launched a prototype of an identity-storage blockchain and is currently working with the World Economic Forum and the United Nations on projects concerning digital identity.
