42402214,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fUc,1542408319,"After Friday's SEC Actions, Experts Say ICO Party 'Is Truly Over'","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has compelled two crypto startups to register their token sales as securities offerings. It’s the first time the SEC has pursued such an action without additional charges of fraud.  In a pair of orders published Friday morning, the SEC announced it had settled charges with CarrierEQ Inc., otherwise known as Airfox, and Paragon Coin Inc., wherein both startups would register their tokens as securities, refund investors, pay penalties of $250,000 and file periodic statements with the regulator for at least the next year.  And like last week's settlement with Zachary Coburn, founder of the decentralized exchange EtherDelta, this seems to be a harbinger of things to come.  Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture capital fund focused on public blockchain startups, believes the regulator is building up a body of case law against unregistered securities offerings and bad actors.  ""It's really hard to say or predict what the SEC is going to do, but from what I understand from their strategy, they're going after the slam dunks, the low hanging fruit, the cases where it's clear that there's going to be a profit made with the token,"" Carter told CoinDesk.  Friday's  orders seem to support that theory, according to Stephen Palley, a lawyer with D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill. Based on the way they are worded, Palley says the orders ""would appear to apply to 95 percent of all the token sales in the last two years.""  ""In fact, the language is identical in a couple of places,"" he added. ""The footnotes are identical. I would say it definitely looks like a template to me.""  “Path to compliance”  Later on Friday, the SEC itself published a statement explaining its roadmap for regulating initial coin offerings (ICOs), crypto exchanges, secondary market trading platforms and other entities that facilitate token transactions.  Perhaps most notably, the U.S. regulator stated that ""there is a path to compliance with the federal securities laws"" for startups issuing tokens, even if ""issuers have conducted an illegal unregistered offering of digital asset securities"" already.  Palley pointed out that Friday’s orders went “through a pretty standard Howey analysis,” referring to the three-pronged test used to determine whether an object offered for sale qualifies as a security.  The Howey test specifically looks for an investment of money in a common enterprise, meaning that more than one party has funds tied up in the venture and an expectation of profit, said Casey Jennings, a senior associate with financial services law firm Seward & Kissel LLP.  Importantly, Palley noted, while previous orders against ICO startups have included allegations of fraud or similar misdeeds, Friday’s announcement did not.  For companies concerned about whether they may have violated securities law, Palley recommends checking in with a lawyer.  Carter went one step further, advising ICOs to move away from their tokens immediately:  ""My advice to all ICOs would be to get ahead of the game and close up shop, delist the token, get everyone their money back and pursue a normal business model that doesn't require a token.""  Ramping up  The SEC has been ramping up its efforts as it charges or settles charges with different startups, Palley noted.  Anthony Tu-Sekine, a partner at Seward & Kissel, agreed, noting that the SEC has ""ratcheted up the volume"" of its actions.  The DAO Report, for example, outlined the SEC’s views but did not take any actions against the organization, though this may have, in part, been because the DAO had already refunded investors, he said.  Palley noted that following the DAO Report was the Munchee order from December 2017 – at the time, Munchee agreed to refund all of its investors, but was not required to pay any penalties or fees.  ""They’re tightening the screws a little bit,"" Tu-Sekine said.  The SEC statement Friday recommended that projects reach out to legal counsel, as well as the regulator itself through its FinHub project.  Actually refunding investors may be an issue for some ICO projects. Carter noted that Paragon and Airfox were both able to provide full rescission to their investors, but not every ICO would be able to do that.  Even startups which have kept all of the tokens they raised during their sales will have lost money in terms of the U.S. dollar due to the bear market, he noted, meaning they may have difficulty paying investors.  From an investor perspective, Carter noted, ""what matters is the notion of an ICO is pretty debunked as a fundraising method and we can go back to things that make sense for investors.""  He concluded:  ""I guess it's going to take the market a while to realize the party is over, but the party is truly over.""

42402215,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fWa,1542383822,SEC Settles Securities Registration Charges Against 2 ICO Startups,"UPDATE 11/20/18 15:45 UTC: Airfox said in an email that it will allow certain investors in its ICO to reclaim funds, plus interest. Investors can can find more information onlinehttps://airfox.com/uploads/Draft-Claim-form-and-Procedures.pdf.      Two cryptocurrency startups have agreed to register their initial coin offering (ICO) tokens as securities after settling charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The SEC's Friday announcement centered on two firms: CarrierEQ Inc., also known as Airfox, and Paragon Coin Inc., both of which conducted token sales last year. Airfox raised $15 million through its sale, while Paragon raised $12 million, according to statements.  The U.S. securities regulator contended that neither startup registered their ICOs as securities offerings, and neither qualified for registration exemptions. In addition to registering their tokens as securities, both companies will refund investors, file periodic reports to the SEC and pay $250,000 apiece in penalties.  The SEC's statement noted that these two cases are the SEC's ""first cases imposing civil penalties solely for ICO securities offering registration violations.""  SEC Enforcement Division co-director Stephanie Avakian said that the agency has ""made it clear that companies that issue securities through ICOs are required to comply with existing statutes and rules governing the registration of securities.""  She added:  ""These cases tell those who are considering taking similar actions that we continue to be on the lookout for violations of the federal securities laws with respect to digital assets.""  The release further referenced the Munchee ICO, which the regulator halted last December. Like Airfox and Paragon, Munchee agreed to refund investors in its $15 million token sale, though the SEC did not impose additional fines at the time.  Friday's announcement comes on the heels of the SEC revealing settled charges against Zachary Coburn, founder of the decentralized exchange EtherDelta, with running an unregistered securities exchange.  At the time, an individual familiar with the SEC's thinking noted that the regulator is likely to focus increasingly on token trading platforms.

According to figures provided to CoinDesk from one of the largest jobs sites, Indeed.com, searches for roles involving bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency dropped by 3.06 percent from October 2017 to October 2018 (blue line on graph below).  Meanwhile, employer interest in such jobs – that is, the number of job postings – increased by 25.49 percent over the same period (red line on graph).  The statistics paint a “very different” picture than that seen last year, Indeed said.  In the year from October 2016 to October 2017, job seeker interest rose by 481.61 percent, while employer interest increased by 325 percent.  Raj Mukherjee, Indeed’s senior vice president of product, told CoinDesk:  “While over the last few years Indeed saw a steady rise in job seeker interest for roles related to cryptocurrency, our data shows that job searches for these roles really picked up around the time when the cost of bitcoin was at its highest. Since then job seeker interest has gone down, but still remains strong.”  A different report from job portal Glassdoor, published last month, indicated a 300-percent increase in blockchain-related job openings in the U.S. after comparing the month of August this year and last.

42402217,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fXZ,1542376801,Bitcoin Puzzle Artist's Crypto Gaming Startup Now Valued at $13 Million,"One of the bitcoin community’s best-known artists is gearing up to launch a blockchain-powered video game aimed at mainstream audiences.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Marguerite deCourcelle’s startup Blockade Games Inc. raised a $833,000 seed equity round the first week of November from investors including BlockTower Capital Partners and Horizon Digital, to put towards its flagship game, ""Neon District.""  With the raise, Blockade Games has garnered a $13 million valuation.  Ari Paul, managing partner at BlockTower Capital, told CoinDesk that deCourcelle’s long-standing reputation first attracted him to the startup.  DeCourcelle is known for fine art puzzles revealing the public and private keys – the alphanumeric strings that act as passwords for crypto assets – to bitcoin stashes worth more than $1 million total. But on top of that, the team includes artists and designers that worked on games like Spider-Man for the PlayStation 4 and the World of Warcraft trading card game,  “There are tremendous economic incentives for game developers to integrate cryptocurrency and for game players to want them to,” Paul said, adding that new crypto assets dubbed non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, can also strengthen network effects across gaming communities.  “I think we’ll see a rapid move towards this because we’ll see the economics are so beneficial in a straightforward way,"" he added.  Crypto rewards?  Although deCourcelle didn’t commit to cryptocurrencies being hidden throughout the new game, she did say, it might very well include some of her trademark puzzles with bitcoin rewards donated by the Pineapple Fund.  And with an advisor like ""Age of Rust"" creator Chris Loverme, who made one of the world’s first games with bitcoin rewards, winning the original cryptocurrency is looking more and more likely within the new game.  According to deCourcelle, Loverme is helping create bridges between external games and Neon District, a cypherpunk roleplaying game, which will launch publically in May 2019.  “For example, you could have an end-game experience in Neon District as a 2D game, then wake up in an Age of Rust storyline with your asset, and they can maintain some of the qualities they had beyond that trip,” deCourcelle told CoinDesk.  She continued:  “We’re really focusing on the utility of these game assets. So you have your core [storyline] loop, and then we already have designed multiple side loops that compliment and feedback into the larger ecosystem of the main game.”  The design is also an important part of the game – it progresses the concept popularized by the virtual pets collectibles Crypto Kitties by allowing blockchain-based characters to accrue scars, skills, weaponry and other unique distinctions while enhancing storylines and squad-based gameplay.  In addition to the characters themselves, the game will include puzzles that reveal NFT rewards like tools or weapons.  ""Creative explosion""  So far, there are already 8,000 people signed up for the Blockade Games’ mailing list.  While many of those people are perhaps crypto enthusiasts, the game is architected so that even those not familiar with cryptocurrency can play – and get their first experience with crypto.  “Let’s say I’m playing the game, and I don’t even know it’s crypto related, and I earn some item or reward,"" Paul told CoinDesk. ""I’m then informed by a little drop down box that I don’t have to do anything. But if I want to, I can claim ownership of this item outside of the game or I can transfer it to another game.”  Since utilizing the ethereum-based assets beyond the game will be optional, deCourcelle’s team is doing extensive research this winter through a holiday-themed mobile game called “Buidl Bear.” This digital version of Build-A-Bear workshops where people design their own stuffed animals was launched to better understand how gamers manage keys and interact with smart contracts.  Speaking to the artistic potential such blockchain-based gaming assets could open up for developers, deCourcelle said:  “I think there’s going to be a big creative explosion in this area. So we’re building this community that is very supportive.”  Image courtesy of Blockade Games",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/16/bitcoin-puzzle-artists-crypto-gaming-startup-now-valued-at-13-million,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8de165befaee98d074c113e97dfc6e16e8dedeb-1400x788.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the scheduled hard fork was originally intended as an upgrade to the network, the long-standard Bitcoin ABC version found itself with a rival network and token, Bitcoin SV, after it managed to garner enough support from miners.  Taking place at around 18:00 UTC Thursday, the event soon saw both networks producing new blocks, though Bitcoin ABC took an early lead. At press time, ABC has mined 34 blocks more than SV and has 59% of hash power, according to data from Coin Dance.  In an announcement Friday, Binance said all eligible users have now received both BCH ABC and BCH SV – the tokens that arose as a result of different stakeholders providing support for competing versions of the bitcoin cash software.  Binance said the tokens were allocated based on a ratio of 1 BCH = 1 BCH ABC and 1 BCH = 1 BCH SV, based on the snapshot of all BCH balances taken on Nov. 15, 4:40 PM (UTC).  The exchange added that trading for new pairs – BCH ABC/BTC, BCH ABC/USDT, BCH SV/BTC and BCH SV/USDT – kicked off at 08:00 UTC today. Deposits and withdrawals of the new tokens are still on hold, however, until the blockchains and wallets are deemed “usable and stable.""  Both the Bitfinex and Poloniex exchanges have also said they have made the shift to the new cryptocurrencies.  In a tweet, Bitfinex said:  ""BAB and BSV have been successfully credited to Bitfinex users and BCH positions have been claimed. The BCH symbol will not be assigned until the fork is complete.""  Similarly, Poloniex tweeted:  ""We’ve finished converting all BCH balances to BCHABC and BCHSV. The BCH market is now disabled. BCHABC/BTC, BCHSV/BTC, BCHABC/USDC, and BCHSV/USDC markets are open. Deposits and withdrawals of BCHABC and BCHSV are still paused, and will remain paused until the networks stabilize.""  Cryptocurrency data provider CoinMarketCap now lists both BCH SV and BCH ABC, reporting prices at $109 and $293, respectively. It also still lists the former cryptocurrency BCH at $405. If the data is correct at this early stage, it's worth noting that SV is down 23 percent on a daily basis, while ABC has gained 1.2 percent.

42402213,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fTd,1542370225,"Erik Voorhees, Salt Lending Being Investigated by SEC, Report Says","Crypto loans startup Salt Lending and former board member Erik Voorhees are said to be under investigation by the U.S. securities regulator, according to The Wall Street Journal.  In an article published Thursday, the news source cited ""people familiar with the probe"" as saying that Salt was subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February seeking information on its $50 million initial coin offering (ICO) held in late 2017.  Apparently under investigation is whether Salt’s crypto fundraising effort was in fact a securities offering that should have been registered with the regulator, the WSJ says, as well as how tokens were distributed to ""insiders"" and how the sale proceeds were spent.  Voorhees was previously charged by the SEC in 2014 for securities violations that ultimately saw him banned from making a bitcoin security offering for the following five years, according to an official SEC release at the time. He was also fined $50,000.  That case arose from the SEC's view that Voorhees had publicly offered securities without registering with the federal government related to the solicitation of shares in his bitcoin-related ventures, SatoshiDICE and FeedZeBirds between 2012 and 2013.  In yesterday's WSJ report, the sources also suggested the SEC is investigating whether Voorhees conducting crypto-based fundraising while on the board at Salt Lending violated the 2014 ban. The SEC reportedly declined to comment on the matter, when asked by the newspaper.  In a blog post Friday, Voorhees called the article ""inaccurate and misleading,"" saying he had abided by the terms of his SEC settlement.  Seemingly backing up the WSJ's sources, a private lawsuit filed Tuesday in Colorado by a former Salt executive also states that Salt is under SEC investigation.  The article also quotes Salt executive Jennifer Nealson as saying that the firm was subpoenaed by the SEC early this year, adding that Voorhees was no longer serving the firm ""in any formal capacity.”  Voorhees' lawyer, Brian Klein, tweeted a statement Friday, saying:  ""I am proud to represent @ErikVoorhees, a real visionary, who has abided by his SEC settlement terms. This @WSJ story is an unfair attack on him relying on unsubstantiated allegations, anonymous sources, and he is not even a party to the lawsuit discussed""  Both the WSJ article and Voorhees echoed that he was not involved in the private lawsuit.  The news comes after a WSJ report in September 2018 claimed that the ShapeShift crypto exchange, of which Voorhees is CEO, had been used by criminals to launder $9 million, based on its own investigation.  Voorhees responded soon after in a blog post, saying the claims were “factually inaccurate and deceptive.” He said the exchange had been working with the WSJ for nearly six months, but the eventual report “omitted relevant information” and showed that “the authors do not have a sufficient understanding of blockchain and our platform in particular.”  Correction (13:50 UTC, Nov. 16 2018): This article previously incorrectly stated that Voorhees was CEO of Salt. This has now been amended. CoinDesk apologizes for the error.  This article has been updated with comment from Voorhees.

42402222,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fdT,1542367825,Bitcoin Charts Suggest Price Bounce May Be Coming,"If past events are a guide, bitcoin (BTC) could in for a recovery rally in the short-term.  Following Wednesday's 10 percent slump, the leading cryptocurrency printed an intraday low of $5,188 on Thursday, before closing largely unchanged on the day (as per UTC) at $5,580.  The price swing formed what's termed a “long-tailed doji” candle on the daily chart, which is usually taken to represent indecision in the marketplace. The fact that the candle appeared at the bottom of the recent sell-off indicates the indecision is predominantly among the sellers and could be considered a sign of bearish exhaustion.  Potentially more interesting, though, is that throughout 2018, BTC has witnessed corrective rallies in the days following the creation of long-tailed candles.  Daily chart        As can be seen above, the cryptocurrency created a long-tailed candle on Feb. 6 and rallied to highs above $11,700 in the next two weeks.  On similar lines, a long-tailed candle on April 5 was followed by a rally to highs above $9,900 soon after – a pattern that was repeated in June and August (marked by arrows).  It's worth noting that the relative strength index (RSI) was reporting oversold conditions on each occasion. Further, the low of the long-tailed candles has never been put to test on the following day. However, the resultant corrective rallies each ended up creating a lower price high.  History repeats itself  The above chart shows:  BTC created a long-tailed doji yesterday.  The RSI is reporting oversold conditions.  At press time, BTC is trading at $5,540 on Coinbase – up 6 percent from the previous day’s low of $5,188.  So, the stage may be set for a recovery rally to former support-turned-resistance of $5,777 (June low). A break higher would allow a test of $6,000 – a level at which BTC had supposedly carved out a long-term bottom in recent months.  However, the historical pattern may not play out if prices find acceptance below the previous day’s low of $5,188. A break below that level would signal a resumption of the sell-off.  View  BTC could revisit $6,000 in the next week or two, having charted a long-tailed daily candle alongside an oversold RSI in the last 48 hours.  The overall outlook remains bearish as long as prices are holding below $6,000.  A close today below the yesterday’s low of $5,188 would invalidate the short-term bullish view and allow a drop to $5,000 (psychological hurdle).

42402212,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3fSe,1542362401,The Giant Bitcoin Rat Is Back And This Time It's After Alan Greenspan,"The artist behind a giant, inflatable piece of protest art dedicated to bitcoin is at it again.  After grabbing attention last month for his public critique of the New York Federal Reserve, artist and ex-hedge fund manager Nelson Saiers will now make a new home for his art on the streets of Washington, DC.  Like last time, Saiers has put a lot of thought into the design and location of the piece. He told CoinDesk that in the next few days, the rat would be positioned just blocks away from the Eccles Building, where the U.S. Federal Reserve system is headquartered. But that isn't the only reason for the placement.  According to Saiers, the rat will be let loose near Capitol Hill where Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman from 1987 to 2006, testified in 2008 that during his time at the central bank he had made a ""mistake.""  Saiers said he interprets this statement to be Greenspan conceding that he may have accidentally led the U.S. right into the 2008 financial crisis.  Pointing again to Greenspan, the rat will now be wearing a Halloween mask of Greenspan with a speech balloon coming out of its mouth, saying ""I made a mistake.""  ""Given ... we were in the midst of the biggest financial crisis in 70 years it was a bit late for the guy who led the Fed ... to come to this realization,"" Saiers argued, adding: ""Hence why I'm late to 'trick or treat' the Fed.""  Whereas last time Saiers told CoinDesk the art is up to the interpretation of the viewer, this particular look is pretty on the nose. During the rat's time in NYC, Saiers offered that the rat signified bitcoin taking on the existing financial system as an alternative currency option.  The bitcoin white paper was released on October 31, 2008, in the midst of the crisis.  Going forward, it's not just the U.S. Federal Reserve system Saiers wants to install the rat in front of. After DC – coinciding with the 10th anniversary of bitcoin's code release on January 9 – Saiers has tentative plans to fly to London to install the rat in front of The Bank of England.  This bank is particularly special in Saiers' eyes because it's the one pseudonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto ""called out"" in the message in the cryptocurrency's genesis block – embedding a newspaper clip one of the bank bailouts.  Speaking broadly about his art, Saiers concluded:  ""Again one of the reasons why a person may choose to invest in bitcoin is they are deeply scared of the Federal Reserve making a gigantic mistake.""

Speaking at the Economics of Payments IX conference on Thursday, Cœuré, who is also the chair of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures at the Bank for International Settlements, addressed the rising awareness of cryptocurrencies and their use as part of a broader speech on the 10 year anniversary of ""the Lehman debacle.""  ""In more ways than one, bitcoin is the evil spawn of the financial crisis,"" he said, noting that the bitcoin genesis block included a headline about the U.K.'s chancellor bailing out banks.  That being said, he added that ""bitcoin was an extremely clever idea.""  However, Cœuré appears to believe that the underlying blockchain technology may be a better idea than bitcoin itself, saying:  ""Sadly, not every clever idea is a good idea. The opportunities of the blockchain are many, but the problems of bitcoin are also plentiful. I believe that Agustín Carstens summed its manifold problems up well when he said that bitcoin is 'a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.'""  Despite bitcoin's issues, central banks can take advantage of distributed ledger technology to possibly issue central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDCs), he went on to add.  Some banks have already begun exploring the concept of central bank digital currencies, with 69 percent of central banks already – or at least planning to in the near future – studying how these may be used to aid national monetary systems.  In particular, he said, about 57 percent of central banks already studying CBDCs see two main potential applications. The first is specifically for high-value transactions, such as interbank transfers, whereas the second would be more general, for everyday consumers to spend.  Banks are also finding that there is ""a potential for cross-border remittances-related payment services"" aspect.  ""There is broad agreement that a CBDC, in whatever form, is unlikely to be issued within the next decade, even among those four central banks that have indicated that they have reached the stage of developing a pilot project,"" he said.

42402224,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3feS,1542344949,Bitfinex's Parent Company Has a New Offshore Services Provider,"iFinex, the parent company of controversial cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, appears to have hired a new offshore corporate services provider.  A trademark application dated Oct. 31 gives iFinex's address as care of SHRM Trustees (BVI) Ltd., marking a change from prior trademark applications – including one filed in June 2017 – which gave the address as care of Estera Corporate Services (BVI) Ltd.  Both SHRM and Estera, the filings show, are located in Road Town, the capital of the British Virgin Islands.  Recent trademark application showing iFinex's address as ""c/o SHRM Trustees (BVI) Ltd.""  Older trademark application showing iFinex's address as ""c/o Estera Corporate Services (BVI) Ltd.""  The change was first spotted by Jakal Intel, a pseudonymous sleuth who describes their focus as ""OSINT [open-source intelligence] driven investigations into investment scams and Ponzi schemes.""  Estera, which changed its name from Appleby in April 2016, also served as a director of Tether Holdings Ltd., according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' (ICIJ) database of offshore leaks. Tether is closely tied to Bitfinex, sharing directors and shareholders in common, and Tether Holdings was registered at the same Town Road address as iFinex.  Estera Corporate Services Managing Director Gareth Thomas confirmed to CoinDesk that iFinex is no longer a client of Estera.  CoinDesk reached out to Bitfinex, Tether and SHRM for comment, but did not receive a reply before press time.  Why SHRM?  According to SHRM's website, the firm provides a number of services to corporations, funds, family offices and yacht enthusiasts. The site lists a number of these services, including ""formation and administration of onshore and offshore companies"" and ""provision of directors and/or managers"" – both standard offerings in the offshore services industry.  There are few publicly available clues to what might set SHRM apart from its rivals, including Estera. There is, however, one example of a company hiring SHRM, reported by the BBC in 2017.  Bridgewaters, an Isle of Man-based firm that the BBC described as being ""involved in major deals involving Russian cash, including the purchase of significant stakes in Facebook,"" had a number of companies registered in the British Virgin Islands.  Bridgewaters had previously been a client of Mossack Fonseca, the now-defunct Panamanian law firm whose records formed the infamous Panama Papers leak.  Mossfon, as the firm was sometimes known, pushed to obtain additional information from Bridgewaters, including apparent links to Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, according to the BBC. That push for increased transparency appears to have driven Bridgewaters to find a new provider.  ""After Mossfon raised questions about compliance,"" the BBC wrote, ""Bridgewaters transferred most of its BVI companies to another financial services company, SHRM Trustees, in February 2015.""  Shopping offshore  iFinex's change in offshore service providers recalls the months-long search for a stable banking partner that Bitfinex and Tether engaged in under significant public scrutiny.  The two firms lost access to Taiwanese banks in early 2017 as a result of intervention by Wells Fargo. Noble Bank, based in Puerto Rico, filled the gap, but that relationship ended around October.  For some time it was not clear where Bitfinex and Tether were banking, and the exchange was pushed to publicly deny that it was insolvent. Tether's current banking partner is Deltec, based in the Bahamas.  The anxiety in the market around Bitfinex and Tether continues. Bitfinex recently introduced a 3 percent fee on large and frequent deposits, which many interpreted as being designed to slow the pace of withdrawals from the exchange, given that customers are complaining that they've been waiting weeks to receive fiat withdrawals.  Tether, meanwhile, has sought to produce convincing proof that the outstanding supply – which has shrunk markedly as the company has removed hundreds of millions of tokens from circulation – is backed by dollar deposits.  A recent letter from Deltec saying that Tether had sufficient deposits attracted skepticism from some quarters.
