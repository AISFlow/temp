Today the SEC announced a $268,998 settlement with ICORating for projects rated from December 2017 through July 2018. According to the SEC, projects rated by ICORating during that time raised funds through particular initial coin offerings which the SEC classifies as securities. As such, proper disclosures should have been made to potential investors.  A platform for rating investments in ICO-based projects, ICORating lists multiple team members from prominent cryptocurrency projects like NEO. No company members were charged in the SEC settlement.  In a statement, Melissa Hodgman, Associate Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division said ICORating violated Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933:  “The securities laws require promoters, including both people and entities, to disclose compensation they receive for touting investments so that potential investors are aware they are viewing a paid promotional item. This requirement applies regardless of whether the securities being touted are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain.”  ICORating agreed to pay $106,998 in interest and a civil penalty of $162,000 without commenting on the SEC’s findings.  August has proven to be a busy month for the U.S. regulator. Last week, the SEC charged New England-based SimplyVital Health for failing to register a $6.3 million ether (ETH) pre-sale of its HLTH tokens. On August 13, the SEC took action against two other ICO-based projects, PlexCorps and Reggie Middleton of Veritaseum.

Amaten, a secondary marketplace for gift cards, announced a partnership with the Singapore-based cloud computing startup Aelf, according to a statement published August 20. The exchange plans to scale its operations internationally using Aelf’s enterprise-oriented blockchain platform.  Founded in 2012, Amaten has grown to capture 40 percent of Japan’s gift card exchange volume and takes in approximately $110 million in revenue annually. On a global scale, the gift card industry has ballooned into a $340 billion market.  By converting gift cards to digital assets managed by Aelf's platform, the firm looks to “revolutionize the way gift cards are issued, purchased and exchanged.""  ""The current system and technology used for gift card[s] is completely obsolete and dates all the way back to the mid 90s,” said Amaten chairman Tom Kanazawa. ""It still suffers from basic fundamental shortcomings and is very inconvenient. I believe that the gift card industry can be a perfect use case for blockchain.""  Aelf’s blockchain will provide an immutable record of a gift card's issuance and any exchanges of ownership, thereby increasing the transparency of Amaten's platform.  “We have chosen to partner with... Aelf, because they offer the scalability, dedicated sidechains and smart contract modules that we very much need to build our service rapidly and most cost effectively,” said Kanazawa.  The firm also suggests that blockchain may reduce the amount of gift cards that go unspent.  “Through the partnership with Amaten, we are hoping to pioneer the adoption of blockchain solutions within the traditional industries,” says Aelf’s Co-Founder and COO, Zhuling Chen.

Robert A. Cohen will join the corporate law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as partner. The firm is known for representing several crypto firms including Coinbase, as well as large legacy financial institutions, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  Cohen tendered his resignation in July, after 15 years of government service with the SEC. His departure reportedly leaves the cyber unit without a leader.  As head of the Cyber Unit, Cohen oversaw the precedent-setting lawsuit against Kik Interactive for allegedly engaging in an unregistered $100 million securities offering. In a recently published rebuttal of the lawsuit, Kik denies the agency’s core complaints.  The cyber unit was founded in 2017 as a way to manage the development of the blockchain ecosystem and protect investors. The agency's mandate includes investigating financial violations involving digital assets, as well as policing cybersecurity issues. Cohen made a name for pursuing several actions against allegedly fraudulent initial coin offerings.  In an interview with WSJ, Cohen said the watchdog carefully weighed which actions to pursue.  “We brought some high-profile cases pretty quickly and we got the message out,” he said. “But the industry should have a chance to adapt to it. If the goal is to send the message, you should give people a chance to get the message and adjust.”  In his new role, Cohen will be barred from speaking with SEC officials for a year, per “revolving door” regulations.

In a website post dated Aug. 9 and entitled 'Prixbitend,' the exchange declared it would cease operations. The move was subsequently reported by local press.  ""Due to negative internal and external influences, management difficulties could not be overcome and normal operation became impossible,"" the founder wrote.  The exchange said it had worked hard to deal with hacking, money laundering and voice phishing. It promised to return all deposits for people who had provided customer information to allow for return. For other tokens still on deposit, the site encouraged the owners to register for a refund as soon as possible.  An Aug. 19 report in BusinessKorea said that the failure of the exchange had to do with ""financial difficulties"" and that investors were concerned about their holdings.  The report noted the bifurcation of the local market — in which four exchanges are able to connect to local banks for fiat transactions while the rest have been shut out from the financial system — as well as the low trading volume as factors.  BusinessKorea wrote that an estimated 200 Korean exchanges are in danger of closing down, a full 97 percent of the sector.  According to the magazine, the weakness of the local environment is leading many coins to seek listings overseas, while non-Korean exchanges are looking to provide won-denominated services.  It mentions Mediblock, a medical-related blockchain project, and Temco, a supply-chain blockchain project, as examples of local Korean players seeking the listing of their coins on overseas markets. The magazine said they were looking at Singapore or the U.S.  Prixbit's failure comes as the sector works to tighten security and get back to basics. Coinone has been especially active in this respect, doing a security validation and publishing listing rules recently, while its Malta exchange is in the process of closing.  Very little information is available about Prixbit and it seemed to do very little while in existence. According to Foundico, which tracks ICOs, the beta launched in February 2019.

42403173,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf9Oc,1566311418,"Pieter Wuille Unveils 'Miniscript,' A New Smart Contract Language for Bitcoin","Smart contracts could soon get a boost in bitcoin as prominent programmer Pieter Wuille has unveiled a new coding language designed specifically for their use.  Posted to the bitcoin developer mailing list Monday, the 'Miniscript' language aims to make it easier for programmers to write up ""smart contracts"" or conditions for spending bitcoins. Programmers Wuille, Andrew Poelstra and Sanket Sanjalkar have been working on the code for roughly a year, Wuille said.  Although it's been shared around behind the scenes, Wuille said he is now posting it to the email list because it's now it's reached ""a stage where I'd like to get it some more attention.""  Backing up a bit, ""Script"" is the smart contracting language in bitcoin, which allows users to specify certain conditions need to be met before the bitcoin can be spent. Say, funds are locked up until a certain time before they can be spent. Or, two people need to sign off on a transaction before the money can be moved, a concept called ""multi-sig.""  This programmability is novel when it comes to digital money, since before bitcoin, it wasn't possible to implement such rules without trusting a bank or a similar type of intermediary in the middle.  ""Miniscript,"" on the other hand, builds on top of this programming language, improving on it in several ways. One is it's a bit easier to look at and reason about, as Wuille argued with an example that ""that permits A to take the coins at any time, and B after [one] day.""  This are how these rules are implemented in bitcoin's Script:    OP_CHECKSIG OP_IFDUP OP_NOTIF OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <hash160(B)>  OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY <144> OP_CSV OP_ENDIF      Then, the same thing in Minscript:  or_d(c:pk(A),and_v(vc:pk_h(B),older(144)))  Miniscript builds on top of Script, able to ""compile"" to bitcoin's native language.  The new language is getting applause from developers in the community. Blockstream lightning engineer Rusty Russell, for example, tweeted: ""This will be one of those, 'How the hell did we do it before this?!' technologies. Unsexy and vital.""  There are many potential use cases, such as making it easier to implement such complex scripts in wallet, as Eric Lombrozo tweeted. Or, as bitcoin educator Jimmy Song described, it could even be used for underpinning the lightning network.  Thinking about it in the wider context of blockchain languages, Song commented that the smart contract language differs from ethereum's Solidity language, because while ethereum makes it possible to write many more types of smart contracts, Miniscript actually reduces the possibilities.  Song argues this is better because it reduces the ""complexity"" and ""attack surface.""  Included in this release are two working implementations, in the programming languages C++ and Rust, which Wuille called a ""work in progress,"" adding:  ""Through large scale randomized tests we have confidence that the language design and associated witnesses are compatible with the existing consensus and standardness rules.""

As a result, the SEC managed to get a New York court last week to temporarily freeze the assets of the project – which describes itself as a ""gateway to peer-to-peer capital markets"" – pending further discovery in the case.  Middleton stands accused by the SEC of spreading false information about his businesses,and conducting trades in the open market that hiked the price of the VERI token. The SEC further alleged he misappropriated over $520,000 of investor funds for his personal use, as well as $600,000 to purchase precious metals to fund another alleged scam.  The founder had failed to register the ICO with the SEC, the commission said. The SEC also disagreed with Middleton's claim the tokens were not securities.  Veritaseum's lengthy, 423 page response sets out its argument that the project had in fact issued ""utility tokens,"" not securities, that were to provide holders with access to research reports and later access to its ""software platform.""  The document states:  ""The tokens are not investments and are not securities. They do not represent an ownership interest in Veritaseum or its assets; do not give holders any right to share in the company’s profits; do not confer voting rights; and do not pay dividends or interest. Numerous token holders have used their tokens to avail themselves of the Veritaseum’s unique products and services, which the company has continually expanded and improved.""  The SEC had also justified the assets freeze on the claim that Middleton had begun transferring over $2 million-worth of investors' ether funds to “other digital asset addresses,” and his personal account soon after the agency had informed Middleton’s lawyers of the coming enforcement action.  The firm's response hits back at this claim, saying that its legal team had already ""demonstrated"" to the SEC that the asset transfer was ""routine funding of Veritaseum’s ongoing lawful business operations and was consistent with the company’s prior funding practices.""  ""The SEC did not disclose this information to the Court in its asset freeze application and incorrectly represented to the Court that Mr. Middleton had transferred a portion of the assets to a personal account. In fact, all of the assets remained in the company’s control,"" according to Veritaseum.  The firm further set out that the assets freeze goes against the very purpose of the SEC and is harming investors.  The firm called for the court to ""lift the freeze in its entirety,"" continuing:  ""The Second Circuit has instructed district courts to give careful attention where an SEC asset freeze might financially destroy a defendant’s company and thereby thwart the goal of protecting investors. ... The temporary freeze in this case has already caused significant harm to the holders of Veritaseum’s utility tokens, the very people the SEC is purportedly seeking to protect.  It further claims that the SEC provided ""no evidence that Middleton has dissipated or concealed company assets or is likely to do so in the future.""

According to Kurbanov, it took his Houston-based company 18 months to get approved, compared to the traditional 6 to 9 months broker-dealers normally need, because it had to prove to FINRA that IOI's business practices met regulatory requirements.  The discussions focused on ""post-trade processing in the secondary markets,"" Kurbanov told CoinDesk. ""We wanted to make sure that investors received the necessary protections, issuers were given the tools to manage their cap table, money flows were secure and appropriate reporting/record retention was implemented"" – the kind of services clearing and custody firms provide in the public securities markets.  Built for blockchain...  iownit's technology does not deal with crypto assets, however, but digitizes the securities issuance, asset lifecycle management and secondary trading processes to create a more efficient private market for institutional and accredited investors, Kurbanov said.  Unlike publicly offered securities – such as those Overstock's tZERO aims to tokenize – private placements are negotiated at a table between the issuer and investor.  “Private securities as a market is characterized by the diverse nature of the instruments and infrequent transactions,” Kurbanov told CoinDesk. “The distributed ledger is perfect for that. Because it allows you to have the concept of a smart contract that you can model any financial instrument without having to build a complex database that you have to do for over-the-counter derivatives.”  IOI would not say how much market share it hopes to have on the platform in a few years but said it has set a benchmark for three years out.  The company claims that the platform will be cheaper to use and easier to find information on than traditional private market platforms.  “This is a large market that doesn’t have infrastructure invested in digitization and automation,” Kurbanov said. “It is purpose-built for blockchain.”  ...but not named for it  The name iownit was inspired by the secure record of ownership of a financial asset that blockchains afford.  The company also rejected any proposed name with “blockchain” in it.  “We had a lot of people advising us to call it Block Security or blockchain this or that,” Kurbanov said. But this reminded him of an earlier tech hype cycle that ended badly:  “I resisted it because of the dot-com boom when everyone tried to jump on the bandwagon to call ourselves 'something dot com.'""

42403172,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf9Me,1566302422,Facebook Isn't Behind the First Incubator for Libra Crypto Developers,"The Takeaway:  An Israeli startup called Libracamp is funding development on Facebook's Libra testnet.  More than 80 projects have applied for the five spots in Libracamp's initial virtual bootcamp, which starts in November.  Even though Facebook admitted in a recent SEC filing that regulatory pushback may prevent Libra from launching, Libracamp remains undaunted.  The Libracamp founders are currently fundraising for a $1 million prize for the winning team as well as capital for a second cohort of the bootcamp in 2020.      A rag-tag team of Israeli entrepreneurs is looking to leverage Facebook’s cryptocurrency project for profits, even without the $10 million required to join the Libra Association.  So far the newly established startup, Libracamp, has received more than 80 applications to participate in a virtual bootcamp for Libra developers starting in November. Libracamp co-founder Tomer Weiss told CoinDesk that Facebook’s Calibra team is in touch with the new startup, but not officially sponsoring this program.  “We see this as the ‘iOS moment’ of digital assets and programmable money applications,” Weiss said. “Imagine there was an incubator that came to companies and helped them think about how to put their companies on iOS before the iPhone launched.”  Libracamp’s five co-founders scrounged together $125,000 to divide among five chosen teams for the first bootcamp cohort in the fall. The founders are currently fundraising for a $1 million prize for the winning team as well as capital for a second cohort of the bootcamp in 2020.  Self-taught crypto trader turned Libracamp co-founder Yonatan Ben Simon described his new startup as an “investment curation system” combining an incubator approach with hedge fund–esque capital pools. The upcoming Libracamp platform will connect Libra developers with mentors, grant opportunities and investors, offering a stronger “crowd-sourced” vibe than most accelerator programs.  Too soon?  To some, recruitment for this bootcamp may seem premature. Facebook stated in its latest Q2 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the Libra cryptocurrency project may never launch due to regulatory concerns.  Yet an anonymous source with knowledge of the meetings told CoinDesk Israeli regulators are enthusiastic about Facebook’s Libra project, as long as their American counterparts approve its launch.  Plus, Facebook’s Israeli head of policy, Jordana Cutler, is herself a former political advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.  The Israeli newspaper Globes reported that Facebook representatives met in July with officials every economic ministry in the country, from the Bank of Israel to the Capital Market, Insurance and Savings Authority, which regulates digital currency services.  Regarding regulatory concerns, Libracamp’s Ben Simon said:  “If it will go out, we will be a main player in the major financial infrastructure of the world. … If not, we can apply the protocol to other things.”  Compatibility  If anyone could profit off of one of the world’s largest fintech projects without cowing to its Silicon Valley creator, it’s a quintessential hustler like Ben Simon.  He’s got long eyelashes, an omnipresent smile and a quick wit – charm which he wields to cut through red tape despite an utter lack of pedigree. While nearby crypto startups like Orbs pursue the costly opportunity to formally join the Libra Association, as sources told CoinDesk, the Libracamp team seeks to align incentives across industry players.  The Kyber Network, one of the startups that received a small grant from Libracamp before the bootcamp, is already working on atomic swaps between ethereum and Libra.  Bootcamp mentor Lex Sokolin, of the ethereum-centric incubator ConsenSys, told “interoperability will happen” between the world’s largest networks.  “There will probably be cross-asset movement between different chains and we want to take a collaborative point of view on powering the next generation of fintech applications,” Sokolin said.  Beyond helping startups think about how to connect existing ecosystems to Facebook’s open-source Libra testnet, Sokolin also seeks to learn from these entrepreneurs. In particular, mentors like Sokolin, TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington of Arrington XRP Capital and Winklevoss Capital’s Jane Lippencot may want to better understand what types of challenges and tools crop up across like-minded entrepreneurs.  Sokolin said this knowledge could also apply to other ecosystems. So whether the mentor’s favorite asset is XRP or ether, they stand to gain from proximity to the Libra network’s first products and services.  David piggybacking on Goliath  Meanwhile, Facebook has ample reason to allow, even support, external parties investing in a robust ecosystem.  Indeed, one of the most salient criticisms lobbied against Facebook was its utter dominance over the Libra ecosystem’s infrastructure to date. This is, in part, due to the costly requirements for any company seeking to formally join the Libra Association. According to the Libra website, prospective association members from the crypto industry must currently be “custodying or staking greater than or equal to $100 million in assets for customers or clients.”  This hasn’t stopped companies from lining up, looking to tap into a new set of global payment rails. For smaller teams that lack deep pockets, Libracamp offers unique access to mentors that double as Libra Association, like Joe Lallouz of Bison Trails and Efrat Katz of PayPal. Sokolin said:  “It’s notable that even before the network is fully launched, entrepreneurs want to build on it.”  And while Facebook itself has shied away from developing tools for sanctioned markets like Venezuela, the South American team behind Valiu is already working with Libracamp on such solutions. (In typical Israeli fashion, the Libracamp team didn’t wait until the official program’s launch to start working with the most promising projects.)  Ben Simon added that until now, every fintech startup in the world was limited by geographic rails, whether it leveraged banking networks or credit card networks. Facebook’s global reach to 1.59 billion daily active users, on the other hand, offers his crew “asymmetric” benefits.  “We know there is uncertainty,” he said. “But with uncertainty comes opportunity.”  Image: Libracamp co-founders Noam Shahar, Tomer Weiss, Alon Shavit and Yonatan Ben Simon (coutrtesy of Libracamp)",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | KNC | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/08/20/facebook-isnt-behind-the-first-incubator-for-libra-crypto-developers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5eb0422ea35fc1652437eadee256a465d55e0e2-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403178,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf9SY,1566298843,Bitcoin Faces Further Losses After Rejection Near $11K Price Hurdle,"View  Bitcoin has created a rising wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart. A wedge breakdown, if confirmed, could yield a drop to levels below $10,000.  Bitcoin's recent recovery from $9,467 lacked high-volume support, so a rising wedge breakdown looks likely. The weekly chart is also flashing bearish signals.  A high-volume move above $11,000 would invalidate the bearish case and allow a rise to $11,500. A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed for a full bullish revival.  Bitcoin is losing altitude after rejection near the psychological hurdle of $11,000 earlier today, and may fall below $10,000 in the next 24 hours.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose to a high of $10,956 at 00:03 UTC today on Bitstamp, extending its recovery from the Aug. 15 low of $9,467.  The rise to $11,000 was expected, as the cryptocurrency's hourly chart was reporting a high-volume ascending channel breakout or a bullish continuation pattern yesterday.  The momentum, however, soon petered out just short of $11,000 and prices fell back below $10,800 by 03:30 UTC. Another wave of selling hit the markets in the European morning session, pushing BTC lower to $10,550 in the 75 minutes to 09:00 UTC.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,690 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.25 percent loss on a 24-hour basis. Prices are still up more than $1,000 from the low of $9,467 seen on Aug. 15.  Investors have associated the recent recovery with Friday’s announcement by the Bakkt exchange that it will be launching physically-settled bitcoin futures on Sept. 23, with some believing the news marks a long-term bullish development for bitcoin.  In the short-term, however, there is a strong probability that BTC will fall back below $10,000, as the recovery from recent lows has taken the shape of a bearish reversal pattern.  4-hour chart  BTC has created a rising wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart, comprising converging trendlines connecting higher highs and higher lows.  The converging nature of the trendlines represents weakening bullish momentum. Hence, a breakdown is said to confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  As of writing, the lower edge of the rising wedge is seen at $10,494. A 4-hour close below that level would confirm a rising wedge breakdown – that is, the bounce from $9,467 has topped out near $11,000 and the bears have regained control.  A wedge breakdown, if confirmed, would open the doors to $9,974 (horizontal support line). A violation there would expose the Aug. 15 low of $9,467.  The odds of BTC confirming a wedge breakdown in the next few hours is high, as the relative strength index has dived out an ascending trendline in favor of the bears. Further, trading volumes dropped during the recovery from $9,467, which usually happens during temporary corrective rallies.  Weekly chart  The 5-week moving average (MA) has crossed below the 10-week MA, confirming the first bearish crossover since February.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram continues to produce lower highs and is currently reporting the weakest bullish momentum in six months. The 14-week relative strength index (RSI) has also produced a bearish lower high.  BTC fell 10.49 percent last week, strengthening the case for a deeper pullback put forward by the rejection above $12,000 two weeks ago.  All-in-all, BTC risks falling below $10,000 in the next 24 hours or so. The bearish case would be invalidated if prices print a 4-hour close above $11,000 on the back of high volumes.  That would signal a continuation of the recovery from the Aug. 15 low of $9,467 and allow a rise to $11,589 (resistance on the 4-hour chart).

Thirty-nine-year-old Sky Justin Gornik had pleaded guilty to using a number of marketplaces such as Alpha Bay, Trade Route, Abraxas, Evolution, Outlaw Market, and Dream Market to deal in fentanyl, carfentanil, ketamine, oxycodone, amphetamine and other drugs under various pseudonyms, according to a Department of Justice announcement on Monday.  In a raid on Gornik's home, law enforcement agents seized 1.7 grams of carfentanil and sheets of fentanyl gelatin tablets on June 7, 2017, court documents say. The amount of carfentanil – a super-potent synthetic opioid – found reportedly equated to ""over 86,000 fatal dosages.""  Gornik was found to have been buying 600-1,200 fentanyl gel tablets a week over around two years from another dark web dealer, identified as Oklahoma resident Steven Wallace George. George has been prosecuted by federal authorities in his home state for manufacturing the fentanyl tablets from pure fentanyl obtained from China.  With his guilty plea, Gornik also agreed to forfeit ""millions of dollars"" in cryptocurrencies including bitcoins, stratis, ethereum and monero accrued as part of his drug trading. His crypto holdings were held in accounts at the U.S.-based Bittrex and Poloniex exchanges.  ""Gornik admitted that these digital or crypto currency represented drug trafficking proceeds of the offense and were involved in the offense of money laundering over the Dark Web,"" according to the Southern District of California Attorney's Office.  Gornik was given a 70-month sentence for the drugs charges and for laundering drug proceeds using digital currencies.  The investigation into Gornik's criminal activities was led by U.S. Postal Inspectors in San Diego with the assistance of special agents at Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).  Juan Munoz, acting special agent in charge of HSI in San Diego, said:  “Today’s sentencing of Gornik demonstrates the commitment of Homeland Security Investigations and our federal partners to bring these criminals to justice.

42403174,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf9Nd,1566273640,"Central Banks, Stablecoins and the Looming War of Currencies","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  This essay is presented as a part of No Closing Bell, a series leading up to Invest: Asia 2019 focused on how the Asian crypto markets are interacting with and impacting global investors. To keep the conversation going in person, register for Invest: Asia 2019 coming up in Singapore on Sept. 11-12.      Facebook’s Libra project, in which a group of companies managing a basket of fiat currencies will maintain a digital token at a stable, redeemable value, has taken the idea of “stablecoins” out of the crypto echo chamber and thrust it into the public arena.  But if the raging debate that Libra sparked among government officials, financial executives and businessmen seems overwhelming, you better get used to it. A flood of competing stablecoins is coming to the global economy. And Asia, with its vibrant cross-border trade, might be Ground Zero in their battle for supremacy.  This is both exciting and somewhat terrifying.  By far the most important player here is not a startup, a bank, or even a tech company. It’s the Chinese government.  The People’s Bank of China’s forthcoming central bank-backed digital currency, or CBDC, is not a stablecoin per se – its value isn’t just expressed in terms of a fiat-currency benchmark; it’s a fully digital version of the renminbi itself. Still, China’s move will inevitably drive other entities – private and public – to develop their own actual or de facto digital fiat currencies.  CBDCs and stablecoins potentially solve one of the biggest problems dogging smart-contract and blockchain projects. Until now, designers of blockchain solutions for, say, supply chains or remittances had two choices of payment mechanism: they could do an on-chain integration of a volatile, cryptocurrency such as bitcoin that most people don’t use or they could run it, inefficiently, off-chain through the existing, clunky banking system. If, instead, a proven monetary unit such as the dollar had programmable, smart-contract qualities of its own, significant new efficiencies in commerce would, in theory, be possible.  With China moving first, I see other central banks reactively following suit, partly out of fear that a digital renminbi will gain a bigger role in international trade, especially within the 65 countries of the Belt and Road initiative. (For why this matters geopolitically, imagine a Russian importer and Chinese exporter using smart contracts and atomic swaps to hedge exchange rate risks between digital versions of the renminbi and ruble – it would make the dollar obsolete as a trusted, stable intermediary for international trade.)  Notably, days before state-owned China Daily first reported on China’s CBDC progress, Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank of International Settlements, made a startling about-face. Whereas he had previously dismissed the value of digital currencies, now he was telling the Financial Times that other central bank digital currencies might come “sooner than we think.”  Already we’ve seen regional central banks, such as Thailand’s, experiment with digital currencies for interbank transfers.  One problem is that CBDCs will raise fears of state surveillance, especially from China, whose encroachment on civil freedoms has fueled wild protests in Hong Kong. Enterprises and people don’t want their own governments, much less foreign governments, monitoring their expenditures.  Here lies an opportunity for stablecoins from non-government, cryptocurrency developers, especially if they can offer stronger privacy assurances than Facebook’s Libra designers.  Among those, the choice now is between reserve-backed stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins.  The market for the former was once dominated by Hong Kong-based Tether’s USDT, but since doubts were raised about its opaque reserve-management system, a new set of coins backed by more tightly regulated entities has taken prominence, including Gemini’s GUSD, Paxos’s PAX and Circle’s and Coinbase’s USDC.  Among algorithmic stablecoins, the clear leader is DAI, a dollar-denominated token developed by ethereum-based MakerDao that’s founded on smart contract-managed, collateralized ether loans.  Algorithmic stablecoins have the advantage of not relying on a trusted third party, whereas the reserve model requires an identified entity to stand behind its declared holdings of fiat currency. But on-chain stablecoins like DAI could potentially be gamed by high-frequency trading bots and are dependent for growth on ethereuem overcoming its scaling challenge and on continued expansion of the volatile and potentially systemically risky market for collateralized ether lending.  Either way, as a report by TradeBlock showed last month, these private stablecoins are rapidly growing in volume, with their total value surging past Venmo’s in the second quarter.

42403175,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf9Pb,1566268189,Crypto and Security Token Exchange INX to Raise $130 Million in Landmark IPO,"INX Limited, a crypto exchange startup, plans to raise up to $129.5 million through an IPO, in the first security token sale registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  No, that’s not a typo for “ICO,” the initial coin offerings that tested the limits of securities law during the go-go days of 2017. IPO means IPO here: INX, which is domiciled in Gibraltar, filed a draft F-1 (the SEC's prospectus form for foreign issuers) with the agency on Monday and will market the tokens to retail and institutional investors through the initial public offering.  As such, it's a major milestone since to date, token sales have been unregistered. Some issuers confined their marketing to wealthy investors so they’d be exempt from the registration requirement and filed notices with the SEC. Most didn’t even bother to tell the regulators what they were up to, and over the last year, the agency has brought a slew of cases against ICO teams for illegally selling unregistered securities.  Further, INX's sale would also be one of the very few full-fledged IPOs in the blockchain industry and almost certainly the largest. Last year, mining subscription company Argo Mining raised $32.5 million through an IPO on the London Stock Exchange.  One-stop shop  INX's target userbase is largely institutional investors, even though like the INX token itself, crypto trading on the exchange will be available to the general public, provided they go through anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer screening.  ""When fully operational, we expect to offer professional traders and institutional investors trading platforms with established practices common in other regulated financial services markets, such as customary trading, clearing, and settlement procedures, regulatory compliance, capital and liquidity reserves and operational transparency,"" says the draft prospectus.  In this way, INX will be competing with a number of institutionally-focused, regulated trading platforms launching this year – although INX stands out in the breadth of digital assets it plans to list.  ""Our vision is to establish two trading platforms and a security token that provide regulatory clarity to the blockchain asset industry. We plan to achieve this [in part] by differentiating between security and non-security blockchain asset classes and providing trading opportunities for each class,"" says the prospectus, later adding:  ""In the future, we intend to establish a platform for the trading of derivatives such as futures, options and swaps.""  This means the exchange will be in the same space as not only Overstock’s tZERO (security tokens) but also Coinbase Prime and Fidelity Digital Assets (spot cryptocurrencies) – and eventually Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt (derivatives).  Hybrid token  Although it is a security, INX's token could also be described as a utility token, since holders will have the option of using it on the INX Exchange to pay transaction fees.  This is perhaps ironic since, during the ICO boom, many issuers argued that their tokens were not securities because they had a utility, such as the right to use a platform developed with proceeds from the sale.  At the same time, token investors will get a share of INX’s profits, though they won’t be equity holders.  Rather, they will stand in line ahead of shareholders to get repaid, in the event of a liquidation. In this way, the token is akin to preferred stock.  ""It is the Company’s intention that the INX Token holders’ claim for breach of contract will be senior to the rights of the holders of the ordinary shares of the Company in liquidation,"" the document says.  The securities will be represented as ERC-20 tokens on the ethereum blockchain.  Red tape  Since crypto assets are such a new and unprecedented phenomenon that does not map easily to old categories, several different regulatory agencies have claimed jurisdiction over different parts of the industry.  For INX, this has meant getting sign-off from multiple agencies. Before it can proceed with the token sale, INX still has to get the SEC to deem its prospectus “effective.”  The prospectus includes disclosures that are standard for publicly listed companies, but rare if not unheard-of in the shadowy world of crypto, such as the executives’ employment contracts.  That’s just for the fundraising. For the exchange to actually open for trading, several other approvals still must be obtained.  Since INX will be listing security tokens, it will have to first become a broker-dealer, which requires a separate registration with the SEC and acceptance into FINRA, a self-regulatory organization (SRO), and an alternative trading system (ATS), which requires filing additional forms with the SEC.  On top of securities-related approvals, to operate as a crypto exchange where investors can buy and sell bitcoin and the like, INX will need money transmitter licenses from the individual states where it does business.  All-star cast  INX's management, board, advisors and early investors feature luminaries from both the crypto and traditional finance worlds.  On the crypto side, INX's advisors include bitcoin security stalwart Jameson Lopp, Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow, and Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO Mark Yusko.  The management team includes executive managing director of U.S. operations Alan Silbert, a former commercial banker who ran an early bitcoin startup called Bitpremier on the side. (His brother Barry is the founder of VC firm Digital Currency Group, which is not involved in INX).  The board, on the other hand, includes David Weild, former vice-chairman of Nasdaq, and Thomas K.
