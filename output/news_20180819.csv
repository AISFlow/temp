42421902,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwpGn,1534676418,Crypto Trading 101: An Introduction to Support and Resistance,"Are you a crypto trader struggling to find a footing in a volatile crypto market?  If yes, then the first thing you need to master is the art of identifying support and resistance levels.  Imagine bouncing a ball inside your house. There are two barriers that will limit the flight and fall of the ball – your floor and ceiling. In trading, there are similar barriers that limit the movement of price action known as support and resistance.  Such barriers in trading can have long-lasting effects on an asset, since price action rarely forgets its past. If traders regard a certain price level as a great entry or exit point, it will likely continue to act as a barrier for prices until all of their respective needs are satisfied.  Support  For example, buyers will generally continue to buy at a specific price, given the asset is perceived as undervalued, until all of their demand is fully absorbed by the market. So, if buyers engage at X price and the price moves upward only to later return, the same buyers will look to defend their positions at X and potentially add more to their positions.  New buyers will see that price fell no further than X before, so are likely to consider it a safe entry. This concentration of buy pressure will prevent price from falling any further, creating a temporary floor known as support.  Resistance  On the other hand, if an asset is perceived as overvalued at a certain price level, sellers will be sure to take advantage. Here, those large buyers from before will look to exit their position and take profit. It's also possible traders will enter ""short"" positions at this level, given the perceived over-valuation, increasing the market's sell pressure.  Just like when there was high buy pressure, this concentration of sell pressure will force the price level to act as a barrier, except this time it will act as a ceiling, rather than a floor, known as resistance.  Horizontal Support & Resistance  The most important and easiest to identify support and resistance levels take the shape of horizontal lines as a result a trend being rejected repeatedly at a very similar price point.  Horizontal support or resistance lines can be created by simply ""connecting the dots"" between trend peaks or valleys as seen in the chart below.  In the upper frame of above chart, sellers of XMR/BTC continually push down price from the 0.00451/BTC area, establishing it as strong resistance. Simply put, traders continued to take advantage of this area of concentrated sell pressure.  In lower the frame, buyers continually held up the price of XLM/USD at $0.17 fortifying it as strong support.  Once again, traders repeatedly took advantage of the level given the chart has told them time and time again price is more likely to bounce than fall through.  Porlarity  So, what happens when these levels are eventually surpassed?  As mentioned earlier, these barriers do eventually break once either the buying or selling efforts have been completely absorbed by the market. When this occurs, a major shift in sentiment can take place - a concept known as polarity.  When the selling behind an established resistance level is fully absorbed, it is no longer perceived as an optimal point to take profit, rather it is viewed as a good entry point for buyers due to the disappearance of sell pressure, as a result turning the resistance level into support.  Conversely, when the buying pressure behind a support level is fully absorbed, it will turn to a resistance level given traders are no longer interested in buying at this price.  It's important to note that when price breaks through major support it is regarded as bearish development, that is, an asset usually drops further until sellers reach a point of exhaustion. The subsequent rebound due to profit taking or bargain hunting ends up creating a new support level.  Conversely, surpassing resistance is bullish in nature and price tends to follow the breakout until its next resistance level is identified.  The above chart depicts the effect polarity had on the price of XMR/USD once its resistance level of 0.00451/BTC was broken. You can see that what was once established as strong resistance, given it rejected price action on several occasions, became weaker the more it was tested until it could no longer hold down prices.  Price rose emphatically once the resistance was breached due to the large shift in market sentiment that was taking place. Even after prices action cooled off, it fell to the prior resistance left, but this time it held as support - the essence of polarity.  Conclusion  Price trends are expected to take a breather when coming in contact support or resistance lines due to the concentration of buying or selling pressure that awaits. While the levels can act as a barrier to price action for a lengthy period, they don't last forever as the market will eventually absorb their efforts.  Once this occurs, polarity takes effect and converts the support to resistance and vice-versa.  Long story short, support and resistance levels help identify areas of strong supply and demand. So, identifying major supports and resistances is perceived by many to be the most important aspect of trading.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Ouimet,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-trading-101-an-introduction-to-support-and-resistance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d888637b0e77c1a780908477da8692a5563bf1f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381103,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93v3F,1534672820,"As No-Deal Brexit Looms, UK Blockchain Startups Are Weighing Options","From longer approval processes to the threat they might lose access to the European market, it's safe to say U.K. blockchain startups are looking for contingency plans.  A quick recap: in 2016, the U.K. held a referendum on whether to stay in the European Union (E.U.), with a majority of voters opting to leave the economic bloc. Since then, the government has been negotiating with E.U. officials on the terms of its exit – but recent hurdles have raised the specter of a ""no-deal Brexit"" that could lead to economic turbulence and uncertainty.  It's that uncertainty that has some blockchain startups sweating about their future prospects – at least in the months ahead as politicians attempt to hammer out an agreement.  ""Brexit is a hindrance to everything in the short term,"" said Jamie McNaught, CEO and founder of Solidi Ltd, which is developing a blockchain-based payments platform that uses cryptocurrencies to facilitate money remittances.  He told CoinDesk:  ""[It's] because all fintech regulation experts and lawyers are busy with so many things at the moment. They wouldn't be busy if the Brexit hasn't happened. In terms of just getting time with people is difficult at this moment. Will it (Brexit) be a hindrance in the mid-and-long term? That really depends on how successful the Brexit will be.""  The startup is one of the four blockchain companies that were accepted by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for a normally six-month-long sandbox test in December 2017.  Until this July, Solidi was still in the regulatory test, as ""the whole thing is being held up by some of the requirement as to become regulated,"" McNaught said.  What Solidi is waiting for is the approval of a money service business (MSB) license from HM Revenue & Customs, the U.K. authority that reviews anti-money laundering compliance. Solidi has waited nine months to get approved for the MSB license, but the process previously took about five weeks, and the startup is not the only company in this position according to the FCA, McNaught said.  Stormy horizon  To other blockchain firms who aren't facing that specific issue, the ramifications of a ""hard Brexit"" have become a big concern.  Renat Khasanshyn, co-founder of Etherisc, a European firm offering decentralized insurance protocol, expects Brexit will create hurdles for users and developers of its protocol and, therefore, hamper client growth. The company's platform allows providers to build insurance products on top of an open-source infrastructure.  But if negotiations around Brexit falter, cross-border market testing will be much harder, and compliance costs for providers will increase, as Khasanshyn explained.  ""The users of our protocol will be impacted by Brexit negatively because they will need to comply with regulations in the U.K. and the EU, which will likely go in different directions,"" Khasanshyn told CoinDesk. ""And they will comply and pay for this compliance twice.""  For London-based blockchain startup Globacap, the biggest concern is likely to be the threat of the loss of passporting rights.  In its white paper on Brexit, the British government proposed new trade arrangements with the EU, suggesting the U.K. and the economic bloc maintain current agreements to trade goods but not services.  Under the proposal, British financial services companies such as banks, insurers and asset managers risk losing their passporting rights - which grant them unconstrained access to other EU markets - when the U.K. formally exits the bloc next year.  Myles Milston, CEO and founder of Globacap, explained that ""normally, once [we] become a fully authorized securities firm, we get passporting [rights] into the rest of the countries in the EU.""  ""However, obviously with Brexit, we might not get that passporting right anymore,"" he went on to say. ""So it doesn't actually affect the sandbox test, but it might affect our business model after the sandbox.""  Sunnier shores  Unless a deal is struck to extend market access – at least for a transition period – these firms will have to pay up to open new bases of operation in the EU or face a severe loss of market access.  Blockchain companies that provide payment or e-money services, therefore, anticipate unfavorable impacts on their businesses, with a number of firms contemplating to set up separate EU subsidiaries to avoid being blocked from the market altogether.  Globacap is another project participating in the FCA sandbox, within which it is working on the issuance of debt and equity securities on blockchain in the FCA's oversight.  As soon as the project goes through the test and is fully launched as a company, it plans to open an office in Europe and apply for regulatory clearance to avoid losing its passporting rights, Milston said.  ""At the moment we are deciding where the best place is in Europe to start that,"" he added.  Nivaura, a U.K.-based fintech company building an issuance and administration platform for securities, including tokenized securities, says its seeking approval from German regulators to open an office in the country.  ""The passporting now takes about three months, and we can go anywhere,"" said Avtar Sehra, CEO and chief product architect for Nivaura.""But if we have to go into Germany and set up a whole new business, there is a whole approval process. It could take from a year up to 18 months.""  Not all doom and gloom  Risks aside, not everyone that spoke to CoinDesk about the potential Brexit impact had a negative view of the situation.  Richard Cohen, a U.K.-based lawyer at international law firm Allen & Overy, contended that Brexit would have little effect on the blockchain industry as a whole – in fact, he sees it as a potential positive for the country in terms of its approach to fintech.  ""The U.K. will be allowed to come up with a regulatory framework that is much more favorable to fintech companies and become a friendly jurisdiction in which banks can make the best use of blockchain and global opportunities,"" Cohen argued.  Alastair Johnson, CEO of Nuggets, an e-commerce and payment ID platform, also struck a largely positive note, telling CoinDesk that his company has found the U.K. government to be a supportive partner.  And its actions to date – particularly through the FCA, which has sought to include blockchain and distributed ledger startups within its sandbox cohorts – bear out that assertion  ""The U.K. is very supportive at the potential of innovation in fintech and technology as a whole,"" Johnson said. ""And I think they will also see that as an opportunity to create markets, continue growth and associate with Europe and the world as a whole. It's everything that driving the support.""
