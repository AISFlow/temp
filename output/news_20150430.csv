First announced by GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard at Inside Bitcoins New York, the deal was confirmed by Lionsgate senior vice president Peter Wilkes.  Wilkes suggested that Lionsgate is working to integrate digital currency payments into the company's online store, and at ""several upcoming branded events"".  Wilkes told CoinDesk:  ""We continue to explore innovative new technologies for connecting with next generation consumers, and we’re intrigued by the possibilities offered by bitcoins in our media space.""  Beauregard elaborated on the announcement in conversation with bitcoin blog Follow the Coin, adding that GoCoin is seeking to appeal to other film studios as part of its customer acquisition strategy.  ""We're going after the big studios to help onboard them and create more places where people can spend their bitcoin,"" he said.  Founded in July 2013, GoCoin allows merchants to accept payment in bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and Tether, while mitigating price volatility risk through payouts in US dollars, euros, pounds sterling and Singapore dollars.  Correction: A previous version of this report named The Day After Tomorrow as a Lionsgate film.

42398327,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTI60,1430430925,Hedgy Raises $1.2 Million for Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Derivatives,"Bitcoin derivatives startup Hedgy has raised $1.2m in new seed funding from a group of 10 investors that includes Draper Fisher Jurvetson partner Tim Draper, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Sand Hill Ventures.  In conjunction with the announcement, Hedgy has also launched a new derivatives product aimed at commercial bitcoin miners.  Miners that use the derivative can effectively lock in a future price at which they can sell bitcoins, using a smart contract to settle the transaction on the bitcoin blockchain.  Drawing price metrics from TradeBlock, the new product is the result of a collaboration with distributed US bitcoin mining company MegaBigPower (MBP) and London-based Crypto Facilities, a bitcoin derivatives exchange founded by former executives from Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas.  MegaBigPower is the first US mine to utilize the derivative. Crypto Facilities buys bitcoins mined by MBP, which are then sold by way of two-of-three multisig contracts.  In interview, Hedgy CEO Matt Slater said that product helps miners address the issue of price volatility as they look to sell coins on the market.  He said his startup has been working with MBP founder Dave Carlson for months on the derivative – Carlson also serves as an advisor to Hedgy – and explained that the solution can help other industrial mining companies better manage their financial risks.  Slater told CoinDesk:  “Our core focus right now is solving this problem for miners. And Dave, being one of those most well respected and biggest miners in the space, you know, if we can solve it for Dave we can solve it for other miners as well.”  Slater added that Hedgy has fielded interest from other bitcoin miners, as well as companies in the broader digital currency space, about the use of smart contracts to alleviate concerns about price fluctuations.  When reached for comment, Tim Draper praised the Hedgy the team and predicted a significant role for blockchain-powered smart contracts to come.  ""Hedgy is awesome. Great team, exciting mission. Smart contracts are going to be fundamental to contracts of any kind in the future, and bitcoin makes it all possible,"" he said.  The new funding includes a previously disclosed $764,000 raised by the Boost VC Tribe 4 graduate.

42398324,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTI24,1430421326,Western Union: 'Too Early' to Discuss Ripple Labs Pilot Project,"Western Union has formally responded to statements suggesting it is taking concrete steps toward using distributed ledger technologies via a partnership with Ripple Labs.  Long cited as a technology that could enable more cost-effective cross-border payments, Western Union has, as commentators have noted, what is perhaps one of the more evident vested interests in exploring digital currency offerings.  Still, representatives for the Colorado-based company remain tight-lipped about what the proposed project with Ripple Labs would entail.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""We have had preliminary discussions with Ripple regarding a pilot settlement project, but it is too early to discuss details at this time.""  The revelation suggests Western Union may be looking to use a system like Ripple to move fiat payments between customers in a similar manner as Align Commerce, which uses the bitcoin blockchain as means to remit payment across borders where it is exchanged locally.  Elsewhere, prominent companies working on cross-border payments include Kenya's BitPesa and the Ghana-based startup Beam, each of which is focused on promoting the technology in select African markets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/30/western-union-too-early-to-discuss-ripple-labs-pilot-project,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Citing Coinbase as its main competitor stateside, Helga Danova, chief editor at CEX.IO said that she was confident that they could become a ""great alternative for US citizens and broaden the possibilities of buying bitcoin and trading other cryptocurrencies"".  The US launch comes amid a continued pivot away from mining services. The company halted its cloud mining operations in January citing bitcoin's declining price as a motivating factor.  Danova noted that the mining cease was a temporary measure, as the company looked to focus on developing its exchange.  ""We've been developing in this direction for a long time"", she said, adding:  ""CEX.IO has always been a bitcoin exchange. Even though our key advantage was cloud mining, we have offered trading of the cloud mining power for bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.""  In order to access the exchange, consumers in the approved US states and jurisdictions will have to adhere to CEX.IO compliance procedures, based on know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) standards.

42398308,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTG80,1430392956,"Bitcoin Could Impact Credit Unions, Report Says","Credit unions may one day find some of their core functions replicated by bitcoin, a new report suggests.  According to Mercator Advisory Group, a global consultancy for the payments industry, such an evolution would only occur should bitcoin's market volatility lessen and security mechanisms develop further.  The report  , entitled Understanding Bitcoin’s Implications for Credit Unions, largely serves as a vehicle for understanding the fundamentals of bitcoin and its distributed ledger, the blockchain.  Not until the last page does the report turn to the implications of the technology on credit unions, noting:  ""Assuming the volatility of bitcoin drops considerably to what is considered normal for currencies, and that security concerns around how best to secure private keys are resolved, we could see the proliferation of a host of new financial services backed by bitcoin, many of which are directly associated with the core businesses of credit unions today.""  Mercator posits that credit unions that primarily serve the remittance market could benefit from working with bitcoin exchanges, naming CoinX and Coinbase specifically, to ""explore the possibility of offering a competitive international remittance product to their customers"".  However, the report stops short of saying that credit unions should jump at the chance to integrate bitcoin. According to Mercator, the benefits of operating bitcoin wallets for customers may not outweigh the costs of securing those holdings sufficiently.  Mainstream traction  The report asserts that bitcoin's primary use case is to buy and sell speculatively and, as a result, ""is unlikely to find much traction among the broader mainstream of CU account holders"".  Mercator also questions whether or not bitcoin can vehicle for consumers payments, and as a replacement for credit and debit cards in particular.  ""[Transaction irreversibility] is undeniably beneficial to merchants (assuming they have a way to hedge away all the foreign exchange risk), but, for the most important stakeholders in the ecosystem – consumers – the benefit is unclear.""  Mercator closes the report by acknowledging the impact cryptocurrency will likely have on mainstream financial services, adding that the exact impact is difficult to foresee at this time.  ""Predicting what exactly these implications will be, however, is a bit like  trying to grasp the significance of the Internet would have been in 1995 – these are early days still,"" the report concludes.

42398305,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTG44,1430386726,"Remove Satoshi as Founding Member, Says Bitcoin Foundation Director","As part of a newly published roadmap for the Bitcoin Foundation, executive director Bruce Fenton has suggested removing bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto as a founding member.  Though he called for the removal of all founding members from the organisation, Fenton singled out Nakamoto's inclusion as ""not accurate"", arguing that he or she was never involved in the group's creation.  Now a largely symbolic title, the move would also strip Gavin Andresen, Peter Vessenes, Charlie Shrem, Roger Ver, Patrick Murck and Mark Karpeles of the distinction.  Fenton's remarks suggest the intent of the change would be to underscore that the Bitcoin Foundation is a decentralized network, one that he believes should work to avoid venerating individuals over collective goals.  He wrote:  ""Overall, we should reduce power of individuals but work to remain effective using decentralization, crowdfunding and other means.""  Notably, the presentation marks the second time that Fenton has referred to bitcoin's enigmatic creator during his tenure, following his first tweet in the position reminding Nakamoto that ""she has a board seat per the bylaws, if she produces a PGP key"".  The remark received a warm reception given the frequent portrayal of the unknown founder as a male and recent criticisms in the media regarding bitcoin's largely male following.  Move toward transparency  Fenton began the presentation by looking to set the record straight on the organisation, seeking to emphasize how it does not control or represent bitcoin as often portrayed in the media.  He sought to illustrate how he is seeking to make the foundation more transparent and democratic, having already released financial records for the nonprofit on 17th April and enabled a board chair to be appointed by election at the suggestion of a member.  Going forward, Fenton suggested he would seek to continue this emphasis on transparency, stating that IRS forms would be released along with items such as the organisation's executive compensation and travel policy.  Additional proposals included plans to re-use Swarm to conduct blockchain-based voting in foundation elections and using Factom to secure foundation records to the bitcoin blockchain.

42398313,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTG62,1430362835,Circle Raises $50 Million With Goldman Sachs Support,"Bitcoin financial services startup Circle Internet Financial has closed a $50m funding round.  The Boston-based company drew support from Goldman Sachs and China-based IDG Capital Partners, as well as all of Circle’s pool of existing investors, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners and Accel Partners.  Tom Jessop, managing director at Goldman Sachs’ Principal Strategic Investments Group, said the bank recognizes the need to invest in companies that ""have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.”  Jessop added:  “We think that Circle’s product vision and exceptional management team present a compelling opportunity in the digital payments space.”  Quan Zhou, managing director of IDG Capital Partners and Circle board member, said that China in particular will be a major focus for the company as it looks to further internationalize its services.  “We are very excited about our investment and look forward to helping launch the company in the Chinese market where consumer adoption of innovative digital payment products is growing at a tremendous rate,"" he said.  Circle has also announced the launch of new account features that enable customers to hold, send and receive US dollars. Those funds, according to the company, will be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The news follows reports from earlier this week that Circle was looking to raise as much as $40m in new funding.  New feature outlined  The company’s new account features mean users can hold their funds in both bitcoin and USD.  Customers who choose to hold their funds in dollars rather than bitcoin can still make payments to people or merchants who accept bitcoin. At the time of payment, Circle will instantly convert funds from dollars into bitcoin.  Also, customers can accept bitcoin payments and Circle will convert the funds instantly into dollars in their Circle accounts, if they wish. Those who prefer to keep their funds in bitcoin can do so, CEO Jeremy Allaire explained in a new interview.  “We’re putting forward this hybrid fiat-digital currency model, which gives users the benefits of digital currency – instant settlements, global interoperability, no fees and high levels of security – but without having to use a new currency,” Allaire said.  He reiterated:  “This hybrid model allows customers to have all the benefits of digital currency, without the risks.”  Allaire went on to explain that a user can add dollars to his or her Circle account for free by way of bank transfer, then when they want to pay another Circle user, they can do so in an instant, whether the payment is denominated in bitcoin or dollars.  The company is rolling out the USD features gradually, launching them on selected customer accounts and adding new ones each week.  International outlook  Allaire said Circle’s next step is to add more currencies to the platform. He explained:  “We want to bring these benefits of bitcoin to all the major currencies in the world, including in the UK, Europe and in China.”  With these “global goals” in mind, Allaire said he believed Circle would benefit from significantly more capital and the addition of some new strategic investment partners, so he set out to raise some more funds.  “Having [Goldman Sachs and IDG Capital Partners] as strategic equity investors in the company is a big vote of confidence in Circle and in the opportunity presented by digital money,” Allaire concluded.
