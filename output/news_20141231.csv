42426217,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGE9h,1420039019,BitMEX to Launch Bitcoin 'Fear' Index,"Derivatives exchange BitMEX will publish an index on 5th January that it hopes will become the bitcoin world's version of the VIX– the so-called 'fear index' that is used to gauge uncertainty in the wider financial markets.      The 30-Day Bitcoin Historic Volatility Index, as BitMEX is calling it, works by taking the time-weighted average price from Bitfinex's USD/BTC rate. It then calculates bitcoin's annualised volatility over a rolling 30-day period using that data. The result is a measure of bitcoin's realised volatility for that period.      True to form as a derivatives exchange, BitMEX has created a tradable instrument based on its new index, and will offer a futures contract quoted in volatility percentage points, with each point paying 0.01 BTC. Traders will receive up to five times leverage for the contract.    Volatility as an asset class    The new contract effectively turns bitcoin volatility into a tradable asset class. Effectively, traders on BitMEX will be able to place a bet on increased uncertainty in the bitcoin price without having to predict whether the price will rise or fall.      ""Say an event is coming up that you believe the price will either spike or drop, you can buy the contract and make a profit no matter what happens,"" said Arthur Hayes, BitMEX's chief executive.      If the volatility futures take off, BitMEX might also offer longer dated contracts. Trade in these contracts could give market watchers an idea of where future bitcoin volatility is headed, Hayes said.      ""It will give a glimpse into where market participants see the volatility realising in the future,"" he said.      Trading in volatility is not an innovation in the wider financial markets. The first VIX futures contracts were offered 10 years ago on the Chicago Board of Exchange Futures Exchange, which also developed the VIX.      Since then, a range of products built on the VIX volatility gauge have appeared, including options and exchange-traded funds.      It is worth noting that the VIX differs from the new BitMEX index in one important respect. The former tracks the 'implied volatility' of options derived from the Standard and Poor's 500 index. The VIX, therefore, provides a snapshot of market sentiment towards future volatility. The BitMEX index, however, records historical volatility, or an instrument's average deviation from its average price.    Maturing market    Nevertheless, the introduction of a bitcoin volatility index and tradable instruments is another sign of the maturing digital currency markets, said Harry Yeh, managing partner at bitcoin fund Binary Financial.      ""It's great to have a volatility futures contract similar to the VIX ... [it's] another area for speculators, but also a great indicator on what the market is doing,"" he said.      For Yeh, the increasing range of derivatives for digital currencies is a healthy sign of growth that could lead to a rise in the bitcoin price in 2015. He said derivatives would allow big merchants and long-term investors in bitcoin to limit their exposure to the cryptocurrency's price swings, allowing them to hold it as an asset for longer periods of time.      BitMEX launched on 24th November with five derivatives products, including three bitcoin futures contracts. Hayes said the platform is seeing trading volume of about 100 BTC daily.    The BitMEX teamhttps://www.bitmex.com/app/aboutUs is long on experience in traditional markets. Its team includes former Citi prop trader Hayes; chief risk officer Ian O'Connor, who ran front office support for HSBC's structured equity derivatives group in Hong Kong; and advisor Joseph Jeong, who once headed hedge fund sales for Asia at Deutsche Bank.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/31/bitmex-to-launch-bitcoin-fear-index,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09d4a0b9547a1f778d46f3a3ce539ca34091f810-2560x1714.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426216,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGE7h,1420030063,A Year in Headlines: CoinDesk's Top News Stories of 2014,"Though it seems like just yesterday we entered 2014, bitcoin's place in society and the industry as a whole has completely changed throughout this year.  With its current price of $310, buying a bitcoin today costs less than half of what it would have put you back on 1st January ($770), but don't let these numbers fool you.  Outside of its falling price, bitcoin has weathered considerable hardships in 2014, and the industry has subsequently matured as bad actors have been weeded out in favour of more dependable, transparent and legitimate entrepreneurs entering the space with the support of a great deal of venture capital.  To get a better idea of the 'big picture' of bitcoin's evolution throughout the course of the year, we identified the most popular news stories published by CoinDesk in 2014. While these stories don't tell the full story of what happened in the industry this year, they offer a glimpse into the topics that most grabbed our readers' attention.  Here are CoinDesk's top news stories of 2014:  Leading Adult Site Porn.com Now Accepts Bitcoin  The year started off with a bang when news broke that one of the largest adult entertainment sites on the Internet, Porn.com, would begin accepting bitcoin payments for its... content.      Mt. Gox Halts ALL Bitcoin Withdrawals, Price Drop Follows  It wasn't long before Mt Gox started to dominate the news cycles in the early months of 2014. On 7th February, we reported that the Japanese exchange had halted all bitcoin withdrawals; CoinDesk removed Mt Gox from its bitcoin price index (BPI) three days later.      Bitcoin Exchanges Under 'Massive and Concerted Attack'  In the midst of the Mt Gox chaos, a transaction malleability problem with the bitcoin protocol was taken advantage of to launch DDoS attacks against a number of prominent bitcoin exchanges including Bitstamp and BTC-e.      Mt. Gox Allegedly Loses $350 Million in Bitcoin (744,400 BTC), Rumoured to be Insolvent  In what may be the biggest story of the year in bitcoin, a leaked document published by Ryan Galt revealed that Mt Gox had allegedly lost more than 700,000 of its users' bitcoins, valued at around $350m at press time.      Bitcoin Inventor Satoshi Nakamoto 'Found' in California  For the cover story of its big return to print, Newsweek enlisted reporter Leah McGrath Goodman to uncover the identity of bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto in early March. Goodman named California resident Dorian Nakamoto as the mastermind behind bitcoin. However, the story resulted in staunch denials from D. Nakamoto and considerable backlash from the bitcoin community.      New Colorado Marijuana Vending Machines Will Accept Bitcoin  As Colorado began selling marijuana for recreational purposes on 1st January, the bitcoin community seemed particularly interested in reading about a marijuana vending machine that announced its plans in April to accept bitcoin for its goods.      500 Million Dogecoins Mined by Unknown Hacker in Malware Attack  In an attack that researchers dubbed 'unprecedented', hackers were able to mine some 500 million dogecoins in mid-June of this year. The value of the DOGE mined in the hack totalled around $200,000 at press time.      List of Possible Silk Road Bitcoin Bidders Leaked by US Marshals  Everybody was watching this summer as the US Marshals planned their public auction of bitcoins seized from the Silk Road. When the government accidentally clicked 'reply to all' on an email that included the names of those who planned to bid on the 30,000 BTC, it seems like everybody in the industry was interested in taking a look.      Ethereum Launches Own 'Ether' Coin, With Millions Already Sold  Ethereum effectively built up the anticipation for its long-awaited launch for much of 2014.

Tim Draper: Bitcoin's Price Still Headed to $10k  After Tim Draper was revealed as the sole winner of this year's first US Marshals bitcoin auction (mentioned above), all eyes in the bitcoin community were on the venerable venture capitalist.

42377917,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCXj,1420021316,Venture Capital Funding for Bitcoin Startups Triples in 2014,"It's been a bumper 12 months for bitcoin companies raising funding. In fact, the amount of venture capital flowing into bitcoin startups this year is more than three times the total raised in 2013, according to CoinDesk data.  In total, bitcoin firms raised $314.7m in 2014. This represents a 3.3-fold increase over the previous year, in which $93.8m was invested.  Additionally, this year's total accounts for more than three-quarters of all venture capital raised for bitcoin startups since the start of CoinDesk data in 2012. A total of $410.7m has been invested in the space over that time.  The chart of cumulative all-time VC funding (below) shows two jumps in funds raised this year in March and October.  Twin peaks  In March, a number of big deals were completed that caused the first of those spikes.  Chief among those was Xapo's $20m round raised from Fortress, Benchmark and Ribbit Capital. This was followed by Circle Internet Financial, which raised just $3m less from a group of investors that included Accel Partners, Pantera Capital and General Catalyst.  That month also saw smaller but significant amounts raised by bitcoin exchanges Kraken ($5m from Hummingbird Ventures) and OKCoin ($10m from Mandra Capital, Ceyuan and others).  Six months later, the next round of big deals took place. Wallet and data provider Blockchain led October fund-raising with $30.5m from Lightspeed Ventures, Mosaic Ventures and others. Notably, the Blockchain round was the largest ever single investment made in a bitcoin company.  Bitcoin mining firm BitFury took second place with $20m raised from noted investor Bill Tai and others. Payment processor BitNet closed $14.5m in funding from Japanese e-commerce platform Rakuten and Highland Capital Partners.  Smaller rounds were peppered throughout October, including $2.5m raised by Korean universal Coinplug, $5m for mining hardware maker Spondoolies-Tech and $3m for exchange SolidX.  Big rounds still account for much of the fund-raising activity in the bitcoin sector.  For much of the year, the single largest deal each month was greater than the combination of other rounds completed in the same period. The exceptions were March and October, where a number of large deals took place, and December, where funds raised were relatively well distributed.  Later-stage funding  As the bitcoin ecosystem matures, so do the fund-raising demands of startups in the space. While most funds raised are still allocated to early-stage seed rounds, later stage funds are now increasing.  The grouped bar chart showing a breakdown of funding rounds reveals that only three months went by without later-stage first and second funding rounds being announced. After March, almost every month showed a mix of funding rounds, ranging from small seed rounds to substantial first and second rounds.  In October and November, venture capitalists concentrated more investments on financial services and infrastructure related initiatives such as tools for addressing price volatility, power efficiency and security.  For example, Libra raised $500,000 to incorporate accountancy and tax compliance into the bitcoin system. For the equity market, First Global Credit launched a new derivatives product for bitcoin holders to participate in global equities platforms without cashing their bitcoin in for national currencies.  By contrast, more established business models like exchanges and wallet providers saw three and two startups closing fund-raising deals, respectively. Miners, payment processors and universals all saw two startups in each category raise funding in October and November.  Location, location, location  North America is still the place to be for startups hoping to raise cash for their business. The last two full months of the year showed that the majority of fund-raising deals were completed in the US and Canada. Ten deals were agreed in North America, while Asia saw four successful capital-raising exercises and Europe saw two.  Unsurprisingly, startups boost their chances of closing a fund-raising deal if they are located in San Francisco. Six of the deals completed in the last two full months of the year involved companies based there, compared to three deals for firms located in other US cities.  Venture capitalists clearly remain bullish on bitcoin and its potential, as the amount of capital invested creeps to the half-billion dollar mark.
