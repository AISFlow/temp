42399254,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihUw,1470936307,"Cryptsy CEO Stole Millions From Exchange, Court Receiver Alleges","Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon may have stolen as much as $3.3m from the now-defunct digital currency exchange and destroyed evidence of his illicit actions.  That's according to new court documents from the ongoing class action lawsuit filed against the troubled industry exec. A report from court-appointed receiver James Sallah, published on 2nd August, details efforts to take control of assets tied to Cryptsy, most notably the digital currency holdings sought by the exchange's former customers.  The updates are the latest to follow Cryptsy's collapse in January, when after months of growing issues, Vernon blamed the closure on a previously undisclosed hack. At the time, Vernon claimed as much as $10m in customer liabilities. He later told CoinDesk that customers were misled in order to avoid a ""panic"".  Yet, court documents that surfaced at the time revealed that Cryptsy’s failure was predicted a month prior due to a lack of profit. That collapse ultimately sparked a class action lawsuit, and in April, a court approved an asset freeze that pushed the defunct exchange into receivership.  Now, that receiver is alleging millions of dollars worth of digital currency was taken from the exchange by Vernon over the course of its operation.  Sallah alleged:  ""During that period of two years and seven months, Vernon transferred and converted over 1,100 bitcoin into currency in the amount of over $3.3 million. That $3.3 million-plus was deposited into Vernon’s and his now ex-wife’s (Defendant Lorie Ann Nettles’) joint bank account.""  This amount included roughly $2.2m in bitcoin sold by way of Coinbase, and more than $600,000 in various digital currencies liquidated via other exchanges like Bittrex, BTER and CEX.io, the document states.  Vernon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Evidence destruction alleged  One of the more notable elements in the report is the allegation that, in April, either Vernon or someone acting on his behalf, moved to delete critical information from servers tied to the company.  Sallah went on to write that, as a result of the destruction of evidence, the primary method for identifying how much certain customers are owed is now gone, a development that is impeding the reimbursement process.  ""[It's] not available for me to properly repay the victims and determine the full extent of Vernon’s misconduct,"" the document reads.  The situation presents a higher risk of fraudulent claims, Sallah indicated.  Further complicating matters is the apparent commingling of customer funds into larger wallets.  ""Confirming account-holder information from the account holders themselves will be much more difficult, time-consuming and ripe for fraudulent claims, but my team and I are prepared for the challenge,"" he wrote.  Some Cryptsy funds obtained  Former customers hoping to recoup at least a portion of their account value may be in luck, however.  According to Sallah, he has been able to secure digital currency holdings previously controlled by Cryptsy, some of which were related to blockchain movements spotted by former customers.  In mid-April, funds previously held on Cryptsy were moved to Bittrex, and in the midst of these movements, Sallah was reportedly alerted to the situation. Ultimately, Sallah would go on to send a demand letter to Bittrex, requesting that those funds be secured.  Sallah wrote:  ""After several verbal and written discussions with Bittrex, including several comprehensive sets of tracing analyses regarding the coins that Bittrex had frozen, Bittrex agreed to transfer the frozen coins, which including Unobtainium, Archcoin, Digibyte, Netcoin, Positron, Startcoin and Uro, that were traceable back to Cryptsy to me.""  All told, more than $700,000 denominated in 40 different digital currencies has been taken into possession, Sallah wrote. This was in addition to just under $25 from a Coinbase account previously under the control of Cryptsy.

42399246,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihO3,1470922390,'Big Four' Accounting Firms Meet to Consider Blockchain Consortium,"Blockchain representatives from each of the 'Big Four' accounting firms are set to meet this morning with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to discuss establishing a distributed ledger consortium.  Held at Microsoft's headquarters in New York City, the event marks the first meeting between blockchain specialists from Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC. Collectively, the four firms last year generated $123.7bn revenue.  The meeting is being hosted by ethereum-focused startup ConsenSys, but the attendees will be considering a wide-range of possible blockchain solutions.  According to ConsenSys head of blockchain accounting, Griffin Anderson, the series of roundtable discussions will center on how the accounting industry could work together to develop new blockchain standards.  Anderson told CoinDesk:  ""We are bringing together accounting blockchain industry experts to explore and to determine the value of a joint accounting and blockchain industry consortium.""  Anderson, who helped organize the day-long meeting, said that the goal is to identify exactly how a blockchain could help the companies do their jobs more efficiently, regardless of which network they decide to use.  Roughly 40 people are on the guest list for today's event from numberous firms, including Campbell Pryde, CEO and president of XBRL US, which helps oversee a business reporting language widely used by the accounting industry.  Also in attendance are representatives from of auditing advisory firm Grant Thornton, which last year generated $1.53bn in revenue, and Microsoft, which now hosts a blockchain-as-a-service test environment on its Azure cloud platform.  Industry-wide interest  Those attending the meeting say the idea of an accounting-focused consortium is compelling.  Lead strategist of Ernst & Young’s blockchain and distributed infrastructure, Angus Champion de Crespigny, told CoinDesk he is interested in how a consortium may help harness the disruptive power of the technology.  Originally viewed as a possible threat to parts of the financial sector, the technology is now being embraced by Champion de Crespigny's firm and others for its potential to streamline many repetitive tasks and generate entirely new forms of revenue.  Champion de Crespigny said:  ""Procedures may change, but ultimately there will always have to be some kind of assurance and we’ll just have to wait and see what that will look like.""  Ernst & Young senior partner Scott Zimmerman expanded on that statement, explaining that his firm is taking part in today's meeting to ""stay ahead of the curve"" so that his colleagues won't be caught off guard if and when blockchain changes the way accounting works.  Zimmerman, who focuses on audit innovation, told CoinDesk that ""some believe the transition could be years out, but just like with the internet, you never know how fast it will come upon you"".  KPMG, when reached for comment, confirmed that at least three members of its blockchain team will be present at the event.  Building on the past  Today's meeting will include a presentation by ConsenSys about the technology and its potential applications in accounting, focusing on ethereum as a specific example. Also on the agenda is a presentation on ""triple-entry accounting"" led by smart contract startup Balance3, which is affiliated with ConsenSys.  Later, attendees will discuss potential avenues of collaboration during round-table sessions that are closed to the public.  Organizers say that those taking part will have the opportunity to speak more candidly about the idea of creating a consortium, and how such an effort would overlap with each of the firms' in-house blockchain work.  While organizers say the accounting consortium effort is in its early stages, the concept itself has proven to be a popular way for established players to work with the potentially disruptive technology.  In the finance industry, over 50 members now participate in the R3CEV banking consortium, and this year, cross-industry consortia have been popping up around the world.

42399259,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihZr,1470919715,Ethereum Scaling Advances With 'First' Off-Blockchain Payments,"A team of ethereum developers has successfully completed what they say is the first off-blockchain transaction on the decentralized application network.  Sent from Copenhagen, Denmark, to Mumbai, India, the test saw the developers behind micropayments project Raiden send ether via clients operated by members in those cities last week. While small in scale, ethereum developers more broadly see the proof-of-concept as a key technical step toward solving one of the pressing issues facing not only the network, but all public blockchains.  Ethereum  and bitcoin, for example, currently each support only a fraction of the transactions seen daily on centralized payment networks like Visa or MasterCard. As developers seek to take on this challenge, scaling is widely seen as a fundamental issue yet to be solved.  But, there are advancements being made. Raiden, a team of five working to bring microtransactions to the ethereum blockchain, draws inspiration from the Lightning Network, an in-development off-chain transaction network that's often trumpeted as a fix for scalability on the bitcoin blockchain.  Together, the emergence of the two networks can be seen as evidence small advancements toward this wider goal are being made across blockchain communities.  CEO of Brainbot Technologies Heiko Hees, who leads development of Raiden Network, explained the significance, telling CoinDesk:  ""We now have the alpha of a system to do scalable, fast and extremely cheap token transfers off-chain in ethereum.""  Once the network moves beyond the testing stage, users will be able to tap Raiden for a variety of ethereum applications, he said.  This could include making micropayments for seconds spent watching online videos or facilitating trade in Internet of Things-enabled markets, where machines pay other machines for chunks of bandwidth or temperature sensor data.  Already, the prediction market Gnosis and the file storage system Swarm plan to build on top of the speedy microtransaction network.  Transferring 'state'  A key innovation behind payment channel-style transactions is that they allow users to route cryptocurrencies through a network of intermediaries, without trusting any of the intermediaries with the funds.  But there's still a ways to go. In the case of Raiden Network's first transaction, the intermediary node was stationed in Florianopolis. Further, ethereum was built with more than payments in mind. The smart contract platform applies the technology behind bitcoin to a range of Internet applications, including an identity authentication system and a censorship-resistant Twitter.  The goal is to eventually extend these off-chain payment channels to ""state channels"", which apply a similar concept to non-monetary exchanges.  Martin Köppelmann, founder of Gnosis, sees state channels as a more general purpose version of payments channels. ""State channels are for state, or smart contract state,"" he said.  Köppelmann provided an example of a state change that’s outside the realm of payments.  ""You can also use it for a chess game,"" he continued. ""Every move one of us makes is a signed message that we send each other.""  The idea is to move most of the transactions from the blockchain to these off-chain channels. So, to take the example of a series of moves in a chess game, Köppelmann explained that only the final result would need to be written on the blockchain.  Using Raiden  The next steps for Raiden are ""hardening"" the software with a beta launch by the end of the year, according to Hees, and to generalize the network so that it supports more ethereum applications (say chess-like examples or the censorship-resistant version of Twitter).  However, Hees thinks that it’s adequate right now for the audience ethereum has.  ""Token transfers are probably the most important use case and having them off-chain with Raiden already enables all sort of dapps to scale as in the end there is mostly a token transfer involved,"" he said.  Köppelmann believes the micropayment network is sufficient for users to make bets on the prediction market Gnosis, for example.  Other proposed use cases include prediction markets, decentralized exchanges, notaries, crowdfunds and blockchain-based votes.  Ethereum's future  There are other scalability-focused projects out there as well.  While Raiden Network is the main state channel project in the works, and the first to unveil a proof of concept, there’s at least one more to date. Avocado, led by ethereum developer Jehan Tremback, is a low-level state channel that aims to support the ethereum applications that Raiden Network will support in the midterm.  Off-chain networks aren’t the only proposed solution to the scalability problem, though.  Köppelmann also noted sharding, a theoretical process by which the blockchain would be split like a traditional database.  But Köppelmann sees state channels as a big piece of the puzzle.  ""Whatever becomes a big application on ethereum will need to be on state channels,"" he said, adding:  If you really want something with millions of users that goes viral, the blockchain can currently not handle it.""

42399248,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihP2,1470915945,Blockchains and the Question of Data Reliance,"Kesem Frank is a former blockchain specialist at Deloitte and COO and co-founder of nuco, a blockchain startup aiming to transform digital infrastructure.  In this opinion piece, Frank explores how blockchains could come to play the role of a trusted digital arbiter, and why this may be essential to global consumer protection as the Internet of Things comes of age.  I'm not going to shock anyone by saying we're all living in the age of big data.  Data analytics and data-driven decision-making is the gold standard in an ever-expanding range of domains. From running organizations to deciding on medical treatment to even dictating athletic training routines, data is established as central to more and more aspects of life.  With the hope I haven't bored you too much by restating what most of us take for granted, I'd like to ask a naïve question – How do we know we can actually rely on all of this data?  To clarify, I’m not at all questioning the use of data to optimize decisions. On the contrary, I think that’s exactly what we should all be doing. My question also doesn't relate to the technical aspects of maintaining data. (Just Google any such terms as ""data integrity"", ""data loss"" or ""data corruption"", and you'll see there are countless standards and best practices already dealing with those).  My question is much more fundamental.  Say we have a dataset relevant to a decision we face, and there's nothing technically wrong with it, what indication do we have that we should actually rely on its contents?  Establishing trust  If you think about it, you can quickly get to two main compelling reasons we have to rely on data: vertical integration and a trusted third party.  Let me explain what I mean by way of two pretty simplistic examples.  Vertical integration includes any such scenario where we own the entire value chain comprising the dataset. Think of your Fitbit (or any similar activity tracker) – you own the sensor generating the data, and you're right there when the data is generated.  At the end of every day, you get a data read indicating your activity, so you might say something like, ""I was moving around more today, so it makes sense I have 3,000 steps today versus my regular 2,000"". The fact that every stage in creating your activity’s dataset is owned by you, makes it pretty easy to accept the validity of such data.  Trusted third parties encompass any scenario where we trust the party generating or tracking the data, and so we accept the data as valid.  When I want to know how many visits my website is getting, I check google analytics. Because I trust Google (notwithstanding the question of whether I should ), I accept that data as valid.  Gray areas  These are really simple examples, but the question of data reliance is absolutely huge in scope.  The scenarios I’ve illustrated above suggest that unless we own the data creation process, we are forced to trust other parties before we should ever rely on their data. The complexity of this situation becomes very clear when you think of the growing reliance on IOT generated data.  In 2007, the I-35W Mississippi Bridge collapsed tragically killing 13 people. The bridge has since been rebuilt and now incorporates over 500 sensors monitoring the bridge for strain, load distribution, vibrations, temperature, etc. Seemingly, this solves the problem. If there’s ever any concerning indications, the sensors will tip us off in advance and we could dispatch maintenance crews and prevent disaster.  However for this to work, we need to fully rely on the sensor's data, with the question at issue being – why wouldn’t we?  Consider a scenario in which the sensors are malfunctioning and are constantly sending indications that the bridge is fine. For simplicity's sake, let's assume the sensors generate two types of data: a ""Good"" message meaning nothing is wrong, and a ""Bad"" message meaning we should dispatch maintenance crews.  Let’s also assume there is no ""vertical integration"" of data, ie the IOT sensors are owned by Company A while the maintenance crews are part of Company B.  If the bridge collapses even though the sensor sent ""Good"" messages, Company A is in hot water – its sensors did not deliver on their critical role.  However, if the sensors would have sent ""Bad"" messages but no maintenance crews were dispatched – Company B is all of a sudden at fault. This creates a tangible incentive for Company A, to ""cheat"" by altering the dataset to show the sensors we’re alerting there’s a problem, but Company B disregarded them.  I’ve used this grievous example to illustrate how serious this question is, but the scenario I’ve described could have just as easily be applied to your TV, washing machine or any other IoT-enabled device.  Blockchain solutions  According to major market trends and projections – this is pretty soon going to be everything we own. I'd also like to note that the question of data reliance is not an academic one at all, nor can we afford the luxury of tagging it as ""let's worry about this in the future"" type of matter.  Law enforcement agencies around the world are already doing an extensive usage of cellular data to place suspects in a scene of crime.  The quarried data can serve as supporting evidence either further indicating a suspect or (sometimes) providing an alibi. This is exactly what a network engineer, convicted of murdering his wife, tried to exploit when he used his access to networking equipment to plant fake phone calls from his wife to himself after she was already dead.  I’d suggest that the question of data reliance is an absolutely critical one we should all be asking all the time.  As it happens, my position allows me to go beyond posing the question and actually propose a solution. To me, it is pretty apparent that we already have an architecture that allows us to decide what is true and what isn't, and achieve consensus among multiple parties, without having to own all the data ourselves or to blindly trust others.  That architecture, of course, is blockchain technology, and I would argue that integrating it into many of our existing systems is absolutely critical for all of us to be able to take data reliance to the next level.  In particular, I believe that to unlock much more meaningful value out of data, a blockchain-based solution is a required, with the following domains at the top of my list:  Data analytics  Insurance claims  Record management  Regulatory compliance.  In conclusion, I’ll restate that data reliance will become an increasingly critical issue, growing in importance as data becomes more and more central to our lives.  We have an urgent need to solve the issues raised by the question of data reliance, requiring better answers than either whole ownership of data or the assumption that another party is ""probably trustworthy"".  Blockchain technology will provide an effective and highly applicable way to address this question, and will ultimately constitute a commonplace standard for data reliance.
