42416873,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxd2W,1376073586,What would happen to miners and merchants if the bitcoin price reached $500?,"Bitcoin’s price has been relatively stable the past few months. That’s save for a nail-biting drop in value to almost $65 per BTC for investors in early July. Sixty-five USD was a low number that hadn’t been seen since the skyrocket-then-drop valuation of bitcoin in spring this year, when many believed we would perhaps see bitcoin reach a value of $250 or even $500.  Well, we did see the price of bitcoin surpass $250, albeit very briefly. The breaking through of the $250 barrier, however, still makes investors and bitcoin enthusiasts alike salivate at the idea of such a heady valuation. Yes, $500 sounds like a great price if you’re holding onto bitcoins. But bitcoin and the network surrounding it might be affected by such a lofty price in ways that many probably aren’t even considering. How would a $500 valuation affect the bitcoin economy?  Mining  The environment that exists for bitcoin mining today can be best described as a race that has no finish. It has no winner that will take first place as the pace of technical innovation proceeds. Mining companies with the latest and greatest ASIC technology are constantly trying to squeeze the highest hashrates possible out of hardware that is hungry for both power and cooling.  This year, the bitcoin mining difficulty has gone up exponentially, starting in March when ASIC technology began to take over from the FPGAs that were on the market. The percentage change that we have seen in the mining difficulty has been huge: at this point, only ASIC chips are capable of making any money by mining bitcoins.  What’s clear, though, is that if bitcoins were worth $500, the incentive to mine would be increased. It’s unknown what mining equipment manufacturers like Butterfly Labs would do, since they have said that they do not mine with their own equipment.  There is no doubt, however, that some mining companies would at least consider doing so. It almost seems like a given when the price for equipment versus the value of a bitcoin at $500 would be enticing, to say the least.  Payments  Many companies have decided to get on the bitcoin bandwagon by making announcements that they accept BTC. Some of this is for the free marketing that is provided by putting out a bitcoin press release. It makes sense, because any business that ends up accepting bitcoins will gratify any BTC supporter. Yet it’s not likely that many companies are holding a lot of their incoming revenues in bitcoin, as it still is not generally easy to pay invoices, employees and vendors with it.  Foodler is seeing growth in bitcoin orders at thirty percent per month. And to use that company as an example, the purpose of adopting BTC for them was to reduce the amount of transaction costs that come from banks. Companies like Foodler rely on electronic payments in order to survive, and the cheaper they are, the better.  Bitcoin at $500 per BTC might not be bad for companies like Foodler. A $500 bitcoin means that a lot more people will know about it, and the transaction volume will rise in terms of a payment choice for businesses that accept it. The developers of bitcoin had in mind that a high valuation would require that it be broken down into smaller amounts. A bitcoin can, in fact, be broken down to as little as something called a “satoshi”, which is 0.00000001 BTC.  Hype  As the value of something rises, hype ensues. Hype almost stacks on top of hype. This is a probable scenario that will take place with bitcoin: a break above $266 will set off a hype reaction, but anything less than that won't trigger it.  A great example of this was the seminal moment when a barrel of oil broke through the $100 barrier. Based on the trading prices, towards the end it was clear that oil was going to break that mentally important barrier of $100 because of traders trying to get to that point, and not because of its true valuation.  Fundamental analysts versus technical ones might disagree with that statement, but whenever it does happen that bitcoin passes $266, you can probably expect it to reach much higher. But if you use oil as a case study, the end result was not good: oil took a big drop with the economy, after nearing $150 a barrel before steadying out. Today, at the time of writing, it’s worth $103.15 per barrel, which is near that $100 high back in 2008.  Fiat  If a digital currency like bitcoin were able to reach a $500 valuation or higher like some have prognosticated, what does that mean for fiat currencies? It may be that an event such as this would mean a loss of faith in some fiat currency that has reached a breaking point. Or, it could mean a revaluation between fiat and math-based currencies. It’s hard to predict, but it is a likely future that we face.  There’s only so much money to go around. As the United States has embarked on quantitative easing (QE) revaluation in the past few years, countries like China have had to keep up with the money printing. Just recently, the People’s Bank of China had to release 17 billion yuan (roughly $2.7 billion) of capital into its banking system just to stave off deflating prices and continued credit problems there. They don’t have a choice but to do so: they are so linked with the US that they have to revalue their money as well.  When do you think that the price of bitcoin will hit $500? What kind of effects would such a valuable decentralized currency have on the global economy? Let us know in the comments.

42416859,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcc6,1376059773,Utah-based housing company allows BYU Idaho students to pay in bitcoin,"A Brigham Young University-approved housing company is now allowing students to pay their deposits and rent in bitcoin.  EdgeCreek Property Management owns the Nauvoo House, Mountain Pines and Central Park Rexburg complexes near to BYU Idaho and all are now accepting payment in the digital currency. The company is also accepting bitcoin as payment for the Village on the Parkway accommodation, which is close to Utah Valley University.  Daniel Larson, of EdgeCreek Property Management, said he started paying attention to the bitcoin scene about 18 months ago, but his company began looking into it as a form of payment about three or four months ago.  He went on to say: ""We understand that the generation that we're renting to is probably the most likely to deal in bitcoin and we wanted to give them another way to pay their rent.  ""Also, we love what bitcoin represents from a freedom standpoint – there are no governments manipulating its value – and we want to help make it a viable currency.""  Larson explained the only way this can be achieved is if there is an increase in the goods and services people pay for with bitcoin.  Students can't pay with bitcoin directly via the website. They have to email Larson, who will arrange the transaction with them. ""At this point, we don't see this as a payment option that will be used very often so we will just deal with bitcoin payments on an as-needed basis. If it becomes more popular, we'll work out an automation plan,"" he explained.  Reactions within the bitcoin community to this move have been mostly positive, with members stating that it further legitimises the currency. However, some are surprised a company associated with BYU, which is operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is interested in bitcoin.  One notable BYU graduate is Austin Craig, who, with his wife Beccy Bingham Craig, is living on bitcoin for 90 days for the Life on Bitcoin documentary. Craig and his wife live in Provo, Utah, and are Mormons.  ""Fear, avoidance, or shunning of technology might be true of some faiths, but it definitely is not true of the Mormons,"" he said.  ""It seems to be a persistent misconception about the Mormons, particularly that we're still wearing bonnets and pulling handcarts to settle the West. It's an easy mistake to make, I guess. But nothing could be further from the truth.""  Craig went on to say his faith teaches him to be productive, work hard and take care of himself, his family and fellow man. ""Technology empowers people to do more and be more productive. If I can use technology to work more efficiently and effectively, I'll take it.""  He explained that Utah, a stronghold of the Mormon faith, is home to a growing tech scene.  Craig Huntzinger, who runs the honey products business Bees Brothers with his three sons in Cache Valley, Utah, agrees that the state is becoming something of a tech hub.  ""There is a lot of technology in Utah in many different fields of science and electronics,"" he explained.  Huntzinger believes bitcoin has the potential to thrive in Utah, as many people in the state are into self-reliance and care about independence. Back in March 2011, a law was passed in Utah that directed the legislature to study an ""alternative form of legal tender"", which suggests the state is ready to turn its back on the dollar and is open to accepting a new currency.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/09/utah-based-housing-company-allows-byu-idaho-students-to-pay-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c11ba9d2765bd1540dc5bd3cccec0167c07dae1-1064x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416863,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxciC,1376056645,"The bitcoin guide to what to do, eat, read and think on your holiday","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 9th August 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law  Become famous in a fortnight!  The summer doldrums are well under way, with the world and its non-gender-specific partner fleeing the office for a fortnight on the beach. In the days before the Internet expanded it to a 365-days-a-way festival, journalists used to call August the silly season. With no real news about, desperate editors turned to a run of non-stories, usually involving vicars, starlets or other animals, while waiting for politicians, businessmen and bank robbers to come back from their hols.  Bloomberg, being a very traditional media outlet, still celebrates this ancient festival. This week, it chose to mark a chunklet of real bitcoin news - a judge deciding that BTC was real enough to be called money - as proof that the currency is doomed. The argument went something like this: bitcoin's only reason to exist is that it’s different to everything else. If it’s defined as proper money, then the magic goes away and it’s got no advantages over what’s gone before.  John Law is much taken with such thinking, and would like to take this illustrative example to help you become a Certified Bitcoin Pundit. Earn big money at home! Become famous on the conference circuit! Write a best-selling book (which is forgotten seconds later)!  All you need do is decide whether you’re for BTC or against it. If you can’t make your mind up, flip a (non-virtual) coin. It doesn’t matter what your stance is, providing it’s consistent - once famous, you can flip your opinion every other week, but it’s best to start on the nursery slopes.  Chosen a heart-felt conviction? Good. Here’s how to turn it into fame and fortune, with three worked examples.  1. A regulator pronounces that bitcoin is a proper currency, and will be treated accordingly.  For BTC: This is exciting news that validates the technology! This means that it really does have consistent value and a place in finance, while retaining its unique attributes of flexibility, anonymity and non-mediated transfer. Its future is assured.  Anti-BTC: A death blow! Everything you might love about cryptocurrency is lost, as the great mechanisms of official money control are brought to bear on the fledgling idea. Nobody will be able to shift so much as a bitcent without being taxed, regulated, inspected and complied. Stick to dollars, fool.  2. A major scam is uncovered and the miscreant dragged away by the Feds.  For: Exciting news that validates the technology! All new discoveries of worth spawn an initial phase of over-excitement and hype, when the mere attachment of the idea to something renders it far more appealing to the credulous (see: radium health drinks, commercial television, digital watches). It’s only when a new idea completely fails to inspire over-reach (3D TV, Sinclair C5, vat-grown beef burgers) that you know it’s a flop. This is a regrettable but healthy demonstration of vitality.  Against: A death blow! BTC is nothing but a bunch of chancers and swivel-eyed libertarians fishing in a sea of idiots with the worm of deceit. How anyone can take it seriously when this sort of thing goes on is beyond me. What next, bitcoin cures cancer? (Note use of ridicule when facts not available).  3. A new cryptocurrency suffers a security problem and shudders to a halt.  For: Exciting news that validates the technology! Let a thousand flowers bloom - evolution says that some will die so that others may live. The idea of decentralised currency is so correct, and the tools to make it so available, that perhaps some will dabble without thinking it through. Let them, and accept that the furnace of interest will purify the slag of incoherence into the puissant steel of the new industrial revolution! (Note use of flowery language and simile to cover lack of intellectual rigour in argument).  Against: A death blow! The whole area of cryptocurrency is infested with inventors who are either incompetent or incomprehensible. Nobody truly understands this stuff but the hackers, and they’re out to get you. No thinking person will give this nonsense a second thought.  There you go. A new career awaits and you have a couple of weeks before the silly season is over. Homework will be set later.  Slush fund  Growing beef burgers in vats is very science fiction. The idea goes back to the 19th century, although one of the best books featuring it is 1952's The Space Merchants, a pungent satire of big business and advertising that holds up well even today. But it’s not the most famous SF foodie riff: that would be Soylent Green. In an overpopulated world, a mixture of soya and lentils is the only way mankind can feed itself - only, of course, it’s really made from the most plentiful protein source on the planet: humans.  Bitcoin has plenty of science-fiction chops too: real money that doesn’t exist except as a pattern of ones and zeros, generated and controlled by a global robotic mind that lives in the incomprehensible Internet. So it makes total sense to combine the real-life Soylent - an artificial gloop designed to be a complete nutritional substitute for all other food - and the cryptocurrency of choice. Now, you can buy the one with the other. Is it possible to live a more 21st century life than eating quasi-food bought with BTC you mined yourself with the latest ASIC? No, it isn’t.  However, a word of warning. Although John Law cannot speak about the long-term consequences of such a diet, he does know of one serious drawback. A friend, fired by curiosity, misplaced geekiness and youth, decided to live on the stuff for a while. This being 2013, he published a day-by-day account of the experiment, so all his friends (and everyone he came into contact with in his professional life) knew he was guzzling the gruesome brew.  On meeting said friend for the first time after his conspicuous consumption, the obvious question came out: how was it, and what were the, er, end results he hadn’t written about?  “You mean my poo, don’t you?” said the friend. “The poo was horrible. But not as horrible as the fact that despite me working at the cutting edge of technology, finding out about the latest big computing technologies and assiduously cultivating the digital future, for the past month all anyone has wanted to talk about has been my poo. All. Anyone. Asks. Is. Poo.”  His eyes blazed. The veins in his neck throbbed. Tiny shudders convulsed his body. The subject was swiftly changed.  This may be a sign of some latent psychosis, perhaps triggered by unforeseen effects of the diet. Also, to be fair, the conversation came up at the end of a long night spent absorbing other liquid nutrients. But John Law recommends, should you be tempted, that you prepare yourself to talk an awful lot of excrement.  Pi eyed by bitcoin fan  Finally, another marriage made in heaven - this time between bitcoin and the Raspberry Pi. If you’ve somehow missed this phenomenon, then it’s time to hand in your geek credentials: a tiny £30 computer designed to bring proper programming back to the masses, this Cambridge-sourced wonder has been a true phenomenon, spawning a hyperactive and ultra-inventive fan club.  Raspberry Pi is small, cheap and powerful enough to make itself the obvious hub for almost any esoteric computing and control application. In this case - literally - a hacker by the name of Garbage put a 4G modem and some electromechanical gubbins in a briefcase and offered passers-by at the Defcon security conference the ability to turn their pocket change into bitcoin. The output was a printed QR code that could be scanned in later, when the punters had set up a wallet. The overall intention was to make people aware of, and part of, bitcoin, at no possible risk and for the tiniest possible investment.  So: your exercise for the week is to write a think piece explaining why this is either Exciting News That Validates The Technology! or A Death Blow! Something to do when you’re bored with the beach or stuck in the queue at immigration. John Law is off for a couple of days R&R himself, but will leave you with one final thought: the true Master Pundit is he who can get other people to provide all the material for him.  Get cracking!  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.

42416858,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcY2,1376040609,Canadian startup Coin Forest is Groupon for bitcoin,"Coin Forest  is a new site that enables bitcoin users to take advantage of group discounts from bitcoin friendly merchants. The team behind the site is based in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Coin Forest will promote limited time deals with online (only) companies that are part of the bitcoin community.  The Coin Forest team consists of the founder, John Mardlin, who has a degree in mathematics and engineering; and Brandon Gains who is a Victoria-based entrepreneur specialising in business development and online marketing, as well as a student of the University of Victoria.  The company's first deal was with shirtoshi.com, a bitcoin-themed T-shirt shop. It's second and current deal offers around 50% off .co domain names purchased with bitcoin at the registrar, Gandi.  As with Groupon, the mainstream name in group-deals, Coin Forest will make its money by taking a cut of the revenue made by the various promotions.  Bitcoin entrepreneur Michael Parsons thinks that the service could be attractive for bitcoin users. ""It provides a new avenue to spend bitcoins on an already tried, tested and trusted business model which is already understood - and the novelty of spending bitcoins on services (or goods) of value at a significant price discount.""  Parsons also stresses the importance of the nature of the deals offered for consumers, and the potential risks for merchants associate with bitcoin's volatility.  ""The success of Coin Forest will depend upon the quality of its discounted deals that holders of bitcoin will find attractive and the amount of discount provided. However there is a monetary risk (or advantage) to Coin Forest's suppliers if deals are live at a time of large fluctuations in the bitcoin exchange rate - they may want to have the option (in their T&C's) to terminate a deal instantly before the deadline if the bitcoin exchange moves within certain parameters.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/09/canadian-startup-coin-forest-is-groupon-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c209a0524e4483a55cebacc42d5a905286d4cf6f-500x331.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
