42377863,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oVP,1417287545,Bitcoin: New Plumbing for Financial Services,"Jonathan Levin is a digital currency consultant and entrepreneur. He previously co-founded and served as CEO of Coinometrics.  .  Payment systems are systems of pipes and valves that allow monetary transfers between people all over the world. To most, they sit insulated from view. Even when in plain sight they evade comprehension. With large responsibility for errors and lack of acknowledgement for progress, there has been little innovation and construction of new pipes. Bitcoin represents a new way to re-plumb the financial system on a decentralised architecture. However, much like the existing financial system, few people understand the consequences of the layout and design of its pipes.  The plumbing analogy fits far closer to bitcoin than normal financial markets. Bitcoins are not coins, indeed there is no concept of identifiable currency units. Bitcoin should be considered a type of monetary fluid with a unit of account: bitcoin. The monetary fluid – bitcoins – flows through a system of pipes (transaction outputs) and fittings (transactions).  Constructing bitcoin’s pipes  Transactions are constructed using previous transactions as inputs to fund transaction outputs. Each output can be thought as a pipe with some capacity of bitcoin. Each transaction is a fitting, connecting one or more of the existing pipes. The pipe or pipes that are the result of a fitting can at most carry the same capacity of the sum of the pipes that led into the transaction.  Bitcoin is neither an account based payment system or a tokenised banking system. The protocol uses the history of all past transactions to generate a state of unspent bitcoins. When we say there are 13 million bitcoins in circulation, what we actually mean is that the system recognises that there are 13 million bitcoins in unspent outputs that can be reassigned according to the rules of the payment system. The reassignment is irreversible and hence new transactions are additions to the growing complex system of pipes.  Analysing bitcoin’s pipes  The graph of pipes or transactions is largely immutable and therefore makes it amenable to analysis. Pipes are only destroyed if there is a reorganisation on the consensus of the network. The system of pipes is appended only and therefore the complexity and size of the transaction graph grows over time. Bitcoin’s history can be evaluated by looking at the state of the pipes on 1st January 2014 or any block height.    One problem in any analysis is the lack of mapping from inputs to outputs. When warm water comes out of a tap, there is no separation between the hot and the cold. In bitcoin, if two transaction outputs are both inputs in the same transaction, the protocol makes no attempts to map inputs to outputs. Bitcoin retains the information that can reveal the capacity of the individual pipes that were feeding into the fitting. In this way, bitcoin is not a token system but something far more fluid and complex.      In the diagram below each node is a transaction or an unspent output. The green nodes are transactions and the white node indicates unspent outputs. The number contained within the circle represents the sum of the outputs of that transaction or transaction output. Each edge is the link of output to the subsequent transaction. We cannot say in which proportion the inputs of the transaction are funding the outputs.      Imagine this transaction was the purchase of a new iPhone 6 costing 1.5 BTC. Now assume that one of the funding transactions used to fund the purchase was a theft. The theft is marked as the orange transaction. Now the difficult question becomes how much of the stolen bitcoin remains in the thief’s possession? Bitcoin the protocol does not have the answer to this. Instead we would have to rely on our legal principles to establish that all of the 0.5 BTC remaining in the possession of the thief was actually the stolen bitcoins.      As the blockchain is a public set of transactions, the analysis could be performed on an arbitrarily large scale. For example, we could ask the question: are the bitcoins that you are holding the same as the ones that I once had? The analogue is pouring water into the pipes at a source transaction and analysing how much of the same water collects at the target transaction. To perform such analysis, two types of algorithm are used – minimum flow and maximum flow. Minimum flow asks the question: “what is the minimum number of bitcoins that went from the source to the target?” The maximum flow asks the question: “what is the maximum number of bitcoins that could have gone from the source to the target?” If minimum flow returns a positive answer, X, then the target is at least holding X amount of bitcoins that were once held at the source. The water that flowed through the source is the same as the water that we found at the target.      However, usually the minimum flow quickly goes to zero because we need to combine transactions in order to pay our debts. So if I make the payment of 1.5 BTC for the iPhone 6. The minimum flow from each of the inputs to the expenditure is 0.5 BTC. The algorithm places the maximum number of bitcoins, 0.5 BTC, in the change and leaves 0.5 BTC to pay for the good. In the maximum flow case, the amount would be 1 BTC in both cases since the output is larger than 1 BTC. After only a few transactions, it is likely that the minimum flow falls to zero.      In the instance of minimum flow being greater than zero, we can prove that the bitcoins went from the source to the target and we have full traceability. But where minimum flow is equal to zero for all potential outputs, as is often the case, we have no traceability. Even though we can show the connections between all the different transactions or pipes in bitcoin’s history, we cannot say a lot about the flows of funds or monetary fluid. We get transparency but hardly any traceability. The parties that cause the obfuscation can also be identified by their bitcoin addresses and could be subject to adverse claims.      In light of this, perhaps it is a red herring to even think of bitcoins as units of currency and we should be rethinking the way that we speak of “my bitcoins”. Perhaps flows of currency as I have described them should be thought of as simultaneous creation and destruction of interests that are not necessarily tied together (as is the case with some US securities). These issues must be understood in order to develop private law frameworks for bitcoin as well as appropriate anti-money laundering guidelines. One thing is for sure – there are no coins in bitcoin.    This article has been republished here with permission from the author. Originally published on Jonathan's bitcoin blog.

42377861,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oU9,1417275832,The Importance of Keeping Crypto Crowdsales Accountable,"For many entrepreneurs, one of the most compelling use cases of blockchain technology is the potential for it to enable new marketplaces that remove traditional hurdles associated with investing and crowdfunding.  The growing number of public crowdsales has been widely covered as of late. With these crowdsales, companies sell a branded bitcoin fork as a way to finance the early development of cryptocurrency-related projects. The popularity of many of the early crowdsales has sparked a conversation about where the burden of consumer protection lies.  It appears that burden, at least for the moment, falls on the consumer to do their own analysis of a project’s legitimacy, team, technology and likelihood of success.  Despite the current situation, it is inevitable that this burden will, in some form, eventually land on the companies or the platforms that support them.  Legal concerns  Legal questions regarding cryptocurrency crowdsales are uncertain right now. To avoid classification as a security, tokens sold to buyers are often said to represent future access to a company’s technology.  The motivation to participate in cryptoequity crowdsales varies from investor to investor. While some possess a genuine interest in advancing a crowdsale-fueled through their support, other investors simply aim to buy low in order to sell for a higher price.  Yet the nature of how all of these tokens are eventually classified remains uncertain for the time being.  What is often predictable about an industry that lacks legal and regulatory clarity, however, is that the participants in that industry may be tempted to take minimal steps to protect themselves from potential liability. This is not surprising, as establishing measures and policies to protect consumers costs money and affects the bottom line.  Such actions are shortsighted. Regulation, particularly in the financial services industry, is generally a reaction to current problems in the market.  Rules are written to address problems that exist. Therefore, how an industry conducts business today has a direct result on how that industry will be regulated and required to conduct business in the future.  Prepaid cards  The prepaid card industry is a good example of how this battle between innovators and regulators has played out in the past.  Prepaid debit cards are a fast-growing form of non-cash payment. For years, particularly in the early to mid-2000s, prepaid card programs were largely unregulated and issuers were able to essentially write their own rules.  Card programs imposed fee structures that punished cardholders for inactivity, charged them each time the card was used and allowed for premature expiration if the card was not used regularly.  These fees were included in card agreements that accompanied the physical cards. However, the terms were often printed on inside packaging and not accessible to a consumer prior to purchase.  As the prepaid card market developed, legislators took notice of the developing industry problems and began crafting laws to address them.  A formal reaction came in 2009 with the passing of The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act.  The CARD Act restricted dormancy or inactivity fees and prohibited expiration dates of less than five years. The fees imposed also were required to be conspicuously stated for the consumer to easily understand.  This type of consumer protection will be required for cryptocurrencies where fees are not obvious. This will affect cryptoequity and the onramps to it, including bitcoin debit cards, bitcoin ATMs and wallet services.  Wall Street  We saw a similar reaction from legislators after the 2008 financial crisis. Wall Street was overleveraged and deeply entrenched in an experiment with exotic financial products.  When the markets went sideways, the walls came crashing down. Given the far-reaching consequences of the financial panic – and the public uproar that followed – the federal government was compelled to take some form of action.  This resulted in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection (Dodd Frank) Act, which sought to bring about increased transparency to the derivatives markets and reduce the amount of speculative investments on large-firm balance sheets.  Though imperfect by some measures, the law indicates a congressional interest to legislate previously untouched sectors of the US economy. The cryptocurrency industry is not immune from the tendency of the federal government to investigate – and create rules – for new and controversial financial systems.  Regulators have already targeted companies in the crypto space, efforts fueled largely by the consequences of mismanagement.  It can be argued that at least some portions of the New York Department of Financial Services' proposed BitLicense program were inspired by the shortcomings of Mt Gox and other first-generation virtual currency companies.  These companies lacked adequate compliance programs, measures to combat security breaches and fraud and disaster plans. Emerging bitcoin industries such as crowdfunding with cryptoequity would do well to get ahead of regulatory issues.  Reaction is inevitable, but not imminent  History tells us that, like with prepaid cards, investment banks and first-generation bitcoin companies, a regulatory reaction to crowdsales is inevitable, but probably premature today.  Each of these industries operated for years without interference from the government.  Legislators need data points and there aren’t enough yet. Crowdsales are in their infancy, and more issues will be exposed as the market matures.  In the meantime, crowdsales desperately need some adult supervision, and it must come from within. The leaders in this space – highly publicized projects raising money via crowdsale and the platforms that support them – need to lead by example.  The bar has been set – projects like Ethereum have invested impressive amounts of time and resources to ensure that the formalities of a typical financing were not lost on the informal nature of a crowdsale. Most of these efforts were dedicated to informing the market; educating them on both the product and the potential risks.  Crowdsales have already generated tens of millions of dollars for their respective projects and this industry will only continue to grow as more technology projects seek non-traditional forms of financing.  Setting a good precedent now may inspire these future crowdsales to follow suit. It's becoming easier for consumers to identify and avoid crowdsales that disregard a framework adopted by a majority of the market, so it's in the best interest of everyone involved to keep each other honest.  This article was co-written by Andrew Beal, an attorney at Crowley Corporate Attorneys in Los Angeles. Andrew represents virtual currency companies, has been a strategic advisor to several successful crowd sales, and is a frequent speaker on the surrounding legal issues.

42377849,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oDn,1417266767,Zennet to Pay for Distributed Computing With Blockchain Tech,"For several years now, kindly volunteers have been contributing their spare computing power to vast, distributed supercomputers, all in the name of worthy causes.  Spare computing cycles have been used for everything from scanning cosmic radio signals for signs of extraterrestrial life through to calculating climate change scenarios. Now, a new project hopes to let people charge for their spare computing cycles.  Traditionally, in a community grid project, one central resource (such as SETI@Home) co-ordinates thousands of volunteer computers in a cloud, relying on people giving up their computing cycles for free. After all, it has been practically impossible for people to charge for them – until now.  Zennet  is a distributed supercomputing project that will use blockchain technology to remove the central administrators from the problem. Instead, it will be a completely decentralised system, according to its founder, software engineer Ohad Asor.  Asor calls it a market for computational power, in which many different jobs would be distributed among many different computers, with no middleman taking commission or co-ordinating things.  How Zennet will work  Publishers provide jobs ripe for large-scale distribution, which would typically be the kinds of workloads used in Hadoop, the open source project used for the distributed processing of large data sets (you'll often see Hadoop and 'big data' used in the same context).  Publishers distribute information about those jobs on the network. Software operated by providers – owners of computers with spare computing power – will contact the publishers, and automatically negotiate a price for their part in the job.  Anyone can be a provider, as long as their computer is capable of running the Zennet client. Every computer has spare computational cycles, in between each rest break, cup of coffee and keystroke, which could be used by a provider.  The key concept behind Zennet is that publishers' jobs are designed to be distributed among hundreds or thousands of providers, each of whom take on a tiny proportion of the job.  Asor said:  ""More computers is better, because large equals fast. If you have twice as many computers, you will fold your protein twice as quickly.""  Need for speed  Managing thousands of agreements with as many different providers is no mean feat. That's where blockchain technology will come in, Asor said.  Publishers will announce their jobs on the blockchain and providers will search the public ledger for those jobs. They negotiate the contract directly, then the publisher commits a specific amount in funds to the blockchain.  The provider starts work, and the publisher controls the work on the provider's computer. Once the work is done, the funds on the blockchain can be released.  Asor would have liked to have used bitcoin's blockchain for the system, but it is too slow, he said.  ""I have been thinking about the coin algorithm for a long time. It has to be a secure coin, and fast,"" he explained. ""If you did it over bitcoin, when you ordered a computational job it might take half an hour until it begins. That is unacceptable.""  The potential slowness is because of a payment method that Xennet needs to function effectively as the jobs completed are likely to be small, Providers would be paid off-chain, using the micropayments protocol already outlined in the bitcoin wiki. Setting up that micropayments channel takes a confirmation on the blockchain.  ""To initiate a micropayment channel, it is necessary to deposit money in a multisig address, and the other party has to wait for confirmations of this deposit,"" says Zennet's explanatory literature.  Key decisions  Instead, Asor proposes an alternative blockchain and cryptocurrency, called XenCoin, which would be used to pay for computational work. He suggests a fixed amount of coin at the start of the Zennet project, rather than ongoing mining.  As a blockchain-based token, XenCoin still needs a consensus mechanism to ensure that the system stays reliable, and every client believes the same version of the blockchain. Asor is mulling two different options here: delegated proof of stakehttp://bitshares.org/documentation/group__dpos.html (DPOS), and some kind of modified proof of work.  ""They are both good solutions, as far as I can tell, but we take more time to decide on these things because we really want to come with the most secure thing possible,"" Asor said.  He'd better get a move-on, as the presale for the Zennet network was supposed to happen in November. Although Asor says that the lawyers are still working it out. ""It's always in a few days,"" he said.  Attractive proposition?  In any case, why would people want XenCoins in exchange for their work? If they are used to pay for large-scale computing resources, and the average desktop PC owner doesn't have a whole bunch of 3D raytracing to do, then it's difficult to see why they'd bother spending computational power in return for a token like this.  ""The formal answer for legal reasons is, I don’t care how you redeem XenCoins,"" said Asor. But what about if an exchange offered to trade them for fiat currency? ""That's the informal answer,"" he joked.  There's still a lot of fundamental work to be done in areas such as consensus algorithms before Zennet goes live. However, Asor says that around a quarter of the coding has been done.  If the concept can be made to fly, then it'll be an interesting example of how blockchain technology opens up hitherto unexploitable markets.  Quite how the folks relying on volunteers to search the skies or predict future climate chaos will feel about all of that is another thing entirely.
