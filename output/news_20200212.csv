42383276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2Tv,1581551719,"IRS Refused to Clarify Its Crypto Tax Guidance Isn't Binding, US Watchdog Says","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) should – but won't – clarify how taxes are levied on cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency transactions in the U.S., the government’s top auditing institution said Wednesday.      The Government Accountability Office (GAO), a U.S. Congress watchdog, published a report in response to a request from Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), evaluating the IRS’s existing approach and public guidance surrounding cryptocurrencies.      The office had three recommendations for the U.S. tax collector, as well as an additional related recommendation for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department. Notably, one of its recommendations was to clarify that some of the IRS’s recent guidance is not binding or authoritative – and the agency rejected this recommendation.      “Part of the 2019 guidance is not authoritative because it was not published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB). IRS has stated that only guidance published in the IRB is IRS’s authoritative interpretation of the law. IRS did not make clear to taxpayers that this part of the guidance is not authoritative and is subject to change,” the report said.      Wednesday’s GAO report was reported earlier by Bloomberg Tax.      The IRS’s 2019 guidance answered some questions around the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies but “prompted new concerns among virtual currency stakeholders,” the report said. Complying with tax requirements may be difficult, and the GAO report suspects that trading activity may be underreported due to a lack of clarity around what should be reported.      A further complication comes from foreign account reporting requirements, the GAO said. Specifically, it is unclear whether foreign bank account reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reports apply to cryptocurrencies.      Indeed, even the wording around cryptocurrencies is vague. The IRS and other elements of the federal government have been referring to cryptocurrencies as virtual currencies, but as noted by Coin Center’s Jerry Brito, the term can also refer to digital monies used in video games (UPDATE: The IRS modified this language to exclude video game currencies late Wednesday).      The term “convertible virtual currency” may more specifically refer to cryptocurrencies, and has appeared in White House publications and IRS documentation (though not its 2019 FAQ).      The GAO recommended the IRS add a note saying its 2019 FAQs are not binding guidance, clarify third-party reporting requirements and clarify the reporting requirements around FATCA. The GAO also recommended FinCEN, in coordination with the IRS, share more information about applying foreign account reporting requirements under the BSA.      The IRS agreed with the second recommendation but disagreed with the first and third, the GAO report said. FinCEN also agreed to share more information.      “We continue to believe that including such a statement would provide more transparency and help taxpayers understand the nature of the information provided in the FAQs,” the GAO said.

42383288,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2hl,1581541214,Options Protocol Brings 'Insurance' to DeFi Deposits on Compound,"Trustless insurance has arrived on decentralized finance (DeFi). At least on the Compound protocol, the collateralized lending platform that runs on ethereum.      The new product, from a company called Opyn, allows people to take out options on stablecoin deposits, allowing users to hedge against the risk of a catastrophic event wiping out Compound's books.      ""You can make a claim at any time. You don't have to prove anything to anyone,"" Zubin Koticha, one of the three co-founders behind the new product, told CoinDesk.      The decentralized web may have reduced the need to trust intermediaries, but that doesn't mean there isn't risk. As the broader DeFi market grows past $1 billion in committed crypto, users need ways to manage that risk just as in the old market.      To that end, Opyn is the beginning of a blockchain-style solution analogous to those found in traditional financial markets. As it happens, derivatives are so big in those markets that it's somewhat ridiculous even to repeat their estimated market size.      Meanwhile, Compound is the third-largest DeFi app on ethereum, as measured by DeFi Pulse. Users can earn interest on funds they deposit into the protocol, and they can also borrow against their deposits.      Compound has been stable since launching in late 2018, but no one disagrees that this world of DeFi is still tiny and hasn't really been tested in the fires of true panic. If more serious investors are to start using Compound, they will want a way to hedge.      Multicoin Capital's Kyle Samani told CoinDesk one of the perks of DeFi is the ability to make applications work together without having to ask permission (also known as composability). But this feature might yield surprises.      ""We don't yet have enough evidence to know that they work as intended 100 percent of the time. And so, the more that users layer these protocols together, the more systemic risk grows,"" Samani said.      ""There is certainly a non-trivial amount of risk in the ecosystem, as a lot of smart contracts present substantial surface area for bugs or attacks to occur,"" Autonomous crypto fund founder Arianna Simpson told CoinDesk. She said the industry is working on this challenge, citing Nexus Mutual as a company that already provides insurance services for smart contracts.      On risk, Koticha says he’s talked to a lot of people in the space about their fears of depositing on Compound.      The computer types fear a bug or a hack, knowing that smart-contract languages can be very touchy. Financial types fear a liquidity event. For example, what if everyone just decided to close their deposits all at once?      Opyn's first product will offer a hedge, what financial types call a ""put option,"" which will guarantee that users can recover most of their lost capital if Compound has a disaster.      ""Options are great oracles of volatility and risk in traditional markets,"" Koticha said.      Koticha declined to name the project’s investors.      How it works    Opyn isn't offering insurance in the traditional sense. There will be no credit check or claims process or even proof the person owns the asset being insured (more on that below).      In fact, starting out, Opyn isn’t even going to ask users to submit know-your-customer (KYC) forms.      The team’s ethereum-based Convexity protocol can make all kinds of options, Koticha said. For now, it's simply making put options to protect Compound users.      To explain that first product, we need to back up and talk about how Compound works. If someone makes a deposit onto Compound of, say, 100 DAI, he gets cDAI tokens back. cDAI tokens appreciate in the user’s wallet at whatever rate the underlying asset is appreciating. This makes deposits on Compound tradeable.      For simplicity's sake, let's say 1 DAI equaled 1 cDAI (it doesn't, but let's say it does). With Opyn, someone pays a small fee to buy an oToken. That oToken would be good for a year (for now). At any time, any holder of an oToken could turn in their cToken and their oToken and get back (for example) .95 DAI (there will always be a little bit of a haircut).      The advantage for insuring these deposits is guaranteed free money in exchange for staking ETH as collateral. How much the user earns will be determined by the market. New oTokens will be sold via Uniswap and the price will be determined algorithmically.      So, for a borrower, if someone put 1,000 DAI into Compound, he could go out and buy 1,000 DAI worth of oTokens for what should be a modest fee in normal times. He’ll then feel safe for the next year knowing he can get most of his deposit back if something terrible happened to Compound.      Note: You don't actually have to hold cTokens to buy oTokens, which has interesting implications for the market. Imagine a trader who foresaw a liquidity run on Compound. He might buy up a bunch of oTokens (a so-called ""naked put"") knowing people will sell their cTokens for pennies on the dollar if Compound got wiped.

Speaking during a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Mnuchin said FinCEN, the nation's financial crimes watchdog, is preparing to roll out some ""significant new requirements"" around cryptocurrencies, though he did not provide any further detail.      Mnuchin's explanation came in response to Senator Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who asked, ""How will the Treasury's proposed budget increase in monitoring suspicious cryptocurrency transactions and prosecuting terrorists and other criminal organizations financing illicit activities with cryptocurrency?""      FinCEN and the Treasury Department more broadly are ""spending a lot of time on this,"" Mnuchin said, and was working with some of the U.S.'s regulators on the issue. He did not name the specific regulators but the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control have all been active in the crypto space.      ""We want to make sure that technology moves forward but, on the other hand, we want to make sure that cryptocurrencies aren't used for the equivalent of old Swiss secret number bank accounts,"" he said.      However, Treasury does share the senator's concerns about illicit use, and ""you'll be seeing a lot of work coming out very quickly,"" Mnuchin said.      A spokesperson for FinCEN did not immediately return a request for comment.      FinCEN and its director, Kenneth Blanco, have been warning businesses in the crypto space for months that in their view, existing regulations cover most forms of crypto transactions, particularly anti-money laundering rules.      FinCEN joined its fellow financial regulators in signing a joint statement last autumn, noting that banking laws still apply to this nascent asset class.      CORRECTION (Feb. 12, 21:25 UTC): An earlier version of this article said Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) asked about FinCEN activity around cryptocurrencies.

42383274,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2RP,1581535943,"Coinbase Revives Margin Trading, With Conservative (for Crypto) 3x Leverage","Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., is getting back into the business of lending money to traders, joining a growing roster of venues providing leverage to help users juice investment returns.      The San Francisco-based exchange said Wednesday in a blog post its new “margin trading” feature provides leverage up to three times or ""3x"" for individual investors in 23 U.S. states. The leverage is also available to institutional traders in 44 states and nine countries.      The 3x leverage matches Coinbase's previous margin offering from 2017. Coinbase, led by CEO Brian Armstrong, briefly offered margin trading at the time, but suspended the service later in the year. Executives had been signaling since early 2019 that they were considering reviving the effort.      The resurgent push by Coinbase comes as competition heats up among the world’s crypto exchanges and the biggest players are scrambling to attract customers and transaction volumes with new digital-token listings and features including better trading technology, more leverage and more-secure custody options.      ""Margin has been one of our most requested features,"" Coinbase said in the blog post.      Several big non-U.S.-based exchanges, including Binance, BitMEX and Deribit, offer leverage of 100 times or more on futures contracts and other derivatives, but many of those offerings are off-limits to American customers. While U.S. traders can get leverage to buy regulated bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts on the CME and Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt division, those venues require special accounts to trade commodities.      Leverage is considered risky in trading because it boosts the chances of losses alongside the enhanced potential for gains.      In an example of how Coinbase’s new offering will work, traders could put $100 down and borrow up to $200 of bitcoin from the exchange for trading, increasing the potential size of the bet to $300 worth of bitcoin. If bitcoin’s price climbs by 33 percent, traders would double their original investment to $200; but if the price falls by 33 percent, they’re wiped out — known as ""rek't"" in the slang of the crypto industry.      In the blog post, Coinbase said the borrowed funds can be used to trade other cryptocurrencies, in addition to tripling down on a single digital asset like bitcoin: "" If deployed as part of a responsible trading strategy, margin trading doesn’t just increase your position in a specific trade but can also help diversify your portfolio, allowing you to hedge or arbitrage across multiple positions without depositing additional capital.""      Coinbase is notable because it is one of only a few big cryptocurrency exchanges based in the U.S., submitting to the nation’s strict regulations in exchange for access to customers from the world’s largest economy. Started in the early years of the crypto industry in 2012, Coinbase has long been used by cryptocurrency newcomers as an “on-ramp” into bitcoin and other digital assets from dollars and other government-issued money. The company now claims to have more than 30 million users.      Kraken, the second-biggest U.S. crypto exchange, also based in San Francisco, offers margin trading with up five times leverage, or “5x,"" but unlike Coinbase the exchange isn’t licensed to operate in New York.

42383284,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2dz,1581532228,Libra Minus Facebook: Why Celo Is 2020's Buzzy Token Project,"Celo is the new black.      Investors from Silicon Valley to Switzerland are whispering about it. The team behind that project, cLabs, is combining the ethereum and Libra models with a $30 million war chest from the likes of Polychain Capital and Andreesen Horowitz (a16z).      And with their stablecoins and reserve baskets, the shared backing of a16z isn’t the only similarity between the two projects.      “The Celo mobile app, bringing stable payments and remittances to the unbanked, has a chance to bring broad swaths of people to the world of blockchain technology and crypto, but to also level up the economic well-being of those most in need across the globe,” said Polychain President Joe Eagan.      Polychain CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee said in a Reddit AMA: “In the best case, Celo is Whatsapp for money.”      To that end, cLabs enlisted the makers of Libracamp to launch a Celo Camp incubator. Starting in April, the eight-week program will match up to 30 teams with mentors including Jane Lippencott of Winklevoss Capital and a16z’s newest hire, Arianna Simpson.      “Hopefully, people will build interesting stuff and we can guide them and offer support along the way,” cLabs founder Rene Reinsberg said. “We see Celo Camp as a way to test the curriculum and the concept of a virtual bootcamp to make this technology a lot more accessible.”      Five teams will earn prizes from cLabs, including $10,000 and a travel budget for the winning team. Incubator organizer Tomer Weiss said his goal is to be “a significant player in finding the product-market fit.”      “We are not doing anything related to the token sale,” Weiss said, referencing the not-yet-launched Celo Gold token sale. “But we are putting our skin in the game, our compensation will be paid in Celo Gold.”      Celo Camp will follow the model established by the Israel-based Libracamp incubator, which yielded tepid results. Since Libracamp wasn’t endorsed by Facebook, the initial goal was to connect investors with unaffiliated teams able to build products and services that leveraged Facebook’s open source Libra project. The $2,000 prize went to the Thailand-based startup Kulap, which made a crypto wallet for daily commerce.      “We are sharing our Libra library and documentary for everyone who wants to learn and implement,” Dighton-Mason said. “We have a real sample merchant to test this project, and we also connect with retailers and restaurants that are interested in Libra. Meanwhile, we plan to launch a digital wallet this year, which Libra will also list as a beta version.”      As far as Weiss knows, none of the teams raised funds related to their work in the bootcamp yet (though Dighton-Mason said Kulap is currently seeking venture capital and is in talks with prospective investors).      “The investment wasn’t mandatory. We decided not to invest in any teams in Libracamp,” Weiss said.      Regardless of whether the Celo Camp teams are able to launch venture-backed businesses, Reinsberg hopes participants will make financial products and services that help Celo find a use case. The startup will offer support to these teams throughout the incubator. Plans for a mainnet launch are penciled in for April 2020, said Reinsberg, laughing at how often he's fielded that question since raising last year.      “By this time early next year we hope to see that many people have built applications and big organizations have launched use cases on Celo,” he said. As part of the plan, the project will also conduct a token sale in 2020.    More tokens?    “There’s an auction that will run on CoinList for non-U.S. purchasers,” Reinsberg said, adding the team has yet to finalize the timing of this year’s sale.    Following in the footsteps of the Interchain Foundation, stewards of the Cosmos project, a separate foundation will distribute funds to cLabs to develop Celo. Governance has proven to be the trickiest aspect of blockchain projects. Leaders in the Cosmos ecosystem, for example, are currently embroiled in a feud. Some of the remaining projects funded by token sales are closing down, like Hong Kong-based BitSparkhttps://www.bitspark.io/blog-posts/dear-bitspark-community.    BitSpark co-founder George Harrap said that although the company was generating revenue and had plenty of runway, both regional circumstances and personnel changes led to the company’s closure. It’s clear that distributed legal structures have, so far, not abstracted away the need for committed people to build an ecosystem over many years. The fluid commitments of bitcoin contributors hasn’t successfully translated to startups just yet.      Meanwhile, ethereum, which influenced many of the above-mentioned token projects, is both undergoing a complete rebuild due to technical shortcomings and inspiring central banks to explore blockchain solutions. These accomplishments were largely due to the ethereum co-founders’ aggressive evangelism and strategic investments in community development. Now, startups like cLabs are exploring whether this approach can be replicated.      Vanessa Slavich of cLabs said her team is “dogfooding” a governance model by using the Teal management approach while also encouraging external application development. To its credit, cLabs has conducted some of the industry’s most extensive field research in emerging markets and used Reinsberg’s own experience with currency woes, growing up in East Germany, to inform a mobile-first approach.      Plus, he said Celo will complement ethereum’s broader movement. The Celo network’s currency reserve will include ether and the broader network will use stablecoins, inspired by the dollar-pegged and crypto-backed DAI stablecoin.      “We’re very focused on financial systems,” Reinsberg said. “Having a built-in identity layer … that maps phone numbers to wallets, which makes it really easy to send payments to a phone number, and having that number be an anchor for a reputation that can be used in the context of peer-to-peer lending or other types of financial transactions.”      Facebook’s Libra project arguably has the same goals, but Reinsberg says Celo’s approach is “fundamentally different.”      “We want to build a truly open, permissionless platform,” Reinsberg said.

On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, he spoke to Michael Casey about the convergence of forces leading to what he sees as a wholesale shift in how money and value moves around the world.      “Digital currency, stablecoins and the role of central banks in that is now a central theme for world economic leaders,” Allaire said. “The conversations are with people who run major currencies in major countries, with finance ministers that are looking over those economies, with supranational leaders that work on the monetary system.”      Those political conversations, Allaire said, are now aligning with technological improvements.      “We are at a moment in time now, [with] the dramatic continued improvements in the fundamental infrastructure for public blockchains and these models for things like stablecoins are meeting [while] major tech platforms and others are potentially creating mass distribution, that we can really now see a world in which, in the next couple of years, there could be hundreds of millions or billions of people using digital currency in their everyday life.""",POSITIVE,없음,TECHNOLOGY,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/12/circle-founder-digital-currencies-at-key-growth-moment-as-governments-take-notice,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/993041d761897afb0e484bed7e54d3749cf7ce32-2560x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383283,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2aD,1581521449,"Retail Investors Aren't Interested in Crypto Derivatives, Says eToro Executive","Despite being one of the largest crypto derivatives platforms, an eToro executive said he isn't losing sleep over the U.K.'s proposed retail ban.      Over breakfast in a central London restaurant, inside what used to be the Midland Bank, Iqbal Gandham, eToro's U.K. managing director since 2016, said the country's decision to ban retail access to all crypto derivatives would likely have a ""minimal"" impact on its business.      With more than 10 million users worldwide, eToro is one of the largest trading platforms in the world. Gandham said the company has noticed a shift in the behavior of retail traders, who value the fact they can buy an actual cryptocurrency asset and transfer it out into their personal wallets.      ""Two years ago people didn't understand real [assets] and derivatives, they just thought they were buying bitcoin. Now people are more comfortable in owning their own wallets and transferring crypto, they understand that if they can't transfer it out then it can't be real,"" Gandham said.      The U.K.'s chief financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), surprised the industry last summer when it unveiled plans to ban the “sale, marketing and distribution to all retail consumers” of crypto derivatives, including contracts for difference (CFDs).      At the time, the regulator said retail investors were ""ill-suited"" to such products because they were unable to ""reliably assess the value and risks of derivatives or [exchange-traded notes] that reference certain cryptoassets.""      Although regulated platforms, such as Hargreaves Landsdown, have already banned retail access to crypto derivatives, the FCA isn't expected to make a final decision until later this year.      eToro first offered bitcoin CFDs in 2014. It gradually increased the number of supported cryptocurrency-based options, but only allowed users to buy the underlying asset in September 2017.      ""Had you asked me this question in 2016/17, I would have said 'a really, really big impact, we need to change our business,'"" Gandham said. But the majority of eToro's customers now buy the underlying crypto, rather than any CFD product.      eToro currently offers retail users crypto assets or crypto CFDs at a maximum leverage of 2:1. A spokesperson told CoinDesk approximately 87 percent of eToro's retail users buy the asset. In the first month of 2020, that number increased to 90 percent.      In the case of catering to retail investors, eToro is ""moving away from the derivatives market,"" Gandham said.    Casualties    Few crypto derivative providers share eToro's sanguine attitude to the upcoming ban. Daniel Masters, executive chairman at CoinShares, which is the owner of XBT Provider, one of the largest crypto derivatives developers in Europe, told CoinDesk the company had ""vigorously resisted"" the FCA's proposal.      During the consultation phase in Q4 2019, CoinShares spearheaded a campaign against the ban and criticized the regulator for cherry-picking data and for an overall ""lack of understanding"" concerning the asset class.      ""Banning such instruments has many adverse consequences,"" Masters told CoinDesk. The ban ""will not protect investors,"" but will push them to offshore providers with little to no investor protection, he added.      Gandham agreed the ban will likely be a net negative for investor protection. ""I don't understand the premise of banning [retail crypto] derivatives,"" he said, because a blanket ban would push trading underground and overseas, which would likely expose consumers to more risk.      Still, Gandham is convinced the ban will only have a muted effect on cryptocurrency trading in the U.K. Crypto derivatives, in his view, are better suited for institutional or professional traders who aren't affected by the ban and who want exposure to the asset but would be burdened by having to hold the physical asset.      Of course, there will always be a handful of retail investors wanting 100x leverage on platforms like BitMEX, Gandham said.

U.S. cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said in a report Sunday that network traffic for monero (XMR) mining that had originated from North Korean IP ranges had increased by ""at least tenfold"" since May 2019, making it the most popular digital asset to mine and surpassing the regime's mining activity for bitcoin (BTC).      The report attributes the changing preference for monero to the fact XMR mining can take place on non-specialized machines, such as conventional computers, which lowers operating costs and negates the need to import mining rigs from abroad.      Monero transactions are also anonymous, making it easier for North Korea to ""evade attempts to track funds"" as well as circumvent sanctions imposed on the regime by the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, according to Recorded Future.      ""We assess that cryptocurrencies are a valuable tool for North Korea as an independent, loosely regulated source of revenue generation, but also as a means for moving and using illicitly obtained funds,"" its report reads.      Recorded Future's report said the regime's mining activity had been obfuscated with proxy IP addresses, meaning analysts could not determine the share of the XMR hashrate for which North Korea was responsible.      Although a U.N. study previously suggested a branch of the North Korean military was responsible for the regime's crypto mining activity, Record Future's study was not able to say which entity was responsible based on the data it collected.      Monero has been used by North Korea since at least August 2017 when operatives involved in the WannaCry attack exchanged extorted bitcoin into monero. The regime's bitcoin mining activity has remained relatively static over the past two years, according to the report.      Monero is the preferred cryptocurrency for many illicit and criminal organizations. A Japanese cybersecurity firm reported this week the mysterious hacking group Outlaw had developed a range of sophisticated crypto mining bots that can infiltrate enterprise computer systems to covertly mine monero.

As advertised on LinkedIn, BAE Systems, McLean, Va., is searching for candidates who can ""demonstrate proficiency in cryptocurrency"" and can move to the Washington metropolitan area to ""support a client’s operational requirements.""      Successful candidates must either be a certified bitcoin professional or expert (CBP/X) – industry-standard certifications – or have a ""substantive understanding"" of cryptocurrencies. That will include expertise in elliptic curve algorithms and zero-knowledge proofs, as well as ""hands-on experience analyzing Smart Contract vulnerabilities,"" the advertisement reads.      Candidates will also need to understand how cryptocurrencies operate at a source code level, according to the ad, as well as ""understand privacy coins, wallet types, full and light nodes, virtual currency payment processors, secure payment protocols and other issues related to the currency.""      BAE Systems Inc. is one of the largest contractors for the U.S. Department of Defense, supplying it with military hardware as well as advanced electronics and technology solutions.      BAE's ad does not disclose the client's identity but does say the role requires candidates to have security clearance from Polygraph, a lie detector test usually reserved for positions that handle sensitive information.      Candidates will be expected to interact with personnel at ""all levels"" within the client organization and will require experience in ""supporting operations or familiarity with the Intelligence Community."" They will also need to have at least six years of relevant work experience.      U.S. regulators have been increasing their interest in analyzing cryptocurrencies. For instance, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis earned more than $10 million in 2019 from 10 federal government contracts, according to public documents.

42403991,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh9y0,1581506474,Bitcoin Most 'Overbought' in 2 Years After Price Rises Back Above $10K,"View          Bitcoin is at its most overbought level since December 2017, according to the three-day chart's money flow index.  If prices fail to establish a foothold above resistance at $10,350, a correction to $9,800 may be seen.  The overall trend will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above support below $9,100.    Bitcoin’s recent price rally is looking as overstretched, according to a technical indicator.      The money flow index (MFI), a momentum indicator that incorporates both price and trading volumes, has risen to 86.00 on the three-day chart. That's the highest level since late 2017 when prices hit a life-time high of $20,000. A reading above 80 indicates overbought conditions.      The overbought conditions do not necessarily imply an imminent bearish reversal but likely represent over-exuberant bitcoin buying because the cryptocurrency has rallied by more than $3,500 over the last six weeks.      Also, markets sometimes enter into very strong trends, in which case the MFI can stay overbought for a prolonged period of time.      That said, the latest above-80 reading on the MFI has gained credence with bitcoin’s failure to keep gains above $10,350 (October high) resistance earlier today.    3-day chart    The long upper wick on the latest three-day candle represents a failure on the part of the bulls to establish a secure foothold above the horizontal resistance of $10,350 – a sign of buyer exhaustion.      That, along with MFI’s overbought signal, indicates scope for a temporary pullback or consolidation.      Prices may fall back to the five-candle moving average (MA), currently at $9,876, if the bulls fail to engineer a convincing break above $10,350 during the U.S. trading hours.      The overall bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above the Feb. 4 high of $9,075, as discussed on Tuesday.    Hourly chart    The hourly chart relative strength index has produced lower highs, contradicting higher highs on price. The bearish divergence supports the case for the price pullback put forward by the three-day charts.    Daily chart    Bitcoin created a bullish engulfing candle on Tuesday, signaling a continuation of the uptrend.      Bullish bias would further strengthen if prices find acceptance above $10,383 (engulfing candle’s high), bringing additional gains toward the next big resistance at $10,949 (September high).      Bitcoin is currently trading at $10,355, representing 5.66 percent gains on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/12/bitcoin-most-overbought-in-2-years-after-price-rises-back-above-10k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1eda2b816d128df6724df0e9cf7d179a7c418a31-716x420.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403990,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh9w2,1581483600,Bitcoin's Mining Difficulty Stagnates as Coronavirus Outbreak Delays New Equipment,"After posting solid gains in January, a key measure of competition among bitcoin miners has stagnated in the past two weeks as the coronavirus outbreak disrupts economic activity in China.      The slowdown in the growth of so-called mining difficulty signals miners have had to pause upgrading equipment after the epidemic prompted Chinese authorities to impose a quarantine and major mining equipment makers delayed production and shipments.      Mining difficulty – which gauges the effort required to solve math problems in order to win newly created bitcoin – adjusted on Feb. 11 to a level 0.52 percent higher than 14 days earlier, data show. That’s a significant drop from the growth rates of 4.67 and 7.08 percent, recorded on Jan. 28 and 14, respectively.      Bitcoin is designed for the difficulty to adjust roughly every two weeks, depending on the amount of computing power connected to the network. When more miners join the race to earn newly created bitcoin, the difficulty rises; when miners drop out, the measure eases.      Before the slowdown, miners were bracing for a new reality: their industry was about to become fundamentally less profitable. In May, mining rewards are expected to be cut in half, to around 6.25 bitcoin ($64,000 at current prices) per block, every 10 minutes or so. This would be the third so-called halving in bitcoin’s history and could result in operating costs exceeding revenue at miners.      “Many miners have been phasing out older mining machines and buying new and more powerful models as we get closer to the halving,” said Jason Wu, the co-founder and CEO of crypto lending startup DeFiner. For example, mining farm tenants have started to replace old machines such as Bitmain’s AntMiner S7 and S9 since the second half of 2019, Wu said.      “The outbreak may have delayed the transition and contributed to the slow growth in mining difficulty,” Wu said.    Running older models    Miners now keep running the remaining old machines since a high bitcoin price at the moment (above $10,000 since the weekend) keeps such operations profitable, while waiting for new models to be delivered, according to Wu.      Aside from the availability of new equipment, the virus has affected some miners in a more direct way.      “While most mining farms remain open during the Chinese New Year, there have been incidents where mining farms are shut by local governments due to the outbreak,” said Aries Wang, co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Bibox.      One mining farm owned by mining pool BTC.top’s CEO Zhuoer Jiang was shut down by the local government in an unnamed area in China, Jiang said on Feb. 4 via the social media network Weibo.      Among the largest crypto exchanges to come out of China, Bibox (now based in Estonia) has invested several million dollars in the mining industry, according to Wang.      “Many investors such as crypto funds and exchanges expect the halving would increase bitcoin price and they are putting their money in mining,” Wang said. “These investors would buy new machines as well as slots and maintenance services from a mining farm, where they can operate the machines.”    Arms-race respite    The situation has given incumbent miners a respite from ever-fiercening competition.      “The slow growth in mining difficulty is good news for existing miners,” said Abe Yang, chief operating officer at PandaMiner, a Shenzhen-based manufacturer and operator of mining farms. “Mining is like an arms race, the slow growth in general mining difficulty means these miners are likely to get higher returns from their mining investment.”      While almost all miner makers have halted production due to the coronavirus outbreak, the low inventory makes new machines even scarcer, Yang said.      “We could have produced more if it were not the stagnant bitcoin price before the Chinese New Year,” which fell on Jan. 25, Yang said. “Furthermore, we did not make any machines during the vacation.”      Although the bitcoin price started to rise after the holiday, there is typically a delay between market price moves and equipment orders, Yang added.      The outbreak already slowed logistics, and the fact that many mining farms are located in isolated, remote areas makes it even harder to deliver the machines to these sites.    A complex equation    To be sure, mining is a complex business and many different variables can influence decisions.      “For each miner, they have their own equation that includes factors beyond the mining difficulty,” Lingxiao Yang, chief operating officer at crypto hedge fund Trade Terminal, said. “A drop in mining difficulty growth does not necessarily lead miners to turn on more mining machines and increase their computing power at a faster pace.”      As some deliveries of new mining machines with higher computing power have been delayed, Yang said one of the options to boost mining power growth is to put older machines back into operation. That might not be in the best interest of some miners.      “The decision on whether to increase hash power faster depends on whether miners can make a profit,” Yang said. “If you consider other factors such as the operating cost, some miners might not have that much to gain by turning on the older machines.”      Many mining farms tend to have a mix of new and older machines as they phase out the older vintages while buying the new ones that are more energy-efficient with higher capacity, Yang said.      The cost of operating a machine is based on factors such as spot electricity price at the moment and how many coins the machine can mine. Many mining farms in Sichuan province rely on hydropower that changes seasonally, leading to differences in the electricity price over time.      When hydropower is harder to come by, some of the farms might go to Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions for coal-fired power plants. Even in the same region, mining farms might agree on different electricity rates with the local government since they negotiate separately.      Another factor that a miner takes into consideration is the expectation for future bitcoin prices. “Miners make revenue by selling the bitcoins they mine,” Yang said. “For example, they could make a profit at a price higher than $10,000, but lose money at a much lower price.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/12/bitcoins-mining-difficulty-stagnates-as-coronavirus-outbreak-delays-new-equipment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/579e9f1512b3b863c9563825d36058e64e1dd02a-1000x668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403982,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh9p9,1581480000,Why Security Token Offerings Are a Big Yawn in Parts of Asia,"Security token offerings (STO) were supposed to be the next big blockchain-based investment vehicle following the bursting of the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble of 2017. But there have been a number of reasons why this form of equity funding has not lived up to the hype of being a next-generation activity, including regulatory uncertainty and the high cost required to offer an STO.      The lack of interest is particularly striking in Thailand and Taiwan, two areas that were among the first to enact STO regulations to encourage the investment.      An STO is similar to an ICO where investors are issued a crypto coin or token representing their investment, which is recorded on a blockchain. These coins or tokens can be held, sold or traded. Because security tokens represent financial securities, purchased tokens are backed by tangible holdings such as assets, the company's revenue or profits.      It didn’t take long before regulators in many parts of the world, starting in early 2018, began drafting laws to build a legal framework to attract this new type of activity. Thailand and Taiwan were among the first to publish legal frameworks for STOs. But that hasn’t drawn firms to use the laws for meaningful blockchain-based securities listings.      Taiwan and Thailand aren’t traditionally thought of as financial hubs. However, the lack of interest in forming STOs in either place may offer a window into the conundrum faced by blockchain startups and investors when deciding to use STOs for raising capital.      “While STOs are easier to understand compared to ICOs for many institutional investors, we have not yet seen meaningful capital or liquidity move into the STO space,” said Hong Kong-based Henri Arslanian, PwC’s global crypto leader. “Many thought 2019 was going to be the year of STOs but, while there were a lot of developments, we did not see meaningful investor capital move into the space.”      In a recent CoinDesk opinion piece, Emma Channing, CEO of the Satis Group and a FINRA Registered Representative with ConsenSys Digital Securities, noted that in 2019 STOs had markedly improved infrastructure technology and lower costs than when they were first offered in 2018.      “At the same time, platforms have initiated thoughtful design around end-to-end functionality and compliance, including functionality that broker-dealers need (for example, around suitability data, such as a potential investor’s investment experience and risk tolerance, so broker-dealers can fairly advise them in line with FINRA rules). These developments, along with the emergence of a critical custody and control industry, bode well for the long-term maturation” of STOs, she wrote. She is even more optimistic about 2020 thanks to continued improvements in the technology.      “It’s now just a question of finding the right issuers, the right products and the right purchasers. Ultimately, we remain confident given the developments of the last two years that STOs will become commonplace across public and private markets,” she wrote.      But in some parts of the world, STOs are floundering. A spokesperson from Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed to CoinDesk there are no organizations raising funds via an STO launch in that country, despite the commission approving laws regulating STOs in mid-2019.      In Taiwan, Taipei-based law firm Winkler Partners, which works with crypto startups on deals and has an advisory role with Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission, said via a spokesperson that most blockchain companies in the island nation are “generally issuing utility tokens instead of security tokens at this moment.”    A stalled process    In 2018, Thailand’s Royal Decree on Digital Assets Business created a formalized structure for the taxation of crypto assets, among other things.    In 2019 this decree was expanded to allow for the creation of STO portals licensed by Thailand’s SEC. However, the five Digital Asset Exchanges that sprung up after the creation of this framework discontinued operations as of September 2019, according to a directory curatedhttps://pugnatorius.com/bbb/ by Bangkok’s Pugnatorius law firm.    In Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) published its first draft of its STO laws in mid-2019, calling them the “world’s first STO laws.” Feedback was encouraged from stakeholders. But despite the initial groundwork of capital formation from entrepreneurs, the process has stalled.      The FSC hasn’t released its final framework, pushing it back to early 2020, although local firms do have the green light to get the process started. The initial STO effort was largely driven by former legislator Jason Hsu, known as a “crypto congressman” seeking to take Taiwan to the forefront of the crypto industry.      Even so, blockchain startups haven’t been interested in the current framework and have not begun fundraising.      According to the current framework, firms seeking to raise over US$1 million (NTD 30 million) are required to be tested in a “financial regulatory sandbox” run by the FSC and rolled out slowly to the general public.      Those looking to raise capital under this amount have regulatory limitations such as only being offered to accredited investors, each with a maximum subscription of $10,000.    Product/market fit    The large amount of capital required may not be the only issue preventing blockchain startups from opting for an STO in Taiwan.      The story of STOs in Taiwan is similar to what happened to the country’s once-active equity crowdfunding sector, where the legislative barriers are high and the investment cap low, which means the potential for a healthy return isn’t there.      The Over-the-Counter Taipei Exchange, established in 2013, ran the Go Incubation Board for Startup and Acceleration Firms (GISA), which in turn provides the backend to power portals to solicit investments.      In 2015 the FSC allowed two local brokerage firms, Masterlink Securities Corp. and First Securities, to establish their own platforms. Nearly 50 firms have gone through the fundraising process via these platforms, raising over $200 million in funds.      However, while the equity crowdfunding market in Taiwan could be considered mature, interest in the GISA board eventually sputtered out because of strict regulations that limited investment to accredited investors at a maximum of $2,000 per project.      “The volume was so low that nobody wanted to be listed there,” said Jason Hsu. “It was like giving you a piece of candy to make sure you’re satisfied, but it’s not really going anywhere.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/12/why-security-token-offerings-are-a-big-yawn-in-parts-of-asia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a254aba262629b922cc7c4778cbebea5943354c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403987,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh9v3,1581477250,"Bitcoin Price Hits 5-Month High Above $10,350","Correction (14:40 UTC, Feb. 12, 2020): An earlier version of this article misstated the chronology of events: bitcoin started rising to above $10,300 just before Jerome Powell’s speech, not after.      Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is trending solidly back above the five-digit figure mark.      At around 15:00 UTC on Feb. 11, the price of BTC rose back above $10,000 from around $9,850 to $10,351 within an hour after succumbing to a small sell-off beneath the $10,000 level on Feb. 10, CoinDesk BPI data show.      The peak figure represents BTC’s highest point in over five months and offers a shift in trend from bearish-to-bullish in the mid-term as it continues to print new highs in 2020.      The rise in BTC’s price came minutes before Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday in which he discussed the need for privacy among digital currencies when seen through the lens of China's digital yuan.      ""A ledger where you know everybody's payments is not something that would be particularly attractive in the context of the U.S.,"" Powell told the committee.      David Freuden, blockchain innovation and cryptocurrency adviser at Monsterplay, and a proponent for privacy coins, told CoinDesk that while Powell’s comments are “somewhat bullish,” the concern is the U.S. government will insist on creating “back doors” on all major technology innovations.      “The U.S. government has the misguided assumption that it would be the only government that would request or coerce a back door,"" Freuden said.      Besides Powell’s recent comments, the sudden surge in value may be attributed to three catalysts including increased institutional and retail demand for cryptocurrencies, BTC’s halving event and macro developments, with a focus on the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus outbreak, analysts and traders said.      Joshua Green, a cryptocurrency derivatives trader operating in Australia, told CoinDesk a combination of “bullish sentiment” around BTC’s halving event, altcoin sentiment “dragging everything higher” and coronavirus concerns supporting the macro perspective are key factors.      “A lot of buying seems to be physical in nature, which is good,” Green said.    Bitcoin halving    BTC’s halving event, an occurrence every four years where the bitcoin network undergoes a 50 percent reduction in its mining rewards, has been spurring bullish sentiment reflected in both the spot and derivatives markets.      Data from Skew analytics demonstrates how institutional buying pressure continues to provide a solid base of support for the world’s largest crypto by market cap, reflected in a legitimate increase in derivatives volume and open interest.      Analysts like to keep track of changes in open interest to determine the strength of certain price moves. An uptick in price along with a rise in open interest is telling of the strength behind the move to higher prices. A trend is said to be lacking substance when the two metrics move in opposite directions.      In addition, spot volume on major exchanges like Binance are up 13 percent over the last 24 hours, data at Nomics show.    Macro view    The sentiment of ""BTC as a safe haven asset"" continues to hold water as major world events such as last month’s debacle with Iran and the U.S. helped drive prices higher, according to Tim Shaler, chief economist and professional trader at iTrustCapital.      “We believe one of the key drivers over the past five weeks or so of the rapid rise of BTC/USD may have been the threat of war with Iran,” Shaler said.      Simon Peters, analyst at eToro, said if the price of BTC remains above $10,000 then it would likely give investors confidence and “stoke” increased buying activity.      “There clearly seems to be more interest in bitcoin and other crypto-assets as potential safe havens for investors worried by the volatility of the stock markets as the coronavirus crisis continues,” Peters said.      Altcoins are also experiencing increased bullish sentiment as major names like ether (ETH), tezos (XTZ) and EOS (EOS) were up 10 to 12 percent on a 24-hour basis ahead of Powell’s comments, while privacy coins such as ZCash and Monero rose between 7 to 9 percent.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/12/bitcoin-price-hits-5-month-high-above-10350,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2b55fb278140e97200024bfba281a528a6f4abe-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
