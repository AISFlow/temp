42380956,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xR3,1530647110,VeChain Revises Roadmap to Address Token Swap Concerns,"Blockchain project VeChain announced on Monday that it has revised its development roadmap in response to community concerns related to its token swap.  The project, which aims to create a business-friendly public blockchain, launched its mainnet last week. However, the technology is not yet live, and will only be active after VeChain migrates from the ethereum blockchain – where it exists as an ERC20 token – to a wholly independent network.  Yet the swap has also been a point of contention for some token holders, especially those with so-called 'X Node' status.  According to the VeChain Foundation, the X Node program rewards early project supporters who hold a set amount of tokens by giving them the opportunity to run a low-level node in the network. They also have the opportunity to upgrade to a more privileged node status in the future. To maintain their X Node status, users must continue to hold the necessary balance, which will be ""monitored"" by the VeChain foundation.  In order to transfer users' X Node status from ethereum to the VeChain mainnet, the foundation initially said in its wallet manual that eligible users must transfer their tokens to VeChain's mobile wallet app by August 1.  However, despite VeChain's assurances that the wallet is secure, users in community forums were concerned about its use, particularly about what would happen to their X Node status if they lost their phone.  Likewise, many expressed frustration that the available alternative to the mobile wallet, the VeChainThor Ledger app, would not be released until after the cut off date for X Node migration.  ""This means everyone has to do it without Ledger support because that is not due until after that date,"" a Reddit user named _Neil_ wrote on the VeChain subreddit. ""This is going to make people nervous...me included as a want to keep my tokens secure but definitely do not wish to lose X status.""  Another user, spellboundaries, criticized the VeChain Foundation by saying:  ""They could have been better about this, specially[sic] in a space like crypto where people place safety as a top priority and invest money in things like hardware wallets. Having to place tens of thousands of dollars on the line for a token swap is pretty dumb imo.""  Fork in the roadmap  On Monday, the foundation announced that it would address the community's concerns by extending the X Node migration period for ten days after the VeChainThor Ledger app is available. It also said that X Node monitoring will start three weeks after the mobile token swap service becomes available – though it has not yet provided exact dates for these events.  Additionally, VeChain will introduce a ""wallet observation function"" that will allow users who create their VeChain private key addresses through alternative means (such as hardware wallets or desktop wallets) to manage and swap their X Node status through the mobile wallet.  The foundation also said it will ""backdate and compensate VTHO to token holders"" for the X Node migration and token swap period ""as the entire migration timeline is completed,"" though it did not provide further details on when or how it will do so.  ""Your voice has been heard,"" the foundation wrote. ""We believe this is the best way to strike a balance between our desired security level and user functionality.""  Users in community forums appear to be responding positively to the changes. While some Reddit users thanked the foundation and said they ""admired"" its ""responsiveness,"" others were less impressed.  One user, identified as sevletor, wrote: ""It's called professionalism.""

The firm has officially launched the Issued Assets (IA) program on its bitcoin-backed Liquid sidechain, allowing users to create their own tokenized assets, according to a press release. These tokens can represent any sort of financial instrument, including fiat currency, crypto assets or attested assets (such as gold coins), as well as more novel types.  Users can also adopt Confidential Assets to enable private transactions between blockchain assets, ensuring only the parties involved in a transaction will know the asset type and value being traded.  Moreover, users can conduct atomic swaps between bitcoin and IA that include altcoins, meaning that a bitcoin can be exchanged for an asset in a single transaction without using intermediaries. Finalizing a transaction takes less than 2 minutes, the startup said.  Blockstream previewed the tool at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York, demonstrating how the Liquid platform could be used to issue five different types of IA, representing physical goods.  In the demonstration, these assets included shirts and hoodies – and these tokens were randomly sent to attendees' paper wallets. Each paper wallet had a public key, and the owners were able to redeem the tokens for each asset it contained. After the physical gifts were redeemed, the digital assets were destroyed.

42380943,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xET,1530630700,Court Says India's Crypto Exchange Bank Account Ban Will Continue,"India's highest court has declined to end a ban enacted by the national central bank that bars the country's crypto exchanges from doing business with regulated financial firms.  Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the Indian Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, said that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) prohibition on providing services to crypto-related businesses will ""remain implemented.""  The decision continues the ban, announced in April 2018, when the RBI said that financial institutions would not be allowed to work with exchanges or related firms. It gave the banks three months to exit that market, making July 6 as the official start date for the ban, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  The policy shift prompted moves by members of India's cryptocurrency ecosystem to launch a series of legal challenges. But, as CoinDesk reported on May 22, the Indian Supreme Court barred all other courts from accepting petitions, after five similar petitions were filed against the RBI. At the time, the Supreme Court said it would hold a hearing on July 20.  According to Quartz, the hearing was held on July 3 instead of July 20 after the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), which counts bitcoin exchanges as its members, requested an early hearing.  The RBI claimed during the hearing that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, cannot be treated as currency in India as the country's law requires coins ""to be made of metal or existing in physical form and stamped by the government.'  The Supreme Court fight isn't over yet, as the July 20 hearing is still set to take place.

42380952,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xKl,1530619246,Why Companies Need to Get on the Tokenization Train,"Paul Brody is a principal and the global blockchain leader at EY.  The following article is the second in a series. Read part one here.      One of the most compelling uses of blockchain technology is the ability to reliably record information and verify when and where it was added to the network.  This feature, combined with the ability to synchronize a ledger, means that all parties can get the same information at the same time and have confidence in the truthfulness of that information. The result has been a rush to treat blockchains like infallible digital notaries, recording truthful information and sharing it around. Useful, definitely, but with significant limitations.  While knowing when and where a product was made is interesting and being able to trace its history is a powerful means to reduce fraud, it isn't an economic unit that I can buy or sell.  Digital tokens, on the other, are designed for economic activity. And blockchains are ideal for handling them.  Rx for commerce  Take something complex and valuable like a package of medicine. Not only do I need to record when and how it was created and where, I would also like to sell this product to my distribution partners and then on to pharmacies.  By creating a digital token to represent that package of medicine, not only do we record all the history of that medicine, just like a digital notary solution, we can also buy and sell that item by moving the token between accounts.  Public blockchains like ethereum are largely based on the ability to handle both complex business logic with smart contracts and a nearly unlimited number and type of digital tokens. Some tokens (like those representing money) are essentially fungible while others are unique. In either case, we believe the future of commerce is in contracts that involve the exchange of product and service tokens for money tokens.  Quite simply, the economy is going to be tokenized.  Using digital tokens, we can recreate all the sophistication of the existing financial and operational business world we live in, but with far less operational cost and complexity, and do it all within the same system. The future of business contracting is, we believe, the exchange of product and service tokens for digital payment tokens.  When combining tokenization with the complex business logic enabled by smart contracts, we can represent complex business interactions faithfully, and we can do so much more reliably than most companies can today. It's not atypical for companies to find that their ability to negotiate agreements far exceeds their ability to actually keep to those agreements.  Bird's-eye view  Volume purchasing agreements are a good example: most companies beyond a certain size often have multiple enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and subcontractors and subsidiaries, which makes doing even simple things like keeping track of volume purchased across the network difficult. And if you can't track volume, you can't get the discount.  With a smart contract and a blockchain for procurement, it's possible to both track total volume consumed across the business network and always calculate the correct price for each purchase order and validate each invoice.  As the token economy matures and companies put more and more assets, products, and services into public blockchains, expect the delivery of complex financial services to be digitized as well.  Everything from trade finance to receivables factoring will be a one-click activity, once participants have established a trustworthy track record of doing business on the blockchain – a record of granularity and precision that will far exceed the reliability of any traditional credit report.  To get there from here, however, the first step is for companies to embrace tokenization and move away from simply treating blockchains like fancy digital notaries.

At press time, BTC is trading at $6,575 on Bitfinex - up 3.4 percent in the last 24 hours.  The short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, as indicated by BTC's break above the significant obstacle of $6,450, will likely entice investors to bargain-hunt, creating an upward pressure on BTC prices.  Hence, BTC could rise to $7,000 in the short-term and extend into further gains if its move toward the psychological hurdle is backed by a sharp rise in the trading volume.  That said, the crypto asset's 24-hour trading volume stands at $4.61 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, down 8 percent from Monday despite a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  Daily chart  BTC closed (as per UTC) at $6,618 on Monday, confirming a bullish falling channel breakout. Further, the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) is biased to the bulls (sloping upwards), having witnessed a bullish crossover over the weekend.  Meanwhile, the relative strength index has moved to neutral (at 50.00) from the bearish territory (below 50.00).  What's more, the Chaikin money flow (CMF) oscillator, which measures the buying and selling pressure, has turned positive for the first time since May 20 and currently stands at the highest level since May 10. The positive print indicates the money is flowing into bitcoin and adds credence to the bullish falling channel breakout.  1-hour chart  BTC witnessed a bull flag breakout on Monday, which signaled a continuation of the rally from Friday's low below $5,800 and could yield a break above $7,000.  Clearly, the odds are stacked in favor of a rally to $7,000, however, the move may not happen overnight, as the short-duration charts are reporting overbought conditions.  For instance, the hourly chart RSI is rolling over from the overbought territory (above 70.00) as seen in the chart above. Further, the 4-hour RSI is hovering well above 70.00 (in the overbought territory).  View  The bullish falling channel breakout confirmed a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  BTC looks set to test $7,000 in the next few days.  As for today, we could be in for a minor pullback or a bout of consolidation (sideways trading) as the cryptocurrency is overbought as per the RSI on the hourly chart and 4-hour chart.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $6,275 (previous day's low) would abort the short-term bullish view.

However, according to a report from the South China Morning Post on Tuesday, Xiaomi stated it has no knowledge of the scheme at all and did not approve or endorse the token offering project.  According to Blackmoon's website, by contributing to the ICO with bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin, investors will be able to get exposure to Xiaomi's stock performance without having to directly own the underlying equity.  Blackmoon said it will convert the proceeds raised from the ICO into fiat currencies and transfer to its brokers, who will subsequently purchase Xiaomi's stocks from the secondary market on investors' behalf.  After an initial 93-day lock-up period, the company said investors holding BMxXMI could sell the token through brokers again who would execute sell orders of the stocks on the exchange.  However, Blackmoon has not disclosed details of the brokers who reportedly will act on investors' behalf such as their names and whether they are licensed broker and dealer to participate in the Hong Kong financial market.  In an email response to CoinDesk, the company declined to disclose details of its banking and broker partners citing confidentiality agreements, but stated its offering is ""aligned with the requirements of the jurisdictions in question, "" including the firm's ability to participate in Xiaomi's IPO and to distribute the tokens.

Operated by SK Planet, the e-commerce arm of communication giant SK Telecom, OK Cashbag was launched in 1999 to reward users who purchased goods and services from SK affiliated merchants. In an interview with CoinDesk Korea, SK Planet said a plan to introduce a blockchain system to tokenize cash points had been shared with the company's top-level management.  One aspect of the plan would involve the creation of a so-called stablecoin, or a cryptocurrency that maintains a fixed value, given that the points in question are tied to the Korean won.  While the bid – temporarily called OKX – is subject to further research ahead of any formal debut, it's a notable development given the existing user base of OK Cashbag and the number of merchants that accept the usage of OK Cashbag points.  According to the report, the program now has over 35 million users with more than 50,000 affiliated merchant stores where consumers can spend their rewards. They can also exchange points for cash if they earn more than 50,000 points.  And, while SK Planet could not calculate the exact amount of its reserve, the company told CoinDesk Korea that the total amount of points within its system could be worth more than $100 million.  More broadly, the report also indicated that SK Planet's move may run into regulatory hurdles even if the company decides to roll out the initiative.  According to the report, OK Cashback's cash point system is currently categorized as ""prepaid electronic payment means."" Firms offering this type of service must obtain approval from South Korea's Financial Services Commission.  Since the South Korea government has yet to pass a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, it remains to be seen whether SK Planet's plan will receive approval under the Electronic Financial Transactions Act mandate, the report said.

42380948,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xIF,1530604803,Bankers Tout Trade Finance as the Sweet Spot for Blockchain,"Even if blockchain fatigue may have set in among bankers, there's at least one use case they're still clearly excited about: trade finance.  At least, that was the impression given at the Blockchain Summit in London last week, where a range of bankers talked enthusiastically about the digital trade finance platforms they are building and the cost reductions they believe will result.  Perhaps most notably, Amit Varma, the CTO of Citibank, was unusually vocal and specific in describing the savings his institution expects the technology to bring to the chain of players involved in each stage of global trade, from manufacturing to shipping to distribution.  He told attendees:  ""We expect to see a reduction of 70 percent to 80 percent in costs on supply chain management by using blockchain.""  By contrast, in other business lines, bankers have their heads down these days, trying to live up to the hyped promise of blockchain optimization, all while having to deal with the thorny business of integration with their legacy systems. But one refreshing aspect of a largely paper-based system like trade finance is that there's less in the way of creaking architecture.  ""Blockchain is good for areas that have resisted digitization,"" said Xavier Laurent, the head of blockchain community at the French financial institution Credit Agricole.  And the ultimate example of this may be trade finance.  The flip side is that in some parts of the world, the process may continue to resist digitization. Laurent said that while trade finance is global, some governments slow things down and are stuck in the paper trail.  ""We will have some jurisdictions where all transactions are going on the blockchain,"" Laurent said. ""But there are other geographic regions where the legal and regulatory risk means you will still use paper.""  Platforms and tokens  Still, underscoring the energy around this use case, Varma described, in general terms, a new, fully automated trade platform Citi is building, which he said would combine blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT).  The AI will drive trigger points in the system (i.e. the conditions that have to be met before a payment is made), Varma said, adding that an AI-enhanced platform could go as far as issuing a contract. In addition, IoT sensors could be used to do verifications normally done by humans.  ""Shipments monitored using IoT devices can give everyone on the blockchain an idea of where the shipment is,"" he said, adding:  ""We are moving towards real time, to a point where the blockchain platform will trigger a payment when goods are received.""  However, Varma kept other details close to the vest. He did not say how close the platform was to being completed, much less tested or put into use, and when asked by CoinDesk he would not even give the project's name.  Others talked about the possibilities for tokenization – one aspect of blockchain that enterprises have only recently begun to embrace – in trade finance.  Laurent said using tokens to represent assets on a blockchain could free up liquidity, giving the example of invoices, ""which are not very liquid assets, so this could make them more liquid and distribute them better.""  Taking the tokenization of trade finance to its logical conclusion, Lee Pruitt, the CEO of ethereum-based startup InstaSupply, said the whole process can be opened up so that banks are no longer required to loan money against invoices.  ""An approved invoice is an asset from an accounting standpoint. A token means anyone, not just banks, can participate in the purchase of this asset,"" Pruitt said.  Pain points  Stepping back, trade finance is big business, worth some $9 trillion worldwide, according to a recent report by the International Chamber of Commerce.  Yet bankers see room for improvement, which helps explain their search for efficiencies through digitization via blockchain. For example, Sean Edwards, the head of legal at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, posited that there is an additional $1.5 trillion of potential trade finance business that isn't being done, in places like Africa and parts of Asia.  Edwards, who is also chairman of the International Trade Finance Association (ITFA), said one the things that's needed to get those places on board is an efficient know-your-customer (KYC) system to onboard what he called ""long tail suppliers,"" those most in need of finance.  ""Trade finance is event-driven, punctuated with invoices, purchase orders etc. What you find is the pre-shipment stages are very poorly served; banks are bad at providing finance to early-stage small suppliers,"" he said.  The ITFA's focus has been on clearing certain pain points, including assisting the work that IBM is doing with shipping giant Maersk to digitize bills of lading.  ""It's a document of title,"" said Edwards, ""so understanding the process, it helps to be a lawyer.""  Edwards has also been working closely with Marco Polo, the trade finance network built by R3 and TradeIX, which includes the likes of BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, ING and Standard Chartered Bank.  ""Things like promissory notes are very easily digitized,"" said Edwards, adding:  ""R3 wrote a program to do this in an afternoon.""

42380965,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xb7,1530590405,Tether on Strings? Crypto Debates Fresh Round of Manipulation Claims,"As they say, shots were fired.  An investigative article raising concerns about possible market manipulation of tether has sparked a social media firestorm, with the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency's detractors, supporters and seemingly everyone in between weighing in.  In an incendiary take on an already controversial topic, Bloomberg analyzed tether trading data from the Kraken crypto exchange and found several ""red flags,"" as the headline described them.  Complete with colorful annotated charts and interactive data visualizations, the article published Friday sought to characterize the market for tethers, also known as USDT, as defying the laws of supply and demand, going so far as to say it is suggestive of wash trading – a maneuver ""in which cheaters trade with themselves to create a false impression of market demand.""  Some hailed the data analysis, which pulled from more than 56,000 trades on Kraken over a period of eight weeks, as a ""deep dive into suspicious trading patterns,"" and a prime illustration of ""why institutional money is staying out of the market.""  Release the Kraken  But then Bloomberg, for better or for worse, became part of the story.  On Sunday, Kraken published a characteristically combative blog post rebutting the analysis by the four Bloomberg reporters who contributed to the article.  The post, whose very title (""On Tether: Journalists Defy Logic, Raising Red Flags"") was a dig at Bloomberg's headline, went so far as to suggest that the authors of the piece lacked subject matter expertise, saying:  ""It's scary to think that our lawmakers are reading this stuff. The title sure was sensational, and it undoubtedly grabbed eyeballs but what of the readers who are not following the outrage on Reddit and Twitter? What of those who rely on the journalistic integrity and expertise of their news sources?""  Others appeared to agree, with varying degrees of tact.  But the pushback was not limited to ad hominems. Specifically addressing the article's contention that heightened demand for USDT on Kraken should have temporarily driven the coin's price up to $1.10, one Reddit user argued that arbitrage opportunities keep the price close to $1, writing:  ""Of course we're not seeing that as Kraken USDTUSD divergence from $1 is equal to Bitfinex cryptoUSD premium or discount. A 1.1 dollar USDT would mean a ~10% discount on Finex. It shouldn't be that hard to comprehend.""  Still, longtime critics of tether remained unconvinced by such arguments.        Common ground    Despite the intense debate, there is actually one thing tether's defenders and doubters seem to agree on: not all trades in this crypto asset are done out of a human-driven profit incentive.  If you accept the premise that certain amounts of tether are purposefully injected into the markets and alternatively bought from the markets by ""bots"" with the sole intention of maintaining parity with the dollar, the oddly specific order sizes and their frequency as depicted in the data by Bloomberg start to make sense.  As another commentator on Reddit explained,  ""As long as there are an active party doing market intervention to maintain the peg i am sure you will see some strange action in the order book... Tether is actively managing this on all exchanges that have the USDTUSD cross. If they did not provide 'unlimited' liquidity on both buy and sellside the peg would break.""  In other words, the odd patterns reported by Bloomberg may suggest actions by Tether, the company behind USDT, to issue coins when the value is high and buy it up when the value is low, in order to maintain its value at $1.  But if so, this points to another, longstanding controversy around Tether: the potential for the company at some point in time to issue more currency than it actually has the reserves to back, which some are quite adamant is already the case.  Nevertheless, whether you agree with such interpretations or not, it's worth noting the basic principles of economics that ring true through this entire discussion.  The same concepts of supply and demand that informed the Bloomberg article were used in turn by Kraken to argue they promote stability in tether prices. They can also be used to point out the inherent vulnerabilities in a fixed pegged currency, crypto or not.  It's elementary, my dear Watson.

42380946,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92xFj,1530583209,Voorhees vs Schiff: Bull Meets Bear at NY Bitcoin Debate,"A debate between an infamous bitcoin detractor and one of the cryptocurrency's most well-known entrepreneurs made sparks fly in New York City Monday.  Hosted by the Soho Forum, a monthly Manhattan debate series, the event saw Erik Voorhees, the CEO of exchange service ShapeShift, argue that government-backed monies will eventually be replaced by bitcoin and blockchain innovations. The world's largest cryptocurrency, he said, just needs gradual adoption to eventually triumph.  However, the debate was far from a one-sided showcase. There to represent the opposition, Peter Schiff provided more than a healthy dose of skepticism. Perhaps most damningly, he argued people are not currently buying into bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to use them; they're here to get rich, he said.  The economist said that bitcoin is primarily seen as a speculative asset. Moreover, even people who do plan to use bitcoin cannot do so easily.  Bitcoin is not, at present, a reliable store of value, he continued. Schiff pointed out that the price of a bitcoin can change hour-to-hour, which makes it difficult for people to price goods or negotiate contracts using the cryptocurrency.  ""The biggest problem with bitcoin and why it can never be used as money is because [currency] has to be a reliable store of value, not just a medium of exchange,"" he said.  Voorhees did not see market fluctuations as an issue.  He told the crowd:  ""I remember when it was a big deal when bitcoin moved 50 percent. Today, it's a big deal when it moves 10 percent. I think in a few years it'll be a big deal when it moves 2-3 percent. While bitcoin is volatile today, I think this problem is self-correcting.""  Still, the event did see both provocateurs find common ground. Schiff, for example, doesn't believe in fiat currency.  ""The fiat system that we have now is not going to work,"" but ""replacing fiat currency with digital currency is not an improvement,"" he said.  Gold or currency?  Another subject discussed was whether bitcoin can become a store of value to rival precious metals.  Touching on a familiar topic, Schiff trotted out the argument that gold's long tenure in the market will make it hard to replace. Further, he argued it's already surpassed its competition over the centuries.  ""What are the odds that bitcoin's the best cryptocurrency that's ever going to be invented? … Nobody's come up with a better gold,"" Schiff remarked.  Here, Voorhees seemed to concede a bit to the argument, if on different grounds. Notably, he noted that the asset would likely be more susceptible to government bans than its more established competitor.  ""Well, the government can absolutely outlaw bitcoin. More easily [than it would be to ban gold],"" Voorhees said.  Elsewhere, Voorhees also conceded that bitcoin might not succeed in meeting all of the four classic functions of money.  In response to Schiff's argument that the ""crypto bubble will pop before the fiat bubble,"" Voorhees acknowledged that consumers will likely ultimately play a role in deciding what kind of currency they want to exchange with, and whether it will be with cryptocurrency.  ""The biggest obstacle to adoption is most individuals want governments to manage money for them. Until that changes, bitcoin will play second fiddle.""  No use?  But Voorhees did more than simply concede ground to Schiff.  In response to Schiff's argument that the market is solely propelled by speculation, Voorhees noted that bitcoin can be used in cross-border transactions, is censorship-resistant and has a limited supply.  People transacting in bitcoin are also free of many of the restrictions seen in traditional financial institutions, including the fact that people cannot send wire transfers outside a bank's business hours.  And an informal poll of the audience suggests this market may have won a few converts.  Soho Forum took a poll of audience sentiment before and after the debate, asking the audience if they thought bitcoin had a chance to beat government.  Notably, the yay votes rose from 40 to 55%, while the nay votes fell from 40 to 31%  Peter Schiff, Erik Voorhees and Gene Epstein image by Nikhilesh De for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/07/03/voorhees-vs-schiff-bull-meets-bear-at-ny-bitcoin-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33bab5a1fa318eb6486aca568d3012ae517dfcae-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
