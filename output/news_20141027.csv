42377727,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NDJ,1414448128,"FinCEN Rules Bitcoin Payment Processors, Exchanges are Money Transmitters","The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has released new guidance for custodial bitcoin exchanges and payment processors, ruling that such companies may be considered money services businesses under US law.  In a response to twin letters submitted in late 2013, the chief US money laundering and terrorist financing regulator explained that bitcoin exchanges may be money transmitters, even if they only match buyers and sellers on their platform. Further, the letters suggest this is true, even if the exchanges behave more like traditional securities or commodities exchanges, where no money is transferred between the company and any counterparty.  While the first of today's issuances may have been expected by those following the space, the more surprising update is perhaps that such guidance could apply to bitcoin processors as well as exchanges.  The finding is notable as big companies in the sector like BitPay have indicated in the past that their services are exempt from FinCEN's guidance as they facilitate purchases between consumers and merchants, only accepting and transmitting funds as necessary to the sale.  However, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman attorney Marco Santori told CoinDesk that FinCEN's latest guidance implies that the exemption only applies in instances where both sides of the transaction are Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulated institutions, as is the case in credit card processors, which transfer funds between customer and merchant banks.  Santori explained:  ""What most payment processors do today is just accept peoples bitcoin, from wherever those bitcoins may be, possibly their own wallet software [...] and accept those coins and send them on to the merchant using whatever software they might be running. What this is saying is that if you're a merchant payment processor and you're doing that you're not exempt from the rules, in fact, you're a money services business.""  Worrying development  Andrew Ittleman, an attorney at Fuerst Ittleman David & Joseph, PL, further stressed the implications of the rulings, suggesting that they perhaps are a troubling sign for how the industry could be treated by the agency as a whole.  ""Based on my reading of these documents, I'm not sure if there's a limit to the breadth of [the MSB] definition,"" he said. ""It seems to me that, according to FinCEN, any company that's dealing with bitcoin is a money transmitter, and I don't know if I could have said that before before I read the payment processor note.""  In the two letters, FinCEN policy division associate director Jamal El-Hindi outlines the government's arguments for why the unnamed businesses in question fall under the money transmitter definition. As a result, companies in the US that facilitate such bitcoin transactions may be required to adhere to additional reporting and compliance standards.  FinCEN told CoinDesk that the ruling is meant to be an official opinion to the companies in question, however, and that it may not apply more broadly.  ""We encourage businesses to ask us directly if they are uncertain about their status as money transmitters, and to determine if they need to register with FinCEN,"" a spokesperson said. ""Depending on the specific facts and circumstances described to us, we offer an official opinion. These rulings are not meant to signal trends or to be interpreted as some broad pronouncement for the industry.""  CoinDesk has reached out members of the industry's bitcoin processing services sector for further comment.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42377729,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NEZ,1414431638,UK High Court Orders Moolah to Hand Over Syscoin's 750 BTC,"Moopay LTD and ex-CEO Alex Green have been ordered by a UK court to hand over 750 BTC to the team that developed the syscoin cryptocurrency.  The final injunction, issued by the High Court in London, was granted in response to a request from UK-based law firm Selachii LLP on behalf of syscoin.  Moopay, known commonly as Moolah, and Green had been holding the money for the developers and have now been ordered to repay the 750 BTC before 16:00 (GMT) tomorrow.  The move follows an emergency injunction granted on Friday by the High Court. At the time, the team's legal counsel advised the court that bitcoins owed to their clients were beginning to be moved.  Selachii announced the final injunction on Twitter, issuing an advisory to Moolah’s Twitter account following several unsuccessful attempts to make contact.    @moolah_io Final Injunction granted today served by email and at your home address. Please seek immediate legal advice.      — Selachii LLP (@Selachii_LLP) October 27, 2014      Message to 'bad actors'  CoinDesk spoke with syscoin manager and developer Dan Wasyluk, who said that the process of reclaiming the held funds won’t happen overnight. The team are happy with the result of today’s hearing and looking forward to the next stage in their legal fight, he said, adding:  “Hopefully with this injunction 'bad actors' who think that simply because ‘this is crypto’ that they will not be held legally accountable for their actions will now think twice.”  So far, Wasyluk said, neither Green or his legal representation have responded to messages or court documents. However, he expressed hope that the injunction will have a significant impact on the future of the case and the developers' ability to access the remainder of funds raised during an initial coin offering held in July.  “With this last injunction, it is very clear cut,” he said.  The legal fight over the ICO funds began amid a funding crisis at Moolah and the subsequent resignation of Green. That incident sparked a public uproar and has since left the firm's investors and users of its MintPal digital currency exchange facing losses.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/27/uk-high-court-orders-moolah-to-hand-over-syscoins-750-btc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c54bf644dec9210bbe26574de285f82261c7471-2560x1700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377722,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73N9X,1414422654,"Gallery: 'Eye of God' Painting Sells for €10,000 in Bitcoin","A painting depicting bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto sold for 35 BTC (roughly €10,000) at the most recent Inside Bitcoins Conference and Expo in Israel.  Called 'The Eye of God', the work was created by local artist Xania Dorfman and bought by Yoshi Goto, a mining expert employed by bitcoin ASIC developer Bitmain. Goto got his first glimpse of the work when setting up his booth at the two-day conference, which ran from 19th to 20th October and included speakers such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and bitcoin developer Peter Todd.  ""It was there, and it was tempting,"" Goto said. ""I was thinking if I don't purchase the picture, I wouldn't have a right to make a copy or distribute it. I thought, maybe I was crazy, but I wanted to find a way to use it.""  Goto has not decided where he will house the painting itself, saying that it could find a home at the company's Denver office. However, he stressed that he wants to find a way for the painting to become a community resource.  ""I was thinking that the drawing might be good promotional material for bitcoin, because right now, when you say bitcoin, the only thing is the orange bitcoin sign,"" Goto said.  Goto added that he has been in talks with local Israeli bitcoin groups to determine whether it could be used in some way by the community.  See images of the artwork below:  Inspiration strikes  Speaking to CoinDesk, Dorfman said that she was not familiar with the technology prior to accepting the assignment, a project for the conference organized by Israel-based mining hardware specialist Hashware.  While she remains a bitcoin skeptic even after learning more, Dorfman said that she was at least inspired by the provocative story of the digital currency's still-anonymous creator. In particular, she said she enjoyed the challenge of attempting to visualize bitcoin due to its virtual and digital nature.  ""Right away, I saw this image of the Earth in my mind, because I realize that it is something that has the power to take over, you know? I saw the mask also because of the anonymity and because it was something mysterious,"" Dorfman recalled.  Dorfman said that with the images of the Earth and the mask in place, she next turned her attention to finding the right way to visualize Nakamoto.  Eventually, she decided to depict the creator as a godlike figure, putting an emphasis on the photo-realistic eyes, one of her artistic specialties.  ""He's the biggest figure there, you see the Earth and he's above all that,"" she added.  A second career  For Dorfman, the painting also represents the first step down what she hopes is a path that could jumpstart her art career.  Dorfman received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Israel's Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in 2011, but has since gone back to school to study nutritional science after struggling to find work in the art world. Still, she was encouraged by the sale, as she was not optimistic it would find a buyer.  The money she earned from the painting, she said, will be used for her school expenses. However, she said it had a much larger impact on her.  ""I'm very flattered that someone was ready to pay so much for my art,"" Dorfman said. ""Nothing like this has ever happened to me.""  Still, she has been emboldened by the sale. Dorfman reported that Inside Bitcoins has invited her to produce a new work for its next showing in Paris, France, and that she has accepted, even going so far as to suggest that the event could have an influence on her career path.  Dorfman ended the interview optimistically, adding:  ""I'm not a full-time artist, but maybe I will be now.""  More of Dorfman's work can be found on Facebook and her personal website.

42377739,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NR9,1414420096,Markets Weekly: Bitcoin Price Resilience Crumbles,"Bitcoin price resilience finally crumbled this week after two weeks of strength following the so-called 'BearWhale' slaying.  The price opened the week at $386, holding steady until mid-week, when it began a steep decline. It closed at $346, shedding $40 over the last seven days.  The bitcoin price deterioration follows a strong rally from $295 on 6th October to a high of $405 about a week later. Trading held steady until this week's drop, even as the wider financial markets tumbled in mid-October.  Swaps activity spikes  A look at the swaps activity on Bitfinex reveals more bearish indicators. The sum of active BTC swaps began to rise sharply on 25th October suggesting that traders are betting that the bitcoin price will fall further.  A BTC swap takes place when traders borrow bitcoin at one price to trade it for US dollars, hoping the price will fall by the time they purchase bitcoin again to return it to the lender. Total BTC swaps on Bitfinex nearly doubled from 8,799 BTC on 25th October to 16,281 BTC the next day.  Examining the swap data in greater detail also suggests that shorts profited from the mid-week price drop. Bitcoin swaps spiked as the price tumbled on the morning of 23rd October, potentially driving the price down.  As the week ended, total active swaps stood at over 18,000 BTC, the highest level since April 2013, according to Bitfinex data. Swap volume also depends on the amount of customers using a particular exchange, of course, and Bitfinex's trading volume and user base has only become significant since last October, according to Bitcoinity volume data.  Trading volumes shrink  Overall trading volumes on the major exchanges have plummeted this week. About 1.9m coins changed hands on the exchanges this week, compared to 2.5m last week. That's a drop of more than 26% over seven days.  All the big exchanges showed big double-digit drops in trading volume, with ANXBTC leading the way with a 40% decline in traded volume over the week.  News and fundamentals  New York State's 'BitLicense' closed to comments early in the week, with bitcoin economy heavyweights Circle and BitPay submitting their responses to the proposed regulations. Circle took a hardline on the regulations, saying that it would have no choice but to leave New York if the regulations took effect in their current form.  This follows New York financial regulator chief Ben Lawsky's comments two weeks ago that the BitLicense would not apply to software developers and those ""innovating and developing"" the latest platforms for digital currencies.  In the United Kingdom, a major high-street retailer announced that it would adopt bitcoin in a big way. CeX, which sells technology products, said it would initially accept bitcoin payments in 30 of its 266 UK stores on 22nd October.  The UK-based company also said it would introduce Lamassu ATMs in its stores that would allow customers to buy bitcoin without being charged a fee. CeX already takes bitcoin for sales made through its website. The retailer further said it could introduce bitcoin payments at its international stores across Europe, Australia and in India.  The macro picture has largely kept digital currencies out of the frame this week. European banks have been subjected to ""stress tests"" to prove their financial health, although Bloomberg View said they are not enough to ""dispel the fear"" over the region's banking system and wider economy.  Brazil, meanwhile, has re-elected Dilma Rousseff on a platform of reform and rooting out corruption, after a tightly contested election. Bitcoin adoption has huge potential in Brazil, as it does in Latin America in general, although digital currency adoption remains nascent there.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/27/markets-weekly-bitcoin-price-resilience-crumbles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e96da37c86f3f64de8732e67c9ded57f4df4d67-757x391.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377738,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NPt,1414414972,CoinDesk BPI Spike Caused By LakeBTC Price Ticker Error,"UPDATE (29th October, 09:38 GMT): LakeBTC has confirmed it has patched its system to stop this problem from happening again.  UPDATE (28th October, 10:00 GMT): Information about a second data error lasting seven minutes on 27th October was added.      The CoinDesk BPI spiked this weekend due to an error in the data reported by the LakeBTC exchange.  From 09:18 UTC to 12:24 UTC on 26th October, LakeBTC's price ticker reported a bid value of $1,000. Immediately prior to this, the value was $351.34.  ""We thought it was the trades but the trade history looked fine. Product support reviewed all the logs and cache for that time period and found it was a rare data caching issue,"" said a spokesperson from LakeBTC.  LakeBTC said the ticker was showing the wrong numbers and that the order book and trading history were not affected. It said it is working on a patch to prevent this from happening again.  CoinDesk has recalculated the BPI's price between 09:18 and 12:24 to exclude data from LakeBTC. The OHLC chart, however, still reflects LakeBTC's erroneous data.  CoinDesk has contacted LakeBTC about obtaining the data for the affected period, but the exchange has said that its historical bid data is ""not available"". As a result, we have taken the step of using the last accurate bid across the affected time period in the OHLC chart. The price chart continues to exclude LakeBTC data over the affected period.  A second data error of the same nature took place on 27th October between 19:23 and 19:30 UTC. LakeBTC showed a bid value of $1,000 for that period. We have taken the same steps as above to rectify the data on our OHLC chart, taking the last accurate bid value across the affected time period.

42377734,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NNN,1414411865,Poland’s InPay Lets Crowdfunders Buy Equity With Bitcoin,"Poland-based bitcoin payment solutions provider InPay S.A. has launched an equity crowdfunding campaign that makes it possible to buy company stock with bitcoin.  The company claims to have secured the approval of Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), the country’s equivalent of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which makes it a unique project in the Polish digital currency industry, according to company representatives.  The initiative was launched on Poland-based equity crowdfunding site Beesfund.com, where potential investors can acquire InPay stock with bitcoin, becoming shareholders in the company .  Paper stocks  In total, InPay is aiming to raise the equivalent of 200,000 zloty (around $60,000) from the public offering to finance its further development and expansion to other markets.  At press time, the firm had sold just over a quarter of the 5% of its stock made available in the scheme, priced at 40 zloty per share, and which has been purchased by over 100 investors so far. The offering is scheduled to be completed by November 16th.  InPay said in a statement that, unlike the reward-based crowdfunding model popularized by sites such as Kickstarter or RocketHub, equity crowdfunding enables potential investors interested in innovative business models to acquire stock in the firms.  Examples of such sites include EquityNet and Crowdcube. However, to date, none of these sites has enabled investors to purchase shares with the use of bitcoin, according to InPay.  Despite being paid for with bitcoin, InPay says that the stock will be printed on paper and sent by post to its new shareholders.  “For crowdfunding platforms, such as Beesfund, bitcoin seems to be the ideal engine for growth,” said Arkadiusz Regiec, Beesfund CEO. “It makes the whole purchase procedure much quicker and lowers transaction costs.”  Growing bitcoin market  InPay says it is the first bitcoin payment solution in Central Europe, providing services to retail outlets in a bid to remove “the obstacles facing the owners of brick-and-mortar and online stores who want to start accepting bitcoin”.  Poland is in the top 10 countries for the number of downloaded bitcoin clients, which makes it a promising market for digital currency payment operators. Data obtained by InPay shows that, in terms of active bitcoin node numbers, Poland ranks 12th and eighth at the global and European levels, respectively.  Additionally, there are more businesses accepting bitcoin in Warsaw than in a number of other major European cities, such as Munich, Brussels, Barcelona or Budapest, according to figures released by Coinmap.org.  “We use the bitcoin protocol to provide a quick and free flow of payments … for company owners, from buyer to seller,” said Lech Wilczyński, president of InPay.  Registered public offering  Wilczyński told CoinDesk that the latest venture by InPay is officially registered with the Polish financial authorities, and as such it is “completely different” from the unsuccessful attempt by bitcoin entrepreneur Eric Voorhees to launch a public offering of bitcoin securities without registering with the federal government.  According to the SEC, between 2012 and 2013, Voorhees solicited shares in two bitcoin-related ventures, SatoshiDICE and FeedZeBirds, triggering an investigation by the commission. In June 2014, the entrepreneur was banned from making such an offering for the next five years, and was forced to relinquish profits totaling $15,843.98, in addition to being imposed a penalty of $35,000.  Commenting on the affair, SEC Division of Enforcement director Andrew Ceresney said:  “All issuers selling securities to the public must comply with the registration provisions of the securities laws, including issuers who seek to raise funds using bitcoin.”  Vorhees reportedly raised more than 50,000 bitcoins from a number of investors. As a result, the SEC decided the entrepreneur had violated sections of the Securities Act of 1933. He was also accused of using online forums and social media platforms to solicit investors.  ""In our case, everything was approved by the KNF. It is a public offering with shares available for purchase outside of the stock market,"" Wilczyński said. ""We know there are multiple platforms for stateless equity, but in this case, users receive real registered shares of the companies they invest in.”  CoinDesk was given access to documents stamped by the KNF that back up Wilczyński's statement.  Bitcoin's status debated  Meanwhile, Polish authorities are still debating the stance the country should adopt on digital currencies. Earlier this year, Poland’s deputy finance minister Wojciech Kowalczyk released a document confirming that, under the country’s existing financial regulations, bitcoin can be considered a financial instrument.  The Finance Ministry stated:  ""Options or futures contracts which are based on [bitcoin] as a base instrument can be considered as derivative instruments, and as such, they can be considered as financial instruments, according to the bill on financial instruments.”  However, the notice also indicated that bitcoin is not an officially recognized currency in Poland.  Registered in June 2014, InPay S.A. is a limited company headquartered in Poland’s capital Warsaw. The firm was co-funded by Polish software developers Lech Wilczyński and Sławomir Więch.  Prior to the latest public offering, the site secured funds provided by local online entrepreneur Arkadiusz Osiak, the creator of one of Poland's leading financial news sites Money.pl.  Update (16:15, 27th October): This article was updated to confirm the fact that CoinDesk was given access to documentation regarding the KNF approval.
