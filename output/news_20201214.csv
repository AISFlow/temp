42385343,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAwKRh,1607982961,Google Down: The Perils of Centralization,"Google was down for only an hour, but Monday's outage served as a jarring reminder of how much modern existence online depends on the centralized search engine colossus.      From Gmail and Google Calendar to YouTube and even Google’s two-factor authentication, the outage temporarily ground online work to a halt for many, including publications that would have otherwise been reporting on the outage.      Moreover, it underscored the hidden costs of the easy-to-use systems that permeate the web, and just how taxing or debilitating they can be when the head of the many-tentacled beast that is Google nods off, even for just an hour.      “If an internet giant like Google can suffer such a major attack – denying millions of users access to basic internet services – it just goes to show that under the surface of the shiny web interfaces we see, internet infrastructure actually hangs in a delicate and vulnerable balance,” said Jaro Šatkevič, head of product at Mysterium Network, an open-source Web 3.0 project focused on decentralizing the internet.    Google down and out    According to a tweet from Google, the company suffered an “authentication system outage” that essentially rendered a wide variety of servers useless for about 45 minutes because the system was unable to confirm users were who they said they were.      It seemed to largely affect Europe and extended well beyond what people might normally associate with not being able to get into their email. On Android smartphones, for example, native apps like Google Maps ceased to work, and internet-connected devices through Google Home were seemingly also down.      Tal Be'ery, co-founder and security researcher at ZenGo, the cryptocurrency wallet company, said that, in theory, a decentralized solution that would have allowed users to authenticate their credentials with Google using other services might have solved that problem. Such solutions do exist; however, they were “probably not aligned with Google’s business model and therefore not implemented,” he continued.      Read more: How a Hacker Launched a Decentralized Network to Track Internet Censorship      The blackout shows just how much control and how far-reaching the effect of having a single point of failure in a centralized system can be. Services and features critical to daily life were suddenly gone, with users having no idea, and much less control over, when they might be back.      “Google infrastructure is distributed, with servers across all continents. But these depend on each other and are controlled centrally,” said Šatkevič. “They are upgraded centrally. They talk to each other – not just by using the same protocol, but through a shared software that is operated by the same employees (centrally).”    Limits of centralization    While the Google outage appears to be due to internal technical issues, the news comes on the heels of one of the more sophisticated cyber attacks the U.S. government has seen in years, with allegedly nation state-directed hackers infiltrating the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments through a standard remote update by SolarWinds that injected malicious code into a variety of systems.      SolarWinds, which develops software to manage networks, has hundreds of customers including Fortune 500 companies and other government agencies. These include the Secret Service, the U.S. Defense Department, the Federal Reserve, Lockheed Martin and the National Security Agency.      The update allowed the hackers to then access internal emails at various agencies via Microsoft Office 365. It’s unclear what else they were able to do or access.      In a rare move, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security issued Emergency Directive 21-01, which “calls on all federal civilian agencies to review their networks for indicators of compromise and disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products immediately.”      These single points of entry, automatic updates controlled by a central actor and the swath of disruption they can enable are part and parcel of Web 2.0, which relies largely on central actors to maintain systems, control access to them and ensure they run smoothly. But that has siloed power in the hands of a few massive, centralized companies such as Google, internet service providers and others.    Pushing back on power    While there is some early pushback, including antitrust cases being brought against Google and Facebook in the U.S., there have also been extensive lobbying efforts on behalf of those behemoths to maintain their power in places like the European Union.      “My personal opinion is these companies are just old-fashioned monopolies,” said Canadian-British tech blogger and science fiction writer Cory Doctorow when I spoke with him earlier this year. “Their growth is not because of the magical properties of data or network effects or whatever. It’s just because they bought all their competitors, which is a thing that used to be illegal and is now legal.”      Read more: Cory Doctorow: The Monopoly Web Is Already Here      Decentralized architecture prevents this form of centralized control by design, making sure no one person can make a call, decision or update (or mistake) that might affect millions or even billions of people. CoinDesk has reported on the implications of this that play out in the public discourse, such as the debate over content moderation on social media, which some see as corporate censorship.      But in the case of Google, such centralized constructions of data and power show the long shadow these companies cast over seemingly mundane and increasingly critical parts of our lives.      Be'ery said at ZenGo they are not ""religious"" about decentralization; rather, he believes a hybrid model, smartly combining the robustness and security of decentralization and the simplicity often associated with centralized services, is the best solution for customers in many cases.      What’s next is continuing a debate to decide whether that remains the case.      “Explaining the advantages in decentralization to end users is usually harder as these advantages of greater stability and robustness do not manifest themselves on a daily basis,” said Be'ery. “Only in time of failures, such as the one experienced by Google users today, are the merits of decentralization highlighted.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/14/google-down-the-perils-of-centralization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/752893968bf4ef64afcea166ae6fc0602548c1e5-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Looking at ether’s price as a percentage of spot BTC, it may be undervalued.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $19,196 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.35% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $18,990-$19,323 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC near its 10-hour moving average but above the 50-hour on the hourly chart, a flat-to-bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin reversed course over the weekend from a downward slide, with an upward trend that began on Saturday.      “This weekend, bitcoin demonstrated a V-shaped reversal. After the appearance of such a figure, the growth usually continues,” said Constantin Kogan, a partner at investment firm Wave Financial.      Over the past 24 hours, the price hit a high of $19,323, according to CoinDesk 20 data, before settling around $19,196 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Still on Track to Breach $20K in Coming Weeks: Analysts      “Quite a strong move over the weekend,” noted Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “I wouldn’t expect a continuation of 3%-4% a day. We’ll likely test the highs again in the next few days and will be met with a lot more sell orders [from] short- to medium-term whales and institutional traders.”      After a higher-than-expected amount of volume over the weekend, including over $865 million in spot exchange volume Sunday for the eight exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20, Monday’s tally is looking lower, at $569 million as of press time.      “We still see the market challenging the all-time high but there is not a lot of conviction behind it. This can be seen in the lower volumes,” said Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange Bitflyer USA. “December normally has lower volumes due to holidays and vacation among Western institutional clients.”      Read More: MassMutual’s Bitcoin Buy May Presage $600B Institutional Flood: JPMorgan      Fewer liquidations in the derivatives market is also helping bitcoin stay steadier. Stalwart futures platform BitMEX, for example, has seen liquidations, the platform’s equivalent of a margin call, dry up in the midst of its regulatory issues. The exchange’s influence in 2020 was previously obvious given the massive amount of sell liquidations that occurred in March when all markets crashed on macroeconomic issues related to the coronavirus.      Since then, however, the BitMEX effect has waned. Bitcoin’s volatility has also flattened out of late, with the 30-day volatility as calculated by CoinDesk Research at 57%, close to where it started 2020 when it was at 53% Jan. 1.      “There may be a few more attempts at the highs before the sellers disappear but, importantly, there is enough new volume on the buy side to keep us up around these levels and eventually buy all the sellers offers around $20,000,” added Swissquote’s Thomas.      While bitcoin is up 166% so far this year, it’s ether that is going gangbusters in 2020, up over 346%.      Cryptocurrency veterans like Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter trader, expect occasional peaks and troughs while remaining steadfastly mega-bullish. “Correction of course,"" he said, ""on the way upwards on rocket fuel!”    Ether at 3% of bitcoin’s price    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday, trading around $586 and climbing 0.14% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Mergers Position Yearn Finance as the Amazon of DeFi      Ether’s price as a percentage of the spot value of bitcoin is hovering around 3% according to data aggregator Skew. This is after the native asset of the Ethereum network started the year at below 2% of the price per 1 BTC and going as high as 4% on Sept. 1 during the fervent period of popularity for decentralized finance, or DeFi, in 2020.      John Willock, chief executive officer of Tritum, a diversified crypto services provider, is highly bullish on ether. He expects more institutional participation on the Ethereum network in 2021 and noted the increase in address activity in 2020.      “In the next six months, I think the most interesting metrics to follow will be large accumulations in addresses that can be attributed to institutional buyers soaking up supply, and proving long-term upward price expectations from educated participants,” Willock told CoinDesk. ”Things like [nonfungible tokens], DeFi and various other integrations this year that have utilized Ethereum as a layer but obfuscated it from users.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Monday, mostly red.

Per her grant proposal, the UX Designer will use the funding to research Bitcoin user experience, specifically why people use Bitcoin and what hurdles may obstruct their use.

""I'm thankful to Square Crypto and its team for granting me this opportunity. ""      Estevão has been working on Bitcoin-related design since 2016. One of her more recent and impactful projects is an in-depth paper she published for Lightning Network design in November 2019.      Once concluded, her research will find its way into the Bitcoin Design Guide, an open-source, community project that includes UX/UI design notes for developers, businesses or anyone building on Bitcoin.    Square Crypto and Bitcoin development    The grant is the latest in a deluge of funding that Square Crypto, the Bitcoin-focused arm of Jack Dorsey’s Square, has poured into Bitcoin development over the past year.

That's what Yearn Finance is rapidly becoming as a result of acquisitions and partnerships, CoinDesk's Brady Dale suggests in a big-picture analysis this morning. If Bezos' behemoth has become synonymous in consumers' minds with low prices, wide delivery and ample selection, Cronje's creation could achieve similar status among the ""degens"" of decentralized finance by delivering low fees, high yields and a wide selection of risk profiles. Hmm, a financial supermarket. Where have we heard that one before?      Nexus Mutual CEO hacked But not Nexus itself. The DeFi insurer's chief, Hugh Karp, is out $8M worth of its NXM tokens thanks to a wily attacker. Karp is being gracious about it, though. ""If you return the NXM in full, we will drop all investigations and I will grant you a $300K bounty,"" he told his unknown assailant on Twitter.      Mind the gap Crypto exchanges have been heavily advertising on the London Underground, cheaper than usual due to the economic fallout from coronavirus. London is about to go into its strictest tier of lockdown, though, which would presumably reduce ridership and hence eyeballs on the ads.

(Decrypt) If the name isn't familiar, his mom wrote ""Listen, the Snow Is Falling."" And his father, John, wrote a few tunes, too.  Market intel    Exuberant Bitcoin is still on track to hit a new high of $20,000 in the coming weeks, several analysts told CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole. MicroStrategy borrowing $650 million to buy more of the digital gold is one factor that drove the price up over the weekend. But leveraged bets are a risky strategy, for pros only, and even Vitalik is warning; don't try this at home, kids.    At stake    The U.S. government is fanatical about collecting data. Securing it? Not so much.      Over the weekend, it emerged that several U.S. federal agencies and potentially thousands of international corporations have likely had their communications networks compromised, in what appears to be the most sophisticated act of espionage in the past decade.      Reports indicate that malicious actors, likely backed by the Russian state, have hacked their way to troves of sensitive information at the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments. A routine code update introduced spyware onto a key piece of management software developed by SolarWinds. Not much has been publicly confirmed, though it appears these hackers have had free access to much of the Treasury and Commerce departments' email systems dating back to the spring of this year.      Yet, the damage could be far more widespread: SolarWinds also counts the Secret Service, the Defense Department, the Federal Reserve, Lockheed Martin and the National Security Agency, among its customers.      The attack serves as the latest reminder of the amount of personal, professional and publicly sensitive information that transverses the internet and is held in sometimes insecure databases. Over the past several decades, government and corporate agencies have amassed vast quantities of data – on both companies and individuals – all potentially subject to exploitation. Knowing what types of data, how it's stored, how long it's kept by government or corporate institutions is often the exception. Far more frequently, these information stores are black boxes.      Last week, CoinDesk's privacy reporter Ben Powers detailed how the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department responsible for snooping out and eliminating crime in financial systems, maintains a database of detailed personal and business information.      In its mission to acquire and disseminate data related to crime, FinCEN has a window into the world of the global economy. This includes information related to suspicious activity reports (SARs), a form of documentation that came into the public light after publication of the FinCEN Files. SARs are filed by banks, and other financial institutions, to alert federal watchdogs of sketchy behavior, but in themselves are not confirmations of any wrongdoing.      Powers' report focused on the fact that much of this data may never be deleted and is hackable, just like any online system.      ""I don't think data retention is seriously thought about at the government level,"" Michael Yaeger, a shareholder at the law firm of Carlton Fields, told Powers. ""They specify how long they retain it at the bank level, but the government doesn't. It's not in the habit of destroying data.""      On the contrary, like 1970s disco diva Andrea True, Uncle Sam wants ""more, more, more.""      In a memo late last week, FinCEN clarified there is no limit on ""the sharing of personally identifiable information"" between private financial institutions, like banks or cryptocurrency exchanges, under the 2001 Patriot Act's safe-harbor provisions. In fact, the U.S. agency is encouraging these institutions to share information, while lowering the bar to what may be deemed pertinent.      ""Overall, the sheet seemingly lowers the obstacles for further sharing of personal customer information among banks, the threshold of what qualifies as ""suspicious"" activity and whether the entities sharing customer information even need to be financial institutions,"" Powers wrote in a second article, co-authored by CoinDesk's regulatory maven Nikhilesh De and Executive Editor Marc Hochstein.      To be sure, this is all in the service of catching bona fide bad guys. But the first paragraph of Powers' first piece is a salient warning, particularly in light of the subsequent SolarWinds revelations: ""If a despotic government's bank transactions can be leaked, so can yours.""

Kolomoyskyy, one of the most influential people in Ukraine with net worth of $1.1 billion, is the former owner of PrivatBank, a major privately owned bank in the country. He was also governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region until 2015.      His Calvert City, Ky.-based CC Metals & Alloys steel plant has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic, and corruption allegations against Kolomoisky were filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. The facility closed and let staff go this summer, but ""every few months, it re-ignited the furnaces and urged the workers to return,"" Radio Liberty reported Monday.      The only activity continuing at the plant is the production of bitcoin, employees told the multimedia broadcaster. The sources said one of the warehouses is filled with mining equipment, though it's not clear how many devices are on site and of what type or brand.      Kolomoisky and his partner Gennady Bogolyubov bought the plant plant in 2011 for $188 million as a part of a plan to build their metal business in the U.S., which grew to seven plants across five states.      The holding firm, Optima Specialty Steel, filed for bankruptcy in 2016 and ownership of the plant passed to another firm, Georgian American Alloys, of which Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov are beneficiaries, according to a court document.      Further adding to their woes, the U.S. Department of Justice this year accused Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov of buying real estate and businesses in the U.S. for money misappropriated from PrivatBank from 2008 to 2016. The DOJ alleges the partners had ""obtained fraudulent loans and lines of credit"" from the bank before it was nationalized by the National Bank of Ukraine in 2016.

42385316,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAqNGT,1607959613,How the Incoming Administration Can Fix Crypto Regulation,"As 2020 comes to a close, it is a good time to review the regulatory landscape for crypto assets in the U.S. and provide suggestions to the Joe Biden administration that will be arriving in January 2021. Our advice would be to emphasize clarity, consistency and more collaboration across regulatory agencies.      The biggest impact on crypto policy in the U.S. during the next four years will come from federal agencies – and the regulators staffing them – that are responsible for overseeing our financial system. As with all administration transitions, key appointments to prominent roles in agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are expected to be made in the upcoming months. The CFTC’s head, Heath Tarbert, announced last week that he is leaving early next year, for instance.    Donna Redel is the former chairman of COMEX, a board member of New York Angels and an adjunct professor of law at Fordham Law School. Olta Andoni is an attorney at Zlatkin Wong, LLP and an adjunct professor of law at Chicago-Kent, College of Law.    Crypto’s speed of innovation continues to outpace regulatory adoption and/or adaption. Hence, flexible, principles-based regulation, such as the approach taken by the CFTC, would create less friction at the intersection of innovation and technology. Regulators walk a tightrope between balancing the need to protect retail inventors as well as the integrity of markets while simultaneously trying to foster innovation and business growth, especially for startups.      Let’s summarize where regulation stands right now.    Securities law clarity    We have not received substantial additional clarity from the SEC following its publication of its Framework for Digital Assets (April 2019) which has left many unanswered questions and raised new ones. For example, we are not clear on who or what is, or is not, an “Active Participant,” and how one applies the Howey Test to the decentralized protocols.      Many crypto lawyers have expressed concerns about the Howey Test prong of the “efforts of others” as applicable to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This prong refers to a purchaser’s reasonable expectations of profits. Specific concerns relate to the cash flows (“dividends”) from staking and the voting rights of governance tokens, both characteristics that enhance the likelihood of turning the token into a security. The latter has made venture capitalists (VC) more reluctant to fully utilize their voting rights.      See also: Redel and Andoni - A Safer Harbor: Improving Hester Peirce’s Proposal for Regulating Token Sales      While the SEC has made enforcement actions and issued at least three no-action letters, these have not provided insight into some of the most common project structures that are prominent today. For example, the results of both Telegram and Kik cases did not answer the big question of when a token would be considered a security.      Furthermore, cases involving PocketFul of Quarters and Vcoin offered only the narrowest pathway for a token to not be considered a security. Therefore, projects and their legal counsels have neither clarity nor consistency as to when a project would be considered “sufficiently” decentralized (or even whether Director William Hinman’s speech is to be considered good guidance).      The guidance provided by the SEC is especially hard to implement in an industry where projects have enormous variation in structure and design. Commissioner Hester Peirce proposed a Safe Harbor and engaged with many attorneys, including ourselves, on ways in which to modify their prior guidance and other regulations, including regulations related to capital formation (e.g. Reg A+), intermediaries like transfer agents and exchanges. These proposals may be subject to some critique. But we believe they should not be abandoned, as they provide a workable securities law framework and the basis for resolving uncertainty in the U.S.      Custody is a key issue for the continued development of digital assets for both institutional and retail investors. It remains unclear how existing custody rules are applicable to digital assets. The recent letter from Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and others to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton emphasized the need for the SEC and FINRA to issue further guidance regarding the custody of digital assets.      Turning to securities on the blockchain, the SEC and FINRA are making slow progress on approvals of Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) that are necessary to trade security tokens. Accelerating the adoption of ATS will encourage innovation of all types of securities on the blockchain and potentially move traditional securities to blockchain. This would enhance investor protection and potentially address critical governance and voting issues wherein the number of shares owned and the timing of the ownership are difficult to ascertain as we saw in both the Del Monte and Dell cases.    Given the complexity of the regulatory framework in the U.S., the incoming administration should have a unified strategic approach that is clear, consistent and collaborative.    Another prominent issue is the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are a type of investment funds and exchange products traded on stock exchanges. The industry hopes to put crypto-denominated ETFs on a similar trajectory to gold ETFs, which were first listed in 2003 and now have a market value of $132 billion.      As demonstrated by the demand for Grayscale offerings trading in the secondary markets, retail customers are seeking to invest in SEC-approved products. Additionally, improved liquidity and open interest on the CME, a CFTC regulated exchange, should help assuage the SEC’s concerns relating to pricing transparency. A key focus of the new administration should be to encourage renewed engagement by the SEC and CFTC with the industry and the institutional participants which will likely have a significant influence on the development of retail markets going forward. [Grayscale is a sister company to CoinDesk.]      It would be helpful if there was more transparency from the SEC’s informal guidance from many of the closed door meetings so that the industry could gain a greater insight and benefit.      We applaud the recent announcement that the FinTech Hub, led by Valerie A. Szczepanik, was advanced to a stand alone division reporting directly to the Chairman. This may further the SEC’s open-door policy of engaging in discussions with the community and projects.    Commodities law clarity    The CFTC uses principle-based regulation, in contrast to the SEC’s rule-based regulation. Hence, often the CFTC provides more clarity and flexibility.      It is clear the two main cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, are commodities, according to the CFTC. CFTC guidance to futures commission merchants on custodying crypto creates opportunities for new entrants, as well as established members of clearing houses, to engage in crypto, and enable exchanges to develop new listed products such as lending and swaps.      See also: Redel and Andoni - DeFi Is Just Like the ICO Boom and Regulators Are Circling      There was a misunderstanding by many marketplace participants regarding the timing of the implementation date of the final interpretive guidance about what constitutes “actual delivery” of virtual currencies. The interpretation was approved on March 24, 2020, but COVID-19 delayed both the listing in the Federal Register and the subsequent adoption by some exchanges. This caused some confusion regarding Coinbase’s short time fuse for the implementation of the rule, which contributed to a quick sell-off in crypto assets.      The joint action by the CFTC and Department of Justice (DOJ) against BitMEX to enforce regulations and particularly the Bank Secrecy Act raised the ante for exchanges. The chairman has been clear to emphasize that crypto exchanges are subject to all federal regulations while having stated the CFTC will “continue to do its part to encourage responsible fintech innovation through sound regulation.”    DeFi    The DeFi “experiment” has neither clarity nor consistency and little transparency in guidance and enforcement while continuing to raise red flags for multiple agencies. As Commissioner Hester Peirce stated during her recent talk at the LA Blockchain Summit, DeFi projects are posing a challenge to the SEC similar to the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of the 2017, while also presenting more difficult legal issues for the regulators to solve. It is ironic companies that pursue regulatory approval for products and markets are waiting endlessly for an unified direction and approval from the agencies while many DeFI projects proceed without regulatory clarity until some date in the future when another DAO-type report will be forthcoming.      Legal concerns in DeFi are focused on token launches, swaps, exploits or hacks of protocols, smart contract bugs, airdrops and the applicability of proxy rules. The regulatory agencies should be concerned about the potential of systemic risk from leverage in yield farming/lending. The SEC should review governance tokens when rights begin to mirror those in centralized finance (CeFi).      Cautious VCs are still reluctant to exercise their voting rights for fear it may lead to the determination the project is more centralized. We still do not have clarity as to what exactly are the measures to determine the moment(s) in time when a protocol is sufficiently decentralized and importantly when it might morph back to centralized. DeFi’s almost total lack of know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) in projects and exchanges also raises questions as to how blockchain technologies can remain integrated with the wider crypto space, which is facing more stringent global Financial Action Task Force (FATF) rules.    Treasury    The U.S. Treasury Dept. has a portfolio of agencies with crypto nexus that have been neither clear nor consistent. On one hand, we have the recent speculations about moves by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnunchin regarding restriction on hosted wallets; on the other hand, we have Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Acting Chairman Brian Brooks putting forth progressive rules for the banking sector and digital assets. The OCC interpretive letter stated that national banks and federal savings associations have the authority to provide custody services for customers with respect to cryptocurrency and other digital assets.      A clear and consistent policy regarding digital assets would inform the direction of regulation while also being supportive of innovation. An approach that is proactive with respect to new products/markets that want the imprimatur of being regulated under U.S. law would show global leadership and indicate an awareness of competition with other countries.      If the United States wants to be the foremost hub of cryptocurrency innovation it has to have regulation that balances the demands of adoption while considering U.S. values and foreign policy interests. Given the complexity of the regulatory framework in the U.S., the incoming administration should have a unified strategic approach that is clear, consistent and collaborative throughout the federal agencies.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,"Olta Andoni, Donna Redel",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/14/how-the-incoming-administration-can-fix-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ed4769bd3bacbd6a87b0e6b03b96b72a1d72e98-1347x902.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Band Protocol announced Monday it will help the project create a common API standard enabling blockchain applications to easily leverage APIs (application programming interfaces) and data.  An API is a software intermediary allowing applications to access data and, in effect, talk to each other.  Various industries are now recognizing the need to connect blockchain applications to common APIs, according to Band Protocol.  The potential benefits of the work are said to include new revenue streams for tech firms who can sell their data and price feeds to smart contracts, better data security (and thus less hacks), and creating decentralized apps that can interact with centralized technologies.  “Our mission is to define a common API standard for blockchain applications by collaborating with prestigious partners to bridge the gap between centralized data, APIs, and smart contracts on the blockchain,” said Soravis Srinawakoon, CEO of Band Protocol.

""There is an element of fatigue, with the market unable to drum up the momentum needed to spur us to new highs,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency firm Diginex, told clients in an email.      In traditional markets, European shares rose the U.K. and European Union agreed to extend talks over a Brexit-related trade deal. U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open as lawmakers in Washington continued negotiating a new stimulus stimulus package.    Market moves    For so many reasons, 2020 will go down in history books. For many of those same reasons, it could go down in economics textbooks.      This year saw the biggest drop-off in economic activity since the Great Depression, the biggest money-printing episode in the Federal Reserve's 107-year history, an epochal shift toward remote working, negative prices for crude-oil futures and the first real signs the global financial system might be migrating toward fast-growing markets for cryptocurrencies and digital assets.      Bitcoin was invented just 11 years ago as the first and original cryptocurrency, intended for use in an electronic peer-to-peer payment system that wouldn't be controlled by any person, business or government. At the start of the year, bitcoin was still considered a fringe investment, disparaged by the likes of the billionaire investor Warren Buffett as having ""no value.""      By the end of the year, bitcoin had pushed to the center of conversations among big investors and Wall Street firms – cast by proponents as a hedge against the potential currency debasement that might come from trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related stimulus money emanating from central banks and governments around the world. Others saw growing mainstream acceptance of the cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain network as validation of a landmark technology that might forever change finance.      Whatever the case, the bitcoin market in 2020 offered as good a prism as any through which to view the year's monumental economic developments – and the responses to the crisis from national authorities and monetary policymakers.      Over the course of the next several days, First Mover will provide a recap of how the bitcoin market evolved over the course of the year, with prices for the cryptocurrency nearly tripling, attracting bullish commentary from big traditional-finance players including JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock, AllianceBernstein, Morgan Stanley and Tudor Investment.      That story might really represent another way of recounting the broader narrative in which low interest rates and the dollar's reign as the global reserve currency allowed the U.S. government and its corporations to amass a heavy debt load in the years before the coronavirus hit. Once it did, the response was to invoke what one leading economist described as the ""war machine"" – the Federal Reserve financing U.S. government emergency-relief packages costing trillions of dollars.      Eventually, markets from stocks to bonds became hooked on the expectation that stimulus would be provided in amounts needed to keep investors from suffering losses deep enough to impair confidence and derail the economic recovery.      All the while China pushed forward with its plan to roll out a digital version of its yuan, raising the specter that a virtual currency from the world's second-biggest economy might eventually challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance in payments for global trade. In the U.S. and elsewhere, billions of dollars of venture capital and trader money flowed into an array of obscure digital tokens on blockchain-based, semi-autonomous trading and lending systems – collectively known as ""decentralized finance,"" or DeFi; the fast-paced growth suggested that digital-asset markets might represent a haven of innovation in an otherwise stagnant global banking system.      Whether due to causation or correlation or merely wishful thinking, the bitcoin market, long viewed as a hotbed of volatility and unfettered speculation, suddenly seemed to rise with nearly every new twist.      Coming Tuesday: Even before the coronavirus hit, bitcoin traders and mainstream economists alike were growing increasingly concerned about the slowing U.S. economy, rapid growth in corporate debt and whether the dollar faced growing threats to its global monetary hegemony.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin’s revived uptrend could soon lead to a much-anticipated breakout above the $20,000 mark.      “We have witnessed a large move up over the weekend, with MicroStrategy’s efforts to increase bitcoin holdings from several large players bringing with it fresh optimism,” Matthew Dibb, chief operations officer of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. “Our belief is that we will see a breach of $20,000 in the coming weeks.”      On Friday, business-intelligence firm MicroStrategy raised $650 million through a convertible senior note sale to fund bitcoin purchases; the deal was upsized from $550 million. Since then, the cryptocurrency has rallied by over $1,000 and was last seen trading near $19,100, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The cryptocurrency nearly doubled from $10,000 to a new record high of $19,920 in the 12 weeks to Dec. 1, before falling to $17,700 last week amid a bout of profit taking. Pullbacks are a normal element of bull markets and often recharge the engines for a bigger ascent.      Kenetic Capital’s CEO Jehan Chu also foresees bitcoin marching onward with “two steps forward, one step back” price action. The breakout, however, may remain elusive until the new year, as some investors are still looking to sell around record highs.      “The topside is still kept with lots of selling orders, possibly from miners,” Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk over Twitter.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Still on Track to Breach $20K in Coming Weeks    What's hot    Fidelity's Abigail Johnson says cryptocurrency industry is moving so quickly that ""trying to keep up with it is very hard"" (CryptoSlate)      Bitcoin is a ""fascinating representation of animal spirits and speculation,"" DoubleLine's Jeff Gundlach says (Business Insider)      An additional $600B of bitcoin demand could materialize if pension funds and insurance companies in the U.S., euro area, U.K. and Japan allocate 1% of portfolios to the asset, compared with the cryptocurrency's current market capitalization of about $350B, JPMorgan analysts write in new report (Bloomberg)      Wall Street heavyweights moving into bitcoin are the enemy to many who hail from the cryptocurrency's cypherpunk roots, CoinDesk's Michael Casey writes in Money Reimagined newsletter (CoinDesk)      China aims for gradual consumer adoption of digital yuan, former central bank governor Zhao says (South China Morning Post)      19-year-old Ukrainian lawmaker discloses ownership of $24.5M of cryptocurrency monero (CoinDesk)      Sygnum, a digital-asset firm with a Swiss banking license, claims to be first bank in world to tokenize its own shares (CoinDesk)      Aegis Custody clears hurdle in bid for South Dakota trust charter (CoinDesk)      CEO of DeFi insurer Nexus Mutual hacked for $8M in NXM tokens (CoinDesk)      Bitcoin exchanges flood London's Metro with ads (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    Morgan Stanley says there's a chance a no-deal Brexit could prompt Bank of England to cut benchmark interest rates below zero (Reuters)      Remote-working shift loosens Silicon Valley's tight grip on tech industry (WSJ), and Google opens door to ""flexible workweek"" (NYT)      Shandong Ruyi Technology Group, once considered the ""LVMH of China,"" cancels bondholder meeting over possible debt-maturity extension as coronavirus exacerbates ""liquidity pressure"" and interest payment looms this week (Nikkei Asia Review)      Suspected Russian hackers are believed to have broken into the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments and have been monitoring internal email traffic (Reuters)    Tweet of the day",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/14/first-mover-horrible-2020-economy-proved-best-thing-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/648e6f6a2e16a3c59da0cf1e1d24aa51abdca132-2037x1455.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385324,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAqNPH,1607954424,Crypto Is Booming in Economically Challenged Argentina,"At the start of 2020, Ripio, one of Argentina’s largest crypto exchanges, had around 400,000 users. It’s finishing the year with 1 million.      Ripio’s chief brand officer, Juan Mendez, told CoinDesk that around 70% of Ripio users are from Argentina, with the remainder mostly concentrated in Brazil. According to Mendez, the platform also saw a tenfold increase in trading volume this year compared to last.    Lea este artículo en español.    “I've been with the exchange pretty much from the beginning and I’ve never seen this kind of growth. This is bigger than the 2017 spike on operations and on demand,” Mendez said.      Argentina’s economic woes, from enormous debt obligations to high inflation, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, drove its population to seek alternative ways to store their wealth this year. But as the government limited U.S. dollar purchases by its citizens, crypto quickly proved to be the next best thing.      Along with Ripio, crypto exchanges operating in Argentina saw record growth in 2020, with some experiencing all-time highs in trading volumes towards the latter half of the year.      Mexico-based crypto exchange Bitso, which expanded operations to Argentina as recently as February of this year, has already seen a 68% increase in trading volumes on the platform in the third quarter of 2020 versus the second. Bitso’s move to Argentina also helped the platform pass the 1 million user milestone earlier this year.      Peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading platform LocalBitcoins also saw a 547% increase in trading volume between August 2019 and August 2020, with an all-time high of over $1 million worth of bitcoin traded in the second week of August this year. Another P2P platform, Paxful, saw near zero trading volume for the last five years, but trading picked up this year, recording a whopping 60641% increase from September 2019 and September 2020.      The unprecedented growth in Argentine crypto trades is reflected in a larger regional trend as LocalBitcoins and Paxful also saw record trading highs in a number of South American nations including Chile, Colombia and Bolivia. Business in the region is so good that, on Wednesday, CoinDesk reported Bitso had raised a jaw-dropping $62 million to fund its expansion to Brazil.      The increase in the use of cryptocurrencies is taking place against a backdrop of devastating economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the World Bank declaring Latin America and the Caribbean the “hardest hit” regions in the world.      Rather than hinder crypto use, the combination of the bitcoin price run, the inflationary economies created by countries desperately trying to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and the push for faster digital payments (particularly for cross-border remittances) drove adoption in South America this year.      Within this landscape, Argentina stands out.      Compared to hyperinflationary economies like Venezuela – whose economy is forecast to shrink by 6.8% in 2020 – Argentina seems even the worse for wear, thanks in part to a long and complicated economic history. In May, the government missed a $503 million interest payment on dollar bonds issued under New York law, putting the country into its ninth sovereign debt default in its history.      The nation’s GDP is set to contract by 12% this year, with nearly half its population already living in poverty.      “Cryptocurrencies are in a way allies for individuals, particularly in countries with a higher degree of political or economic uncertainty,” Andrés Ondarra, Bitso’s country manager for Argentina, told CoinDesk via an email.      Read More: Money Reimagined: Warnings From an Argentine Tragedy    Catch-22    As Argentinians, nervous over the country’s deteriorating economy, increasingly buy U.S. dollars to store their wealth, the country’s reserves shrink, forcing the government to devalue the currency and place restrictions on how much in foreign currency citizens are allowed to hold.      In a bid to salvage dwindling reserves, in September Argentina’s central bank limited the amount of U.S. dollars citizens are allowed to purchase to $200 a month with a 35% tax.      This led to more problems: After difficult negotiations with creditors, the government had managed to successfully restructure $65 billion in foreign debt back in August, but thanks to investor concern over forex restrictions, newly issued international bonds fell sharply through September and people continued to buy dollars despite the tax.      Each time the peso is devalued people scramble to find a way to protect the value of their salaries, Mendez said. To top it off, early December, Argentina’s senate passed a one-time wealth tax on the country’s millionaires to help fund pandemic relief efforts.      Ondarra said Argentina is a peculiar crypto market due to its users’ permanent search for access to value reserves and diverse financial solutions.      “Argentinians are always trying to find a stronger currency,” Mendez said.    Enter crypto    According to Mendez, there’s a fundamental difference between crypto users in Argentina and Brazil, where Ripio also operates. The two nations are set apart because of the systemic economic failures of Argentina through the years, he explained.      “Argentina has had to overcome a lot of economic disasters over the years. We're pretty much used to governments and strategic economic planning failing, and we are more willing to try different things in order to keep the country afloat,” Mendez said.      Mendez said Argentina’s topsy-turvy economic policy is perhaps reflected in the sudden spikes in trading on crypto platforms through the last few months.      For example, the government usually announces new financial restrictions in the late hours towards the end of the week (intended to be implemented the following Monday), Mendez said.      “So during the weekend and that whole week, we are always expecting a great demand for crypto,” Mendez said.      Argentinians see crypto as a great alternative store of wealth, even though his platform warns users that currencies like bitcoin are volatile digital assets, Mendez said.      Both Ondarra and Mendez agree Argentinians’ strong curiosity about alternative wealth reserves and increasing knowledge of cryptocurrencies have helped the growth of the local crypto space.      But Ondarra also attributes the rapid growth this year to the price run.      “An important factor that explains the increase in volume during the last months has been the upward trends in the price of bitcoin, which has undoubtedly kept people focused on the price action and led to higher trading volume,” Ondarra said.      He also explained that Argentine investors are closely watching the actions of big movers like MicroStrategy, which recently converted around $500 million of its cash investments from U.S. dollars to BTC.      This year, Argentina ranked 28 out of 154 countries in the Chainalysis crypto adoption index, with other Latin American countries including Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and Peru placing ahead of Argentina as adoption in the region continues to grow at a rapid pace.      “It’s thriving. Everyone’s attention is focused on Latin America. And it's growing fast,” Mendez said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/14/crypto-is-booming-in-economically-challenged-argentina,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd2e8d56e2c94581f60c1464fb03ef477a71ca5c-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385325,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAqNQX,1607948136,Bitcoin Exchanges Flood London's Metro With Adverts,"“If you’re seeing bitcoin on the Underground, it’s time to buy,” according to one of the many posters now plastered across London’s vast metro network.      In fact, two cryptocurrency exchanges chose to kick off advertising campaigns with Transport for London (TFL) on Monday.      Coinfloor, the U.K.’s longest-running exchange, launched a mix of large digital billboards and posters across London’s main tube stations. Meanwhile, Luno, the crypto exchange recently acquired by Digital Currency Group (also the owner of CoinDesk), combines its London Underground ads with 650 Greater London buses and a bunch of large roadside billboards.      While crypto prices are perched close to an all-time high of $20,000, the coronavirus pandemic has greatly reduced the cost of running advertising campaigns in the U.K.      “Prices for prime ad space are highly competitive,” said Obi Nwosu, founder and CEO of Coinfloor.      And with London in a lower tier of COVID-19 restrictions (although this may change soon) and Christmas around the corner, the trains are busy, Nwosu said.      “Footfall remains high at major stations, owing to the lockdown ending and Christmas run up,” he said. “Also, bitcoin is now finally being seen as a bona fide investment for the everyday person and so broader advertising starts making sense.”      James Lanigan, chief revenue officer at Luno, agreed that a combination of the winter holiday and the coronavirus has been favorable for bullish crypto advertising.      “At this time of year, the price of advertising around London would normally be almost out of reach,” Lanigan said. “But of course, everyone's been really hit and so actually on TFL and on the global network there's a lot of inventory out there. So there are great opportunities.”      Luno’s London push is part of a global campaign that includes national TV and radio in South Africa, the transport network across Lagos in Nigeria, print and radio in Malaysia and a mix of transport and radio in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia.      See also: Permission.io Has Quietly Raised $50M to Make Advertising Personal and Data Private      Lanigan was buoyed by the fact Coinfloor was launching its London Underground campaign at the same time as Luno.      “If we can get lots of crypto companies advertising at the same time, that would be fantastic,” he said. “You got Luno shouting about [cryptocurrency], and Coinfloor shouting about it and if we had two or three others it would just naturally lift the whole industry.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/14/bitcoin-exchanges-flood-londons-metro-with-adverts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8207052ad820f87dc2edcb4d2600515c703fa124-1600x1092.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385328,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAqNRn,1607946569,Bitcoin Still on Track to Breach $20K in Coming Weeks: Analysts,"Bitcoin's revived uptrend could soon lead to a much-anticipated breakout above the $20,000 mark, according to several analysts.      ""We have witnessed a large move up over the weekend, with MicroStrategy's efforts to increase bitcoin holdings from several large players bringing with it fresh optimism,"" Matthew Dibb, COO at Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. ""Our belief is that we will see a breach of $20,000 in the coming weeks.""      On Friday, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy raised $650 million through a convertible senior note sale to fund bitcoin purchases. Since then, the cryptocurrency has rallied by over $1,000 and was last seen trading near $19,100, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Several public-listed companies, including insurance firm MassMutual, have made forays into bitcoin in the past couple of months, bolstering its appeal as ""digital gold"" and helping trigger a major price rally. The cryptocurrency nearly doubled from $10,000 to a new record high of $19,920 in the 12 weeks to Dec. 1, before falling to $17,700 last week amid a bout of profit taking.      Pullbacks are a normal element of bull markets and often recharge the engines for a bigger ascent. Further, the cryptocurrency looks to be following previous bull market patterns, as noted by Delphi Digital. The decline seen following the all-time high on Dec. 1 is reminiscent of the the 20% pullback seen following a similar move to a then-peak price of $1,200 in February 2017. That decline was short-lived and the cryptocurrency went on to chart a meteoric rally to $19,783 in December 2017.      Kenetic Capital's CEO Jehan Chu also foresees bitcoin marching onward with ""two steps forward, one step back"" price action. ""Those who missed the $17,600 dip may get another chance to buy, but likely at higher levels as bitcoin pierces the $20,000 ceiling,"" Chu said.      The breakout, however, may remain elusive until the new year, as some investors are still looking to sell around record highs. ""The topside is still kept with lots of selling orders, possibly from miners,"" Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk over Twitter.      Bitcoin struggled to keep gains above $19,000 earlier this month largely due to long-term holders liquidating holdings in fear of near-term sell-offs.      Institutional demand could also wane toward the year's end, weakening demand. ""Don't forget the Grayscale market is closed over Christmas ... so no buying from institutions,"" Heusser said. Grayscale is a digital asset manager owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.    Mt. Gox risk?    Japanese exchange Mt. Gox ceased operations in February 2014 after announcing a fund loss of 850,000 BTC in long-term attacks. The deadline for a plan to distribute some 150,000 bitcoin back to investors is Dec. 15.      Some observers fear that if the distributions starts soon, recipients of the funds may cash in the 2,500% return accrued over the 6.5 years the cryptocurrency has been locked up, possibly adding to downward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price.      According to Stack's Dibb, the deadline has been extended multiple times and could be delayed again. ""However, if there is a decision, it will likely have an immediate and negative effect on the market,"" Dibb said. ""We are currently warning investors to brace for volatility ahead of the announcement.""      Also read: Missed the Bitcoin Rally? Here’s a Low-Risk Strategy to Ride the Bull Market      Kenetic Capital's Chu doesn't believe the Mt. Gox bitcoin it is a huge risk for the market. ""The impending distribution could be worth as much as $2.8 billion at the current market price. That is just 10% of the daily volume,"" he said.

On Thursday, the 169-year old insurance firm announced bitcoin purchases worth $100 million, as well as a $5 million equity stake in NYDIG – a financial services firm focused on bitcoin with $2.3 billion in the asset under management.  MassMutual’s move suggests insurance firms and pension funds are beginning to look at bitcoin as an investment/reserve asset alongside increased demand from wealthy investors and family offices.  According to JPMorgan, bitcoin may find an additional demand of $600 billion if pensions insurance firms in the U.S., European Union, U.K. and Japan allocate 1% of assets to the top cryptocurrency.

According to a report by the South China Morning Post on Sunday, Zhou Xiaochuan told attendees at the Shanghai Financial Forum that China's digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) initiative shouldn't be perceived as ""great power chauvinism.""      Rather than threaten other nation's currencies, DCEP will instead promote cross-border trade and boost the yuan's international status, according to Zhou.      ""We are not like libra and we don’t have an ambition to replace existing currencies,” he said, referring to the Facebook-initiated payments token that recently rebranded to diem and is slated for launch early next year.      The DCEP is China's proposed centralized digital payments system – an official yuan-pegged token to be issued by the People's Bank of China (PBoC). While a number countries have begun exploring and developing central bank digital currencies, China's efforts represent the most advanced effort to date from a major nation, with the potential to be used by billions of people.      The former PBOC governor also said if people were ""willing,"" the digital yuan could be used for trade and investment, but also flagged the sensitive nature and power of its utility on the world stage.      “Some countries are worried about the internationalization of yuan,” Zhou said. “We can’t push them on sensitive issues and we can’t impose our will.""      China, he continued, hopes to persuade consumers and overseas merchants to eventually accept digital yuan payments. The nation has learned from lessons the intense pushback from regulators and governments that libra has seen since it was first proposed in 2019, Zhou said.      China's DCEP would also offer an alternative to credit cards or payment services like Alipay and WeChat Pay. While those systems can already manage foreign exchange transactions, they are “often not real-time or transparent,” he said.      Edit (11:18 UTC, Dec. 14 2020): Corrected the former governor's surname.      “If the currency exchange is realized at the moment of a retail transaction and there is oversight of that exchange ... it brings new possibilities for interconnection,” Zhou said.
