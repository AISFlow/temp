12517473,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=531090,1683759653,"Binance, Coinbase Bitcoin Reserves Fast-Dropping, Is This Bullish?","According to CryptoQuant’s data on May 10, Bitcoin reserves in centralized exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase experienced a significant decline in Q4 2022. The reserves remained stable in April despite the prices soaring from $20,000 to $31,000 during that period. Exchange Bitcoin Reserves Rapidly Shrinking Bitcoin exchange “reserves” is a metric that tracks the amount of BTC held by centralized exchanges at any given time. Typically, the interaction between coin holders and exchanges can be used to gauge sentiment and their price expectation of the coin shortly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Is Moving From American Holders To Asian Wallets: Glassnode An example of reserves falling is when there is a sudden outflow from exchanges. This could indicate that users are optimistic and store their assets in non-custodial wallets. However, it’s important to note that this may not always be the reason for outflows. They can also be caused by fundamental factors such as hacks or regulatory concerns – as seen recently with Binance. Conversely, Bitcoin inflow to exchanges may drive the ramp’s reserves higher. Even so, this is interpreted as bearish since holders might quickly liquidate their assets for cash or stablecoins. With Bitcoin reserves across centralized exchanges falling, it could mean traders expect prices to rise shortly. In Q4 2022, the total Bitcoin exchange reserve in all tracked ramps fell sharply, especially in November 2022. This coincided with the collapse of FTX and questions emerging about the stability of Binance and other centralized exchanges. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, led other platforms in publishing proof-of-reserve statements to assuage fears and re-instill confidence. Though reserves have stabilized, there was a marked drop in late March 2023. Then, the bank run at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the closure of Signature Bank, banks that served crypto projects, including Circle, the issuer of USDC, appeared to have triggered coin outflows. From March 20 to early April, the Bitcoin exchange reserve fell from around 2.2 million to 2.1 million. Will BTC Rally? The general trend of Bitcoin exchange reserves remains negative, and prices are relatively firm, trading below $31,000. While this correlation between rising prices and falling exchange reserves is still valid, whether regulatory actions against crypto exchanges may cause a divergence is yet to be seen. Binance is reportedly being investigated by several United States agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The CFTC alleges that Binance, the world’s largest exchange, flouted trading laws in the country. Still, whether charges will be brought forward is being determined when writing.

This announcement marks a major milestone in Marathon Digital’s plan for global expansion. The creation of the “Abu Dhabi Global Markets JV Entity” will involve joint ownership between both companies, with Zero Two holding 80% ownership and Marathon Digital holding 20%. Related Reading: Matrixport Report: Here’s What Happens To Bitcoin If Inflation Continues To Fall Marathon plans to capitalize on the advantageous climate and energy costs in Abu Dhabi while forging valuable partnerships through its expansion efforts. Marathon Digital Expands Into The Middle East The newly formed joint venture with Zero Two will develop and operate two digital mining sites with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts. The sites will be located at two different places in Abu Dhabi. The larger 200MW site will be located at a feasible hub in Masdar City. The second site of 50MW will be located in the port zone of Mina Zayed, Abu Dhabi. Marathon and Zero Two anticipate leveraging the excess energy in Abu Dhabi to power the sites. According to the firms, this approach will increase the base load and sustainability of the Abu Dhabi power grid. In the past, the two firms ran a trial project to see if Abu Dhabi, where the desert temperature has historically made air-cooled digital asset mining unattainable, might be a viable location for a large-scale operation. As such, Marathon Digital and Zero Two developed a custom-built immersion solution that’ll cool the ASIC miners and also developed the right mining software. Notably, the infrastructure and mining equipment needed has already been requested, and construction is underway. Related Reading: PEPE, WOJAK, TURBO Take A Nosedive As Meme Coin Euphoria Dies Down These mining sites are projected to be among the most technologically advanced and energy-efficient mining hubs globally. According to the current construction timelines, both sites might be operational by 2024, with a total hash rate of about 7 EH/s. The news of the mining operation surfaced as executives from Coinbase visited the UAE to assess the region’s potential as a “strategic hub” for its global operations. The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, spoke at the Dubai FinTech Summit and met decision-makers in UAE. Several U.S.-based crypto companies, including Coinbase and Ripple, are considering relocating their operations abroad due to the unfavorable regulatory environment in the United States. The UAE appears to be a favorable jurisdiction for crypto companies seeking a more welcoming regulatory climate. Marathon Digital’s Crypto Mining Operations Might Boost Local Economies The latest advancement in immersion technology, coupled with the expertise of those involved, will be a significant benefit to the companies involved and the local economy. As Marathon partners with local businesses, it can create new job opportunities and enhance economic growth in the region. With immersion technology, the firm can help minimize the worries about the negative effect of cryptocurrency mining.

First, bitcoin and ether rode higher following a mildly encouraging U.S. inflation report. Then the price of the largest crypto by market capitalization tanked following internet rumors the U.S. government was selling $324 million in bitcoin. And then BTC rose again as investors regained their equilibrium.  The ups and downs reflected ongoing uncertainties about cryptos and wider macroeconomic conditions. Investors have remained cautious throughout the spring as they look for spurs to drive bitcoin’s price from its current $25,000-$30,000 range. When the catalysts will appear remains uncertain. In the interim, BTC seems susceptible to smaller, singular events and minor swings in market sentiment, although its rebound Wednesday also offered the latest evidence of its resilience.  Investors early Wednesday seemed buoyed by an unexpected decline in the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) to 4.9% in April, sending bitcoin and ether’s prices up 2% and 1.4% in the hour after the Labor Department released the data. Those increases broke a four-day losing streak for the assets. Economists had predicted 5% CPI, matching the March index. The CPI almost a year ago soared past 9%.  But bitcoin plummeted in the ensuing hours, amid rumors that the U.S. government had sold more than 11,800 bitcoin. On-chain data showed movement of the BTC between two wallets at approximately 1:06 PM ET. The receiving wallet had a balance of approximately $633 million in BTC, but just three transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.  To be sure, on-chain data provider Glassnode showed no movement in the U.S. Government’s bitcoin balance. But perceptions often have a stronger impact than reality. In this instance, the possibility – even if unfounded – appears to have spooked investors.  Bitcoin prices began to move higher by early afternoon, as the validity of the rumor came into greater question. BTC was recently trading near $27,900, about where it started the day after falling as low as $26,900.  Bitcoin is now 2.5% below its 20-day moving average of $28,520. Support for BTC at current levels appears to be strengthening, given historic levels of price activity near this level. .  Either is displaying similar behavior, with prices reverting to their 20-day moving average as well.  Upcoming, potentially impactful economic data includes U.S. jobless claims, and the producer price index (PPI), both set for release on Tuesday.  They will help the U.S. central bank next big decision in June whether to raise interest rates and have a major impact on crypto and other asset markets.

42410799,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdhFnt,1683752980,"Ether Selling Pressure Post-Shanghai Upgrade Was 'Non-Event,' Says Nansen","In hindsight, the selling pressure of ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, turned out to be a “non-event” following the Shanghai upgrade, which enabled staking redemptions for the first time, according to a report from blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  Over a month has passed since the Shanghai upgrade that marked Ethereum’s full transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain, and ETH staking deposits have surpassed withdrawals, making the number of staked ETH climb to 19.55 million at presstime, a new all-time high. As a result, the May 8 report stated “that the elimination of unstaking risks has thus far offset selling pressure from withdrawals.”  In the weeks building up to Shanghai, crypto bulls and bears debated extensively about the market’s potential response following the upgrade. The price of ETH has decreased about 8% to $1,851, since April 13 when Shanghai went live, per CoinDesk data. The CoinDesk Market Index, designed to measure the broad performance of the digital asset market, has dropped nearly 10% in the same time period.  “Ultimately, withdrawals have been minimal and have thus far been matched with inflows, signaling strong overall confidence from investors in the network and the asset itself,” according to the Nansen report.  Crypto exchange Kraken, which complied with regulation from the Securities and Exchanges Commission to end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S customers in February, had the most withdrawals at over 646,000 ETH, with Coinbase, a rival crypto exchange, trailing behind with more than 376,000 ETH.  While roughly 73% of the ETH withdrawn from staking has been sent to centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Kraken and Coinbase, the majority of withdrawn ETH is CEXs withdrawing ETH to themselves.  “This means that the majority ETH being sent to CEXs is not primarily for selling, but for the exchange’s internal operations,” according to Nansen.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sage D.

12514692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=531057,1683752408,"Arbitrum (ARB) Surges Nearly 10% In The Past 24 Hours, Here’s Why","Arbitrum (ARB), one of the recently launched Ethereum-based Layer 2 scaling solutions, has seen a surge in its price by almost 10% in the past 24 hours. The surge comes when the global crypto market seems to be in an upward trend. However, the Arbiturm spike can be tied to a different factor. The recent increase in ARB’s value can be linked to the protocol’s announcement about how it plans to manage the fees generated on its platform. Arbitrum Update On DAO Revenue In the Twitter announcement posted earlier today, the Arbitrum team noted it is “the only rollup that sends all surplus revenue generated by transaction fees to their respective DAO. It is time for the DAO to collect the funds so far.” Related Reading: Arbitrum Soars 44% To Record Highs As Whales Splash Millions On ARB Tokens Notably, the Arbitrum protocol allows users to transact on the platform with reduced transaction fees and faster speeds than the Ethereum network. The protocol requires users to pay a fee when transacting on the network. The fee paid is split into two sections, including Layer 1 (L1) fees for covering transactions on Ethereum and L2 fees for Arbitrum fees. As per the protocol’s mechanism, surplus tokens are generated by the fees and are accumulated before being sent to the DAO. The DAO revenue mechanism on Arbitrum now enables token holders to reap the rewards of accumulated surplus fees. When the organization collects the tokens, members of the Arbitrum community DAO will receive their share of the fees. This substantial increase in benefits has contributed to the current surge in the token’s value and the value of becoming its long-term holder. It is worth noting that the distribution of rewards resulting from this development will benefit members of the Arbitrum community DAO, which could lead to a significant increase in demand for ARB as users aim to capitalize on the opportunity to earn rewards. ARB Surges Nearly 10% Following the DAO revenue mechanism announcement, the price of ARB has recorded a bullish uptick, up by 8.7%, with a trading price of $1.19 at the time of writing. The assets have also seen a surge in its market cap, surging by over $100 million in the past 24 hours. Despite the surge, Arbitrum has fallen from its previous rank of #32 among the global crypto market to ranking #38. However, according to the activity in its trading volume, the token might soon be quick to reclaim its spot. CoinMarketCap data shows Arbitrum’s trading volume hasn’t moved much in the past 24 hours. Instead, it has only continued to range between $300 million and $400 million, indicating a possible accumulation. Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop Notably, the DAO revenue mechanism incentivizes platform users to hold ARB tokens, and it could increase the demand for ARB. This, in turn, will benefit the protocol and its users as it increases the network’s value and liquidity.

Luis Cuende, who created the DAO builder’s platform and retains influence in the association running it, called for $30 million in ANT buybacks using a smart contract that would buy all tokens trading higher than the 30-day moving average, which is currently $3.09. He also called for Aragon’s $200 million treasury to gradually transfer to the Aragon DAO – an entity controlled by ANT token holders – over a period of five years.  The proposal extended what had already been a banner rally for the ANT token, which climbed from its Wednesday low of $2.75 to $2.98 immediately prior to his post – and shot up to $3.25 and higher afterwards.  Coming nearly one week into Aragon’s governance crisis, the proposal seemed to cool a volatile situation that on Tuesday exploded with the Aragon Association's decision to throw its DAO into lockdown to protect against a “51% attack.” The barbarians at its gates were the so-called RFV Raiders, a loose collective of activist crypto traders including the crypto hedge fund Arca who had called for buybacks of the ANT token to bring its value in line with the treasury.  On Tuesday, Aragon Association reversed a community-approved plan to move its $200 million treasury to ANT holders’ control – an important step in its “DAO journey” – out of fear that the RFV Raiders would plunder it. In a blog post, it said it was “repurposing the Aragon DAO as part of a new grants program” that would “secure these funds from those seeking to access them for their own financial gains.”  One member of the activist collective told CoinDesk that between all of them they have enough voting power to win any vote over the team’s objections, including the ability to block grant allocations. That threat underscored the pickle Aragon is in: It cannot afford to completely ignore the RFV Raiders while continuing to rely on its ANT token for any form of governance.  There was no guarantee that Cuende’s proposal would be implemented. He said he is “not involved in the day to day of Aragon” and warned any solution would take time. The Aragon Association did not immediately respond to CoinDesk.  “The Aragon Association’s mandate is to spend its treasury on Aragon’s mission. That mandate also applies for transferring the funds to the DAO. So whichever proposal the AA decides to go with, it will need to be reviewed by the legal team. This is usually slow, painful, and requires a lot of back and forth,” Cuende wrote.  Still, there were signs Wednesday that after days of bickering, banning, conspiratorial allegations, open letters and accusations of “decentralization theater,” cooler heads were prevailing. Three activist investors that CoinDesk spoke to said the proposal was a good start.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/10/aragons-ant-rallies-after-cofounder-proposes-token-buybacks-to-end-activist-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62008a0cc5010f9ff8155494a9b17529c08989b3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier classified Algorand as a security in its charges against the Bittrex crypto exchange. Related Reading: PEPE Token Futures Cast Gloom For Investors As Prices Plummet By 45% Notably, Coinbase delisted XRP based on regulatory scrutiny in 2021. But it has yet to do the same with ALGO, even as the cryptocurrency faces a similar issue. Paul Grewal Explains Coinbase Position On Algorand In his interview, John Deaton discussed the confusion among XRP’s community regarding Coinbase’s approach to making and reviewing listing decisions. Paul Grewal stated that secondary sales of assets do not make them securities. However, Deaton believes that the same argument regarding secondary sales applies to XRP tokens. According to Deaton, XRP’s suspension from trading on Coinbase was due to the argument that the token is a security under U.S. law. However, Coinbase still offers ALGO to traders, frustrating XRP holders who feel penalized. In response, Grewal reiterated Coinbase’s commitment to upholding the rule of law equally for everyone. He sympathized with the plight of XRP holders who believe that a double standard applies to various situations. Further, Grewal states that laws and circumstances changed and referred to Coinbase’s amicus brief supporting Ripple in November 2022. He believes crypto exchanges and projects must “team up to withstand a solid adversary,” the U.S. SEC. According to Grewal, the SEC is not “above mistakes” in interpreting the law, and the recent enforcements from the body are politically motivated. Teamwork Necessary Moving Forward These remarks come after a meeting between Paul Grewal and Ripple’s General Counsel, Stuart Alderoty. John Deaton remarked that the meeting showed two great General Counsels leading the front line in the battle to improve crypto regulation in the United States.

It’s the latest development in a long-standing debate on Uniswap’s protocol fees and broader finances.  Implementing fees on the pools would allow the Uniswap protocol to top up its treasury’s coffers and provide rewards to holders of the protocol’s native token Uniswap (UNI). Uniswap’s decision to further monetize its platform by switching on fees for a large swath of its version-three (v3) liquidity pools and all of its version-two (v2) pools could also set a precedent for the large DeFi ecosystem, of which Uniswap has captured roughly 70% market share.  “If Uniswap can monetize and bring in all these dollars by building a really great open-source protocol that gets usage then that will incentivize other folks to do this too,” Getty Hill, the proposal’s author, told CoinDesk. “I’m hopeful that this kind of changes some of those industry norms.”  Uniswap v2 has nearly $1.2 billion total value locked and has averaged roughly $367 million in daily volume on Ethereum during the past week, DefiLlama data shows. Meanwhile, Uniswap v3, which is deployed on SushiSwap, Curve, Balance and PancakeSwap, among other networks, has roughly $2.9 billion total value locked.  The mechanism by which the protocol would collect those fees, where those fees would go and what type of initiatives the tokens would fund is up for debate, Hill said. Users will iron out those details in community-based discussions before the proposal goes to a formal vote.  This isn’t the first time community members have called to activate fee switches on Uniswap liquidity pools. Last summer, a proposal to switch on fees became a point of contention within the uniswap community. The proposal ultimately failed to get enough traction, with opponents voicing fears the move could have broader tax implications for the protocol and its users.

42410788,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdhFNR,1683746783,"Rehypothecation May Be Common in Traditional Finance, but It Will Never Work With Bitcoin","If there is one cause for consensus in crypto after a disastrous 2022 it's that centralized crypto lending carries a particular cause for concern. The rehypothecation of customer assets allowed crypto firms to grow rapidly until they collapsed under the weight of these risks.  Rehypothecation is the technical terms used when financial platforms reinvest their depositors' assets to further those platform’s access to credit. This practice is the norm in traditional finance – so deeply ingrained in the operating behavior of the legacy financial system that not doing so is dismissed out of hand as less efficient.  Christopher Calicott is the managing director of Trammell Venture Partners, an Austin-based venture capital firm focused on seed- and early-stage startups.  Applying this behavior onto bitcoin or crypto ignores the fundamental essence of these assets arising from a core bitcoin innovation. Scenarios like these will repeat into the future as long as the market is not effectively acknowledging and pricing the risk of rehypothecated collateral. The risk to a customer is fundamentally different when there is and when there is not rehypothecation of the customer’s collateral.  Hypothecation occurs when a person or entity takes a loan and receives an interest rate based on providing collateral, like when bitcoin is posted as collateral to a lender. The promise made by the lender is that when you pay off your loan, you will receive your collateral back.  However, lenders themselves often take leverage based on assets on their balance sheet and get credit on other platforms – providing themselves with additional credit for their own use using the customer’s originally posted collateral. This process is called rehypothecation. Deep in the fine print, that promise to return a borrower’s collateral is conditioned upon there being collateral available to return.  The very common use of rehypothecation in traditional finance created a sense of normal for how to treat assets – financial or otherwise. And as the bitcoin and crypto industry has grown, many from TradFi have brought those norms with them. Scratch the surface of many crypto firms and you’ll find them using customer deposits to further their business goals (often while stressing the importance of “sovereign” money like cryptocurrencies).  An inescapable reality of this practice in TradFi is that it functions fundamentally via the system of fractional reserve banking. Dollars are largely created through the system of central banking which is awash in cheap liquidity, and in the event of a crisis scenario, the government opens the liquidity pump further.  Fractional reserve banking necessarily incentivizes risk taking. When credit dries up, the stated goal for opening the spigot: to incentivize lenders to take risks and put capital to work via credit. In this way, the normal market forces to identify weakness are mitigated and the cycle perpetuates.  However, these fundamental differences between dollars and bitcoin are not often well enough understood and it is an error to proceed with bitcoin using the same rehypothecation approach.  See also: Why Bitcoin and Rehypothecation Don’t Mix | Opinion  To illustrate, the software industry has enjoyed the margins it does because of the inherent ease in replication of digital information: there’s essentially zero marginal cost to produce one additional unit of a digital product. Consequently, with music, movies and software, an entire digital rights management industry emerged with the internet to thwart free duplication of products.  Given that backdrop, a foundational innovation for Bitcoin was Satoshi’s solution for creating something that is provably digitally scarce – there can only ever be 21 million bitcoins – presenting us with something unusual for finance. There is a fundamentally different risk profile for collateral that is unique from that which is being continuously created or can be reproduced at will.  We must treat both bitcoin’s custody and the pricing of risk in bitcoin lending markets differently than an asset backed by a seemingly endless supply of dollars. The reason is simple: if someone loses your bitcoin, there is no way to make more of them to make you whole. They are truly, irrevocably gone.  Traditionally oriented lenders balk at the very idea of non-rehypothecated collateral for their loans. They would argue that a pure balance sheet loan – making a loan as an investment of your own capital risk – is less efficient than rehypothecation.  To be sure, a company’s potential returns would not be a juicy as those when leverage has been taken by rehypothecating a borrower’s collateral, getting more dollars and originating even more loans in a cycle that repeats itself for that specific lender. However, borrowers often lack the information needed to understand the risks they take when posting collateral to a lender who only offers this model, even though this currently represents nearly all centralized crypto lenders.  In the fallout of the failures in crypto and now in banking – where customer deposits above a certain threshold are treated as if the depositor was there with an investor’s hat on – it’s obvious that those depositors and borrowers did not intend to invest in the platform’s (or bank’s) business. Yet, in a failure depositors find themselves suddenly a creditor of the failed business.  For an everyday retail customer pursuing a personal loan and being asked to post bitcoin as collateral, it would seem sensible that they understand what is going to happen with their money and therefore have an understanding of what kind of overall risk they are taking when getting their loan.  $5 words like “rehypothecation” are rarely understood by borrowers today. Education for market participants is the most effective way to bridge the gap between the status quo in finance and the true benefits of a sustainable path forward in light of the emergence of Bitcoin and digital scarcity. One powerful way for market participants – borrowers in this case – to get a sense of the risk involved is simply to ask what will happen to their collateral before repayment of their loan.  Fortunately, the key learning for these customers is a simple truth: Non-rehypothecated lending is a superior and objectively lower risk way to take out a loan and would naturally be worth some premium for many customers. This could take the form of lower interest rates for higher risk loans or higher fees for safer, non-rehypothecated loans.  A more transparent market would offer both loan types and respective interest rates side by side. An informed borrower considering the risks and costs could choose the lower rate/higher risk loan, but they would do it from a place of informed consent and not unexpectedly find themselves to be a creditor in a platform’s bankruptcy proceeding, possibly having lost their bitcoin forever.  During the last bull cycle, we have seen risk taking with customer’s assets at a shocking level. Until we see more information in the market about how customers’ assets are used on platforms and a recognition that bitcoin and digital scarcity needs to be thought of fundamentally differently than in traditional finance, it appears likely that these highly leveraged scenarios and subsequent asset losses will repeat themselves in the future.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Calicott,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/10/rehypothecation-may-be-common-in-traditional-finance-but-it-will-never-work-with-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1d0c9085f9545945604b98b8ecc9b75b9235c02-2400x1597.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Furthermore, the report reveals an increase in Tether’s excess reserves, reaching an all-time high of $2.44 billion, up from $1.48 billion in the previous quarter. Related Reading: Should You Worry About Bitcoin Withdrawals On Exchanges? New Data Sheds Light Tether Q1 Net Income Surpasses Blackrock, Leading Hedge Fund Manager The recently released Q1 2023 Assurance Report highlights the stablecoin’s impressive performance in the year’s first quarter. The report shows that Tether’s net profit for the quarter was a staggering $1.48 billion, contributing significantly to strengthening its reserves. Moreover, the report reveals that the token in circulation increased by 20% during the quarter, indicating the high trust that Tether’s customers have in the stablecoin. In addition, the company ended the first quarter of 2023 with consolidated total assets of $81.8 billion, with most of its reserves invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Tether is also taking steps to reduce its reliance on pure bank deposits as a source of liquidity. It utilizes the repo market as an additional measure to ensure a higher protection standard for its users by maintaining the necessary liquidity. The report demonstrates Tether’s commitment to transparency, with most of its investments being held in cash, cash equivalents, and other short-term deposits (approximately 85%). It also highlights a 25% reduction in secured loans from 8.7% to 6.5% of this asset class within the overall reserves and the highest percentage of assets allocated in US Treasury Bills to date. Gold and Bitcoin represent 4% and 2% of the total reserves, respectively. All new issuance of tokens has been invested in US Treasury bills or placed in overnight Repo. Last but not least, Tether has outperformed BlackRock, one of the world’s leading providers of investment, advisory, and risk management solutions, in terms of net income in Q1 of 2023. While BlackRock reported a net income of $1.16 billion for the quarter, Tether reported a net income of $1.48 billion, highlighting the confidence investors had in the stablecoin issuer and the crypto market as a whole. Cementing Its Position As Leading Stablecoin Tether’s report reveals that its consolidated total liabilities amount to $79.4 billion, of which $79.3 billion relates to digital tokens issued. Despite this, the group’s consolidated assets exceed its consolidated liabilities, demonstrating the strength and stability of the platform. Tether’s success in Q1 2023 is evident, with its reserves’ surplus reaching an all-time high of $2.44 billion and net profits for the quarter of $1.48 billion. Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, attributes this success to the strength and stability of the platform, as well as the company’s ongoing risk management processes. Per the report, Looking ahead to Q2, Tether has an extremely positive outlook. It evaluates the global economic environment to ensure its customers’ funds are not exposed to high-risk scenarios. With its reserves remaining extremely liquid and diversified across various asset classes, Tether remains a leading stablecoin issuer in the cryptocurrency market.

42410794,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdhFka,1683742524,"If Bitcoin Can’t Handle a Few JPEGs, How Can It Handle the World?","Many bitcoiners have been up in arms about high fees amidst a surge in new activity on the original blockchain. Fees, which are set dynamically by a competitive bidding process, spiked to a staggering $30.19 for a simple bitcoin transaction on May 8, after hovering around $2 since July of 2021 – nearly two years.  The situation is dire enough that some bitcoiners, particularly so-called “maximalists,” have gone so far as proposing censorship of BRC-20 tokens and other assets based on the “ordinals” issuance method. Those assets use new features to inscribe data in bitcoin transactions, and appear to be driving the price spike. There’s an immense amount to be said about the moralistic debate around BRC-20 issuance, but in one surprising development, maximalist figurehead Michael Saylor (the former chief executive of MicroStrategy) has now declared their emergence “bullish.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Leaving aside the question of “what Bitcoin is for,” there’s a much more straightforward takeaway here: Bitcoin isn’t scaling, and blaming ordinals doesn’t change that fact.  The chain would be facing the same scaling issues if only a slightly larger fraction of the world were using it for monetary transactions. That means the BRC-20 kerfuffle, ironically, is ultimately a blow to the very “maximalist” vision held by those currently railing against non-monetary uses of bitcoin.  Crowded mempool  The explosion of interest in BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin has driven a huge spike in transaction volume on the base layer network, and in turn driven up transaction prices. There are many different ways to put this congestion in context, but one very good metric is congestion in the Bitcoin mempool. The mempool is where transactions wait to be validated, and are ordered according to the fee bid attached to them. A fuller mempool means more competition to get your transaction into the next block.  Reviewing the data is eye-opening in numerous ways. (I used this straightforward but stellar mempool visualization tool by Jochen Hoenicke, a researcher at smart contract security firm Certora.)  First, by sheer transaction volume, Bitcoin’s mempool has seemingly never been this full – not by a longshot. The last major peak in April of 2021 saw 200,000 transactions waiting in line, but yesterday that number peaked at 450,000. (Hoenicke’s node only tracks back to 2017, but prior to that bull market, Bitcoin congestion and fees were negligible.)  Just as notable, these transactions are often tiny. You can also see, courtesy of bitinfocharts, that the average bitcoin transaction size has plummeted in recent days.  That exploding volume of small transactions seems to confirm that the demand spike has been driven by speculators (and/or future rug-pullers) frantically issuing and minting tokens using the experimental “BRC-20” standard. There’s hype around the tokens right now, and degens seemingly want their $pepes and other casino tokens right now, not in 12 or 14 blocks. Coinmarketcap claims that a staggering 8,500 tokens have been issued on Bitcoin in the mere weeks since the BRC-20 standard was first floated.  Given that these are largely “memecoins” that amount to little more than gambling, the bidding war seems likely to be short-lived. And in fact, fees by May 10 had already declined a bit from their May 8 peak.  But here’s the thing: if even a few million people wanted to actually use Bitcoin to send money peer-to-peer on a regular basis, we’d be in exactly the same position. And it would be permanent, rather than transitory. The calls for Bitcoin censorship from maximalists are arguably incoherent for a number of philosophical reasons, but this practical incoherence is most striking. Bitcoiners upset at a temporary fee spike driven by degens may be better off focusing their energy on solutions to the imminent problem of sustained higher fees driven by everyday users.  See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Maximalism | Opinion  Most fundamentally, as Castle Island Ventures co-founder Nic Carter pointed out in these pages yesterday, “high prices are the cure for high prices.” We are seeing this in real time, particularly with Binance integrating the layer 2 “Lightning network” into its bitcoin withdrawal flow. Lightning is purpose-built for removing the load of smaller transactions from the base chain, but it does require a fairly arcane setup for peer-to-peer use. At the same time, Lightning service firms, such as David Marcus’ Lightspark, have a suddenly target-rich environment for making Lightning easier for average Joes.  In this respect, the BRC-20 fee spike seems likely to be a blessing in disguise: A warning shot that should trigger a frenzy of preparation for a sustained barrage.  There is a final, hypothetical irony here. The actual viability of both ordinals and fungible tokens on Bitcoin is still extremely unclear – a significant bug in inscriptions was identified just last week, for instance. But if you squint, it’s not impossible to envision some form of ordinal technology enabling entirely new approaches to scaling Bitcoin, perhaps including “layer 2” technology closer to what Ethereum can accomplish.  That may prove even more distasteful to the maximalist crowd than sharing their mempool with JPEGs and degens. But if you’re actually committed to scaling Bitcoin, it may be time to think bigger.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Z.

The BTC/USD trading pair on Coinbase traded as low as $26,800 before regaining some ground, according to TradingView data. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $27,400, down more than 4% in the past hour and 1.8% in the past 24 hours.  Coinglass data showed that traders who bet on a price shift liquidated over $47 million in BTC long positions over roughly the past hour versus just over $5 million in BTC short position liquidations. These types of long squeezes tend to push prices lower.  Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, pointed out that there are still concerns about low liquidity in markets, with BTC's aggregated 2% market depth – a metric for assessing liquidity conditions – hasn't recovered since crypto exchange FTX's collapse last November.  It's ""a symptom of illiquidity,"" he told CoinDesk.  BTC’s price initially jumped after Wednesday morning’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that annual inflation slowed to 4.9% in April from 5% in March and less than the forecast 5%. The CPI rose 0.4% on a monthly basis, aligning with expectations and higher than 0.1% in March.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, followed a similar pattern, dropping by 1% in the past 24 hours to change hands at around $1,860. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market performance, was down 1% over the past 24 hours.  Equities were mixed on Wednesday midday (ET), with the S&P 500 trading down 0.1% but the tech-heavy Nasdaq edging 0.5% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 0.6% for the day.  “The sell-off coincided with a drop in stocks so it could be partially correlation-led,” Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin Supplies Held By Asian And US Investors Have Gone Opposite Ways Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, an interesting dichotomy has formed between the different regional supplies of the cryptocurrency recently. Glassnode has divided the Bitcoin addresses into different regions based on the hours they have been making transactions in. “Geolocation of Bitcoin supply is performed probabilistically at the entity level,” notes Glassnode. An “entity” here refers to one or more wallets that are under the control of a single investor (or an investor group). “The timestamps of all transactions created by an entity are correlated with the working hours of different geographical regions to determine the probabilities for each entity being located in the US, Europe, or Asia,” explains the analytics firm. The three main regions are the US (13:00 to 01:00 UTC), Europe (07:00 to 19:00 UTC), and Asia (00:00 to 12:00 UTC). In the context of the current discussion, however, only the supplies based in the US and Asia are relevant.

The change slowed down in the second half of the year, but still remained positive, suggesting that the supply was still growing, albeit at a slower pace. In 2022, however, the supply started decreasing, as the bear market took over and the LUNA and 3AC crashes took place. The year-over-year change of the US-based BTC supply has continued to grow more negative since then and today stands at a value of -7.5%, suggesting that the supply has shrunken by 7.5% since May 2022. The Asian Bitcoin supply, however, has displayed a very contrasting behavior, as it started going up just as the American investors started shedding their holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates On BitMEX Turn Deep Red, Here’s Why This Is Bullish Interestingly, the pace at which the supply held by the Asian traders has transformed is almost exactly the same as what the balances of the US-based wallets saw (although, of course, the change has been in the opposite direction). Currently, the year-over-year change in the Asian supply stands at +6.9%. The fact that the Asian investors have bought a similar amount to what the US holders have sold suggests a direct transfer of coins between the two supplies. Now, as for why this continued transition of supply has taken place, the main reason is likely to be the fact that the US has been tightening up regulations related to the cryptocurrency sector recently. One of the most prominent examples of this has been the regulatory crackdown that Coinbase has observed from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently.

The company is teaming up with 11 partners, including alternative wellness advocate Deepak Chopra’s metaverse organization Seva.Love, TIME magazine’s Web3 arm TIMEPieces, crypto domain provider Unstoppable Domains, digital artist Adam Bomb Squad and NFT platform House of First, to release the JOMO Effect NFT collection in honor of May’s Mental Health awareness month.  With over 40 creators contributing digital art works to the collection, the tokens are available to mint as an open-edition on Polygon through marketplace Magic Eden for 24 MATIC, or about $21, for the next 24 hours. The “Joy List,” or allow list, opened for three hours preceding the public mint at 20 MATIC, or about $18.  Minting a JOMO Effect NFT donates primary sale profits to five mental health charities, including the American Foundation or Suicide Prevention. Collectors can also participate in Chopra’s Soul of Leadership course, access to Peace Inside Live’s meditations and mindfulness materials, claim a 30% discount for an Unstoppable Domain, and more.  JOMO, or the “joy of missing out,” is a term that emerged to counteract FOMO, or the “fear of missing out.” It’s been a prominent conversation in the Web3 space as collectors have been eager to “ape” into collections, attend events and be omnipresent in the NFT space in hopes that they don’t miss the opportunity to turn a profit.  Shira Lazar, Emmy nominated host and co-founder of Peace Inside Live, told CoinDesk that FOMO can exacerbate stress and anxiety for creators, preventing them from setting aside important self-care and wellness practices that community members should prioritize. She hopes the collection will start a discussion about the significance of mental health in Web3, and offer collectors a chance to make an impact for the greater community as well as themselves.  “I believe if we really want to make or have this industry be different as we know it is disruptive, how do we integrate [mental health] into the foundation of what we're building?” said Lazar. “Through everything we do, we're not just promoting this idea, but we're allowing you to practice it.”  Chopra, who has been an advocate for mindfulness throughout his career, said in a press release that he sees Web3 as a space where efforts to promote mental health are necessary as the industry continues to grow.  ""I believe that each of us is a unique strand in the intricate web of life and that we are here to contribute,” said Chopra. “The collaboration with the JOMO Effect is part of our ongoing focus on nurturing community and well-being in the Web3 space and working towards a more sustainable, peaceful, healthier and joyful world.”",POSITIVE,MATIC,MATIC | SPONSORED,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/10/from-fomo-to-jomo-web3-mental-health-collective-peace-inside-live-launches-nft-collection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1ea644305d37ff0425886d16e20d649cddbe599-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, its native token MATIC has steadily declined in the last few weeks. This comes as no surprise as many other altcoins are also experiencing the same downward movement due to negative market sentiment. But while the volatility of MATIC’s price can present profitable opportunities for traders, it can also pose a risk for inexperienced investors. Current Market Sentiment For MATIC In the past day and the previous seven days, MATIC has fallen 6.9% and 20.3%, respectively. According to an on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, millions of MATIC tokens were transferred between on-exchange addresses. Related Reading: Check One, Two: Is Bitcoin Ready For A Mic Drop Rally? These large whale transactions on the Polygon network might be fuelling the downtrend as it suggests that holders are selling off their MATIC tokens. At the time of writing, MATIC’s price is $0.8675, representing a 44.53% drop since February 18, 2023. At the time of writing, the CFGI indicator also confirms the bearish sentiment around the MATIC price as its shows 38, indicating Fear among investors. This suggests that MATIC is in a phase where investors and traders are afraid to hold the asset. This may result in more dumps if the bulls remain stagnant. Meanwhile, MATIC’s 24-hour trading volume is down by 15.38% to $375 million. A drop in daily trading volume shows fewer activities are on the network. However, MATIC still maintained its #9 position with its market cap of $8 billion on CoinMarketCap. Polygon (MATIC) Price Analysis MATIC is trading below both the 50-Day and 200-Day SMAs, indicating a bearish trend in the short and long term. Traders may utilize this current trend to sell or avoid MATIC until it recovers fully. MATIC’s RSI reading of 22.99 suggests that MATIC is currently in the oversold zone. This also implies that the price of MATIC has rapidly declined and may be due for a possible retracement. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin May Have Completed The “Perfect” Pullback The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) below the signal line confirms the bearish trend. This suggests that MATIC is currently in a downtrend movement. The histogram also is below zero, confirming the bearish momentum. MATIC trades between the significant support and resistance levels at $0.7438 and $01.0306, respectively. The asset has already breakthrough the first primary support of $0.9335 and is heading strongly to the next support level. With this strong bearish momentum, the bears might break the next support and eventually hit the last support of $0.51. However, if the bull could take back control, we might see MATIC hit the strong resistance level at $1.1900.

Jane Street and Jump are paring back crypto trading in the U.S., Bloomberg reported Tuesday, amid the regulatory clampdown that spawned out of FTX's collapse in November. Jump's crypto division will continue to expand globally while Jane Street will scale back on its growth plans, Bloomberg reported.  ""The news is not necessarily surprising given recent developments,"" Kaiko analyst Riyad Carey told CoinDesk. ""What's concerning is that liquidity has still not recovered from Alameda's collapse, and a slowdown with two of the biggest surviving market makers could weigh on liquidity even further. It's a bit surprising how slow the industry has been to fill Alameda's shoes.""  Market depth, a metric used to measure liquidity on exchanges by assessing how much capital is required to move a market, slumped by more than 50% following the collapse of FTX and has failed to recover despite a rise in crypto prices.  Crypto-native market makers, unlike traditional firms such as Jane Street and Jump, aren't put off by the duo's exodus as the issue is constrained to the U.S. market.  ""Not a big impact yet,"" Zahreddine Touag, Head of Trading at Paris-based market market Woorton, told CoinDesk. ""In the short term, some exchanges will be less liquid but more importantly it will be more difficult for US counterparties to source OTC liquidity.""  ""We might see it in the future if brokers, payment providers and other actors looking to source liquidity start shifting offshore or to Europe and Asia,"" he added.  The United States' gung-ho stance on crypto regulation has already attracted criticism from the likes of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, but the long-lasting effects are potentially far greater than any short-term tremble.  An absence of liquidity, which is what the crypto industry will experience as several market makers jump ship, causes an increase in volatility as it takes less capital to move an asset. This, coupled with this highly-leveraged nature of crypto markets, has the potential to create a credit risk that could spread to all sectors of finance.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/10/bitcoin-liquidity-on-the-brink-as-jane-street-and-jump-exit-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed7eb37f74c7af50076d90f9d4766985dd1f4a1-3684x2072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company for the first time broke out bitcoin (BTC) and gold holdings detail in its consolidated reserves report. As of March 31, Tether held $1.5 billion of bitcoin on its balance sheet – or about 2% of roughly $80 billion in reserves – and $3.4 billion of gold, or about 4% of reserves.  This quarter’s attestation comes after a turbulent period for the $131 billion stablecoin market, when several tokens lost their dollar pegs in a knock-on effect as the U.S. banking crisis hit Circle’s USDC, the second largest dollar-pegged stablecoin. The New York Department of Financial Services also forced fintech firm Paxos to stop issuing the third-largest stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD), in February, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was reportedly probing the firm for issuing BUSD as unregistered security.  Tether’s dollar-pegged USDT, the largest stablecoin with an $81.8 billion supply as of May 9, has been one of the clear winners of the calamity, increasing its market capitalization by $16 billion since the start of the year, or 24% growth. Tether also issues stablecoins pegged to other currencies and gold, which represent a fraction of USDT’s market cap.  Read more: USDC Outflows Surpass $10B as Tether’s Stablecoin Dominance Reaches 22-Month High  “Tether has become the most trusted stablecoin in the industry due to its perceived safety from the SEC and due to its peg safety as of late,” Conor Ryder, an analyst at digital asset research firm Kaiko, wrote in a note.  According to the Q1 attestation signed by financial services firm BDO Italia, Tether held about $2.44 billion in excess reserves of the $79.4 billion Tether-issued tokens in circulation as of March 31. That surplus was at an all-time high, Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Tether, said in the announcement.  All newly issued tokens were invested in US Treasury bills or deposited in overnight repurchase and reverse repurchase facilities, Tether said. The firm held about 85% of all reserve assets in cash and cash-like assets, U.S. Treasury bills and bank deposits among them.  Tether continued to trim the amount of secured loans in its reserves, reducing them by about $500 million to $5.3 billion in Q1.

As a result, the profitability levels of investors in the meme coin have dropped drastically during this time. Even now, SHIB holders continue to see a decline in profitability, bringing it to one of the highest levels of losses since inception. Only 18% Of Shiba Inu Holders Are In Profit Data from on-chain aggregators show Shiba Inu investors are not faring well in the current market. Unlike other top tokens in the space, the meme coin has seen its percentage of holders in profit actually drop below 20% while others maintain their positions above 40%. Related Reading: Matrixport Report: Here’s What Happens To Bitcoin If Inflation Continues To Fall Currently, there are only 18% of SHIB investors seeing a profit, which is one of the lowest margins recorded since the token was first launched in 2020. This puts the vast majority of investors in losses, some more severe than others. To be more precise, a total of 78% of all addresses holding SHIB are nursing losses at current prices. This leaves only a meager 4% of investors sitting at breakeven, meaning that these coins were last moved at prices similar to current market prices. Only 18% of SHIB holders in profit | Source: IntoTheBlock However, unlike holder profitability, the duration of which these investors are holding their coins has been growing. There are now more long-term SHIB holders than there have ever been with 68% of holders having held their coins for more than a year. Mid-term holders that have held between 1-12 months make up 29%, while only 3% can be classified as short-term holdings, having held for less than a month. SHIB Price Struggles To Hold Up Shiba Inu continues to struggle after falling below support at $0.00001. Since then, the digital asset seems to be in free fall with bulls unable to establish any significant support since then. However, it has not been entirely bad for the meme coin given that it has seen 1.06% gains in the last 24 hours. Although small compared to what investors are used to in the crypto market, it shows some resistance from bulls against sellers. SHIB struggles to recover | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com Now, SHIB is well below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages which puts it well on a bearish trend in the short to mid-term. The only hope would be for bulls to rally support t $0.0000085 which could eventually serve as a bounce-off point for future increases. Otherwise, a fall to $0.000007 could be programmed.

The exchange filed for bankruptcy on Monday, citing regulatory uncertainty, after its assets under management had fallen nearly 80% in just two years.  Susheel Kirpalani, representing Bittrex, said the firm had not indulged in the kind of bad behavior that has been alleged of others in the crypto industry – and perhaps had suffered financially because of that.  “Bittrex did not hypothecate, or loan out, or put at risk any of its customers’ deposits,” Kirpalani said. “As a result, it also has difficulty generating revenues, particularly if the regulatory environment that it operates in restricts or starts questioning the ability to permit trading.”  “We will do everything within our power that we can reach customers who, for whatever reason, have gone dark,” Kirpalani added, saying that he believed there will be a “substantial amount” of estate assets that go unclaimed.  The U.S. arm holds $50 million in customer cash and $250 million in customer crypto, and the Maltese operating company which has also filed for bankruptcy has $120 million in customer cash and crypto, Kirpalani said, with assets matching liabilities in each of those cases.  Kirpalani, of law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, also cited as estate assets over $3 million of the company’s own cash and crypto.  The company had a median value of just $566 million of assets under management in 2023, down from $2.7 billion in 2021, he said. Together with Bittrex Global GmbH and a Bermuda entity – two affiliates catering for non-U.S. business which haven’t filed for bankruptcy – the company has 1.5 million active users, of which 600,000 are in the U.S, Kirpalani added.  Bittrex announced its intention to wind down in the U.S. on March 31, citing an uncertain regulatory and economic environment. On April 17, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the company had failed to register as an exchange, broker or clearing agency, an allegation which Bittrex executives have said they will challenge.  A further hearing under Judge Brendan Shannon has been set for June 7.

42420483,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq42H,1683734072,"Urbit, a Network Older and Weirder Than Bitcoin, Finally Turns Toward Growth","Urbit isn’t a blockchain, but it was started seven years before bitcoin, with a similar idea of attempting to create a peer-to-peer network that is free from the influence of big companies or the government.  That’s a key reason Urbit often gets discussed in the context of crypto and invited to blockchain-industry conferences. One doesn’t have to spend a lot of time on the Urbit Foundation’s website to come across some of the themes popular among blockchain advocates - the idea of trying to short-circuit middlemen and centralized applications that dominate online activity. “We think the internet can’t be saved. The way things are going, MEGACORP will always control our apps and services because we can no longer run them ourselves,” the site reads.  Read more: Urbit Courts DAOs, Crypto Teams in Quest to Make Internet P2P Again (2022)  Users are identified on the network by their Urbit IDs – four-syllable pronounceable names generated by an algorithm from a number, then registered as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. (For example, according to the website, the Urbit ID ~dalwel-fadrun ties back to the number 3,509,632,436.)  “Your Urbit ID is meant to feel a bit like a secret code name,” the website reads. “We want Urbit to be a single, simple interface for your whole digital life.”  This sort of clubbiness, of course, is a major part of the exercise with any blockchain ecosystem, where building a community of staunch followers is one of the hardest parts. And lately, Urbit appears to be getting some traction.  The chart above indicates the user base is growing briskly, with the caveat than an individual can own multiple ""ships,"" or identities. Such growth is partly due to the introduction of personal-server hosting services and better user interfaces that made it easier for normies (non-technical types) to join. The number of developers has doubled over the past year; there’s now about 90 monthly active developers working on the project – on par with some of the 20 largest blockchain projects.  “For a long time Urbit wasn’t really growing at all,” acknowledges Josh Lehman aka ~wolref-podlex, executive director of the Urbit Foundation. “It was just enthusiasts.”  Urbit recently got some exposure to a general audience, after getting a mention in a Vanity Fair article, while another writer spent an entire weekend following attendees around Urbit’s own “Assembly” conference in Miami last September and then chronicling every detail gonzo-style. (Excerpt: “I meet two girls from Minnesota who learned about Urbit on a podcast and wanted to see if they could learn any tricks for building their fashion brand by coming here.”)  The conference also had some prominent speakers, including Balaji Srinivasan, garnering further conversation about the network. Srinivasan, the entrepreneur and “Network State” author who more recently grabbed headlines for his unsuccessful $1 million bitcoin bet, was a keynote speaker at the Miami conference. ""Urbit wants to actually be a cathedral,"" Srinivasan said, in a video recording of the talk. ""It's a bit of a bazaar, but it's currently a bit of a bizarre cathedral.""  Origin story  Urbit describes itself as an operating system and a network where users keep data on personal servers; that way, users control any data they need to function on the network, unlike many blockchains where data is preserved on-chain – a feature that’s often championed for the transparency benefits. Then, using the Urbit peer-to-peer network, users simply interact with each other and keep local records of those interactions.  Curtis Yarvin, a computer scientist, started the project in 2002 - long before Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper was published in October 2008. His fringe political views, associated with what’s known as the “Dark Enlightenment"" or “neo-reactionary movement” were so pronounced that they were hard to ignore in any conversation about Urbit.  Read more:Urbit Is Web3, Weird and Wonderful and I Don’t Care Who Made It (2022)  In 2019 Yarvin (aka ~sorreg-namtyv) stepped down as CTO, board member and voting shareholder of Tlon, the company that previously sponsored Urbit’s development, writing at the time, “From the very start, I knew Urbit could not succeed until it ceased to be mine and became the world’s.”  “Urbit is not uniformly excellent quite yet,” Yarvin wrote. “There are a few medium-sized cleanups in the near-term pipeline. But this is a matter of months, not years. I don't see any unknown unknowns,” he said.  According to the Urbit Foundation's website, the non-profit was established in 2021 when it split off from Tlon, a private company formed in 2013 to work on the network.  Advocates for Urbit are quick to claim that the underlying programming language is simple and elegant because it only needed to solve the problem of how to best create a peer-to-peer network. The entire Urbit operating system supposedly compiles down to 33 lines of code, known as “Nock.”  There are plenty of Urbit talking points that sound like core arguments for Web3 – the imagined next iteration of the internet, which would promote decentralized protocols while reducing dependency on large tech companies like Youtube, Netflix and Amazon.  One example from Urbit’s website: “For the most part, we use our laptops simply as access points to MEGACORP services. Our phones are the same. These services are amazing and convenient. But for that convenience we’ve traded away control, ownership and privacy.”  One of the Urbit faithful, Hocwyn Tipwex (he no longer uses his real name in a professional context), is co-founder of the Uqbar Network, which is building a zero-knowledge rollup to Ethereum.  He says Urbit’s inherent peer-to-peer design makes it easy to design peer-to-peer applications and decentralized apps known as dapps. So far there are apps for chatting and social media as well as poker on the Urbit network.  “Peer-to-peer infrastructure is harder than it looks,” Tipwex said last month at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference in Austin, Texas.  What’s also hard is building a community to rally around any project, crypto or otherwise. Urbit’s weird, little band of devout followers with secret code names might serve as a decent start as the project tries to build a bigger and more user-friendly ecosystem. Projects like Tipwex’s show how the network might ultimately bleed into crypto.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/10/urbit-a-network-older-and-weirder-than-bitcoin-finally-turns-toward-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff3c602eb42767fbcf21a2f21e1e95e733a6f883-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Only a handful of assets may drive the majority of the wealth creation in this asset class.  Historically speaking, bitcoin (BTC) has been the primary wealth creator in the asset class. Simple, passive portfolios have underperformed BTC over most calendar years and over a multiyear, full-market cycle.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  We compared BTC’s returns to passive, market-cap weighted portfolios of the top 10, 25, 50, and 100 tokens over the past five years. None of these passive portfolios were able to outperform BTC. And some of them lost money over this period. BTC is also one of the lowest volatility digital assets, so this outperformance is impressive on a risk-adjusted basis as well.  It’s not enough to simply hold the top assets and expect they will continue to outperform. Assets that fell out of the top ranks of the market have historically not been able to re-enter. We analyzed the annual rankings of the top digital assets by market cap. If a token fell out of the top 10 or top 100, how often were they able to re-enter? We found that there were 12 assets that fell out of the top 10 rankings, and none were able to re-establish their position in the top 10. There was more turnover in the top 100: 115 assets fell out of the ranking, and only 12, or 10%, were able to re-enter.  This analysis suggests that value investing in digital assets may be challenging. An asset that has fallen out of favor and may look cheap relative to others has historically had a difficult time outpacing the market to re-establish its highly ranked position.  If you’re going to invest in digital asset markets, we believe it’s best to either buy and HODL BTC or use active management to outperform by finding the tokens that have the fundamental momentum and potential to rise into the top ranks of the market.

42420480,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq3y9,1683732600,Web3 Represents a Strong Alternative to Today’s Internet,"With all of the back and forth regarding the efficacy of cryptocurrencies, I find myself more and more looking for use cases outside traditional “currency” definitions, i.e. that which is used primarily for transactions, where a unit of account is traded for a product or service.  Doing so often brings me to arenas that while well known to many in the crypto community, are still relatively green space for me. As a markets-based professional, I attempt to be transparent in my crypto journey. While there are many topics that I have a significant degree of comfort with, Web3 is an area where I see opportunities to increase my base of knowledge.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Conceptually, the value proposition for Web3 makes perfect sense to me. Web 1.0 covered the earliest days of the text-based internet, an era of read-only websites that users “surfed” to consume content written by others.  Roughly two decades ago, Web 2.0 emerged, representing an expansion of the “read” era, characterized by users’ ability to contribute their own content, interact with others in real time via social media and garner attention for themselves (both good and bad) via their actions. This is commonly referred to as the “read-write” era, and incorporates a lot of what we do in our day to day lives.  Web3 is meant to add the concept of “ownership” to the first two, where users have control over their data, payments within the network are done on a peer-to-peer basis and data itself is decentralized, rather than being warehoused by a few centralized entities.  But why is this important? Well, speaking for myself, I’ll say this. We’re all the sum of our own experiences, to one extent or the next. And those experiences can often be distilled down into individual data points that can tell what we’ve done in the past, and heavily infer what we may likely do in the future.  Simply by interacting with this very content, you’ve likely revealed something about yourself – to an entity that you’re unaware of and that you may or may not be comfortable with.  Those pieces of information about yourself are extremely valuable to third-party businesses, some of which have built billion-dollar operations with all of our personal data at its foundation. And like an undisciplined fan revealing the ending of a movie, we’re all essentially just giving it away.  In many ways, we’ve exchanged our data as the price of admission to centralized protocols with robust networks. One mental model would be the idea that everything that you use in the physical space is rented, from your house, down to your shoes.  As far as content creation is concerned, that which you create is within your control only to the extent that the centralized entity allows. In these instances you are surrendering personal data and what amounts to intellectual property.  Web3 would conceivably turn that concept on its head, resulting in users having complete ownership and control over their data and content, with digital assets or tokens – see, there’s an angle here for a crypto publication – providing each user with property rights.  Instead of businesses being given unfettered access to your personal habits and preferences, they would conceivably have to compensate you for it.  As an individual, you would personally warehouse your own inventory of data and tokens, which you would bring with you from protocol to protocol, supplying and removing them as you see fit.  In an ideal world, the attractiveness of robust networks that we find in centralized networks would be married with greater ownership of personal data, with the blockchain acting as a trustless and permissionless vehicle to govern peer-to-peer interaction.  And if we can own something that truthfully belongs to us, and decide how and to what extent we want it distributed, I expect that people will find value in that.  So why doesn’t this already have widespread adoption? For starters, I expect that scalability is a real issue. Widespread adoption is needed for Web3 to work effectively.  Moreover, users need to not only believe in the concept of Web3 itself, but also must see value in the tokens that are used as incentive mechanisms.  It stands to reason that inertia will be a huge factor in users transitioning from the current way that they interact on the internet to a Web3 framework. People are comfortable with Web 2.0, even if that comfort level is displayed by seemingly grinning and bearing the loss of privacy and transfer of personal information.  Moral issues, for lack of a better term, will likely present a hurdle as well. It goes without saying that not all content creation is good content creation. The reduction of one’s digital footprint will likely incentivize some to produce content that is illegal and/or deemed harmful. This is not to cast aspersions or make judgements, as much as it is to highlight what I believe would be a reality.  For all of the ills regarding scalability and legality, I believe that time and innovation will be the antidote.  In my opinion, the ability to maintain ownership of one’s personal information, while maintaining the right to monetize it themselves, is something that will grow in favor.  The professional investing community appears to agree as well, with companies like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Disney and Apple exploring the benefits of Web3 or investing capital into the space.  From a market perspective, assets like Chainlink (LINK), Filecoin(FIL) and Audius (AUDIO) represent ways to gain exposure to Web3 development. The same holds true for protocols such as Ledgermail, Presearch (PRE) and DTube (DTUBE), whose Web 2.0 analogs would be email, Google and YouTube.  All told, I believe that Web3 has a long way to go, but remains well on its way to getting there. I have yet to reach the individual who speaks favorably about the extent to which they lack control over the dispersion of their data.  It only makes sense to me that the alternative would be viewed in good terms. But it will take time, patience and innovation before many see it.  – Glenn C. Williams Jr., CMT  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here’s some news worth reading:  BITCOIN TURMOIL: As often discussed here and elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC) has had a terrific year as an asset, zooming higher by a hard-to-believe degree amid an avalanche of bad news. It has also been a time of, let’s say, creativity around how to use the Bitcoin blockchain, with the emergence of what amounts to NFTs (called ordinals) now offered on the protocol. But this has caused strains in the ecosystem, triggering a surge in transaction fees that was so intense that Binance temporarily halted BTC withdrawals. It’s also shaking up the economics of bitcoin mining in a way that miners may welcome, especially given the pain the industry has suffered over the past year or so. The big question is this: Ordinals are a relatively modest addition to the blockchain, and they’re creating problems. Could Bitcoin handle a bigger (but not necessarily big) flood of mainstream use as a transaction processing platform?  PEPE MILLIONS: The rise of meme coin pepecoin (PEPE) has been covered lots of ways. A relatively fun way of looking at it is this: It turned somebody’s $263 pittance into a more than $10 million fortune in just a few weeks. (Past performance does not guarantee future results, etc.) The point of bringing this up in an institutional-focused newsletter is not to spark a run into PEPE – and recent returns have been terrible, presumably as newly PEPE rich folks pare back. Is this a sign of unsustainable froth for the whole crypto market? Is this the kind of thing regulators and politicians will seek to tamp down? Am I overthinking this? Time will tell.  NORTH CAROLINA: The movement against central bank digital currencies (CBDC) notched a victory last week as North Carolina’s House of Representatives passed a bill that would ban state agencies from receiving CBDCs as payment. Not being able to pay bills to a single state would be a pretty minor setback for these government-issued digital currencies, but the unanimous passage of this particular piece of legislation may say something about the prospects for getting crypto-y things incorporated into everyday American life anytime soon.  FTX’S BILLIONS: FTX is seeking to get $4 billion back from Genesis Global Capital (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group). Both (arguably systemically important) companies are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The reverberations from last year’s crypto collapses continue.

Despite today’s profits, the cryptocurrency has recorded a 2.2% loss in the past seven days as of this writing. Crypto Exchange Bleed Bitcoin? Data Clears The Air Crypto analytics firm Jarvis Labs shared data from two sources regarding the Bitcoin liquidity on exchanges to address these concerns. The first piece of data comes from Conor Ryder, a researcher at Kaiko, who claimed that Bitcoin’s market depth on exchanges remains unchanged. The data is associated with Binance’s U.S. subsidiary, where investors pay a premium to purchase BTC compared to other platforms, such as Coinbase and Kraken. The premium emerged due to Binance.US losing the capacity to provide an efficient crypto-to-fiat offramp. The U.S. crypto exchange has been suffering after losing its bank connection due to increased scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The analyst stated the following while sharing the chart below: People spotting a BTC premium on Binance US and seem to be jumping the gun saying its a big market maker pulling funds. No change in market depth on the exchange makes me nearly certain this isn’t the case yet IMO more likely Binance US offering slower USD withdrawal times after their struggles to get banked (…). The chart above shows that BTC’s market depth has seen almost no changes since late April. The rumors about marketmakers leaving the space began circulating due to a Bloomberg report claiming that two of the largest, Jane Street and Jump, are scaling back on their crypto trading operations. The decision follows an increase in regulatory oversight, but it only seems to apply to the U.S. market. According to Kaiko and liquidity provider Macro Cephalopod, international crypto trading venues seem unaffected. Here you go, average quoted size at bbo for Binance BTCUSDT (in USDT) plotted with volatility, as you can see there is almost no change since start of Apr, and the main determinant of top of book size is vol (when vol goes up, MMs quote smaller, when it drops MMs quote bigger) https://t.co/MtV5CcsfP5 pic.twitter.com/KTWCdZRsU5 — cephalopod (@macrocephalopod) May 10, 2023 Related Reading: Ripple CEO Rebuts WeBlogs Founder’s Claims That XRP Is A Security In that sense, Bitcoin’s liquidity and market depth is liquidity to change in the short term except for U.S.-based crypto investors.

42420475,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq3rx,1683730056,We Need Regulatory Clarity to Keep Crypto Exchanges Onshore and DeFi Permissionless,"At Consensus 2023, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) voiced their goals of developing legislation to clarify crypto market structure in the United States, with a House proposal expected in the next two months.  Today, in a joint hearing of the digital assets subcommittees of the House Agriculture and House Financial Services committees, work proceeds to resolve what Congressman French Hill (R-AR) has referred to as “an impossible situation, where the same firms are subject to competing enforcement actions” by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), “pushing entrepreneurs, developers, and job creators offshore.”  Jack Solowey is a Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives (CMFA), focusing on financial technology, crypto, and DeFi. Jennifer J. Schulp is the Director of Financial Regulation Studies at the CMFA, where she focuses on the regulation of securities and capital markets.  This is an impossible situation and it is manifestly unwise for the U.S. to show the door to those working on what may be the next generation of global financial infrastructure. Congress must bring regulatory clarity to crypto market structure, defining the bounds and appropriate legal treatment of crypto securities, crypto commodities, and the exchanges – both centralized (CEXs) and decentralized (DEXs) – over which they trade.  Notwithstanding the skepticism and evasions of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, crypto’s core innovation – decentralization – is the proper criterion by which to rationalize digital asset market structure and determine whether applying traditional financial regulations to crypto tokens and exchanges makes sense.  The phrase “same activity, same risk, same regulation” is oft-repeated by financial regulators. But as applied to crypto it raises the question: are the risks the same?  Specifically, do crypto projects present the risks that issuers (in the primary market) or intermediaries (in the secondary market) can exploit their position to harm token purchasers – by, for example, abusing nonpublic information, misleading market participants, breaking promises, or otherwise engaging in fraud?  Read more: Nicholas Anthony and Norbert Michel - Who Really Benefits From CBDCs? It’s Not the Public  When projects are truly decentralized – where there is no creator promising performance but simply an open-source protocol executing transactions – the answer tends to be “no.” Accordingly, legacy financial regulations must be adapted to crypto projects’ actual risk profiles, through tailored compliance pathways and the removal of inappropriate obligations.  Secondary market regulation traditionally seeks to address “intermediary risks” – for example, will middlemen safely custody customer assets, are transactions and trading practices transparent, and are market participants protected from fraudulent and deceptive market manipulation? Centralized and decentralized exchanges do not present the same risks on these fronts.  Centralized exchanges typically custody customer assets, settle transactions off-chain, and have opaque transaction records. Therefore, CEX users may reasonably ask how an exchange will custody assets, secure data, share best price information, and protect them from fraudulent and deceptive trading practices. Yet, instead of addressing these issues with a straightforward compliance path, U.S. regulators have created a Kafkaesque trap, refusing to provide a practical registration option while nonetheless threatening legal action against those who don’t register.  A new framework  Our proposed framework for centralized exchanges would directly target these problems. We propose a tailored registration path for crypto commodity CEXs administered by the CFTC, whereby CEXs provide price transparency and disclose their custody, cybersecurity, and anti-manipulation policies. These disclosures, subject to CFTC antifraud authority, will allow consumers to choose the exchanges that best suit their needs.  For crypto securities exchanges, we propose amendments to the Securities Exchange Act’s broker-dealer registration requirements, a new crypto-specific alternative trading system rule, and a free-market oriented cost-benefit framework for SEC rulemaking. Combined, these updates seek to modernize securities regulations to suit the reality of crypto marketplaces dealing directly with retail customers, as well as remove the SEC’s perennial Sword of Damocles – regulation by enforcement – which stymies good-faith developers in the U.S.  DEXs face a different regulatory challenge beyond the typical SEC gaslighting on registration. Specifically, 20th century financial regulations designed for financial intermediaries are inapt when applied to disintermediated software protocols.  Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs leverage self-executing smart contracts to remove the middleman from essential exchange functions. While some can be accused of “decentralization theater,”in their purest form, DEXs operate without the discretionary control of a single person or unified group, do not custody the assets of users trading tokens, and settle transactions on open and auditable public blockchains. Therefore, applying traditional custody and market transparency rules to DEXs is at best unhelpful, and, at worst, counterproductive.  With that said, DEXs do face market manipulation risks, including practices like wash trading, spoofing, and layering. But the costs of requiring DEXs to implement pre-cleared anti-manipulation measures outweigh the potential gains. Because DEXs are public, regulators and others have access to transaction data without relying on a DEX to police the marketplace. Moreover, permissionless DEX iteration itself should be allowed to drive competition and enhance consumer protection.  Therefore, our framework calls for strictly voluntary, not mandatory, DEX registration to embrace the competitive benefits of rapid DEX development without prior restraint. DEXs that want to signal their compliance with the same standards as CEXs – for example, through automated controls – can do so with voluntary registration. But making registration optional allows for greater experimentation in consumer protections, as DEXs need not seek pre-approval from inherently risk-averse regulators before launching novel technical safeguards. In addition, voluntary registration avoids creating adverse selection, where low natural barriers to entry in an open-source software ecosystem could allow rogue DEXs to gain first mover advantages while compliance-oriented projects are stalled by a regulatory approval process.  Furthermore, optional registration keeps DeFi truly permissionless – not simply as a technical matter, but also as a regulatory one – recognizing the creative potential of an open and maximally interoperable ecosystem to deliver a greater variety of products and services. Permissionless innovation is not merely a buzzword. It’s an integral component of the original U.S. builder culture that organized solutions to practical challenges without the prior authorization or direction of authorities and made the U.S. an economic juggernaut.  As the economic historian Niall Ferguson wrote of the risks posed by overly constricting crypto regulation: “If we have learned nothing else from the past half-century, it is surely that the best way to win a race with totalitarian rivals is not to copy them, but to out-innovate them” and “[t]he American way is to let innovation rip.”  Hear, hear.  U.S. policymakers ought to let crypto innovation rip by providing realistic registration pathways for centralized exchanges to operate onshore and allowing permissionless competition to deliver the benefits of decentralized exchanges. Regulators should not fear American markets’ creative potential. They should fear extinguishing it with impossible regulation.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Jack Solowey, Jennifer J.

42420469,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq3kj,1683729938,Joint U.S. House Hearing on Crypto’s Future Opens With Discord,"The unusual joint meeting of the two most crypto-relevant committees in the U.S. House of Representatives was called to work out the best legislative approach to digital assets, but one of the top Democrats questioned whether Congress should be writing a bill at all.  The hearing of both the House Financial Services Committee and House Agriculture Committee was called Wednesday as an urgent response to the lack of government oversight of a financial sector that’s passing through a period of turmoil. The group included the Republican chairs and ranking Democrats of the committees and the subcommittees doing the work, among them Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), the senior Democrat on the digital assets subcommittee, who threw cold water on the idea of legislation.  “I’m worried that erecting a new law could be viewed as a light touch,” Lynch said in his opening remarks, and it could encourage other sectors to move their own financial products into the digital-assets space. “Creating a separate regulatory regime through legislation is not the answer.”  In his own brief opener, House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) said, ""the purpose here is to make law.” His Democratic counterpart, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), seemed to agree, talking of the need to “quickly return to developing legislation together.”  Lynch’s rhetoric, however, linked closely with that of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, who routinely says current securities law provides ample authority to his agency to hold the crypto industry to that existing regulation.  Lynch, who argued “the majority of the industry has failed,” said that the SEC has a responsibility to protect investors and uses a longstanding legal framework that crypto businesses are ignoring.  “The problem is not regulatory ambiguity,” he said. “It is mass non-compliance.”  But Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), the chairman of the finance panel's digital assets subcommittee, suggested the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) case against Binance is an example of the CFTC and SEC being on uncertain ground when it comes to policing crypto.  House Republicans posted a draft resolution on the committee website that outlines their current position on crypto oversight. It contends that SEC is going at it badly, and the regulators need to wait for direction from Congress, which should offer up tailored rules for digital assets that establishes the same kinds of investor protections that investors get elsewhere.  ""This committee will act,"" McHenry declared at the end of the hearing. He'd said recently at Consensus 2023 that a crypto market-structure bill would emerge within two months.  Though the Republicans didn't offer concrete elements of their future legislation on Wednesday, Hill asked an industry witness during the hearing whether a method of crypto disclosures proposed by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce in 2021 would be ""a workable one.""  Marco Santori, chief legal officer of Kraken, said the approach is ""light years ahead of what we have today in terms of protecting consumers and allowing us as a global business to continue to plan to invest here in the United States.""

These tokens are worth approximately $81 million at the time of the transactions. Whales Get Busy As Ripple Unlocks Escrow Tokens Whale alert reports that XRP whales moved 168 million XRP across five transactions with the first transaction involving moving 50 million XRP from Crypto.com to an unidentified wallet address. 🚨 🚨 50,000,000 #XRP (21,874,438 USD) transferred from #CryptoCom to unknown wallethttps://t.co/WHqc8giQWt — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 8, 2023 Also, another wallet address transferred 31 million XRP tokens to the Bitstamp exchange, and two Bittrex wallets exchanged 30 million XRP. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Falls Under $80, Is It Time To Buy Now? The most recent whale transaction was the transfer of the batch was 28 million XRP tokens from an unidentified wallet to the Bitstamp exchange. On the other hand, Ripple moved 50 million XRP tokens worth $21.4 million on May 9. Although the tweet from whale alert says Ripple sent the tokens to an unknown address, Bithomp reveals that the receiving wallet belongs to Ripple. Also, this receiving wallet distributed 7.3 million tokens to several addresses. These 50 million XRP tokens are part of Ripple assets recently released from escrow protection in May 2023. Ripple Labs unlocked 1 billion tokens on May 1 to fulfill its monthly escrow executions. However, they returned 700 million XRP to escrow, leaving 300 million tokens. Due to the massive move of coins from Ripple, some Twitter users implied the company was dumping the asset. However, another user negated the impression that dumping would require transferring to Ripple or exchanges. Notably, an attorney supporting Ripple, Bill Morgan, implied that Ripple does not dump its assets in the market. Instead, Ripple buys many XRP tokens for other transactions to meet its growing ODL demand. XRP On A Path To Recovery? XRP is experiencing price volatility as it seeks to mount a price recovery. However, its trading volume is down over 20% today, which might hinder its price recovery efforts. The asset is in a sideways trend, struggling to shake the prevalent bearish pressure. The downward movement has stopped as it bounced off the $0.41 price level. It is currently trading above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a bullish signal for the asset. It implies that its price will likely increase in the long term. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 33.20 and close to the oversold region, a bearish signal. Notably, this indicator is moving sideways, reflecting the current price behavior of the asset today. Also, XRP’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line and shows negative values. It implies that the bears are still active in the market. The coin found support at $0.41353 to move to its current level of $0.43. A decline below $0.41 would drive the asset down to the $0.40141 support and into a downtrend. It faces the $0.43374 price level as its closest resistance, and a break above it will help the asset to retest the $0.44586 resistance level. Expect further price increases ahead if the bulls prevail.

The Consumer Price Index, a key measure of inflation, fell to 4.9% – lower than the expected 5.0%. As a result, crypto prices are climbing. Bitcoin Price Reclaims $28,000 After April CPI Release The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly CPI report this morning, revealing that the key inflation measure dropped to 4.9%.

From the time rates began increasing until the bottom, Bitcoin fell by more than $40,000 in value. But with inflation now cooling off, the system starting to break, and a Presidential election ahead, markets may be about to price in a possible pause in rate hikes.

Last year the European Commission proposed to curb tax evasion using crypto via an eighth amendment to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8), widening an existing law that is intended to prevent taxpayers from stashing taxable assets in hidden overseas bank accounts.  “EU ambassadors have unanimously supported DAC8, paving the way for an adoption by the ECOFIN next week,” commission official Benjamin Angel tweeted Wednesday, referring to the regular meeting of economic and finance ministers that is due to take place in Brussels on May 16.  Angel is director at the commission’s tax department, responsible for shepherding the bill through to becoming a law.  Another EU official, who asked not to be named, told CoinDesk that, though there had been a “positive spirit” from ambassadors on the measures, they had not been formally agreed, as some governments have not yet received procedural approval from national parliaments.  Under Commission plans unveiled in December, which apply to holdings of crypto and some non-fungible tokens (NFTs), any company with EU clients will have to register in the bloc in order to report digital assets to tax authorities.  It follows a move by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) intended to crack down on tax evasion via digital assets.  The commission’s tax proposals could have been vetoed by any of the bloc’s 27 member countries, who meet in a grouping known as the EU’s Council. The Council has so far held discussions on the bill largely behind closed doors, and has not yet published a draft of the agreed text.

Calcanis’ opinions of the native digital currency associated with the Ripple company caused a stir of reactions from the crypto community, earning responses from the likes of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton. Earlier this week, Garlinghouse was featured as a keynote speaker at the Dubai 2023 Fintech Summit and used the platform to talk about the internal costs of the ongoing legal battle with the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Only 6% Left Until Cardano Hits Max Capacity, What This Means For ADA The CEO’s statements on the monetary costs of the Ripple-SEC legal battle were seen to be the origin and factor driving Calacanis’s controversial remarks.

While the company has made countless efforts over the years to debunk this claim, CEO Brad Garlinghouse mentioned at the Dubai Fintech Summit that Ripple will have spent $200 million fighting the SEC lawsuit. On making this statement at the summit, Weblogs founder Jason Calcanis took to his official Twitter handle, saying, “XRP is obviously a security,” and it would have cost little for the team at Ripple to have registered it as a security and played by the rules just like everyone else in the industry does all day long. The tweet by Calcanis was met with counter comments and opinions from top players in the crypto industry, including Garlinghouse. The Ripple boss responded to Calcani’s tweet calling it wrongful and an embarrassment as there is no framework to register digital assets in the US. remind me when you learned securities law?! This is embarrassing for you (and hilariously wrong as there is no framework to register digital assets in the US), but we're all used to you making controversial statements and trolling about things you know nothing about… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 9, 2023 Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton also chipped in comments in defense of the cryptocurrency by saying that claiming Ripple sold XRP as a security is quite different from being a security itself. Deaton responded to Calcanis, saying, “XRP is a line of code inside software. How do you register? ‘to have registered it as a security and played by the rules like everyone else.’ Where did ETH, ADA, ALGO, XLM, etc. register?” Deaton countered. Ripple Remains Undeterred Ripple continues to persevere amid crypto regulatory uncertainties in the US and speculations about when a ruling will finally come in their legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. As stated earlier, Garlinghouse mentioned the large sum of $200 million spent defending the company against the SEC lawsuit, which shows their commitment to emerging victorious.

After launch, Vega will offer support for cash-settled futures markets initially – allowing users to deploy strategies to profit from their price gyrations.  Vega token (VEGA) stakers can propose and vote on the creation of new derivatives markets, and traders can trade without paying gas fees, a developer told CoinDesk over Telegram. VEGA is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, and it interacts with the Vega blockchain over an Ethereum-to-Vega bridge.  Market makers can operate as they would on any other orderbook-based exchange, and can commit capital on-chain as liquidity providers to earn a portion of trading fees.  Importantly, traders will not require the vega token to use the protocol. There are no separate gas fees on Vega for these placing orders or trading, so for many users, unlike most other DeFi protocols, only the tokens being traded are required.  As such, trading on Vega is expected to begin in a ""period of several weeks before markets and trading functionality go live, in accordance with governance processes conducted by Vega token stakers,"" developers told CoinDesk over email.  Vega Protocol offers no gas fees on trading at low latency and has a feature to discourage front running that developers say will attract traders to the protocol. Front running is a frowned-on practice in which a market maker or trader buys a token and then sells it on in the same transaction for a slightly higher price.

For the month of April, the CPI rose 0.4% against expectations for 0.4% and versus 0.1% in March.  The core CPI – which strips out food and energy costs – rose 0.40% in April versus forecasts for 0.4% and March's 0.4% advance. The annual core CPI rate in April was 5.5% versus forecasts for 5.5% and March's 5.6%.  At its last meeting earlier in May, the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicated it's considering at least a pause in its historic run of rate increases that's seen the central bank take the benchmark fed funds rate from about 0% in early 2022 to the current targeted range of 5.0%-5.25%. While that fast pace of rate hikes hasn't succeeded in bringing inflation down to the Fed's 2% target, the central bank also has its eyes on the growing troubles in the U.S. banking system, which has led to the failure of a number of regional lenders, most recently First Republic Bank.

Here’s why this may be bullish. Bitcoin Funding Rates On BitMEX Have Plunged To Deep Red Values As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC felt a bullish boost the last time this pattern was observed. The “funding rate” is an indicator that measures the number of periodic fees that futures traders on a derivative exchange are currently exchanging between each other. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the holders of long contracts are currently paying a premium to the short holders in order to keep their positions. Such a trend implies that the majority of the investors on the exchange hold a bullish sentiment right now. On the other hand, negative values of the indicator suggest the shorts are overwhelming the longs at the moment. Naturally, this kind of trend is a sign of a bearish mentality being more dominant among the futures traders on the platform. In the context of the current discussion, the relevant derivative exchange is BitMEX. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin funding rates for this platform over the last year and a half: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite red in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin funding rates on the BitMEX exchange have taken a plummet toward deep negative values recently. This means that a large number of short contracts are piling up on the platform in comparison to long contracts. Related Reading: oin Plunge Under $28,000 Only Temporary? This Metric Suggests So Generally, when the futures market becomes too unbalanced towards any one side, a sharp price move in the opposite direction to what the investors are heavily betting on becomes more probable. This is because a mass liquidation event, called a “squeeze,” is generally more likely to take place towards the side that has more contracts open. In a squeeze, a swing in the price triggers a large amount of simultaneous liquidations and these liquidations only end up fueling said move further in return. A cascade of liquidations can then occur thanks to this amplified price move. Since the funding rates on BitMEX are heavily lopsided towards the negative side right now, a short squeeze is a possibility in the near term. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator displayed a similar trend just earlier in the year. This negative spike in March occurred as Bitcoin’s price plunged below the $20,000 level, but these red values were only temporary, as a short squeeze took place not too long after and lead to BTC recovering in spectacular fashion. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Falls Under $80, Is It Time To Buy Now? The metric observed some even more negative values following the November 2022 FTX crash, but the price didn’t see any appreciable surge following them. Though, nonetheless, Bitcoin still saw the bottom coincide with the red BitMEX funding rates. It now remains to be seen whether the pattern that was seen in March 2022 repeats this time as well, with BTC observing a short squeeze that reverses the current decline.

The EY OpsChain ESG made the announcement at the firm’s Global Blockchain Summit in London. The platform is now available in beta version on the EY Blockchain SaaS platform.  The system uses carbon emission tokens developed by standards body the Microsoft-backed InterWork Alliance, part of the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC), of which EY is also a member.  Over the past few years, enterprises have looked to blockchain technology to track and trace elements of their workflows, from trade finance to food products.

In principle, as a European Union (EU) member, Hungary is obliged to join the euro but has not appeared in any great rush to set a date for abandoning its own currency, the forint.  Many European authorities, including central banks responsible for the pound, euro and Swedish krona, are actively exploring whether to issue their currencies in digital form. The European Central Bank is due later this year to decide whether to start developing a digital euro, and in the U.K. the Bank of England has said a digital pound is “likely” to be needed in future.  “For the moment we don't see any imminent need for large scale retail CBDC to be introduced” by regular citizens and merchants, Anikó Szombati, Chief Digital Officer of the Hungarian Central Bank, said at an event hosted by think tank the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.  But, she added, “we are also exploring the possibilities for issuing a central bank digital currency” via a series of pilots, and “would like to remain in the forefront of CBDC research.”  Studies by international standard-setter the Bank for International Settlements suggest that 9 in 10 central banks from around the world are exploring a CBDC.  “In considering CBDC, you first have to identify your motivation based on either severe market failure or a very strong policy objective,” Szombati said, adding that getting more people into the financial system could offer one incentive, with 13% of Hungarian adults not having bank accounts.

PEPE peaked shortly after Binance announced the listing of PEPE. Since then, the meme coin has fallen 57% from its all-time high. However, PEPE madness could go into overtime, as the latest whale transactions show. As reported by on-chain data service Lookonchain, whales are adding to their PEPE holdings in hopes of another furious price rally. Whales Favor Longs On PEPE? On-chain analytics service reported Tuesday that three whales began accumulating Pepe tokens earlier this week amid a price drop of nearly 50%. One address withdrew $1.4 trillion worth of PEPE from Binance when the price was $0.000002054. Another large investor bought PEPE with 223 ETH worth $429,000, at a price of $0.000001942. A third whale acquired 424 trillion PEPE worth $864,000, at a price of $0.000001957. 3 whales started to buy $PEPE after the price dropped. 0x50C1 withdrew 1.4T $PEPE($2.76M) from #Binance when the price was $0.000002054. 0x2Baa bought 212B $PEPE($429K) with 223 $ETH($412K) at $0.000001942. 0x3AE8 bought 424B $PEPE($864K) with 450 $ETH($831K) at $0.000001957. pic.twitter.com/Y3wFOshkDI — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 9, 2023 However, not all whales share this opinion. As crypto intelligence firm Arkam reports, user “pepeworldorder.eth” sold $800,000 of PEPE on Uniswap today. “With an $800M market cap, pepeworldorder only needed to sell 0.1% of the supply to receive this. His account still holds 1T PEPE, or $1.92M,” Arkham wrote via Twitter. In addition, data from the last few days shows that other whales are also having doubts about the continuation of the meme coin rally. Related Reading: PEPE Whale Who Earned $14.5M Turns To Turbo, Is This The Next Big Thing? On May 8, Lookonchain reported that Master Ventures sold all of PEPE, WOJAK, and SPONGE. In total, the company sold 352 billion PEPE for $770,000 USDT at $0.000002185, making a profit of about $470,000. It also sold $194,000 worth of WOJAK ($34,000 profit) and 15 million worth of SPONGE for $15,663 USDT ($10,000 profit). On the other hand, another well-known crypto whale, Machi Big Brother, bought 6 billion PEPE again today. The crypto entrepreneur, whose real name is Jeffrey Huang, has bought a total of 66 billion PEPE with 73.4 ETH worth $137,000 in the last 3 days, with an average buying price of $0.000002082. Yet another whale has bought 962.3 billion PEPE (over $2 million) with 70 WBTC and 470 ETH since May 5, with an average buy price of $0.000003122, currently posting a huge loss. Related Reading: Crypto Whale Suffers $500,000 Loss As PEPE Price Plummets All in all, a slight majority of large investors seem to prefer longs. Small investors should still be cautious. As NewsBTC reported, meme coins are a “game” of whales. Moreover, Lookonchain reported on Monday that the top 15 holders of PEPE (excluding exchanges and contract addresses) hold a total of 38.07 trillion PEPE, 9.05% of the total supply. They all made extreme profits on PEPE, with a total profit of $92.6 million and an average purchase price of just $0.0000000853. Popular analyst @ApeDurden is short PEPE.

42420481,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq41F,1683715678,Bitcoin Tends to Become More Volatile Around Monthly U.S. Inflation Releases: Kaiko,"On Wednesday, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 UTC), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the consumer price index (CPI) for April.  The headline CPI inflation figure is forecast to stay unchanged at 5% and the core figure, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have increased by 5.5% following March's 5.6% increase, according to Reuters estimates published by FXStreet.  Bitcoin (BTC) has historically seen increased intraday volatility in the six-hour window before and after the inflation data, according to Dessislava Aubert, a research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko.  In the above chart, the blue line indicates the average hourly volatility for the month as measured by the absolute hourly price return. The orange line represents volatility within the six-hour CPI window.  The blue line has steadily declined over the past two years, with the orange line trending north, particularly since April 2022. The orange circles have consistently printed above the blue circles, a sign the monthly inflation data tends to inject extra volatility into the market.  ""The intraday volatility, especially around data releases, remains above average. This trend will continue as the U.S. Federal Reserve made it clear last week that monetary policy will be even more data-dependent,"" Aubert said in an email.  In other words, bitcoin could see heightened price turbulence (price swings in either direction) later today. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading flat at around $27,620, per CoinDesk data.  The Federal Reserve (Fed) raised rates by 25 basis points last week, lifting the benchmark borrowing costs to the 5%-5.25% range. While the policy statement opened the doors for a pause in the rate hike cycle, Fed chair Jerome Powell maintained the data-dependent stance during the post-meeting press conference.  Therefore, an above-forecast inflation reading might strengthen the case for continued rate hikes, bringing pain to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. On the flip side, bitcoin may see volatility on the higher side if the data misses expectations.  The Fed kicked off its tightening cycle 14 months ago to control rampant inflation and has raised rates by 500 basis points since then. The liquidity tightening roiled cryptocurrencies last year.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/10/bitcoin-tends-to-become-more-volatile-around-monthly-us-inflation-readings-kaiko,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9607a8fc93aea488d2954cf166c47cb86450f649-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420478,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq3w5,1683714165,Three Arrows Founder Su Zhu Obtains Singapore Restraining Order Against Arthur Hayes Over 'Harassment',"Su Zhu, a co-founder of defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), has obtained a restraining order against Arthur Hayes, a co-founder of the BitMEX trading platform, from a Singapore court.  The order, dated May 5 and seen by CoinDesk, prohibits Hayes from using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words"" and ""making any threatening, abusive or insulting communication, that would cause the Applicant harassment, alarm or distress.""  The former BitMEX CEO has been tweeting at Zhu and his 3AC partner Kyle Davies, mainly asking for $6 million he says is owed following the collapse of the fund last year.  Harassment Court Judge Sandra Looi Ai Lin's order says Hayes is not allowed to communicate with Zhu ""by any means,"" and prohibits him from publishing ""any identity information."" The ruling can be served to Hayes via his Twitter account, the order said.  Hayes and Zhu have become controversial figures in the crypto industry. Zhu, after the 3AC collapse sent ripple effects through the industry, and Hayes as he avoided a prison sentence with six-months' home detention after pleading guilty in February 2022 to U.S. federal charges he didn't implement anti-money laundering (AML) checks at his exchange.  Court filings have showed 3AC owes upwards of $1 billion in individual claims. Zhu and Davies, meantime, moved to launch OPNX, a platform that lets investors trade bankruptcy claims for collapsed firms like FTX and CoinFLEX. The two went silent after 3AC folded, surfacing only in July with a Bloomberg interview – which Hayes mocked on Twitter – where they said the fund's failure was ""regrettable.""  Through tweets, Hayes has criticized attempts by the two to raise funds for their new platform. In one dated April 6, he said he'd heard Zhu and Davies raised ""big money"" from a sovereign wealth fund in Bahrain.  ""Be warned. I want my f****** money,"" the tweet said.  Hayes, meanwhile, has set up his own crypto fund, Maelstrom.  CoinDesk has reached out to the Singapore Judiciary and Zhu for further comment and has contacted Hayes over Twitter for a response.

The daily chart of Dogecoin was overly bearish, with trading volumes stunted and negative sentiment growing among investors. In the face of the recent downturn in Dogecoin’s fortunes, many investors are grappling with the question of whether it’s time to cut their losses and move on. The bearish trend in the Dogecoin daily chart has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the future of this once-popular cryptocurrency. As the popular meme coin struggles to regain its footing, investors are left to ponder what factors have contributed to its decline. Related Reading: PEPE Token Futures Cast Gloom For Investors As Prices Plummet By 45% Uncertainty Looms As Dogecoin Faces Price Slump DOGE has experienced a bearish breakout from its previous price consolidation range since May 8, according to TradingView. This comes after DOGE hit the price ceiling near $0.1000 on April 18, after which it sustained a price dump. The current DOGE price of $0.0731 on CoinGecko suggests a mixed bag of fortunes, with a slight 1.07% rally in the past 24 hours and a slump of 6.8% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap However, the overall trend indicates a depreciation of over 20% since the second half of April. Investors are now questioning whether the price dip is temporary or a sign of more trouble ahead for the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Source: Coingecko DOGE has always been a volatile investment option, with its price going through several cycles of surges and crashes. However, the recent slump in the coin’s price has been particularly worrying, as it appears to be part of a larger trend of bearishness in the cryptocurrency market. On Low Trading Volumes And Sudden Price Swings The recent bearish breakout and price slump of Dogecoin has raised questions among traders about what lies ahead. With the cryptocurrency market in a state of flux, it’s important to keep a close eye on the factors that could influence DOGE’s price movements in the coming days and weeks. One key factor to watch out for is trading volume. Low trading volumes can make DOGE vulnerable to sudden price swings, which could either trigger a sharp price increase or a steep decline. In addition, negative sentiment towards DOGE could exacerbate its current bearish trend, as more traders become wary of investing in a cryptocurrency that seems to be losing its momentum. DOGE total market cap slightly above the $10 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Price In A Turbulent Week: This Crypto Market Strategist Weighs In Another factor to consider is the broader cryptocurrency market.

42420486,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq44L,1683708416,"Are Cryptocurrencies an Inflation Hedge? Theoretically Yes, Factually No Says S&P","Ratings agency S&P Global on Tuesday took note of cryptocurrencies' appeal as assets that protect investors from the effects of inflation, while also stressing the lack of data to support the popular narrative.  ""Crypto assets could theoretically be a hedge against inflation,"" the New York-based agency said in a press release shared with CoinDesk, noting adoption in some emerging markets battling high inflation.  ""Some argue that crypto assets could be in demand in a high-interest rates/high inflation environment because they could serve as a store of value. We think the track record for crypto is too short to prove this,"" the New York-based agency added, drawing attention to bitcoin's (BTC) weak correlation with U.S. inflation expectations.  Crypto propounders consider bitcoin, the world's largest digital asset by market value, as a store of value asset like gold, thanks to a programmed code that halves bitcoin's pace of supply expansion every four years.  The so-called mining reward halving contradicts the ever-increased fiat money supply globally. (Propounders believe massive money printing by central banks is inflationary). The broader crypto market, including decentralized finance (DeFi), is considered an alternative to a centralized fiat banking system.  However, past data suggest otherwise. The agency's findings show that historical correlation between the daily returns of S&P BDMI (the agency's crypto index) and the U.S. two-year and 10-year breakeven inflation expectations is just 0.10. The correlation between the rolling three-month returns for S&P BDMI and 10-year breakeven inflation expectations shows no conclusive pattern agency said.  In other words, there is little association between the crypto market and inflation expectations. A strong correlation of at least 0.75 might be needed to validate the inflation hedge narrative.  Breakeven inflation rates are measures of investors' expectations for inflation over a specific period derived by subtracting the yield on inflation-protected bonds from the yield on nominal bonds.  Bitcoin's market value tanked by over 70% last year even though inflation in the U.S., as measured by the consumer price index, averaged 8%, per Statista.  The chart shows several periods where an increase in inflation expectations has failed to lift crypto market valuations. There have been periods when the two were simultaneously positive or negative.  In contrast, the agency said that gold's daily returns have consistently tracked inflation expectations since 2013, adding, ""There is evidence of Granger Causality between the 10-year Breakeven Inflation Expectation index and the S&P GSCI Gold index at a 95% confidence level.""  The Granger Causality test is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether time series X is helpful in forecasting Y.  ""The same test fails for Bitcoin,"" S&P Global noted.  At the same time, cryptocurrencies seem sensitive to cost of borrowing in the economy and tend to move in the opposite direction of the U.S. two-year Treasury yield, which is more susceptible to interest rate expectations than longer duration bond yields.  ""On a daily rolling three-month basis, interest rates [two-year yield] and the crypto index have exhibited an inverse relationship 63% of the time since May 2017. This increases to 75% from May 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" S&P Global said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/10/cryptocurrencies-could-theoretically-be-a-hedge-against-inflation-sp-global-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ba35e597ea1852de6abca6d12ee52d4fb5b91a4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420477,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq3v3,1683705600,Crypto Industry Asks UK to Think Globally as Government Closes Consultation on Proposed Rules,"The U.K.’s crypto stakeholders have largely welcomed the nation’s proposed legislation for the industry – but they want the country to collaborate with regulators globally to avoid post-Brexit isolation, particularly in the wake of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, a review of public comments found.  The U.K. has been consulting the public on its proposed strategy for the crypto sector since February, and the consultation period closed on April 30 with global industry titans submitting their views.  “This constitutes a welcome step towards establishing regulatory clarity for crypto assets in the U.K….Thoughtfully applied, these frameworks will accelerate the adoption of socially beneficial innovation, while reducing both criminal and financial risks,” said Riccardo Tordera Ricchi, head of policy at U.K.-based The Payments Association, in a statement to CoinDesk.  Countries around the world have been looking to construct rules for the burgeoning crypto sector, and with MiCA in its final stages, the pressure is mounting for countries to decide on their own approach.  Instead of creating an entirely new set of rules for the crypto space like MiCA, the U.K. wants to bring crypto into the scope of its existing regulatory frameworks, and the government may publish crypto specific rules in the next 12 months.  The U.K.’s plan is to regulate crypto under the Financial Services Markets Act and have an authorization regime for digital asset companies. It also hopes to regulate stablecoins under the country’s payments rules and set up a market abuse regime to protect investors. The Financial Services and Markets Bill, which will give regulators the power to oversee crypto by extending rules for financial instruments, is already making its way through Parliament.  “If you compare it to MiCA, where the first analysis that you will do is look at the assets, and the asset will tell you if you're falling into the regulatory perimeter or not… here, it's a little bit different. It's based on financial activity, which I have to say from a regulatory point of view is a hard thing to tackle,” said Meiran Shtibel, associate general counsel at U.S.-based Fireblocks.  The lobby group CryptoUK supports the government's “same risk, same regulatory outcome” approach, said Su Carpenter, director of operations at the group, in a press statement.  “It solves for the desired outcome rather than applying generic rules – capturing the intricacies of novel innovations, and their unique benefits/risks,” Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance tweeted recently.  Read more: What the Bank of England’s Stablecoins Regime Could Look Like  Global strategy  The U.K., which left the European Union in 2020 in the infamous “Brexit,” can't go on its crypto regulation journey alone without global collaboration, according to the Association of Financial Markets (AFME) in Europe.  When constructing a market abuse regime, the U.K. needs to ensure what it sets out is compatible with other jurisdictions that host global crypto companies and can work with standard-setters like the International Organization of Securities Commissions, Group of Seven (G7) and Group of 20 (G20), said Nick Taylor, head of policy in Europe, Middle East and Africa at U.K.-based exchange Luno. Luno, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.  CryptoUK is also calling for the country to align with global regulators over disclosure requirements for crypto companies.  “It would make sense for the regulatory regime to harmonize [with global regulators], to the extent reasonably possible, to allow as seamless cross-jurisdictional operation as possible,” Tordera said.  Read more: Global Crypto Regulation Needs Coordination, Not Duplication, Legal Experts Say  In its response to the government’s proposals, ​​AFME also warned that the U.K.’s planned crypto authorization regime could damage its reputation as an open market by making it difficult for foreign firms to access it. The government suggested in its consultation that the regime would require firms serving U.K. clients – regardless of where they are based – to sign up with the Financial Conduct Authority to continue business in the country.  The AFME doesn’t recommend this approach and says it steers too far from how the U.K. usually regulates financial institutions. CryptoUK called for overseas companies to be exempt from local authorization, and for the government to stick to regulating companies based in the U.K.  The licensing regime should come with a transition period that allows crypto companies to continue operating while they go through the authorization process, AFME and Taylor suggested. CryptoUK recommended a quicker process for firms already registered with the FCA – something that France is mulling as it prepares to implement MiCA.  “It is critical that regulators urgently adopt a timely and proportionate authorization process for complete and accurate applications, and endeavor to avoid duplicative information requests of businesses, taking into account the supervisory history of businesses during the authorization process,” Binance said in its response to the proposal.  Read more: UK Crypto Firms and Regulator Blame Each Other for Industry Exodus  AFME, CryptoUK and Binance also asked for clarity on the scope of economic activities that fall under the existing rules, along with the treatment of assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). All three parties suggested that algorithmic stablecoins should fall within the U.K.’s rules – something that has been on regulators’ radar since the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022.  A blurry future  The U.K.’s Conservative government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, has said it wants to position the country as a hub for crypto, and may be pushing to finalize relevant rules ahead of general elections, which are set for 2025 but could occur sooner.  CryptoUK expects proposed stablecoin legislation and rules for the broader crypto space – what the government refers to as the first two phases in its proposals – to be implemented by the end of 2024.  “We suggest taking a broader view at all of the enablers for the U.K. to deliver on its ambition to become a global hub for the crypto industry, which includes a proportionate application of FinProm [Financial Promotion] rules to trading venues, addressing concerns of de-banking by the crypto industry and progressive tax policy that addresses the nuances of the asset class,” Carpenter said in a statement.  Member of Parliament Lisa Cameron told CoinDesk she has had positive discussions with lawmakers about expanding the U.K.’s crypto tax framework.

12497813,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530841,1683702019,"Bitcoin Stagnates Below $27,800 Ahead Of CPI Release, What To Expect","The Bitcoin price has failed to break above the key resistance level of $27,800 since Monday. With today’s release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), a directional decision may be imminent: Will Bitcoin climb again towards $30,000 or is a drop to $25,000 looming? Who Will Buckle First? The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be announced an hour (8:30 am EST) before the US trading session opens. Headline inflation on an annual basis (YoY) is expected to be unchanged at 5.0% (vs. 5.0% last time). The core rate is expected to fall slightly, from 5.6% to 5.5%. On a monthly basis, headline CPI is expected at 0.4% vs. 0.1% last and the core rate at 0.3% vs. 0.4% last. Today’s CPI release could be of major importance because there is a significant discrepancy between the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and market expectations. According to the dot plot and Jerome Powell, there are no rate cuts scheduled this year, while according to the CME FedWatch tool, the market is calling a bluff and the majority is forecasting two to three rate cuts. One side will have to buckle prematurely, and if the CPI numbers come in worse than expected, it could be the market. As a result, it can be expected that the stock market will plummet and possibly drag Bitcoin down as well. A positive surprise in today’s CPI numbers is therefore highly significant for the market. Related Reading: Matrixport Report: Here’s What Happens To Bitcoin If Inflation Continues To Fall Remarkably, Goldman Sachs expects core CPI to rise by 0.47% in April, above the consensus of 0.3%. This would also put the annual rate at 5.59%, above consensus of 5.5%. The banking giant also predicts headline CPI to rise to 0.50% (vs. 0.4%), which would lift the annual rate to 5.09% (vs. 5.0%). Bitcoin Ahead Of CPI Ahead of the CPI release, the Bitcoin price is stuck in a tricky situation. The bears are starting to feel in control, but the bulls continue to have the upper hand in the higher time frames. As analyst @52skew notes, there are signs that the Bitcoin perpetuals market is oversaturated with short positions. While the Bitcoin Perp CVD Buckets & Delta Orders show some liquidation of short positions, they still show heavy short positioning on upswings. This is “often defined as short control,” the analyst said. Binance spot is the market selling aggressor today. $BTC Spot CVD Buckets & Delta OrdersStill very much the same, daily vwap illustrates when MMs are twap selling into price via small spot orders / MM spot orders & TWAP CVD / MM CVD Bounces still being sold by MMs. Binance spot is the market selling aggressor today https://t.co/k02hc5qCDL pic.twitter.com/hwVw1YJcqm — Skew Δ (@52kskew) May 10, 2023 On the other hand, an old ‘reversion indicator’ of 2019 is just flashing up: Bitmex trading below spot. As on-chain analysis service Santiment also observes, Bitcoin’s funding rate on BitMEX is showing its most negative ratio since the massive bets against prices in mid-March, just before prices spiked. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Crypto Market Takes Another Hit “Generally, price rise probabilities increase when the crowd overwhelmingly assumes prices will be dropping,” Santiment concludes. Otherwise, a head & shoulders pattern in the 1-day chart is currently being hotly debated. The bearish side argues that BTC is facing a deeper fall. But, there are also good arguments why this need not be the case. Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Aksel Kibar makes the argument that chart patterns should be analyzed in relation to the previous price action: While this last one month consolidation looks like a H&S top, top reversals form after an extended uptrend, as a result can not be analyzed as a top reversal. I’m more interested to play the long side of this one month long consolidation. Support (neckline for bottom reversal) continues to be at 25K. At press time, the Bitcoin price traded at $27,647.

On-chain analytics tool Lookonchain said on Tuesday that three whales, a colloquial term for holders of large amounts of any tokens, started to accumulate pepe tokens earlier this week amid a nearly 50% price cut.  “3 whales started to buy $PEPE after the price dropped,” Lookonchain said in a tweet. “0x50C1 withdrew 1.4T $PEPE ($2.76M) from #Binance when the price was $0.000002054.”  “0x2Baa bought 212B $PEPE($429K) with 223 $ETH($412K) at $0.000001942. 0x3AE8 bought 424B $PEPE($864K) with 450 $ETH($831K) at $0.000001957,” the firm added, pointing to each individual wallet holding.  CoinGecko data shows PEPE has seen over $420 million traded in the past 24 hours as prices fell steeply before rebounding.  The data further shows trading volumes have shifted from decentralized exchange Uniswap to crypto exchange Binance after the latter listed the tokens in its innovation zone last week.  In the past 24 hours, Binance saw over $160 million worth of pepecoin trading compared to $55 million on Uniswap. A likely reason for this is more accessibility for retail traders and significantly lesser fees per trade on Binance – compared to an average of $35 per PEPE trade on Uniswap as of Wednesday, due to the network demand and a general fee spike.  Elsewhere, DEXTools data shows pepe token holders crossed the 100,000 unique holders mark on Tuesday, implying continual buying activity despite a price decline and a possible reversal for the meme coin in the coming weeks.  The largest pepecoin holders sit on unrealized profits of $4 million to as much as $9 million, the data show.",POSITIVE,PEPE,EXCHANGE | TRADING | ZRX | BNB | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/10/crypto-whales-accumulate-millions-in-pepecoin-as-trading-volume-shifts-to-binance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23a0e1279a0c1275a18673781581415b2c0dcb5b-3596x2023.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420476,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq3sz,1683683391,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Ticks Up as Congestion Wanes and Investors Ponder the Next Price Spur,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: As blockchain congestion eases, Bitcoin's price recovers. eToro's Callie Cox said that inflation remains a key concern among crypto traders but noted bitcoin's resilience in an interview with CoinDesk TV.  Insights: Extraterritoriality is once again at the front-and-center of a crypto court case. Will we finally get some answers as to how far U.S. authorities can reach?

While bitcoin traded sideways throughout the U.S. business day, as Asia opens, the first signs of a return to price growth have reappeared amid diminishing congestion on the bitcoin blockchain.  Bitcoin is currently trading at $27,741, up 0.3%, according to CoinDesk market data, while ether is trading at $1,853, up 0.2%.  On-chain data shows that of Wednesday morning Asia time, the number of unconfirmed transactions had dipped to just below 400,000 from nearly 500,000 over the weekend. In addition, fees for sending transactions had settled to just over $5 from over $20 at the peak of this crisis.  But the question on many people's minds was what will cause the next big move in prices?  eToro investment analyst Callie Cox points to inflation as the chief concern from everyone from the Fed to crypto traders.  On a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV, Cox argued that Americans want inflation to decrease while maintaining job security, and the Fed is trying to balance these, but it's a process that inevitably involves some pain.  “Powell really leaned into his megaphone and provided some very flexible language on the future of policy,” Cox said on CoinDesk TV. “They keep dropping hints and statements, where they basically change the language around if future policy moves are needed. This could be a hint that the Fed is becoming more flexible.""  Meanwhile, despite Bitcoin’s congestion, it remains a defensive asset, as she pointed out that it has surprisingly outperformed the S&P 500 on most CPI and Fed days.  “In the wake of massive sell-offs, Bitcoin, while still risky, seems to be benefiting from both its traditional role and its emerging role as a value store during lower rates,"" she said.  Aside from bitcoin, what is Cox watching at the moment? Ethereum.  She views ether as a riskier investment, but recognizes its economic value and the number of projects being developed on the Ethereum blockchain.  ""Ethereum is one of those blockchains that is proving its value at the moment, and I think investors are realizing that,"" she said.

In a court filing published yesterday, Bankman-Fried moved to dismiss the majority of the charges against him.  One part of his legal team’s move to dismiss the allegations of commodities fraud: extraterritoriality.  Bankman-Fried’s legal team argues in a filing that the commodities fraud charges would necessitate an extraterritorial application of the Commodities Exchange Act (CEA), which is not permissible as the CEA only applies to domestic conduct.  They further argue that prior case law dictates that the focus of the CEA is not on the geographical location of transactions, but on preventing manipulation and ensuring market integrity.  Remember, FTX did not serve U.S. customers, and as lawyers point out in the filing, was headquartered first in Hong Kong before moving to The Bahamas.  What exactly is the U.S. nexus?  We’ve been down this road before with BitMEX.  BitMEX was charged under U.S. anti-money laundering laws despite not serving U.S. customers nor operating bank accounts with U.S. institutions.  “The CFTC’s increasingly expanded view of their jurisdiction will likely be challenged, especially against offshore exchanges and participants that have limited ties to the United States,” Braden Perry, a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission enforcement attorney and now a partner at Kennyhertz Perry, said at the time. “This is dangerous territory for the CFTC.”  Unfortunately, for those interested in seeing a case where the CFTC’s view that its mandate was international, a plea deal taken by Arthur Hayes and Ben Delo prevents a full exploration of these issues in court.  If it had gone to court, the case would have explored new considerations for the Bank Secrecy Act's applicability to entities that don't accept fiat currency or have limited ties to the United States, raising questions about jurisdiction and regulatory overreach.  Part of Hayes and Delo’s settlement involved a large fine as well as house arrest for Hayes and probation for Delo.  This option is unlikely for Bankman-Fried. He’s got more incentive to fight his case.  Hopefully, this will mean we have the extraterritorial tendencies of U.S. regulators tested in court and enshrined in case law. If anything, it would give the industry some certainty of where the U.S. can and can’t reach, instead of playing a constant guessing game.  Important events.

During the 2020 Twitter hack, multiple high-profile Twitter accounts were taken over – including CoinDesk’s – and used to promote a bitcoin giveaway scam. Despite multi-factor authentication being enabled on some of the accounts, the attackers managed to hide scam warning responses, including from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, and amassed approximately 11.3 BTC ($103,960) from the fraudulent activity.  Florida resident Graham Ivan Clark, an associate of O’Connor’s who also participated in the attack, was arrested in March 2021 and tried as a young offender, as he was 17 at the time of the hack.  O’Connor, 23, was also charged by the SDNY and pled guilty for his role in SIM-swapping attacks targeting high-profile executives in the cryptocurrency industry, resulting in the theft of $794,000 in digital assets.  While the SDNY declined to name the company, only stating that it “provided wallet infrastructure and related software to cryptocurrency”, there have been numerous cases of targeted crypto companies using this same technique, including BlockFi.  Telecoms such as AT&T as well as T-Mobile have been sued by victims over the lack of internal security measures that have allowed these attacks to take place.

Pepe coin (PEPE) is a meme token and one of the top-performing assets after rallying by over 10x in recent days pushing its market capitalization to over $1 billion. PEPE’s performance and trading activity saw it flip mainstream coins, including Bitcoin. Whale Exiting PEPE Trackers on May 9 now indicate that the PEPE whale is actively accumulating TURBO, doubling down on the token. Because of the address’ past success, traders are closely watching his actions, with some speculating that TURBO might be the next “big thing” after PEPE’s success.

Nonetheless, though PEPE surged in the first part of last week, the meme token’s price has been cooling off days after listing on Binance’s Innovation Zone and derivatives exchange. PEPE is ranked 57 on the market cap leaderboard, according to CoinMarketCap data. The meme token has gained significant traction at this valuation, attracting interest from speculators and traders. Focus on TURBO With PEPE looking fragile, dropping 55% from May’s high, the whale seems to have identified an opportunity in TURBO. Related Reading: PEPE, FLOKI, SHIB: Insiders Spill The Beans On Meme Coin Investing The whale bought 1.38 billion TURBO with $977,000, worth $1.1M at the time of writing.

The last time he bought $TURBO was 7 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/eawQWEivKq — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 9, 2023 The Turbo meme coin is created entirely using artificial intelligence (AI) with Chat GPT-4, the generative AI protocol, taking charge, building the project from scratch and issuing the token. Fueled by the current rage of AI projects and platforms, the TURBO community is expanding, further propping prices. As of writing, TURBO is up 45% in the last 24 hours, with trading volumes exceeding $140 million. The founder has meticulously recorded the entire process from the project’s documentation while strictly adhering to the AI’s guidance. Still, it is not clear whether TURBO will replicate PEPE’s success and soar to record highs. Bitcoin prices are relatively lower at spot rates, which could be a hurdle for the token’s price action. Despite recent double-digit gains, TURBO has resisted selling pressure and separated from the broader market. However, the success of meme tokens relies heavily on hype and FOMO-driven demand, as they generally lack any practical utility. Consequently, their prices tend to collapse rapidly once the hype subsides.
