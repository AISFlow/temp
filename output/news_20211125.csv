Read More: The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021  Some of the university’s teaching staff are heavily involved in blockchain and crypto research. Luke Anderson has been lecturing on information security since 2015. During that time he co-founded Sigma Prime, an information security firm that maintains Lighthouse, an open-source implementation of Ethereum 2.0.  As long ago as 2018, academics at the university around distributed computing professor Vincent Gramoli were developing a blockchain called the Red Belly Blockchain. It could process transactions significantly faster than the bitcoin blockchain and the researchers concluded that “blockchain scalability can be achieved without sacrificing security.”  USYD pulls more than its weight in populating the higher echelons of Australia’s blockchain scene. Alumni can now be found at Blockchain United, a digital investment bank and research center; Immutable, a digital asset exchange; and Fantom Foundation, a consensus mechanism platform. These firms are all based in Australia, part of the country’s thriving blockchain sector that presents opportunities for students.  Australia’s crypto and blockchain scene has grown over recent years.

42396444,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3U2Q,1637883129,First Mover Asia: What Holiday? Bitcoin Soars Past $59K Amid Brisk Trading,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin broke above $59,000, with at least one analyst expecting a “healthy” holiday rally.  Technician’s take (Editor’s Note): On account of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, today’s First Mover Asia will include a column by CoinDesk Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris in place of the usual Technician’s Take.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $59,118 +3.5%  Ether (ETH): $4,530 +6.4%  Market moves  The crypto market on Thursday, the U.S. Thanksgiving day holiday, was not as quiet as some anticipated after bitcoin prices briefly broke past $59,000, and trading volume remained at a level similar to the previous three days. Ether soared past $4,500, a more than 6% gain.  As bitcoin’s price finished Thursday (HKT/SGT) in the green, the rest of the crypto market experienced high price volatility with major winners of the day including gaming tokens GALA, SAND, and MANA and dog-themed meme token SHIB. These tokens all saw high daily trading volume on Thursday, a bullish sign for a token’s price when it accompanies a price rally.  One analyst expects this bullish sentiment will continue during the December holiday season, particularly now that a few macroeconomic uncertainties have abated, including Jerome Powell’s reappointment as U.S. Federal Reserve chair.  “The period after U.S. Thanksgiving is traditionally very bullish for risky assets and I would not be surprised to see a healthy Christmas rally for cryptos during the holiday season,” Changguang Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, told CoinDesk.  Yet, there were also less optimistic signs in investors’ activities. “Bitcoin put options, derivatives offering downside protection, continue to become pricier, implying bearish sentiment,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported on Thursday.  Opinion  El Salvador: Who Needs the IMF When You Have Bitcoin?: The IMF is a brutal bully constantly declaring its virtue. It’s about time someone pushed back.  Christopher Nolan’s third Batman film, “The Dark Knight Rises,” is generally considered the weakest entry in the series, in part because it’s so easily read as a celebration of neoliberal authoritarianism. The film’s plot has the villain, Bane, take over Gotham City, wipe out all financial ledgers and reign over a kind of mega-Occupy movement. To fight back, Batman engages in a series of moral compromises that he justifies as, more or less, necessary exceptions to defend a more broadly just system.  The International Monetary Fund has been playing the Batman role in the global order for decades. Though nominally aimed at supporting democracy and free markets, reforms mandated by the IMF in exchange for its loans have historically included serious cuts to social spending and industrial policy. The fallout is often devastating: The IMF’s (real world) body count is considerably higher than Batman’s.  El Salvador, a country with low income and high debt, has been in negotiations with the IMF for one of its loans in the amount of $1.3 billion. One roadblock has been the country’s recent adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF signaled it wasn’t too happy with that idea.  On Monday, El Salvador introduced a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” that could present at least a partial end-run around the IMF, highlighting why bitcoin made the IMF so queasy in the first place. “The Dark Knight Rises” contains a notorious moment, drawn from the Batman comics, in which Bane pummels Batman so badly that his back is broken, leaving him paralyzed and vulnerable. That’s about how the IMF is going to feel if El Salvador finds a way to raise large sums of international financing, as a developing country with a troubled economy, without the IMF or corruption-riddled global banks.  The bond allows purchases in units of $100, using bitcoin or tether. It will be issued by Bitfinex, an essentially stateless and unregulated platform. So there are probably few if any controls on who can buy into this bond, either by source or by amount.  That means one simple thing: El Salvador will absolutely sell out of this bond, and will probably be able to issue another round. It will replace that $1.3 billion from the IMF without breaking a sweat, even taking into account that about half of the first bond sale will go into a bitcoin fund.  There doesn’t need to be any further explanation of this than “Bitcoiners are nuts and rich,” and would gladly pump money into this small country for the lulz. More seriously, every one of these experiments that pans out is another win for bitcoin, so pitching in is also a matter of enlightened self-interest. Remember that an Ethereum DAO just raised $40 million for what was essentially a vaguely civic-minded prank – $1 billion for an actual bond with an actual return is nothing.  Let’s leave aside the touted “Bitcoin City” El Salvador says it wants to build using the other half of the first bond. That’s mostly a marketing stunt: For $500 million, at best the country will get a couple of power plants, a server farm and an IHOP. And that’s actually fine! Assuming El Salvador follows through in broad strokes, you do need some kind of infrastructure to support the mining facilities, so whether or not it’s a “city” right off the bat is a matter of semantics. And $500 million of new capital in the small country will have a major impact regardless of how it’s spent.  So, kudos to El Salvador for burning down Wall Street and building a throne out of the skulls of predatory bankers. That said, the bond might not be a terribly great investment.  For one thing, it introduces political counterparty risk to your bitcoin strategy. This is a country that only emerged from near-anarchy in 1994, and while President Nayib Bukele seems to have sturdy popularity, a disruptive change in leadership or the political order could mean creditors don’t get paid back. That’s not necessarily likely, but it’s on the table in a way that it’s not with, say, U.S. Treasury bonds (or just buying bitcoin yourself).  Also, Blockstream’s projection that the bond will return 165% annually over 10 years is based on the bet that bitcoin will be trading at $1 million by that time. I consider that completely possible, but also completely unknowable. A 10-year projection for literally any asset is pretty much always going to be a made-up number. Invest accordingly – unless your real priority is to change the world.  Important events  8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT (12:30 a.m. UTC) Australia retail sales (Oct.

ETH Burned Clocks 1 Billion The amount of ETH burned has risen along with fees on the network.

Howe Institute said.  “Canadian dollar-linked stablecoins could become attractive to Canadians by making them convertible into cash issued by the Bank of Canada, and ensuring that stablecoins are well designed and regulated from business conduct, competitive, operational, privacy and prudential perspectives,” wrote Mark Zelmer and Jeremy Kronick, the authors of the report.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price. Recently nominated vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Lael Brainard, has voiced her support for the potential advantages of a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC).  Indirect CBDC  Such a feat by the Bank of Canada will require any potential stablecoins to be well designed and regulated to make them attractive to Canadians, Zelmer and Kronick wrote. The digital currency should also be issued in token form, with decentralized technology for settling transactions, allowing Canadians to retain most of the benefits of a paper currency, the authors added.  “Our preference is for an ‘indirect CBDC,’ one that is allowed to pass over the balance sheet of payment providers, mimicking cash/banknotes on the Bank of Canada’s balance sheet today,” the duo said.  The authors also highlighted that such adoption may incentivize private sectors to introduce Canadian-dollar linked stablecoins by enabling convertibility to cash to take place digitally, without relying on physical bank notes.  On Feb. 25, Canadian bank VersaBank said it plans to launch a stablecoin “VCAD” which will be pegged to the Canadian dollar on a 1:1 ratio basis.  A new chapter  The Bank of Canada adopting a digital currency that is convertible into Canadian dollars could usher in a new chapter in how Canadians pay for their goods and services. According to the report, however, this move can only be successful if there is a mass adoption by the consumers and there are infrastructures to support such use of digital currencies.  “Canadians are more likely to favor those stablecoins if governments facilitate innovation in the payments world so that Canadians can benefit from ongoing advances in payments systems and crypto-technology, and the purchasing power of the Canadian dollar is maintained by keeping inflation low,” the authors concluded.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/25/canada-needs-a-loonie-linked-digital-currency-policy-experts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4670d158887153be7e744e7955d3b63ee5bdda62-5025x3350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394356,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcDM9,1637862634,Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity),"Manuel Gonzalez Alzuru, a co-founder of a soon-to-launch non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, says he is “doin’ good,” with a smile and a nod over a video call. “It never gets old saying that.” His platform, boyishly named DoinGud, is what Alzuru calls a “prosocial” experiment – a way to funnel some of the massive profits generated by the emergent NFT economy to worthy causes.  “Ethereum gave me freedom,” Alzuru, 31, said. “And I’m always looking for ways to give back and to get some freedom for others as well.” That’s a message he thinks others in crypto could get behind. DoinGud, set to launch on Nov. 30, distinguishes itself from the increasingly crowded field of NFT markets by automatically directly a percentage (5%-95%) of sales to charities.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For an industry that prides itself on working on behalf of the “public good,” outright philanthropy isn’t often prioritized. Companies, projects and individuals have made breathtaking profits this year during a bull market that has driven the entire market cap of all cryptos, at times, above $3 trillion. It’s money that’s sometimes literally printed from nowhere and might be put to good use.  “In order for you to give, you need to have something to give,” Alzuru said. NFTs have unlocked untold fortunes for a number of artists across industries – seemingly regardless of experience or, at times, talent. The “creator economy” was well underway in 2018 when the ERC-721 white paper was published, describing the smart contract standard underpinning NFTs. Since then, however, NFTs have extended the playing field of who can get paid for their work online.  That’s at least part of what Alzuru means when he says “freedom:” Crypto has given him more than just financial “independence” (though there is that): It hast also granted him the lowercase-l, liberal freedoms some people in North America or Europe may take for granted. Born in Venezuela, Alzuru said he felt he had no guaranteed right to speech or expression, until he found Ethereum.  “I’m able now to express myself on Ethereum, on the internet, and it stays there,” he said. “No one can take that away from me.” That’s the power of property rights enforced by code, he said. But don’t confuse him with any old capitalist; Alzuru, perhaps like Ethereum itself, is ideologically fluid.  “I also believe in communal property rights, ‘public goods’ or public infrastructure,” he said, invoking the idea that crypto, open and accessible to all in theory, is a new type of digital commons. That’s ultimately what he wants DoinGud to become, to exist at the protocol level, a tool that other NFT or DeFi platforms can integrate to automate charitable giving.  But public goods are open to exploitation. Or, as street artist Rich Simmons put it in an email, “The whole NFT and crypto climates so far have felt like a bit of a cash grab.” Simmons is joining the ranks (including publications like CoinDesk and The New Yorker) of those using NFTs to fund charitable giving. He’s using a platform called HistoryMakr and donating to several mental health organizations.  Give crypto to get back  Is crypto charity a way to cover up some of the evils of the industry? Under fire for its environmental footprint, rampant scams and general social toxicity, crypto certainly needs a little goodwill.  See also: Want Cleaner Bitcoin Mining? Subsidize It  But “corporate social responsibility,” the idea that traditional businesses owe something to the world in addition to their shareholders, often leads to less-than-desirable and sometimes hysterical results. It’s the same mentality that has the Central Intelligence Agency whitewashing itself as a progressive wing of government.  At launch, creators on DoinGud will be able to determine which causes to support and what percentage is handed over. The intention is to open source its code and form a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to set protocols around charitable giving. “Consensus is also always changing,” Alzuru said, and six-member founding team isn’t comfortable determining what is “right or wrong.” A “curated” registry, launched in collaboration with The Giving Block, an established project that enables charities to accept crypto, may eventually blacklist unsavory recipients.  Regardless of people’s motivations for giving, there’s a huge opportunity for charitable efforts to thrive in crypto. Blockchain has long been touted as a way to bring transparency to an industry that sometimes operates in the dark. Smart contracts, like the ones DoinGud designed, can make giving a routine part of doing business. Not to mention the wealth, the insane wealth, created during bull markets.  Alzuru even thinks the psychological effects that transparent blockchains foster, the same mental forces that drive people to display NFTs as avatars on social media, could benefit charity. “With crypto, you have this proof that you’ve given back to the community,” Alzuru said, referring to the paper trail left on Ethereum. “Most of the time, [when giving], people are showing us vanity.”  “You might want to create something for the betterment of humanity,” he said. “What you need to first think about yourself, like if you’re not good, if you’re not doing good yourself, you cannot be creating stuff for others.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/25/crypto-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving-to-charity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54b8816e5f3ee019fe082cd35f788bdcb6e643cc-2048x1367.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is up almost 40% in the past seven days.  The token of the decentralized virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain now has a reported market capitalization of $9.2 billion, according to data provider Messari. The surge pushes it ahead of metaverse-related play-to-earn game Axie Infinity’s AXS, which has a reported market cap of $8.6 billion.  Tokens tied to the metaverse, or shared virtual environments, have surged since October when Facebook said it was changing its corporate name to Meta to signal an increasing focus on the sector. At the time, Decentraland’s market cap was just over $2 billion.  “Investors are still wanting to capitalize on the narrative of the metaverse since the rebranding of Facebook,” said Juan Pellicer, an analyst at IntoTheBlock.  Pellicer said that the recent waves of transactions for MANA of over $100,000, could be signalling institutional demand.  He also noted that the recent virtual real estate plot sales are putting Decentraland in the spotlight again, which could also be helping propel the price.  Reuters reported on Monday that a Tokens.com subsidiary, the Metaverse Group, bought a patch of virtual real estate in the Decentraland metaverse for 618,000 MANA – equivalent to around $3.2 million at the time of writing.  Other gaming and metaverse-related tokens are also trading upwards. On Monday, Sandbox’s SAND reached record highs after Adidas teased a partnership between the two companies.  Axie Infinity’s AXS is up 15% in the last seven days, trading at around $140 per token.  “Gaming is still very much at the forefront heading into Sandbox’s alpha release on November 29,” said Denis Vinokourov, an independent crypto analyst.  Sandbox, which is owned by Hong Kong-based game software company, Animoca Brands, announced this week it will open part of its metaverse via its multi-week, play-to-earn Alpha event on Nov. 29. The event will give users the chance to earn up to 1,000 SAND and exclusive non-fungible tokens (NFT).",POSITIVE,AXS | MANA | SAND,AXS | ETH | MANA | MARKET | SAND,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/25/decentralands-mana-token-hits-all-time-high-after-sale-of-virtual-real-estate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60dfddfb88421d090b1589631b6e3c0c0ca952a5-8164x6123.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424227,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lhTh,1637836645,Bearish Sentiment Grips Bitcoin Ahead of $3B Options Expiry,"Bitcoin put options – derivatives offering downside price protection – continue to become pricier, implying bearish sentiment. The price volatility may rise as major exchanges, including Deribit, are due to settle monthly options on Friday.  The three-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts relative to calls, has turned positive, hit a six-week high of 3%, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  The positive number shows that put options are drawing higher prices or demand than calls or bullish bets. At the start of the month, the three-month gauge stood at -5%, indicating a bullish bias.  The one-week and one-month put-call skews have seen similar ascents this month and are signaling bearish bias with above-zero prints. The six-month put-call skew has turned neutral.  A positive skew does not necessarily mean traders are taking outright bearish bets rather they could be adding downside protection against long positions in the spot or futures markets.  In any case, it indicates fear in the market, which is warranted, given bitcoin’s 16% fall after hitting a record high of $68,990 on Nov. 10.  Concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve may chalk out a faster end to its two-year stimulus program and the resulting strength in the dollar appear to have driven the cryptocurrency lower. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, has increased by 3% since the hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data released on Nov. 10.  The Fed began cutting back on the monthly bond-buying program from this month and stands ready to accelerate the unwinding of stimulus if things continue to heat up. Minutes from the November Fed meeting released on Wednesday shows that policymakers were willing to raise interest rates if inflation continues to rise.  So, the dollar may remain strong in the coming weeks, keeping bitcoin gains under check.  Options expiry  Data provided by Skew shows a total of 51,900 options contracts worth nearly $3 billion are due for expiry on Friday. About $2.5 billion worth of options will be settled by Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange, at 08:00 a.m. UTC.  The majority of open interest is concentrated in call options at strikes above bitcoin’s record price. The max pain, or the price level at which option buyers would suffer the most loss on expiry, is $58,000.  According to a theory, the max pain acts as a magnet while heading into the expiry as option sellers, typically large institutions, buy or sell the underlying asset to keep the price around key levels to inflict maximum loss on buyers.  While there is no evidence of sellers using such strategies in the bitcoin market, the cryptocurrency has, in the past, moved in the direction of the max pain point ahead of expiry and gained strong directional bias after the settlement.  So, the prospects of a big move in the next day or two cannot be ruled out, more so, as volumes are likely to be thin due to the Thanksgiving holiday.  Bitcoin was last seen trading near $58,200, representing a 1.8% gain on the day.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/25/bearish-sentiment-grips-bitcoin-ahead-of-3b-options-expiry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be484f5e834dfaf6ed174d37de0b0b2c5b3764ae-2400x1200.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424220,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lhLh,1637832726,Grayscale Says Metaverse Is a Trillion-Dollar Market Opportunity,"The metaverse may represent an over $1 trillion annual revenue market opportunity, crypto investment giant Grayscale said in a report, without specifying the timeline.  The report, which was published on Thursday, is dubbed “The Metaverse, Web 3.0 Virtual Cloud Economies.” The report looks into the opportunity that will arise from the intersection of trends in gaming and lifestyle with blockchain’s potential to provide infrastructure for digital worlds.  Projects like Decentraland allow people to interact, govern and earn tokens, and get real world benefits for their time spent online, Grayscale said. People are spending more and more time online, and they concurrently spend money to build social status within digital realms, the company added.  Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which also owns CoinDesk. DCG is also an investor in MANA, the token that powers Decentraland.  Revenue from virtual gaming worlds could grow to $400 billion in 2025, from $180 billion in 2020, Grayscale said. The overwhelming majority of that $400 billion will be in-game spending, compared to spending on premium games, the company noted.  In Q3, total fundraising for crypto was $8.2 billion, $1.8 billion of which went to Web 3 and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Grayscale said. Fundraising for gaming applications overshadowed all other verticals of NFTs in the third quarter, hitting around $1 billion.  “Compared to the $10 billion that companies like Facebook plan to invest, and the amounts that could follow from other companies and venture capitalists, the metaverse is in its early innings,” Grayscale said.  The report was authored by Grayscale Head of Research David Grider and research analyst Matt Maximo. They defined the metaverse as “interconnected, experiential, 3D virtual worlds where people located anywhere can socialize in real-time to form a persistent, user-owned, internet economy spanning the digital and physical worlds.”  Read more: ‘Crypto-States’ Will Compete With Corporates in the Metaverse  UPDATE (Nov. 26, 14:14 UTC): Adds disclosure of Grayscale’s common ownership with CoinDesk, and the parent company’s investment in Decentraland’s MANA token.",POSITIVE,MANA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET | RESEARCH,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/25/grayscale-says-metaverse-is-a-trillion-dollar-market-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c910fc1d77a080b35fa9ee1b719813158511ee07-1600x900.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The National Assembly ordered the FSC to come up with a comprehensive draft bill on crypto in one month, but the law probably wont be ready for the last parliamentary meeting of the year on Dec. 9, CoinDesk Korea reported.  The FSC recommendations call for punishments relative to the gains obtained unfairly, with minimum one year in prison and fines three to five times the illicit gains. The minimum punishment for gains over KRW 5 billion ($4.2 million) is five years in prison.  The FSC also called for taxes on some types of non-fungible tokens, seemingly going back on earlier statements that indicated NFTs would be be exempt.  Seoul is set to implement a 20% tax on crypto gains over KRW 2.5 million ($2,100) starting 2022., but the ruling and opposition parties are calling for an extension to the deadline, the Korea Times reported.

42394364,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcDw3,1637815192,"This Thanksgiving, Let’s Be Grateful for Technology","This Thanksgiving, I will be giving thanks for technology and the endless opportunity it offers us for re-inventing ourselves and fixing our mistakes. Technology has done so much for my family and for me that, no matter the challenges we face today, I could not be convinced to go backwards.  My great-grandfather ran a cheese shop in Athens. His son, George, went to engineering school, which was his ticket out of Greece and around the world. George’s daughter Rosemary, my mother, found endless challenges and opportunities in math and engineering, spending her career as a computer programmer and research executive.  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  My father started his career as a nuclear physicist, and he and my mother both went to the linear accelerator at Stanford and later to European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland. My first real job was a year in Nigeria at the country’s first privately owned cellular network operator.  Read More: Choosing Who We Trust - Paul Brody  For me, blockchain has already been so much more than a nifty technology or a place to make my career. It’s an opportunity to transform the way enterprises run, create immense value and reset the distribution of power across the global economy. We are 50 years into the information technology revolution and we have digitized much of the world’s economic activities, but mostly into very small enterprise-sized silos.  Even the world’s best companies spend 5%-10% of revenue on administration, an expense that’s largely driven by the challenge of matching up different kinds of data and business rules which are all digital somewhere, but just not in the same systems. None of that makes the world better off.  Blockchains will allow us to knit all those systems together across companies. Once it becomes simple for companies to work together, we will in turn change the structure of entire ecosystems because networks of small businesses will then be able to operate as efficiently as big companies.  So far, digital economies have proven time and again that they are winner-take-all (or nearly) engines. Centralized intermediaries take an overwhelming share of the benefits created from building digital networks. It doesn’t have to be that way.  Public blockchains have some of the same features as highly centralized systems: Network effects mean they become more valuable as more people join in. The difference, and the opportunity for us, is to distribute the benefits of digital transformation back to the participants in the network instead of to a centralized operator.  As with every new technology, there’s room not just for new ideas and new products but new ways of doing business, new ways of managing people and new opportunities for people. It’s no accident that women and minorities flooded into information technology in its earliest days. The industry was built on brainpower and competitive advantage came from getting it where it was available, regardless of from whom it came.  For those of us who sometimes feel like outsiders, the lure of math and engineering is even simpler: it’s more objective than subjective. Your numbers add up or they don’t. Your code works or it doesn’t. Great software engineering skills are not a popularity contest, and you can earn respect based on your work, not your background. Progress is uneven and imperfect, but it’s still progress.  Wherever we go, bad old ideas try to follow us around. My mother likes to tell a great story about how when she was working in Switzerland back in the early 1970s, the human resources department explained to her that if a husband and wife were both working at the same organization the wife was not allowed to earn more than her husband, so they were going to have to cut her pay.  It’s hard to believe that kind of thing happened in living memory, though I am sure my kids will marvel at the idea that their two dads weren’t legally married when we had them.  New technologies can never match the hype they arrive with. Television didn’t democratize education. The internet was a decentralized network that ushered forth a new golden age of monopolies. It was supposed to empower the disenfranchised but seems to have instead just given a megaphone to privileged extremists. Doesn’t matter. Thanks to never-ending revolutions delivered by new technology, we keep getting new opportunities to fix our mistakes and make things better. That is something to be thankful for.

These include the lack of transparency and fluctuations of fixed betting odds, bet settlement delays and even winning bettors having their accounts limited due to the success they have enjoyed. For these reasons alone, it makes a lot of sense to migrate betting onto the blockchain. The blockchain, using smart contracts and sometimes oracles, automates the entire betting process and the money flow, that way the funnel is entirely un-manipulatable and transparent.

In the cryptocurrency sector, staking is a way of investing in new blockchain technologies, coins, tokens and currencies. Investors agree to commit a fixed amount for a fixed period, usually when investing in a new coin or token. Crypto and blockchain startups launch these tokens through private and public token sales (e.g. an ICO), often raising millions to fund future growth roadmaps. However, unlike with crowdfunding, equity or debt-based angel and VC financing for startups, crypto investors almost always get returns for staking a percentage of the required investment.
