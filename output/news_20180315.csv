A media representative for next week's summit, to be hosted by Argentina, which currently holds the G20 presidency, said that the first meeting will take place Monday. The talks will feature Argentina Treasury Minister Nicolás Dujovne and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Secretary-General José Angel Gurría, among other stakeholders.  A second discussion will happen on Tuesday, the rep told CoinDesk.  The agenda and talking points for the two discussions have not been released. However, a public document indicates that the discussions will revolve around the implications of cryptocurrencies and the potential applications of its underlying technology.  ""The issue is an important item on the meeting agenda; delegates will consider a common response that would mitigate the risks without discouraging innovation,"" it argues.  The document notes that blockchain “has the potential to promote financial inclusion.” However, it goes on to argue that ""it is important to analyze its implications to financial stability, tax evasion and financial illegal activities.""  Finance officials from the U.S., Germany, France and Japan have all called for the discussions to take place in the months leading up to the G20 summit.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin said his concerns revolve around the use of cryptocurrencies in illegal activities like money laundering, while French and German finance officials co-wrote a letter in February that sounded the alarm on potential risks to investors.

42401290,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWXK,1521148558,French Regulator Blacklists 15 Crypto Investment Websites,"France's stock market regulator announced on Thursday that it has blacklisted 15 cryptocurrency and crypto-asset investment websites.  The Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF) will add the offending platforms to its existing ""liste noir,"" which already includes businesses that unlawfully offer investments in commodities like diamonds, rare earth metals and wine.  The announcement explained:  ""Companies in France offering the purchase of rights over goods promoting the possibility of a yield or its economic equivalent are subject to the regulation of diverse goods and as such their offer must have a registration number provided by the AMF.""  The announcement goes on to list the websites of fifteen companies who have been alerted by the AMF of their regulatory violations but continue to operate. The majority of those on the list claim to be located in the U.K.  Among them is AKJ Crypto, which claims to provide a variety of services ranging from asset storage to account management. Another, Crypteo, is a purported cryptocurrency marketplace.  The AMF's statement cautioned investors that ""no sales pitch should make one forget that there are no high returns without high risks."" Likewise, it advised them to perform due diligence on the investments they're considering and to weigh the criteria used to establish a product's price.  The regulator also said that investors should consider the means by which a product can be resold and the deadlines which may correspond to this.  ""Don't invest in that which you don't understand,"" the Authority cautioned.  This is not the first time the AMF has involved itself in the affairs of the crypto industry. In February, it released a statement positing that trading platforms should not be allowed to market cryptocurrency derivative products electronically because they fall within the realm of the MiFID 2 and Sapin 2 laws, the latter of which bans advertisements for certain financial contracts.  Likewise, the Authority launched the Universal Node to ICO Research Network (UNICORN) in October of 2017. At the time, it described the program as providing a framework that would allow ICO issuers to develop their operations while ensuring the protection of would-be investors.

42401293,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWZI,1521145230,Gibraltar Plans to Regulate ICO Tokens as Commercial Products,"Gibraltar's government provided new details about its plan to regulate initial coin offerings in a white paper published on Tuesday.  Notably, the paper states that most tokens are not considered securities under either Gibraltar or EU law. The classification of tokens and ICOs has troubled regulators and government watchdogs, leading some countries – most notably China – to ban the blockchain use case entirely.  Indeed, the paper notes that ""in many cases, [tokens] represent the advance sale of products that entitle holders to access future networks or consume future services."" In other words, tokens are commercial products, not securities, the document argues.  The white paper also outlined an authorized sponsors regime, which would require every ICO issuer selling or distributing tokens in Gibraltar to appoint an individual to supervise the sale and ensure that it complies with regulations.  The release comes amid a long-running process of establishing regulatory boundaries for the use of blockchain tech within the U.K. crown dependency.  Officials from the Gibraltar Finance Centre and the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission told CoinDesk in February that the implementation of the sponsorship regime was part of their market-driven approach to ICO regulation, an attempt to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach. The regime would mean the market, not regulators, could determine what a ""good"" token sale looks like, according to the document.  Legislators in Gibraltar passed a blockchain-focused bill in December, and previously laid the groundwork for an ICO bill when it published an advisory back in September.  The white paper also states that the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) will ""authorise and supervise secondary token market operators"" and will establish ""a public register of such operators."" Additionally, the government will regulate token-related investment advice, including ""generic advice,"" ""product-related advice"" and ""personal recommendations.""  According to the white paper, Gibraltar intends to wrap up its blockchain-related regulatory push by the end of this year.  ""A draft Bill is expected to be ready by the end of March 2018. Draft Regulations for the promotion, sale and distribution of tokens should be ready in May 2018. The last of the three Regulations should be completed by the end of October 2018,"" the paper says.

42401297,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWcF,1521141334,American Express Patent Filing Touts Blockchain for Faster Payments,"Global payment giant American Express may be looking into using blockchain to boost the speed of transactions.  In a patent application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, the credit card company's travel arm – the American Express Travel Related Services Company – describes using the tech to facilitate payments between two parties by using transaction requests as a proxy.  As described, a request for payment would be sent to the blockchain-based system, which would either be approved or rejected based on various factors, including a risk analysis. If the request for payment is approved, the system would automatically process the transaction, adjusting accounts held by both the payer and the receiver.  In order to access the system, parties conducting a transaction must create digital wallets on the blockchain. As a result, the payments are conducted directly through the blockchain, rather than through a third-party banking institution.  The patent filing references peer-to-peer payments using a blockchain, although it also cites bitcoin’s price volatility and the fact that it is a public ledger as reasons why that network would not be suitable for American Express’s requirements.  Notably, the company further suggests that a blockchain system could improve upon current card payments networks, writing:  ""A payment network based on peer-to-peer payments may be used to facilitate most functions of traditional card payment networks and to enable additional services and functionality.""  This is not the first time American Express' travel and merchant unit has expressed interest in blockchain applications.  A patent application released last October, but initially filed in April, discussed using a blockchain as part of a customer rewards program. As reported at the time, the filing touted the tech's security characteristics as potential boons for a rewards system.

42401285,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWQR,1521137431,US Government to Submit 'Oversized' Argument in ICO Fraud Case,"U.S. prosecutors are planning an ""oversized"" response to a motion to dismiss in an ongoing – and potentially precedent-setting – initial coin offering (ICO) fraud lawsuit.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Maksim Zaslavskiy has been accused of committing securities fraud in connection with two ICOs, RECoin and Diamond Reserve Club World. In September of last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit, and in November Zaslavskiy was arrested and charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ). That move led to the SEC suit being stayed pending the outcome of the DOJ action, and Zaslavskiy has pled not guilty to the allegations.  Now, Zaslavskiy is seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed on the argument that tokens sold through an ICO aren't considered securities. The SEC has said differently, and the case has set the stage for a U.S. federal court to weigh in on the question of whether token sales can be considered securities offerings.  Ahead of that decision, the Department of Justice is set to submit a memorandum of law that is expected to rebut the defense's claim.  According to a letter dated March 14, that filing is expected to exceed the maximum size allowed by the court for such arguments, necessitating a request for an exception. While the letter from U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue doesn't offer any clues as to the exact details of the government's argument, the move signals that the filing in question will be a significant one.  ""The defendant raises a number of arguments in his brief regarding the dismissal of the indictment,"" Donoghue wrote, explaining:  ""The government does not have the benefit of a reply and intends to provide the Court with a complete picture of the facts that are directly relevant to both, the facial attack on the indictment and to constitutional vagueness.""  Donoghue asked for permission to file as many as 40 pages, though he said that the department would aim to keep the filing – which Zaslavskiy has consented to – beneath that limit.  The deadline for the DOJ's filing is Monday, March 19.

The move was announced Thursday during the Blockchain Unbound conference in San Juan. Manuel Laboy Rivera, Puerto Rico's secretary of economic development and commerce, struck a bullish tone during remarks about the tech's future prospects. The council is composed of a mix of public and private sector representatives, including Rivera, the government's chief innovation officer and its secretary of the Treasury, as well as a mix of entrepreneurs and investors that have moved to Puerto Rico.  Blockchain, he said, ""is accelerating economic and social changes worldwide and Puerto Rico wants to be a part of it.""  The creation of the council comes after a number of high-profile blockchain and cryptocurrency entrepreneurs followed investor Brock Pierce to U.S. commonwealth to set up a ""crypto utopia"" of sorts.  According to Rivera, Puerto Rico already offers a beneficial location for new businesses, a state of affairs that is buoyed by the tax incentives outlined in several legislative acts. These include Act 22, which provides exemptions for individual investors that are residents of the island.  On top of that, Rivera said the government – through the advisory council – will be looking at ways to develop the best possible regulations and legal framework to support blockchain businesses. That said, as a U.S. commonwealth, Puerto Rico has all the protections given by federal government and must also abide by American regulatory frameworks.  Puerto Rico's interest in attracting blockchain entrepreneurs and investors comes after the island was hit by Hurricane Maria, the tenth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record.  As such, the government in Puerto Rico would like to diversify its economy – and according to Rivera, officials there see blockchain as one way to do that. And after detailing the openness of the government to the industry, Rivera, pointing to the beautiful landscape and vibrant culture on the island, joked:  ""But most importantly, you'll be doing business in a tropical island.""

42401286,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWSP,1521129605,Ethereum's First Production Scaling Project Is Here – But With a Catch,"A TechStars-incubated startup has launched what looks like the first production-ready platform designed to increase the capacity of ethereum.  Called Loom Network, the little-known company is today releasing a developer toolkit that makes it possible to deploy scalable ethereum apps on the second-largest cryptocurrency network, effectively leapfrogging ongoing efforts such as Raiden Network and Plasma.  For network users, the timing of the release couldn't be more welcome. Scaling has long been top of mind for stakeholders of major cryptocurrencies, and on ethereum ever since CryptoKitties congested the network late last year.  But while other developers have been tinkering away on several off-chain solutions, which are in the testing phase right now, Loom Network's platform uses so-called ""dappchains,"" which can be thought of as mini blockchains, that they say are ready today.  Loom Network head of business development Michael Cullinan told CoinDesk:  ""Basically, the Loom platform is a developer platform to make it simple to make highly-scalable apps on the blockchain.""  Creating chains  To do that, Loom Network – which raised $25 million in a private token sale –takes a bit of a different approach than other scaling projects.  When a developer creates a new program, Loom Network spins up a new blockchain – a ""sidechain"" of sorts – that's made specifically for the app and then connects to the ethereum blockchain.  The process has noticeable parallels to several other cryptocurrency projects out there – sidechains have been touted as a way to tie different features to bitcoin's main network, and researchers speculate that a new type of fork, called a velvet fork, might one day enable similar functionality.  However, Loom Network's sidechains are different in that they're specifically made for scaling, lifting capacity from the main ethereum network.  Yet, there's a catch, one that Cullinan admitted. ""It's not going to have the same level of security that the main ethereum network will have,"" he said.  And that's because while these sidechains work, they're centralized under Loom Network's control (for the time being). As such, not every action needs to be sent over the ethereum blockchain and Loom will keep track of those actions that aren't.  ""Commenting or changing a profile picture doesn't necessarily require the security of the ethereum mainchain,"" Cullinan said. ""That's what would happen on the sidechain.""  Although, other actions will need the security and censorship resistance that ethereum offers.  Knowing that transactions are different and that they should be handled differently is one of the reasons Cullinan believes Loom will be successful since the startup offers a ""spectrum"" of options. It's up to developers to decide how much of their app data they want to be routed over the ethereum network.  Plus, Loom Network plans to ""open"" the network over time in an attempt to decentralize it further.  Centralization first  This centralization-first approach isn't a new idea in the blockchain world.  Bitcoin sidechain project RSK and even CryptoKitties are examples of projects that are centralized today, but their developers hope, with technological progress, they'll be able to decentralize over time.  However, Loom Network is the first ethereum scalability project to start with the more centralized model first.  That said, some might argue this centralized approach might be worth it, since the apps built on Loom Network so far work well, showing how easy spinning up ethereum-based blockchain apps might be one day.  For instance, earlier this week, the team launched its first test app, DelegateCall, on top of their technology. The web app mirrors StackOverflow, the popular developer question-and-answer forum, yet it's tied to the ethereum blockchain. The team has also launched three other apps on the Loom Network.  While the startup is announcing its product as production ready, not everyone can start deploying apps yet.  For now, the platform is in closed-beta, open to just a few select ethereum developers who want to take a stab at building apps on the platform. Soon that will change, though, when team open-sources the code so that more developers can check it for bugs, Cullinan said.  Despite the caveats around the scalability mechanism's security, the company's recent Reddit threads have carried a lot of excitement, with one user exclaiming:  ""This is freaking big.""

Abra founder and CEO Bill Barhydt explained in a press release:  “Our goal is to empower customers around the world, using their local currencies to freely invest in a wide variety of cryptocurrencies at any time.”  A spokesperson for the company said each of the 20 new cryptocurrencies are held directly on the user's phone, allowing them access to their coins at any time.  For customers who want to keep their balances in any of 50 fiat currencies, the platform uses stablecoins based on bitcoin or litecoin in conjunction with smart contracts (also based on bitcoin or litecoin) to offset crypto price volatility, according to the company.

The firm notes that the model allows it to quickly add more cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds or commodities as it see fit, as well as reducing counterparty risk.  Abra's platform can be used to send funds, in addition to investing, allowing it to act as a cryptocurrency bank, of sorts.

42401289,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWVM,1521126043,Lightning Labs Launches Beta With Twitter CEO Backing,"A version of bitcoin’s much-anticipated Lightning Network is finally ready for real users.  Announced today, California startup Lightning Labs has officially launched a beta version of its software (LND), making available what investors and project leads say is the first thoroughly tested version of the tech to date. This means that users can now leverage LND to send bitcoin and litecoin to other users, all without settling those transactions on the blockchain.  While this software is one of several seeking to form a combined network that aims to make cryptocurrency transactions faster and cheaper, today’s development effectively takes bitcoin a step closer to new kinds of applications, such as Internet of Things payments and recurring billing.  That’s because, similar to bitcoin, the Lightning protocol isn't managed by any one person or company. It's a series of compatible technologies. Bitcoin-centric startups Blockstream and ACINQ have released software compliant with the candidate version 1.0 of the Lightning protocol specification released in January.  Still, the Lightning Labs software is believed to be the most mature software to date – and investors are using the launch to signal their interest.  Also revealed today, Lightning Labs has raised $2.5 million from nearly a dozen investors including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Square Capital executive Jacqueline Reses, litecoin creator Charlie Lee and former PayPal COO David Sacks.  While Dorsey and Reses declined to comment other than to confirm they invested, Sacks was vocal in his belief that the beta release marks a crucial moment in bitcoin’s history.  “Lightning is the most important protocol being built on bitcoin and Lightning Labs is the best developer of that protocol,"" Sacks told CoinDesk.  Fellow investor Ben Davenport, CTO at the blockchain security company BitGo, agreed the launch is a pivotal milestone.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's something the entire community has been focused on and working towards for the better part of two years now. It's really the culmination of a lot of work by many people, not just Lightning Labs. ... We see it as a very important piece of the scaling solution for bitcoin, and perhaps other digital currencies as well.""  Team spirit  To Lee’s point, thousands of people around the world contributed to today's Lightning release, from volunteer testers who helped find bugs in the original alpha version, to developers like Jim Posen at the exchange platform Coinbase, who contributed code through GitHub.  ""The community engagement around Lightning has been amazing,"" Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark told CoinDesk, adding that she plans to keep the software freely accessible. ""The protocol will always be open source and right now everything we are making will be open source,"" she said.  When Stark asked the audience at a recent decentralization summit in Berlin who had already tested Lightning, hundreds of people raised their hands. ""We have around 1,800 people on the Slack for LND alone,"" she added. ""We already have dozens of apps that developers have built.""  But it’s important to note that even this beta should be used with caution.  Stark’s team built in a few safety measures to limit the amount of cryptocurrency people can send for now to roughly $1,400 worth per channel, or around $400 per payment. The target demographic for the release is developers and “advanced users” who are able to run a full node and use LND’s command-line interface.  Stark went on to warn that users should not experiment with more money than they are willing to lose.  “We were not recommending use on the main bitcoin network before this beta because there are certain features, such as a wallet seed backup, that were not there previously. There are new features included as well, there are bug fixes and stability improvements,” she explained.  Booting up  Still, it’s a release that’s likely to spur interest and engagement, given that developers are already sending money over the network – regardless of warnings.  As such, Stark now expects people with the skills to host their own bitcoin or litecoin node to add Lightning Labs’ free software to the mix for quicker, cheaper transactions. Already, there are already roughly a 1,000 nodes running Lightning software on the bitcoin mainnet. Investors in the project believe the release will boost that growing number.  Davenport said:  ""What I hope to see, and am optimistic to see, is a Cambrian explosion of development of Lightning-based apps and other things that incorporate Lightning.""  Several contributors spoke of Lightning as a long-term investment in blockchain infrastructure, something that Lee, whose time is dedicated toward a wholly different protocol, spoke to.  A long-time advocate for Lightning, Lee expressed his hope that even more experiments will now be possible with the software, including transactions that occur across blockchains.  ""It's great to see Lightning Network being used in the real world. I'm also excited to soon being able to do cross-chain atomic swaps between bitcoin and litecoin,” he said.  In this way, Lee's comments can be seen as summing up the impact of the day's news.  If bitcoin really is the ground floor of the emerging cryptocurrency ecosystem, then Lightning is the first staircase. This release marks a vote of confidence that the staircase really is safe for builders to start, with cautious steps, climbing up.

The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office reportedly confiscated hard drives, mobile phones, and documents in the search for evidence. One prosecutor was quoted as saying:  ""The firms turned up on our radar in January during our investigation of suspicious money transfers between Bitcoin exchanges that were detected during an audit by the Financial Services Commission and the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit.""  Another report indicates that the exchanges have been taken over by the country's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Commission (FSA), and that the operators of the companies are being charged with embezzlement.  The news comes amid increasing scrutiny of cryptocurrency businesses in South Korea, as the country moved to clamp down on what it considered rampant speculation and criminal activities such as money laundering.  In January, the Financial Supervisory Service reportedly indicated it was investigating possible insider trading of cryptocurrencies by its own staff and that it would make public any findings on the allegations.  Later that month, the Korea Customs Service said that a total of 637.5 billion won (around $600 million) in foreign currencies had been exchanged illegally, including unrecorded capital outflows using cryptocurrencies.  Furthermore, initial coin offerings (ICOs) were outright banned last September, although recent reports suggest regulators may be considering softening that stance.  The government has also restricted cryptocurrency trading, outlawing anonymous virtual accounts at the end of January. After that date, only accounts associated with identified users could be accepted via approved banks.

42401288,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWUN,1521116132,US Bills Could Spell Disaster for Crypto Sex Industry,"Anyone who says crypto doesn't have a real use case hasn't been talking to sex workers.  Shut out of more mainstream payment methods, they've been among the first users of cryptocurrency, creating a symbiotic dynamic between the adult entertainment industry and blockchain technology that continues today. Since most erotic webcam platforms already use digital tokens of some type to pay performers, freelancers have shown a willingness to use bitcoin.  And the sex industry is keeping up with innovation – Playboy TV and Penthouse are already developing partnerships with the cryptocurrency startup Vice Industry Tokens (VIT), which has issued its own custom cryptocurrency to reward porn viewers and performers.  But that years-long trend could take a hit this week when the U.S. Senate votes on a wildly controversial bill package called FOSTA-SESTA (“Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act” and “ Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Acthttps://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=1DA519D4-4B37-4C5E-B8B9-4A205C5E488F"").  Already, non-profits like the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) are speaking out on the bill, arguing, ""No internet user, website operator, trafficking victim, law enforcement officer or other individual will be immune to the consequences of and fallout from this legislation.""  But the Center for Democracy and Technology is far from alone in its view.  Joining the CDT, the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in their condemnation of FOSTA-SESTA is blockchain startup Spankchain, which sees the bills as enabling lawsuits against ""whoever uses or operates"" a interstate or foreign facility offering questionable adult content.  Spankchain co-founder Janice Griffith, an adult performer herself, told CoinDesk these bills could wreak havoc across their token ecosystem, saying:  ""It will cause a problem for anyone involved in any kind of sex work. Producers can be in trouble for, ‘promoting prostitution,’ it could also potentially cause a problem for token holders... It’s not just porn, it’s an attack on freedom of speech. And it is going to trickle down.""  Basically, these laws make anyone who uses or operates a porn site liable if that site gets flagged for fishy content and isn’t restricted to one specific state.  This is problematic for anyone who talks online about prostitution, which is only legal in Nevada, or facilitates user-generated content. The adult entertainment industry is regulated, but stolen content and footage of real sex crimes can slip past moderators.  It gets especially tricky for platforms or services that use cryptocurrency because then token holders could be seen as having an active role in promoting, buying or profiting from the illicit activity – VIT, for example, records data on the engagement of porn viewers, from clicks to likes, paying users tokens for their personal information.  This means international sites with user-generated content, a crucial part of VIT’s business beyond enterprise partnerships, might soon be vulnerable to lawsuits if any content or chats are seen as “promoting” prostitution. Plus, users and platforms might be held liable if content involves a sex trafficking victim.  Likewise, if people talked about paying escorts on a cryptocurrency forum like Bitcoin Talk, theoretically, the forum itself could be targeted by a lawsuit.  Centralized liability  Some critics go so far as to argue the geographic restrictions in this legislation are absurd. The porn industry is in the middle of a technological renaissance, dominated by a shift to global audiences and traveling performers with strong personal brands.  Much like the cryptocurrency industry, entrepreneurs need to move freely for work. That doesn’t automatically make them sex trafficking victims.  Attorney Zoe Dolan, whose clients include several blockchain startups and unrelated defendants accused of sex crimes, told CoinDesk:  ""If we are honest about ongoing trends away from centralized entities back toward individuals... Congress would probably do better to engage with technology companies and movements rather than pursue an adversarial approach that vests power in plaintiffs' attorneys and prosecutors.""  And the consequences don't stop there. Sex workers have also been outspoken about how these bills would make it harder to talk online about safety tips and personal experiences.  “Make no mistake, if these bills pass, sex workers will die,” adult performer Lorelei Lee told Motherboard. “The ability to share information quickly and widely in our community is the main way that we stay safe.”  Decentralized protocols like VIT throw another wrench into the mix, especially if they track user engagement with specific content. If FOSTA-SESTA passes, token holders could someday be liable for criminal charges, alongside content creators and digital media companies.  Sinful tokens  This threat still isn't stopping token buyers for now. VIT’s website shows its token sale has raised more than $15.7 million worth of ether tokens so far, with roughly a week left to go.  This may be low when gauged against all-time ICO funding, but that figure might be surprising given the climate for such sales. The SEC has recently been vocal in its belief that any token might be considered a security, and now VIT buyers must consider the additional risks related to adult content.  Attorney Nelson Rosario, who specializes in blockchain technology at Marshall, Gerstein & Borun LLP, told CoinDesk:  “The SEC has signaled that most ICO tokens should be considered securities. Individuals really need to do their due diligence before getting involved in the ICO market. Now, add to the mix ICO tokens for sin industry items, and you are really tempting fate.”  This doesn’t inherently mean VIT buyers will face any liability. The bills haven’t even become law yet. However, it does mean token holders need to read up on media regulations and figure out how each platform acquires content.  It would also be prudent for users to avoid tipping or receiving tokens in any context that could be seen as “promoting” prostitution.  “There is a principle in the law that ignorance of the law is no excuse,” Rosario explained. “You can be liable for breaking the law even if you don't know you're breaking the law.”  Blockchain solutions  All of this means that cryptocurrency users involved with the sex industry may soon face more legal risks than ever before. As a blockchain-fueled content platform, Spankchain itself could get hit hard by any additional liability for facilitating open conversations between and about sex workers.  The threat goes beyond the startup’s platform, potentially jeopardizing conduits for marketing and audience engagement. Griffith worries broader media platforms, like Twitter, may ban conversations about sex work entirely rather than deal with complex liability issues.  Are laws that conflate consenting sex workers with trafficking victims really the best way to curtail exploitive digital content?  Even Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote a letter saying FOSTA, aka H.R. 1865, raises “a serious constitutional concern.” Griffith believes blockchain platforms could offer solutions for increased accountability and protection with regards to erotic content, if such platforms aren’t overregulated.  If sex workers are free to use the platform without fear of criminal charges, they can help flag stolen or suspicious content and users. In this way, blockchain technology could help reduce the threat of illicit duplicates spreading across the web.  “We have a complete record of everything occurring on the blockchain. With regards to human trafficking,” Griffith said. “I think that blockchain technology could address the issues that this bill is lying about and saying that they want to address.”  Colorful condoms via Shutterstock  Correction: This report has been updated to amend the name of law firm Marshall, Gerstein & Borun LLP.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/15/us-bills-could-spell-disaster-for-crypto-sex-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34d16277243a8478d24807e2b170ad7399bbe644-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401301,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWi9,1521108953,$6K In Sight? Bitcoin's Correction Up Could Be Brief,"Bitcoin looks set to revisit November lows after a 22 percent drop, but a minor corrective rally looks to be in the offing beforehand.  At time of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is seen at $8,228, having clocked a five-week low of $7,676 earlier today. Meanwhile, BTC's global average price on CoinMarketCap is $8,293 – down 7.44 percent in the last 24 hours.  Prices fell nearly $1,300 on Wednesday, a move reportedly influenced by Google's decision to ban online advertisements promoting cryptocurrencies and related products. The restriction would come into effect from June.  However, even before the announcement from the search giant, the technical charts favored a downside move. The sell-off has sent BTC bulls packing and the cryptocurrency faces the risk of further downside in the days ahead.  4-hour chart: Bear flag breakdown confirmed  Bitcoin fell below the flag support of $8,600 yesterday, signaling the sell-off from the recent high of $11,700 has resumed.  Accordingly, losses extended to lows below $7,700 today and could further decline to $5,500 (target as per the measured height method, discussed yesterday) in the next couple of weeks.  Daily chart: Bearish doji continuation pattern  Tuesday's ""inside day"" doji candle highlighted bullish exhaustion around the critical double top neckline resistance (former support) of $9,280.  Further, Wednesday's negative follow-through confirmed that the corrective rally from the March 9 low of $8,342 has ended and signaled a revival of the downtrend. The pattern only adds credence to the bear flag breakdown seen on the 4-hour chart.  On the way lower, the cryptocurrency may encounter support at $6,410 (ascending trendline) and $6,000 as shown in the chart below.  Weekly chart (linear scale)  All that said, BTC may witness a minor relief rally, courtesy of the oversold conditions as shown by the hourly chart.  Hourly chart  The bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence could push prices higher to $8,700 (hourly 50-MA) and possibly to $9,000 in the next 24 hours.  However, the rally will likely be short-lived as the moving averages are biased to the bears (sloping downwards).  View  BTC looks set to test $6,000 (February low) over the next week or two.  As of now, it appears the corrective rally will likely run out of steam in the range of $8,600 to $9,000 as the major moving averages – 50MA, 100MA, and 200-MA – on the 1-hour chart and 4-hour chart, are trending lower in favor of the bears.  The 10-day MA (currently seen at $9,204) is also biased to the bears. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA would signal bullish invalidation and could yield short-term consolidation.  Meanhwhile, a daily close (as per UTC) above $11,700 would indicate a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

42401298,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWdE,1521107457,"Crypto Investment Firm Violates Securities Laws, Warns Philippines","The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a warning over a cryptocurrency investment platform that it alleges is offering unregistered securities.  According to an advisory issued Wednesday, the SEC takes aim at at firm dubbed Onecash Trading which, according to its website, aims to recruit investors as affiliated cryptocurrency traders or ""builders"" who will be rewarded in local currency for recruiting new members of the scheme.  The SEC alert also states that, based on information it has gathered, the firm has been promising potential investors returns of 200 percent interest over eight weeks.  Onecash boasts global coverage across 73 different countries, though its registered headquarters is not known.  The SEC said the firm is offering investors in the Philippines offerings of unregistered securities, and as such:  ""The public is hereby warned that such investment schemes whether with the use of money or virtual currencies such as bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, dash, litecoin, monero, SIBcoin, mooncoin and many others are considered as securities subject to the regulatory authority of this Commission.""  The recruitment of new scheme members is also considered a form of investment solicitation or a sale of securities, it adds.  As stated in the advisory, salesmen, brokers, dealers or agents involved with promoting, selling and recruiting investment services for Onecash may be prosecuted and face penalties up to 5 million pesos ($270,000) or imprisonment of up to 21 years.  Like regulators in a number of countries, the Philippines SEC has been increasing its oversight over cryptocurrency related investments recently, following a cease-and-desist order it issued to an initial coin offering in January. In this case, the agency stopped short of issuing such an order for Onecash, however.

The initiative, dubbed the Global Blockchain Investment and Development Center (GBIDC), is said to be led by the Investment Association of China (IAC), a social organization that facilitates major domestic investment projects and has attracted foreign capital, according news outlet The Paper.  The news first emerged when a document was circulated over the internet, which appeared to be issued by the IAC regarding the new entity.  Since then, Liu Ren, vice chairman of the IAC, has confirmed the document's authenticity to The Paper, explaining that the effort came about after the association noted the growing popularity of blockchain. As a result, the association made the decision to provide funding and shape standards for the industry, he added.  However, whether the funding sources will be sought from the state or private sectors remains unknown so far.  The new funding center, which will be set up under the IAC's Foreign Investment Committee, will seek future collaborations with overseas blockchain projects and will invest in high quality domestic initiatives. The scope of the GBIDC will also include providing consulting services to institutions that are interested in investing in blockchain initiatives.  Founded in 2001, the IAC reports directly to China's National Development and Reform Commission, the major government agency in charge of economic and investment reform in the country.  The GBIDC initiative comes as China is seeing a growing number of government-led efforts to develop the domestic blockchain industry.  Just this week, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China announced that it will launch a committee to develop national standards for blockchain technology.

42401270,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcQ0H9,1521090001,Velvet Forks: Crypto Updates Without the Controversy?,"Velvet has always been a sign of nobility, but in the crypto space, it's now the name adorning a new and promising way for upgrading blockchain software.  At least that's the hype behind ""velvet forks,"" a mechanism for upgrading cryptocurrency code that has some high-profile crypto enthusiasts intrigued.  ""We think the most interesting part is the idea that you can introduce some new concepts to permissionless blockchains without necessarily having a majority of consensus participants agree to do so,"" said Imperial College London research assistant Alexei Zamyatin.  And that complex statement cuts to the core of why Zamyatin and others believe velvet forks might be beneficial.  In short, in the cryptocurrency space, there have long been two types of forks that people generally discuss - soft forks and hard forks.  While soft forks are seen as less disruptive in that they're backwards-compatible, they can still be controversial when used to initiate changes not all cryptocurrency users agree with. Further, hard forks are generally seen in a dubious light since they can split a blockchain in two if not all users decide to update to the new rules.  With velvet forks, however, some researchers think the cryptocurrency world can get around some of the disruptive politics that generally bog down major code changes.  First coined by computer scientists working on building proofs that can potentially be used to improve sidechains, a layer-two cryptocurrency technology for pushing transactions off-chain, a velvet fork allows developers to add new rules to a blockchain without full support from the entire ecosystem.  According to Zamyatin, ""It's not rocket science. It's a pretty simple concept.""  As such, Zamyatin and several other researchers co-authored a new paper that dives deeper into where the mechanism can be applied, which he presented during the Financial Crypto 2018 conference in Curacao at the beginning of the month.  The new paper states:  ""The velvet fork [...] does not require support of a majority of participants and can potentially avoid rule disagreement forks from happening altogether.""  In the wild  Simply, a fork is a way to upgrade a cryptocurrency system to support important new rules, and throughout the history of multiple cryptocurrency protocols, forks have been used often.  From the hard fork that split ethereum into a competing cryptocurrency ethereum classic to less controversial forks like the one used to move bitcoin to a new signature scheme to the ever-growing number of forks designed to not only create new cryptocurrencies with new features, but also make entrepreneurs (or scammers) substantial amounts of money, forks have become a part of life in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  But these mechanisms come with a fair amount of controversy much of the time, which is partly why Zamyatin and other academics are so interested in the velvet fork approach.  In the December 2017 paper where velvet forks were first mentioned, the mechanism is described as one that allows for ""gradual deployment"" without harming the miners that haven't upgraded to the new rules. In this way, it acts similar to a soft fork in that clients that upgrade to new rules are still compatible with those that don't.  Further, the paper states that velvet forks require ""no rule modifications to the consensus layer,"" what some see as advantageous since these are the rules everyone in the system needs to agree with, or everything will break.  While it hasn't become widely-used as a way of upgrading, velvet forks exist in the wild today in various forms (although researchers argue there wasn't an official name for the mechanism before this recent wave of research).  For example, the decentralized mining pool P2pool regularly uses a velvet fork of sorts.  Since there is no one entity (replacing that with code instead) that controls the payments dispersed to the miners of the pool for their work, the pool created a second blockchain with an easier difficulty that only miners part of the pool can contribute to. This blockchain is used to gauge how much computing power each miner is contributing, so the protocol can pay them out proportionally.  Even though the blocks generated by P2pool use these extra rules, miners that don't play by these same rules still accept P2pool's blocks.  As such, P2pool is an example of a ""velvet fork"" because the blocks (from both their proprietary blockchain and the bitcoin blockchain) live side-by-side in harmony, without causing a split.  Bias and bribery  Still, velvet forks are a potential vulnerability.  Namely, the paper describes possible ways that velvet forks could be abused by bad actors for their own gain.  For instance, say a velvet is deployed. Zamyatin's paper describes a scenario where some miners, called ""velvet miners,"" upgrade to new rules while others ignore the new rules. If the blocks that the velvet miners create are somehow more lucrative than regular blocks, the paper argues other miners could be ""biased towards accepting upgraded over legacy blocks.""  ""This, in turn, can have an unclear impact on the security assumptions of such systems, as current attack models mostly do not assume a variable utility of blocks,"" the paper continues.  And Zamyatin himself described another attack vector, which involves ""selfish mining.""  Selfish mining is a process whereby miners hide the fact that they've found a block, keeping other miners searching for that block while they move on to searching for the next block. This gives them a head start of sorts in also winning the next block. And according to Zamyatin, velvet forks could enable new opportunities here.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I can bribe people to work on my chain. There's no guarantee that I'll win, but it could potentially offer an incentive to deviate from the protocol rules.""  Still, more research is needed, as Zamyatin admits he isn't sure how serious these problems are in practice.  Opening the door  But both these vulnerabilities and the thought of the changes velvet forks might enable are reasons Zamyatin wants researchers to spend more time looking into velvet forks.  Although, Zamyatin acknowledges that velvet forks aren't a silver bullet.  ""This doesn't work for something like Segregated Witness (SegWit) of course,"" he said, referring to a bitcoin code change that fueled a two-year debate in the community over the technical direction of the protocol.  That said, it's still potentially useful for other types of changes.  Zamyatin noted that he's looking into how it might be possible to use a velvet fork for bringing GHOST, the protocol that ethereum was originally modeled after, to bitcoin. Because it completely restructures the system to try to speed things up, it likely wouldn't get enough support for a soft or hard fork, and as such a velvet fork where some get to opt in while staying in consensus with those that don't could be the only way.  And velvet forks might also help breath new life into older proposed innovations.  Cornell associate professor Emin Gün Sirer, for instance, said he ""very much"" likes the idea of using a velvet fork for adding the long-stalled Bitcoin-NG (standing for ""next-generation"") protocol, an idea he pioneered which looks to improve throughput by rearranging the bitcoin blockchain, to the cryptocurrency.  ""While [the paper is] short on the details, the overall idea of adding new functionality without incurring the risks and complication of either a soft or a hard fork is quite compelling,"" Sirer told CoinDesk.  And perhaps most far-fetched but interesting of all, Zamyatin believes an even bigger vision could be realized with velvet forks.  He told CoinDesk:  ""You could even have multiple versions running in parallel, perhaps even compatible to each other, and all this without necessitating often controversial soft or hard forks.""

The company is part of a wider blockchain consortium that experimented with technology developed by consultancy firm Accenture. Other participants included shipping container firm APL, logistics company Kuehne+Nagel, and an unnamed European customs organization.  The pilot saw the companies involved use Accenture's solution for 12 real-world shipments, all of which were sent to a different jurisdiction that each carried its own particular regulatory requirements. The results ""confirmed that blockchain can reduce operating costs and increase supply chain visibility,"" according to Accenture.  Danillo Figueiredo, vice president of international logistics for AB InBev:  ""We continually evaluate new technologies and innovations to enhance our operations to meet consumer needs and deliver the freshest beer. Blockchain technology will be transformational to our business and the world. It reduces mistakes, digitizes information and improves the supply chain process so we can focus on our core business of brewing the best beers for consumers.""  The pilot marks the latest effort to shift from a traditionally paper-based process to a wholly digitized one, using the tech as part of an effort to streamline the data-sharing process between different stakeholders.  Among the companies that have pursued similar applications are the Japanese shipping firm Mitsui OSK Lines, announced a partnership with IBM in a proof-of-concept that looks to streamline the global trade flow.  Last year, the Danish shipping giant Maersk completed its first live blockchain trial. Like Mitsui OSK, Maersk also worked with IBM, levering the open-source Fabric blockchain software.

At press time, the price of bitcoin is roughly $7,811.22 across global exchanges, a figure that represents a decline of over $300 from the day's open, and the lowest price observed on the index since Feb. 11, when the BPI hit a low of $7,845.13.  The market development highlights the continued market weakness seen this week, as evidenced by bitcoin's slide toward $8,000 over the course of Wednesday's session.  Still, other major cryptocurrencies are also seeing losses as well, including ethereum and its ether token, which slid below $600 for the first time since mid-February. According to CoinDesk data, the price of ether is trading at $588.32, a decline of about 4 percent since the open.  Ripple's XRP token is down today as well, hitting $0.65 as of press time after trading above $0.70 for much of the day.  Data from OnChainFX reveals that all of the top-20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have fallen in excess of 10 percent in the past 24 hours, with many seeing declines of 15 percent or more. Among those, cardano, vechain, iota, XEM, lisk, NEO gas and icon are all down over 20 percent within that period.

A portfolio company of Overstock's Medici Ventures arm, Bitt said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the ECCB to test its technology for know-your-customer, anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of terrorism procedures within the central bank's member nations.  Those member nations include Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Launching next year, the pilot will be restricted to controlled environments and supervised by the bank, according to a press release. The results could be used to develop more effective digital payment and settlement systems, and may also be used to help issue a digital currency for the region.  Bitt will specifically look to track data management, compliance and transaction monitoring, according to the press release.  ECCB governor Timothy Antoine said the pilot is part of the bank’s 2017-2021 strategic plan. He continued:  “As the ECCB promotes the safety and soundness of the financial system in the ECCU, it also has a responsibility to encourage and support innovation consistent with the Bank's mandate to facilitate the balanced growth and development of member countries. To that end, blockchain technology merits our attention and consideration at this time.”  Details about how long the pilot will last or when its results would be available were not available.  However, the press release did note that any digital currency issued would be used alongside the region’s existing fiat currency.
