Over the course of a particularly active session, the cryptocurrency, once marketed to as the ""silver to bitcoin's gold"", reached as much as $15.09 at approximately 00:30 UTC, its highest since March 2014, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  At the time of report, the digital asset had fallen slightly to $14.48 – yet this figure was still three times higher than price observed last month.  After years of dormancy, litecoin has seen its price rally lately as it comes ever closer to obtaining the miner support it needs to activate a technical upgrade called Segregated Witness. (Should current support levels hold, it's expected upgrade will ""lock in"" in about two weeks).  At the time of report, 77.81% of litecoin miners were signaling their support for the upgrade. SegWit, a solution originally created for bitcoin, would increase litecoin's block capacity by reducing the amount of data associated with each individual transaction.  As such, the support that miners have been showing for this solution is cited as the primary influence on the recent price increase.  ""Over the past week, LTC basically moved in tandem with the percentage of miners supporting it. Miner support is now 99.65% [in the past 24 hours], so litecoin is doing well,"" said Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Management.  Over the long-term, litecoin's implementation of SegWit could have many positive implications, other analysts said.  Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to this situation:  ""I think this is very positive for litecoin. It is showing that that community can come together and make progress.""

42399784,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyicX,1493150107,Bank of England Seeks Startups for DLT Privacy Projects,"The UK's central bank is seeking startups to take part in distributed ledger projects focused on data privacy.  In a speech from 12th April and published yesterday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney told attendees of a conference on FinTech that the central bank wants to expand work it began in earnest last year. The applications being researched by the bank include digital currency – an area being explored by a number of central banks worldwide.  According to Carney, the Bank of England is moving to open its startup accelerator – first revealed in the transcript of a cancelled speech last summer – to additional firms.  Carney explained:  ""Today we are opening our 4th round of applications to the Accelerator. We are looking to work on new proofs of concept on maintaining privacy in a distributed ledger and applying a range of big data tools to support the Bank’s analysis.""  The news is the latest signal that the Bank of England is widening the scope of its work with blockchain and distributed ledgers. The central bank has emerged in the past year as one of the more proactive institutions when it comes to exploring applications of the tech.  Earlier this month, officials from the Bank of England disclosed that a new version of its real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system will be compatible with blockchain. That decision followed months of consultation on whether to take this approach, starting in September.  Recent months have also seen the central bank expand its collaborative work on blockchain. In February, the central bank became a member of the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger blockchain project.

42399773,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyiUf,1493145023,Purse Launches Testnet for Bitcoin Scaling Tech 'Extension Blocks',"A new element was added to the bitcoin scaling debate this week when the developer team behind startup Purse announced the launch of a testnet to trial its scaling solution, extension blocks.  Purse had already presented the ideas behind extension blocks in a blog post earlier this month, but the testnet will allow users to interact with working code for the new technology, available through GitHub.  So far, the launch seems to have galvanized early supporters, drawn to the way that the proposal would separate the block size from the network's consensus rules, essentially allowing peers to set their own version of the limit.  BitPay CEO Stephen Pair, for example, announced that his company would be participating in the technical evaluation of the testnet, and gave his backing to future implementation of the idea, contingent on testing.  ""If it holds up to scrutiny, we may support activation on the mainnet,"" Pair wrote in a Medium post.  For those who haven't been following, proponents of extension blocks see it as a way to scale network capacity that will appeal to various factions in the current debate, thereby building consensus among developers and mining pools that have previously been at odds.  However, support for extension blocks is not universal.  In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussing the Purse team's initial extension block specification, Core developer Luke Dashjr assessed that the proposal as one that would ""creat[e] a lot of additional technical debt"".  Johnson Lau, author of an earlier extension block proposal in January, also warned of possible security risks:  ""Logically speaking if SegWit is not safe, this BIP could only be worse,"" Lau wrote in an email to the bitcoin-dev list.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, the SEC shot down a bid by the Winklevoss brothers to get the ETF listed on the Bats BZX exchange in March. Specifically, the agency declined a rule change proposed by Bats that would have cleared the path for the ETF, citing a lack of market surveillance and regulation.  Less than two weeks after the decision was handed down, Bats petitioned for a review – a move that the agency has now greenlit.  The SEC said yesterday that it had approved the review, opening the door to further comment between now and 15th May.  The agency said:  ""Pursuant to Rule 431 of the Rules of Practice,11 BZX's petition for review of the Disapproval Order is granted. Further, the Commission hereby establishes that any party to the action or other person may file a written statement in support of or in opposition to the Disapproval Order on or before May 15, 2017.""  The news comes weeks after the SEC rejected another bitcoin-tied ETF, proposed by SolidX, that would have listed on the NYSE Arca exchange if approved. At the time, the price of bitcoin set new all-time highs – even passing the price of gold – amid speculation about the investment vehicle.  The decision further flies in the face of popular commentary, as analysts polled by CoinDesk initially saw an uphill road for an attempts to reinstate the proposal.

42399782,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyibY,1493136021,The SEC is Now Weighing an Ethereum ETF Proposal,"The SEC has quietly begun the process of weighing whether to approve an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the cryptocurrency ether (ETH).  The backers of the EtherIndex Ether Trust first filed in July 2016, seeking to launch an ETF backed by a cache of ethers on the NYSE Arca exchange. NYSE Arca then filed for a proposed rule change clearing the way for the ETF listing in December, according to a notice published in January.  A new noticehttps://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2017/34-80501.pdf) from the SEC reveals that the agency has begun weighing whether it will approve the proposed ETF.  The agency remarked in the notice:  ""Institution of such proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change. Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as described below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change.""  The potential launch of an ether ETF – though subject to final approval – would mark the latest development in the ether's market, following recent price increases that have seen the value of 1 ETH rise above $50.  The SEC is also seeking comments and feedback on which approach it should take, though notably, a previous comment solicitation went unanswered, according to the agency.  It remains to be seen whether the SEC moves to approve the proposed ETF. In the past month and a half, the SEC has rejected rule changes that would have cleared the way for two bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns over market surveillance and insufficient regulation.

42399771,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyiSh,1493133147,UASF Developer Revises Controversial Bitcoin Scaling Proposal,"A controversial proposal for upgrading the bitcoin blockchain saw a notable strategy shift this weekend.  Since its publication on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on 25th February, a proposal by pseudonymous contributor Shaolinfry for a user-activated soft fork (UASF) has been widely discussed – and framed by some as a possible way around the current deadlock over SegWit activation.  Conversation has so far centered on how the need for a supermajority consensus in network decision-making means that any mining pool with enough hashing power holds effective veto power over any proposal, a fact many believe is responsible for delays in SegWit adoption.  The logic of a UASF, by contrast, is to bypass this veto power and put signaling into the hands of the digital currency's user base as a whole.  After the first general proposal for a UASF, Shaolinfry put forward a second proposal, BIP148, focused on putting the onus of supporting SegWit onto the 'economic majority', moving power out of the miners' hands.  Yet, even after it gained momentum, high-profile voices such as Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell and other bitcoin developers rejected the proposal on the basis it could undermine the stability of the bitcoin ecosystem.  ""We should use the least disruptive mechanisms available and the BIP148 proposal does not meet that test,"" Maxwell wrote.  It's against this backdrop that Shaolinfry has announced work on a redraft of the proposal, which is aimed to address some of the concerns voiced by Maxwell and others in the community.  Shaolinfry conceded at the beginning of an announcement post that the reason for the changes is related to technical criticisms of how the plan would upgrade the network.  Shaolinfry wrote:  ""BIP 148 is certainly not what a normal UASF would or should look like. While support for BIP 148 is surprisingly high, there are definitely important players who support UASF in general but do not like BIP148 approach.""  The revised proposal, allocated the identifier BIP8, is an addition to BIP9, a proposal that concerns how soft forks are implemented.  Scaling context  The changes also hint at what could happen should bitcoin's scaling debate continue over the course of 2017.  Currently, if the 95% hashrate support for SegWit is not reached by the end of a certain time window (15th November), the proposal is set to be discarded by default.  However, technical changes made in a proposal under the terms of BIP8 would be automatically locked in at the end of the time period, although they could also be adopted sooner.  Shaolinfry's suggestion is that after the 15th November cut off date, a UASF SegWit proposal be made under the terms of BIP8.  This would mean that the community would have a full year from the present date to prepare for upgrading by means of a UASF, removing the possible destabilizing effect of a short-term.  The developer argued in the post:  ""I believe this approach would satisfy the more measured approach expected for bitcoin and does not have the issues [Maxwell] brought up about BIP148.""  So far, there has been less of a response from the community on the terms of BIP8, but the idea of an automatic lock-in could be contentious.  However, with the community stalled over SegWit (and litecoin moving forward on its upgrade), the suggestion of an unambiguous adoption procedure will doubtless seem appealing for many observers.

42399780,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyidW,1493129261,What's Driving Ether Classic to All-Time Highs?,"The price of ether classic surged to an all-time high this week, surpassing previous peaks and largely surprising traders.  The cryptocurrency that powers the alternative ethereum software platform ethereum classic reached a fresh high of $4.11 at 12:00 UTC yesterday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At this price, the digital asset was more than 16% above its previous highest value, set in 2016.  The cryptocurrency has retreated somewhat so far today to $4.02, but was still well above previous marks.  Created last July by a hard fork of the ethereum platform, ethereum classic is a continuation of the blockchain abandoned by that developer team. It has since attracted new developer and miner interest, and the resulting community later outlined a roadmap aimed at differentiating its software.  Currently, ethereum classic is the sixth largest blockchain by market capitalization.  Mixed opinions  As for what drove the cryptocurrency’s recent gains, analysts seemed short of explanation, given the lack of development around the project of late.  Yet, ether classic may have been buoyed as traders anticipating a boost in prices ahead of the launch of a possible institutional investment vehicle focused on the cryptocurrency, according to Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management.  He highlighted progress on an offering from Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary Grayscale Investments – the Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trusthttps://grayscale.co/ethereum-investment-trust/ announced in January – that would aim to give institutional investors exposure to the new asset as a possible cause.  Jacob Eliosoff, an algorithmic trader, mirrored this assessment, stating that buying was likely in expectation of a ""bump"" when the trust materializes.  Other observers chocked up the rise to the illiquidity that has come to define the smaller cryptocurrency markets, stating that it could have been brought about by the whims of a few large traders.  Still while the answer may be unknown, adding weight to the rally is that ether classic rose to this new record amid robust volume, as 24-hour volume reached $46.7m, CoinMarketCap figures show.  Grayscale Investments declined to comment when reached.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which owns Grayscale Investments.

42399777,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyiaZ,1493126877,Internet Giant Tencent is Building a Blockchain Platform,"Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent is building a suite of blockchain services, detailing the plans in a new white paper.  The firm – the maker of popular social services such as QQ and WeChat – is planning to use the technology to offer digital asset management, authentication and ""shared economies"", among others services. The new platform, dubbed ""TrustSQL"", is envisioned as a three-part system, incorporating the core chain layer, a product and service layer, and an application layer.  In statements, Tencent said that it would leverage its technological resources to push the platform, and that it sees the project as an open-ended one that encourages collaboration with other firms. (TrustSQL is envisioned as a way ""to promote the development of [a] trusted internet"", according to a rough translation of the paper.)  The white paper further included a call for the government to play a more active role in the development of blockchain within China.  ""The involvement of government in the development and regulation of block chains is necessary and should encourage in-depth research on blockchain technology and block-chain applications,"" the authors wrote.  Though the exact timing of the launch isn’t yet known – statements indicate that the platform is still in development – the unveiling nonetheless represents Tencent's most direct move in the blockchain space to date.  Last summer, a subsidiary of Tencent was among 31 companies in China to back a Shenzhen-based blockchain consortium. Tencent-backed Webank also took part in a blockchain event in September of last year.

42399791,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyihS,1493122548,Inside the JBI: China's Massive New Blockchain Research Effort,"The government of the Chinese province of Jiangsu is backing a new research effort aimed at offering unbiased information to businesses coming up to speed on blockchain.  Launched in September 2016, the Jiangsu Huaxin Blockchain Research Institute (JBI) is now going public via CoinDesk as the first state-owned enterprise to focus solely on blockchain tech. Already, the group, backed by parent firm Beijing Huaxin Electronics Enterprise Group, claims to have roughly 100 employees at its office in Nanjing working to develop its product.  According to executive director of operations Michael Yeung, the group in many ways can be read as a reaction to the growing hype in the blockchain industry, as well as the increasing desire global governments have shown for becoming active on R&D.  At CoinDesk's offices in New York, Yeung and five of his colleagues discussed how international businesses in the sector are aggressively targeting the Chinese market, and how this has created a new appetite for informational services domestically.  Yeung stressed that unlike established consortium groups, JBI intends not to be ""beholden"" to corporates, and that its government affiliation makes it able to focus on overall ecosystem health.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The hype for blockchain in China is massive. There's different ICOs [initial coin offerings] with pretty girls running around and DJs. But we're also serious about blockchain and the future. They're willing to try blockchain.""  With this backdrop, the JBI will seek to offer services working on academic research, education, political engagement and product development centered on blockchain tech.  Senior members of the group include research directors Kraken Yu, formerly of consultancy Chainsmiths; Paul Jones, a former consultant at consultancy CryptoIQ; and Phillip Fox, a former treasury accountant at New Zealand's ASB Bank.  The group's launch further comes amid an active time for blockchain in China. In addition to new policies levied on bitcoin exchanges, the country has seen the launch of new blockchain efforts by its domestic insurance and lending industry, as well as major technology firms like e-commerce giant Alibaba.  To start, JBI is looking to differentiate itself from approaches taken by established startups and consortium efforts.  Though similar in aim, Yeung said that JBI is styling itself as a facilitator, seeking to be more ""comprehensive"" than groups like R3. Of course, this mandate will still require partnerships and network.  (JBI is a member of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Hyperledger, and it has working partnerships with Bitfury, Bloq, Blockstream, ConsenSys, Rootstock and more).  The difference, though, will be in how these relationships develop.  ""You might be a company involved in supply chain and there might be aways for blockchain to help you. We'll see if one of the tools in our partnership portfolio, if it makes sense to connect that with your needs,"" Fox explained.  He noted that this means working with academics and universities on research projects that could inform its matchmaking. Already, the JBI intends to form a consortium of universities that would study applications of the technology.  Further, Fox explained that the JBI wants to work across financial and non-financial use cases, evaluating and working with both private and permissioned blockchains.  Still, he said the overriding goal is to position China as a leader on blockchain technology:  ""It also offers them a leapfrog for cutting-edge technology, so it's clever if they implement it in banking – the west will try to catch up.""  Overlooked opportunities  Elsewhere, JBI seeks to look into blockchain use cases they argue are being underdeveloped.  ""There's lots of different things that blockchain can provide benefits for, and they're not as easy to look at as finance,"" he said, adding:  ""How much profit is there for educators if education is better because of blockchain?""  Right now, the group is still investigating early business partnerships, but Yu framed this also as a way it plans to differentiate.  ""We're not interested in the 10% back-office improvement that will let people get paid. That is not very interesting. We want to serve the 99% and give a 90% revenue,"" Fox continued.  Another unique feature of JBI's model is that it will seek to train and accredit blockchain professionals to provide market transparency.  ""We have ongoing lessons three days a week,"" Yeung said. ""Two-to-three hours of lecture on blockchain, and they have to pass an examination every three months.""  Those individuals, Yeung suggested, would then be able to sell partner technologies or otherwise be involved in various JBI activities.  Work ahead  For now, though, the group is pushing ahead with work on research and a few experimental projects.  Already, JBI is working with Zhongke Media, a state-owned media and advertising entity, on a project that showcases more creative uses for blockchain in the Internet of Things industry.  The project envisions how a company's TVs and ad displays could be upgraded with air filters, the shares of which could then be bought and sold digitally on an open market. The design could serve as a way to both cut down on pollution and help token holders on the blockchain gain steady access to revenue.  ""The TV behind you would have an air filtration unit,"" Yeung explained. ""So, it does two functions, it shows you an advertisement and clears the air space. Investors who invest in that have revenue collected by the machines.""  For all these futuristic use cases, the group noted it has tough work ahead.  Given the state of China's vibrant and experimental cryptocurrency market, JBI's team noted a big part of its mandate is to provide due diligence for wider public benefit and to mitigate consumer risk.  While the task could be daunting, Yu said the group is taking its aspirations seriously, noting the characters used in the company's Chinese name: 江苏华信区块链研究院.  Yu explained:  ""The first character means 'whole'. The second is 'trust.'""

Already, Dianrong has co-founded a blockchain lending platform called Chained Finance; now, less than a week after the firm hired IPO expert Yawen Cui, he has revealed comprehensive plans to swap over much of the startup's services to a blockchain.  In a statement provided to CoinDesk, the former CFO of AliSports said his new employer's focus on transparency and compliance made it a natural fit for widespread use of the technology.  Cui said:  ""We are integrating blockchain technology across our entire platform, where appropriate, to further enhance transparency and security for our borrowers and lenders.""  Founded in 2012 by Lending Club co-founder Soul Htite, the Shanghai-based company has raised $219m venture capital from Standard Chartered, Cross Pacific Capital Partners and others to help put non-bank lenders in touch with borrowers.  By January of this year, Dianrong had released a statement showing that 3.62 million investors had originated a total of ¥16.2bn in loans last year alone, a 148% increase over the previous year, and its fourth year of growth.  Then, last month the firm revealed it had joined Taiwan-based Foxconn to launch Chained Finance, a blockchain trade finance platform built using technology from the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger Project.  While Cui didn't provide details about Dianrong's blockchain efforts, the firm's website details plans for what the company calls 'D-Chain', an ethereum-based solution designed to facilitate tamper-proof loan contracts, donations to charity and credit management.  Cui's hire is notable in that it comes after, not only one of Dianrong's most profitable years according to voluntarily disclosed numbers, but during a time when a public offering has long been planned.  IPO talk around Dianrong goes back at least to 2015 when The Wall Street Journal reported that Htite had set his sights on a $500m public offering. His last P2P firm, Lending Club, is currently valued at $2.32bn.  In June 2016, Htite spoke again of going public, this time to the South China Morning Post. At that time, he said he was open to going public in either China or the US, and set the target IPO timeline for two years.

So said Neha Narula, director of research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, at a one-day event hosted by the MIT FinTech Club this weekend.  Speaking at MIT Fintech Conference 2017, Narula discussed where blockchain is in terms of its evolution, offering strong words of caution for more novice observers.  The comments cut to the core of popular comparisons to the Internet that seek to portray blockchain as a mature technology vertical. Further, Narula's comments were a stark contrast to other voices on the panel, there to focus on blockchain and its impact on banking.  Narula told attendees:  ""At MIT, we are pretty certain we are in the 1970s or 1980s. We think we are around TCP/IP era. We are just figuring out the basic protocols of what is going to be network technologies.”  Banks and blockchain  At other points in the panel, conversation switched to external interest in blockchain tech.  For example, Tim Grant, CEO at R3 Lab and Research Centre, argued blockchain tech won't overhaul the banking system until we get governments, regulators and central banks all on board.  He told the audience:  ""You don't know regulations until you get into financial services.""  That's not to say that there was broad agreement on that opinion, however.  Karen Hsu, head of growth at blockchain web services startup BlockCypher, countered, stating that, in instances like remittances, ""need"" and ""pain"" will lead onerous regulations to adapt.  Because blockchain cuts out the middleman, the technology has the potential to make sending money across borders easier, she argued. Though, even those efforts have run into regulatory problems.  On the other hand, as Andrew Keys, head of global business development of ethereum startup ConsenSys, pointed out, we are seeing a tremendous push for digital ledger technology internationally.  Some of the more active jurisdictions, he noted, have been places like Dubai and Singapore – smaller regions that may be more aggressive in implementing the tech.  Last year, for example, Dubai's government announced it intends to shift all transactions to blockchain by 2020 as part of a strategy to make all departments more efficient. Further, local regulators like the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are becoming involved.  Snag in the plan  Still, some financial processes, like trade settlements, may continue uninterrupted.  Mainly due to a process called 'netting', it is unlikely blockchain technology will ever be useful in settling trades, according to Mark Wetjen, managing director and head of global public policy at Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a post-trade financial services company.  Netting, a process for consolidating transactions, minimizes the regulatory burden that comes with trading capital markets.  While the DTCC processes $3.5tn worth of trades every day, those transactions don't happen in real time. Instead, payments are aggregated, so that only a net value is settled between parties based on a security on a particular day.  Wetjen said:  ""Is there some way where netting isn’t so important anymore, in which case, some technology like a blockchain-based approach could work? Otherwise you are dealing with the concept of gross settlement, where you settle every single trade that takes place in the course of a day. It is massive and introduces a hell of a lot more risk, so most firms don't want to do that.""  On the other hand, he argued, distributed ledger technology is ideal for credit default swaps and 'repos' – a use case the utility is actively exploring with startup Digital Asset Holdings.  In fact, DTCC announced earlier this year a plan to use blockchain to rebuild its platform that processes $11tn worth of credit default swaps.  Road ahead  One thing the panel did agree on, however, is that the blockchain tech still has a long road to travel before meeting the mainstream.  If that is the case, some of the big disruptions many hope to see in banking, even if they occur incrementally, are still some way off in the future.  Hsu summed up the sentiment, saying:  ""While we are making clear, quick wins in areas like reporting and reconciliation, to reach real promise it will take many more years, more collaborations.""

42427479,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKViNh,1493107180,Swift Selects Hyperledger Tech For Cross-Border Blockchain Test,"Swift has officially selected Hyperledger's Fabric codebase for use in its most prominent blockchain project.  Designed to simplify the nostro-vostro accounts banks held to facilitate international transactions, the trial includes participation from BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon and Wells Fargo, as well as three other global financial institutions.  As a founding member of the Linux-led Hyperledger project, it's perhaps not surprising Swift has decided to base its trial on the technology, though it lauded the final work for functionality including user-tailored access to data and other privileges.  If the blockchain proof-of concept (PoC) is successful, Swift's head of the global payments innovation (GPI) initiative, Wim Raymaekers, went so far as to say it could save as much as 30% of the reconciliation costs associated with cross-border payments.  Raymaekers told CoinDesk:  ""We're really looking to see if banks can gain better visibility on their information; to optimize the liquidity that they have on one end, but also to reduce the cost of reconciliation.""  Other banks participating in the PoC include the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) and RBC Royal Bank, which were already working with Swift on GPI.  These partners will be joined by 20 other institutions during the test phase of the implementation.  Notably, the trial will also attempt to capitalize on existing standards used by Swift members. The data stored on the blockchain and the APIs used to query and update that data will conform to Swift's ISO 20022 message formats.  If successful, the blockchain PoC could be incorporated into Swift's GPI solution.  ""When it comes to exchanging data between nostro and vostro data in accounts, there are solutions today,"" Raymaekers said. ""We are looking to see if DLT is a better solution.""  Blockchain nostro  To facilitate international transactions, banks typically store money all over the world in what are called nostro accounts. Yet settlement times can take weeks depending on the complexity of the transaction.  While nostro accounts are designed to save time by moving money closer to where it's needed, before it's needed, that money lies dormant when not in use, collecting less interest than if it was applied in a more active way.  To test if a distributed ledger could minimize the reliance on correspondent banks, Swift divided the trial into two parts, according to Raymaekers.  First, there's the technology itself. Swift's Fabric PoC is being built to leverage the bank messaging platform's existing GPI resources. While launched in February with 12 members, 30 banks are now in some stage of implementation of GPI, with more expected to go live soon.  Using more traditional technology on the GPI toolkit, Raymaekers said Swift has already improved the speed and transparency of its services and now wants to see if blockchain can take it even further.  ""Several hundreds of thousands"" of messages have been sent since GPI's launch, he said.  The second part of the PoC centers on business. On top of the blockchain implementation itself, Swift's developers plan to build and run a smart contract that could help automate the transfer process.  ""We are using DLT to exchange the debits and credits,"" said Raymaekers. ""We are building value added on top through a smart contract application that will show to a bank in real time what it's position is.""  What disruption?  Still, the test also occurs within the wider narrative surrounding Swift, since earlier on in the frenzy surrounding blockchain tech and its possibilities, the financial messaging provider was identified as one of the middlemen most likely to be disintermediated.  Along with the DTCC and others, supporters of the existing legacy financial infrastructure were targeted by startups built from the ground up to capitalize on the efficiency of distributed ledgers.  Yet, this year Swift has established itself as open to the idea of evolving its own business model for possible integration with blockchain tech.  While some skeptics persist in doubting Swift's willingness to let go of its market position and adapt to a new paradigm, Raymaekers asserted that its receptivity to changes goes beyond this project alone.  He said:  ""Maybe there’s a completely new way where you don’t need to hold money at accounts with your correspondent bank. But that is a complete rethinking of the correspondent banking paradigm.""
