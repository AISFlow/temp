42413796,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCKKG,1666219000,Crypto Asset Manager Valkyrie Lost the Biggest Investor in Its $11M Funding Round,"Months after announcing it had raised $11.15 million, crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments earlier this month revealed – quietly – that the biggest participant in the funding round reneged, leaving Valkyrie scrambling to find others to fill the gap.  In a letter that went largely unnoticed until now, Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald wrote that an entity she called CSA Evolution VC Fund was no longer able to contribute $5 million toward the transaction.  ""We had a signed subscription doc in-hand, and their [limited partners] were blue chip firms that have impeccable reputations in the business,"" she wrote in the letter dated Oct. 7. ""In the months that have since passed, though, those LPs backed out and the investor was unable to meet its obligation."" She went on to say that Valkyrie was looking for other investors to step in.  When reached Wednesday, a Valkyrie spokesperson said, ""we of course are in advanced talks with a number of potential investors who have expressed interest in our firm, and hope to have positive news in the coming weeks.""  Before the publication of this story, there was a single Google search result for CSA Evolution VC Fund: Wald's letter. There are signs, however, that there is an association of some kind with Clear Sky Advisers, a Houston-based firm that describes itself as an investor in ""environmental credits and companies focused on decarbonization, electrification and resource sustainability.""  First, there's the obvious: Clear Sky Advisers can logically be shortened to CSA. But far more significantly than that, Valkyrie's June press release on the more than $11 million fundraising listed, among others, a participant it called ""Clearsky."" There was no mention of CSA Evolution VC Fund.  Furthermore, there's a person who clearly connects Valkyrie and Clear Sky Advisers. The CEO of the latter, Shawn Singh, is mentioned in Valkyrie regulatory filings for its exchange-traded funds (ETF). He is listed, for instance, as a trustee of the Valkyrie ETF Trust II.  Clear Sky Advisers declined to comment. Singh did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Funding snafu  In June, Valkyrie Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg downplayed the importance of Valkyrie's raise. He told CoinDesk that Valkyrie had even declined some offers, which were unsolicited. In the end, the decision to accept the investments was “less about the money and more about [forming] strategic partnerships” with key industry players, McClurg said. “We really weren’t anticipating raising any capital right now.""  That message conflicts with Valkyrie's own regulatory filings.  In March, the company told the Securities and Exchange Commission it was seeking to raise $20 million and already had $5.1 million in fresh capital banked. (Valkyrie's previous funding round was a $10 million Series A in June 2021).  And Wald's comments suggest Valkyrie is still hungry for capital.  ""Over the past few months, we explored a number of avenues and potential solutions to get the promised investment in the door,"" she wrote. ""In fact, the firm’s principal recently made an investment from his own personal funds."" And now Valkyrie has ""decided for now to pursue alternative funding sources, including additional investors.""  Valkyrie had hoped to use venture capital money to fund its staking and mining operations and ultimately court more institutional investors in the digital assets space. The firm currently runs several operations, including a decentralized finance (DeFi) hedge fund, three ETFs listed on Nasdaq, several protocol trusts and a protocol treasury management business. In the second quarter, the firm reported $1.2 billion in assets under management.  ""It pains me to have to write this letter,"" Wald wrote. ""Thankfully, we are already talking to a handful of prominent investors who may be willing to step in and fill this gap, and are eager to move past this challenge.""

However, the coin showed signs of recovery on its one-day chart. Over the last 24 hours, the coin hasn&apos;t made much progress. In the past week, Dogecoin price just moved up by 0.4%, which indicates that the coin is still in a consolidated price range. The technical outlook for Dogecoin indicated that buyers were not in control of the market at press time. This meant that Dogecoin price was still experiencing bearish pressure. For Dogecoin to be able to regain the bulls back, it is important that the meme-coin breaks past its immediate price ceiling. Demand for Dogecoin continued to remain low, which is why the bears could at any point invalidate the brief recovery that the coin made. If DOGE continues to consolidate over the next trading sessions, the coin could fall to its local support level. For a rally to happen, the coin has to topple over the $0.07 price ceiling. Only then can the coin attempt to touch the $0.09 price mark. Dogecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOGE was trading for $0.05 at the time of writing. The coin is still trading laterally. Although it tried to climb on its chart, the buyers did not cooperate. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $0.06. A break above that can help Dogecoin touch the $0.07 price mark.

The show is selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) dubbed “krap chickens,” which offer gated access to real-world events, a virtual viewing room for behind-the-scenes content and voting rights on the elements inside the show. In the first episode sneak peek, which premiered at Comic Con, krap chicken holders voted on which sailor in the show gets slapped by a Kraken.  NFT holders at Comic Con also received front-row seats to Harmon’s panel, as well as the ability to cut the line for his autograph.  So far, 3,000 of the 10,420 krap chickens have already been sold. Matt Bilfield, Krapopolis project lead at Blockchain Creative Labs, said the number was set at “10,420 chickens because that’s how long it could roughly take a chicken to run the marathon.”  A forgotten superhero, revived through NFTs  At the eBay booth, a forgotten superhero was brought back to life and turned into an NFT collection.  Slam-Girl was created in 2001 by comic legend Stan Lee and art director Will Neugniot as a reimagination of the Peter Parker-styled Spiderman series. The franchise was considered a ""lost treasure"" when then Stan Lee Media, an internet-based production and marketing company founded by Lee, fell victim to the bursting of the dot-com bubble and became defunct.  “When I discovered Slam Girl, I felt like Indiana Jones finding the Lost Ark,” said Shirrel Rhoades, curator of Slam-Girl and former executive vice president of Marvel Publishing. “Who would have thought that there were still Stan Lee superheroes that nobody had seen?”  Rhoades, now the director of Stan Lee Holdings, said that the company’s properties were dormant until his collector friend purchased all the assets and asked him to curate them. Rhoads then sought out Will Meugniot, the one-time Marvel animator who co-created the superhero character with Lee.  The genesis Slam-Girl collection, released at Comic Con, features a variety of scenes of her fighting her four nemeses. It is available on eBay, in collaboration with NFT platform OneOf.  “The fans that actually own the collection will be the community that gets to vote on future storylines,” said Lin Dai, CEO and founder of OneOf.  Both Dai and Meugniot revealed to CoinDesk that the future secret power of Slam Girl is “mind melding.” He teased that the second and third collections of Slam Girl NFTs will enable the holders to see their unique NFT as the Slam Girl character inside the show.  “This is based on my own experience as a fat kid who loves comic books,” said Neugniot. “I would die to have a fat kid who is a real superhero … and the new technology will enable you'd have an NFT just like you will enable you to have merchandise that just like you.”  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Comic books and augmented reality  One of the largest exhibitors at Comic Con was Veve, a marketplace for licensed digital collectibles and a partner of Marvel.  Veve’s communications manager, Rhys Skellern, showed CoinDesk Marvel’s first-ever comic book from 1939, which was sold for over $2.4 million dollars in March. Using VeVe, the rare comic collectible can now be viewed in augmented reality.  “It's one of the most expensive physical comics in the world. You can't even touch it, right, you can't take it out of its container … [we’re] giving you access to intellectual property (IP) that is out of reach for most people in the physical world,” he said.  Marvel has been licensing its intellectual property to Veve since June 2021 as a way to break into Web3.  Prior to the partnership, Veve announced its plans to be the first carbon-neutral NFT platform, operating on ImmutableX. Skellern said “sustainability” is one of the reasons behind Marvel and Disney’s step into digital collectibles.  “NFTs are much cleaner than manufacturing physical products,” he said.  Funko takes traditional collectibles into Web3  The night ended with a Halloween-themed party hosted by Funko, which recently released DC comics linked to NFTs.  Attendees purchased a special $200 ticket and were able to take home a goodie bag full of Halloween-themed Funko Pops, a poster and an NFT ready to be claimed.  The crowd ranged from Funko lovers to resellers who aimed to sell these items on the secondary market. One attendee said he immediately made $1,100 by posting his goods to a Facebook group.  According to Dai, this year's Comic Con continued to show similarities between traditional collectors and crypto natives.  “If I could have one wish … we no longer call these NFTs, just digital collectibles,” he said. “I think that message could resonate really well with comic fans who are already rabid community forming groups.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | IMX,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/19/marvel-funko-debuted-new-web3-integrations-at-comic-con-ny-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/496a9be3ba710fd017d4685acd1ed361a106a6cf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413811,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCKYI,1666216102,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hovers at $19K to Remain Within Current Range,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether were flat, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens were up amid moderate trading volume as investors continued their fretful watch of wider economic indicators.  The DeFi token rally was a rare exception in a market that has been moving sideways for weeks, said Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was relatively flat, falling 0.80%.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at about $19,200, roughly where it stood 24 hours ago and toward the bottom of the $19,000 to $21,000 range the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has occupied for more than a month. Bitcoin continued to trail its 20-day moving average, clear evidence of the bear market’s resiliency.  Ether’s (ETH) was recently changing hands just below $1,300, also about the same from Tuesday, and near its bottom support for much of the past month. Ether has also continued its recent trend of trading below its 20-day average.  The top altcoin gainers recently were AAVE and MATIC, which both climbed more than 3%. Uniswap’s UNI token rose 3.5% at one point and was up 9.5% over the past seven days. On Oct. 13, Uniswap, the decentralized exchange behind the token, announced that it had raised $165 million in a Series B funding round led by Polychain Capital.  Macro View  Traditional financial markets declined on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 each falling by a few fractions of a percentage point.  In major macroeconomic data, U.S. housing starts plunged 8.1% to 1.439 million in September, falling slightly short of the consensus estimate but reflecting a sagging of the once-torrid housing market. However, September housing permits, an indicator of future construction, rose by 1.4% over August.  Global inflation continued to tick higher, with Great Britain (10.1%) and Canada (6.9%) each reporting higher increases in prices than expected. Both countries recently increased their key interest rates by 0.50% and 0.75%, respectively. Hotter-than-expected inflation increased the likelihood that both countries would raise interest rates aggressively, similar to the U.S., where the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Markets Committee is expected to approve a fourth consecutive 75 basis point rate hike in November.  In commodities, Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, was recently trading slightly down but still hovering well over $90 per barrel, up more than 15% from the start of the year. Safe-haven gold declined 1.4%.  Latest Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 938.16 −0.9%        ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,191 −0.7%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,294 −1.4%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,695.16 −0.7%        ● Gold: $1,634 per troy ounce −0.9%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 4.13% +0.1        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Technical Take  Investors’ Time Horizons Will Determine Their Bitcoin Positions  On a technical basis, the decision whether to go long bitcoin at current levels will depend on the investor’s time horizon.  For investors with short-term trading horizons, BTC appears to be offering few opportunities. The average true range (ATR) for BTC has declined by close to 74% year to date, taking with it the volatility needed for short-term traders to generate additional alpha.  The opportunity set for long-term holders appears stronger as support for BTC’s price is establishing itself near current levels. The lack of volatility should prove beneficial in this regard because investors with the luxury of waiting can accumulate BTC at a more favorable price.  The most recent Commitment of Traders report, released each Tuesday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, shows that reportable positions for asset managers are now 80% long and 20% short bitcoin futures.  BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a metric commonly used as a proxy for momentum, is in neutral territory with a reading of 45.7. Traditionally, RSI readings below 30 imply that an asset is “oversold,” and readings over 70 imply that an asset is “overbought.”  Altcoin Roundup  Hotly Anticipated Layer 1 Blockchain Aptos Token Plunges in Trading Debut: FTX, Coinbase and Binance were among the first exchanges to list the buzzy new layer 1 token.

Polymarket is not available to U.S.-based traders. Earlier this year, the site was fined $1.4 million and ordered to cease offering noncompliant markets by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for not registering with it. Polymarket then limited access to only non-U.S. users.  The current odds being offered on ""Yes"" on the nuclear weapon question are about 17 to 1, meaning you'd win $17 for every $1 you bet. On the other hand, betting correctly on ""No"" would win you $1.06 for every $1 you bet.  More simply put, the market is putting a 6% probability on Russia using a nuke this year.  According to the bet's page, a prediction market on Russia's use of nuclear weapons “has been requested many times recently by esteemed academics and thought leaders from across the world, and it is strongly within the public's interest to have accurate price discovery and realtime forecasts on such a topic.”  Polymarket wrote that it considered the prediction market on this topic “a public good, in order to provide clarity to society on one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century.”  Polymarket detailed that “this market will resolve to ‘Yes’ if the Russian Federation detonates a nuclear device in an offensive capacity by Dec. 31, 2022, 11:59:59 p.m. ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to ‘No.’” It added that to meet the “Yes” criteria, the detonation of a nuclear device must be in an offensive capacity, must not be a test and must either be claimed by the Russian Federation or widely accepted to be from the Russian Federation.

The partnership comes as liquid staking has become more popular, especially after Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism last month.  Liquid staking occurs when users who have staked their tokens are issued new tokens with the same value. The new tokens represent ownership of the staked ones, are fully transferable and can generate yield.

In August, pSTAKE went live with its liquid staking system for BNB Chain (BNB). The company also offers liquid staking products for Ethereum and Cosmos, and plans to unveil others soon for Solana and Avalanche.  “If anyone is a holder of PoS assets, on a long enough time horizon, they will want to hold the liquid state version so that they can do interesting other things with it and have the liquidity while keeping the asset state and keep owning yields” said Aggarwal.

42393776,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAnoF,1666211587,Investors’ Time Horizons Will Determine Their Bitcoin Positions,"(The material following is provided for informational purposes only, and should not be construed as investment advice. The author, Glenn Williams, CMT, is an analyst for CoinDesk Markets.)  Bitcoin declined 0.74% on moderate volume, as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded down for the second consecutive day.  Ether followed suit, falling 1% on slightly lower volume when compared with its 20-day moving average.  Macroeconomics  Macroeconomic factors continue to drive both digital and traditional markets. U.S housing starts declined 8.1% to 1.439 million for September, falling short of the consensus estimate of 1.465 million. Housing starts for August were revised downward to 1.57 million, from 1.58 million.  The decrease in housing starts appear to signal a slowing economy, although September housing permits, an indicator of future construction, increased 1.4% over August.  Global inflation continues to tick higher, with the U.K. (10.1%) and Canada (6.9%) each seeing higher increases in prices than expected. Both countries recently increased their key interest rates by 0.50% and 0.75%, respectively.  Hotter-than-expected inflation increases the likelihood that both countries will raise interest rates aggressively, similar to the U.S., which has also suffered from soaring prices.  Odds that the Federal Reserve will raise rates by another 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank Federal Open Market Committee's Nov. 2 meeting remain elevated at close to 96%.     The significance of these factors specific to bitcoin, ether and all digital assets is relatively straightforward. As central banks worldwide continue to raise interest rates, expectations are that economic growth will slow, ultimately putting downward pressure on risk assets.  Technical Look  On a technical basis, the decision whether to go long bitcoin at current levels will depend on the investor’s time horizon.  For investors with short-term trading horizons, BTC appears to be offering few opportunities. The average true range (ATR) for BTC has declined by close to 74% year to date, taking with it the volatility needed for short-term traders to generate additional alpha.  The opportunity set for long-term holders appears stronger as support for BTC prices is establishing itself near current prices. The lack of volatility should prove beneficial in this regard, as investors with the luxury of waiting can accumulate BTC at a more favorable price.  The most recent Commitment of Traders report, released each Tuesday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, shows that reportable positions for asset managers are now 80% long and 20% short bitcoin futures.  Asset manager long positions currently make up 37.5% of total open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a metric commonly used as a proxy for momentum, is in neutral territory with a reading of 45.7. Traditionally, RSI readings below 30 imply that an asset is “oversold,” and readings over 70 imply that an asset is “overbought.”  Since hitting a recent bottom of 29 on Sept. 6, RSI has increased 53% versus BTC’s price increasing by just 2%. The difference in rate of change between the price and RSI provides early signals of a bullish divergence, though a stronger case would exist if accompanied by increased volume.  Ether’s RSI movement paints a similar picture to that of BTC, as RSI has risen 33% from a recent low, while prices increased by 4%.  A challenge for BTC holders at the moment is the proximity of its current price to support, in conjunction with a lack of active catalysts.  Prices dipping below the 10-day moving average once again signal a lack of enthusiasm in the market. Investors looking to add to long positions could be waiting to see BTC’s 10 period moving average cross above its 50-day moving average, which sits 4% away.  Given the lack of price movement for BTC, that seems unlikely in the short term. A look at the frequency of distribution for bitcoin in 2022 illustrates the mean return of -0.25% along with the low probability of a 4% return.  On-chain data bears watching as well as unique entities holding more than 1,000 BTC have been progressively moving more BTC on to exchanges. Following 30 days of moving BTC off of exchanges, “whale,” or large, investors have added bitcoin to exchanges for the fourth consecutive day.

The social network’s users have opened over 2.5 million crypto wallets on the platform since Reddit released its NFT marketplace in July.

The social network’s NFT marketplace requires users to set up a Reddit Vault Wallet to purchase and store tokens.

The value of its digital assets remained at $218 million, the same as they were at the end of the second quarter, whenTesla surprised some investors by selling $936 million worth of bitcoin, or approximately 75% of its total holdings, in order to raise cash.  Tesla reported no impairment charges to the value of its bitcoin holdings, as the price of the cryptocurrency remained almost the same at the end of both the second and third quarters at slightly under $20,000.  CEO Elon Musk said on the company's second-quarter earnings call that the sale was made because of “the uncertainty of the COVID lockdowns in China,” but noted that Tesla is open to boosting its bitcoin exposure in the future and that the sale “should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin."" The price of bitcoin fell about 1.7% on the initial news at the time, but soon regained its losses after Musk’s remarks on the call.

In February 2021, Tesla announced it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, a move that caused the price of bitcoin to surge.

It had not bought or sold any more bitcoin until this year’s second quarter.

Johnson told CoinDesk TV the firm has survived for 75 years because it has been open to adapting its business to new technologies.  “We have to be in the space,” Johnson said of the crypto sector during a special guest appearance at CoinDesk’s I.D.E.A.S. 2022 Conference in New York City. “It's a complicated space, and we probably won't see the payouts in the space for five-plus years, but you have to understand it to ensure that you're developing products that make sense.”  Franklin Templeton, which holds upwards of $1.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM) for its investors, will begin offering two crypto-focused separately managed accounts (SMA) this quarter via a partnership with Eaglebrook Advisors, a crypto-centric investment management firm.  Read more: Investment Management Giant Franklin Templeton to Offer Digital Asset Strategies to Wealth Managers  Johnson said there is a “tremendous amount of interest” in crypto from financial advisers but also a bit of hesitation, which she says is partly due to questions about how their clients can enter the space responsibly.  “It's really difficult for a person who sits outside of the ecosystem to understand how to enter it,” Johnson said, referring to her firm’s crypto investment system. That system looks to give investors the ability to be exposed to separately managed accounts with multiple coins, such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  Of the conversations Johnson has had with advisers, she said they are most concerned about data as it relates to ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) issues, sustainability and understanding what opportunities exist within the space and how they can responsibly approach them.  “One of the most difficult things for an investor who's trying to have a portfolio that takes into consideration those environmental, social and governance factors is that they don't have great data,” Johnson said. And if an adviser can’t provide the data, clients are likely to open an account elsewhere, she said later.  Read more: Mutual Fund Giant Franklin Templeton Eyes Bitcoin, Ether Trades With Planned Hires  “ESGs could benefit from blockchain technology,” she added.  Johnson is bullish on the opportunities and the efficiency that can come from blockchain technology and the platforms behind them, referring to blockchains such as Solana and Ethereum. Her firm, she says, is looking to combine its 75 years of active investment experience with that of the digital asset ecosystem.  Despite the ongoing crypto winter, which could be making some traditional finance firms cautious, Johnson said it’s a “great time to get in,” and may give her company “more runway” than competitors who are hesitant to come in.  “We think that blockchain will be a part of the infrastructure to provide the solution around getting better and better data,” Johnson said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/19/blockchain-technology-could-be-massive-disruptor-for-tradfi-says-franklin-templeton-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac92dc8920346abdf393a69e801dd5f655785466-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Yury Orekhov, Artem Uss, Svetlana Kuzurgasheva (also known as “Lana Neumann”), Timofey Telegin and Sergey Tulyakov are being charged with attempting to evade sanctions against Venezuelan oil producers and obtaining technology used in the U.S. F-22, an air superiority fighter. The defendants allegedly used shell companies and cryptocurrencies to launder the funds involved in this scheme, though a Department of Justice press release did not specify the amounts or types of cryptocurrency used.  An indictment published later in the day suggested the defendants looked to the tether stablecoin for a transaction.  Defendants Orekhov and Uss were arrested on Monday, according to the press release. The charges were brought by Task Force KleptoCapture, a DOJ initiative focused on sanctions and economic countermeasures focused on Russia after the nation invaded Ukraine.  U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said the defendants ""were criminal enablers for oligarchs, orchestrating a complex scheme to unlawfully obtain U.S. military technology and Venezuelan sanctioned oil through a myriad of transactions involving shell companies and cryptocurrency"" in a statement.  Andrew Adams, the director of Task Force KleptoCapture, echoed the sentiment in his own statement.  “Stamping out evasion of export controls on military technology is among the Task Force’s highest priorities, and today’s arrests reflects the power of those controls when enforced by a dedicated team of expert agents and devoted foreign partners,"" he said.  The DOJ announced KleptoCapture in March, saying the team would focus on economic sanctions against oligarchs in response to Russia's invasion.

42373650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUIFT,1666203162,"With Bitcoin and Stocks Flat, Rally in DeFi Tokens Gets Notice","The cryptocurrency market was mixed on Wednesday: While prices for top assets bitcoin and ether were unusually stable given their volatile history, tokens from decentralized finance (DeFi) took the spotlight.  The CoinDesk Market Index fell by 0.8% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down 0.8%, changing hands in a range between $19,000 and $19,500. Ether (ETH), the second-largest, followed a similar trajectory, down 0.4% to $1,300 as of press time.  The trajectory was consistent with traditional markets on Wednesday, where the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.5% as investors processed a flurry of third-quarter earnings reports.  “Even now there are plenty of bitcoin investors that look to overall market sentiment to guide them, so some of that negativity does end up getting mirrored,” said Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at StormPartners.  The crypto trading firm QCP Capital noted Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the options market “continues to unwind” trades that had been put on to protect against any swift price decline following last week’s U.S. Consumer Price Index release. The Labor Department’s report, published on Thursday, showed inflation running at a hotter-than-expected pace.  Crypto and traditional markets, rather than taking a deep dive, as many analysts had expected, swerved higher.  According to QCP, there aren’t many crucial economic data points to trade on until the Federal Reserve’s next meeting of its monetary-policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.  “With [few] calendar events till the next FOMC in early November, crypto continuing to lag behind equities and skews near flat, protective downside structures are the cheapest levels they have been since June,” QCP wrote. “Skew” refers to the relative balance in the options market between bearish and bullish trades.  The outperformance of DeFi tokens on Wednesday was punctuated by gains from those associated with the Uniswap, Aave and Maker protocols.  The rally in the tokens stands out in crypto markets that otherwise have been moving sideways, said Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  Uniswap’s UNI token rose 3.5% in the past 24 hours and 9.5% in the past seven days as it recently made headlines by raising $165 million in a Polychain Capital-led round.  Aave’s AAVE rose 5.6% and Maker’s MKR was up 1.4% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  “These can generally be thought of as the gold standards in their respective DeFi categories: decentralized exchange (DEX), lending/borrowing, and decentralized stablecoins,” Carey said in a Twitter DM to CoinDesk.  Looking ahead, investors across the board are eyeing a few lesser economic reports scheduled for release later this week, including jobless claims and existing home sales.  “Any big surprises on these could cause some volatility,” Carey added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/19/with-bitcoin-and-stocks-flat-rally-in-defi-tokens-gets-notice,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b48bf804af4535961e22fb48714cc369b3ed2c83-1120x580.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394189,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY3zj,1666200600,How Crypto Advocates Are Defending Ooki DAO,"A person by any other name  The narrative  District Judge William Orrick, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, ruled last week that LeXpunK Army and the DeFi Education Fund could file amicus (friend of the court) briefs in the CFTC v. Ooki DAO case.  Why it matters  The allowance of these amicus briefs throws what looked like an inexorable case into a puzzle. We now no longer know just how this might resolve, and there's a chance the CFTC’s effort to define a DAO as an unincorporated association might fail.  Breaking it down  Something a little strange happened last week. I got back to my hotel room, checked the federal court Pacer database and discovered that a federal judge had, surprisingly, approved a longshot motion by two crypto groups – LeXpunK Army and DeFi Education Fund – to weigh in on the CFTC’s case against Ooki DAO.  The briefs were in by Monday (alongside another motion by Paradigm), and the CFTC has until Nov. 7 (three weeks) to respond. We’ll have a hearing on Nov. 30, where the parties can argue their motions before the court.  There are a few things going on here.  First off, it was surprising when the judge ruled in favor of the CFTC’s motion for alternative service, which allowed the agency to say it had served the Ooki DAO members by posting in a forum and a help bot.  It was also surprising when the judge then allowed the friend of the court briefs, and said, “I interpret these requests as Motions for Reconsideration regarding my decision to permit alternative service in this case,” meaning he essentially paused that previous order.  It seemed a much-needed chance for the Ooki DAO members to continue to figure out whether and how they'll defend themselves in court.  Thus far, the group has not formally responded to the CFTC’s suit, though its website became inaccessible to people with U.S. IP addresses last week.  On the legal front, there's now at least three teams of lawyers arguing that the CFTC should not be able to just serve the entire DAO at once through a chat bot, nor hold the entire DAO accountable as an entity (as opposed to the individual members responsible for any illicit conduct).  The question is how the CFTC should have served Ooki DAO. The regulator is making the case that Ooki DAO is an unincorporated association and so serving the entire entity at once is fair game. What’s more, the CFTC says that because it couldn’t identify any Ooki DAO participants and because it is treating the entire collective as one entity, posting the suit on a forum and a help bot should be deemed adequate service.  The amicus briefs take aim at these assertions in a variety of ways. The LeXpunK brief spells this out explicitly, saying DAOs are not people and arguing the CFTC’s interpretation of a DAO as an unincorporated association does not hold up under federal statute.  We’ll have to wait until Nov. 7 to see what the CFTC has to say about this.  The timeline, in a screen-capable form:  Wed, Oct. 12: Judge William Orrick grants LeXpunK and DeFi Education Fund friend of the court motions to join the case. DeFi Fund already attached its brief with its motion.  Mon, Oct. 17: The deadline for LeXpunK to file its brief (this has happened).  Mon, Nov. 7: The deadline for the CFTC to file any opposition.  Mon, Nov. 14: The deadline for LeXpunK and DeFi Fund to file any responses.  Wed, Nov. 30: Hearing on CFTC’s push to serve Ooki DAO through its website.  Crypto legislation  The end of 2022 is fast approaching. The midterm elections are in less than three weeks, so we won’t see much legislative action for a little bit. Here’s where current legislative efforts stand.  The House Financial Services stablecoin bill:  We’ve been hearing a lot about this bill’s development, but at this point it sure seems like it’ll be a 2023 effort. We might still see some kind of draft legislative language introduced this year, but that’s about it.  At DC Fintech Week last week, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the ranking member of the committee, said he and Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) agreed on how they defined the term “stablecoin” and what the components of the asset include, but suggested that there's still work to be done on other issues like how to assign a federal regulator.  Moreover, at CoinDesk’s IDEAS conference in New York, Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) explicitly said the bill is not happening this year, and is not likely to happen in the early part of 2023.  The Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act:  The DCCPA is the Stabenow-Boozman bill introduced to the Senate Agriculture Committee by senators Deborah Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.) that, if passed, would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission some more regulatory oversight jurisdiction of crypto spot markets.  Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who is a cosponsor on the bill, said she expects a markup to occur before the end of the year. In speaking to others, this does seem like it may actually happen, though passage is still a question mark.  If you’ll indulge in some rumor proliferation, the big one right now is that this bill may get attached to the National Defense Authorization Act or another broad bill before the end of the year. I haven’t heard any concrete confirmation of this one way or another, but at the least it does seem like we’ll hear more from this bill before the year’s up.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  N/A  Outside CoinDesk:  (Platformer) This was a pretty weird one. So the background here is The Wire, a reputable news organization, reported last week that Meta (formerly Facebook) had allowed a senior BJP official (India’s ruling party) the ability to order Instagram posts taken down at will for any reason. It seemed reasonable because, as Casey Newton and Zoë Schiffer point out, the BJP has in the past actually tried doing just this. However, Meta denied the claim, leading to The Wire publishing what looks very much like a faked email, which was then supposedly verified by people, at least one of whom found out after the fact and denied helping verify its authenticity. Newton and Schiffer have more. The Wire announced it would review the story and its reporting on Tuesday.  (The Washington Post) The Bering Strait snow crab population declined by about 7 billion over three years, leading Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game to cancel this year’s snow crab fishing season. There seems to be a reasonable argument to be made that overfishing of the waters where snow crabs used to grow up has led to their mysterious disappearance, but this is basically part of the broader ecological collapse we’re starting to see from climate change.  (The New York Times) Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig’s term expires next month, and U.S. President Joe Biden has yet to nominate a successor.  (Felix Krause) Security researcher Felix Krause reports that Facebook and Instagram’s in-app browsers track all user behavior if they click on third-party links within the app. In other words, if you’re, for example, clicking on the link in the biography of an Instagram user and it opens in the Instagram browser, the app will track your activity, and could allow the company to log and track every input you make on that site. Krause pointed to potentially buying goods on Instagram as an example. Users can open links in another browser – or use the browser versions of these apps – as a way to bypass this.

42394190,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY44r,1666199492,The Ethereum Killers Are All Zombies Now,"One of the recurring challenges of building in the blockchain space is figuring out which blockchain is worth your time and effort. Bitcoin is the “grandfather” but doesn’t support complex smart contracts and programmable ecosystems. For most developers, that means looking elsewhere, and there is a lot from which to choose.  There are many outstanding blockchains out there and, trust me on this, I’ve heard the pitch from just about all of them over the years. It’s easy to discard the pitches from private blockchains because I can’t get over the impossible contradiction in the idea of having a centrally managed, decentralized ledger. That still leaves an astonishing array of choices.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  For myself, and for EY, the question then becomes which of the many public, smart contract programmable blockchains out there offer us the best return on our investment of time and energy. We’ve long made our choice around Ethereum, and it’s worth taking a moment to talk about why we made that choice and why we have been so disciplined about it even as many outstanding new blockchains have emerged.  First and foremost is the question of market size. Ethereum has long been the most dominant blockchain out there for business applications, with more than 60% of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market and 95% of all non-fungible tokens (NFT) and more developers than any other ecosystem. It is likely that being the best in the largest ecosystem is worth more than being second or third place across many different ecosystems. While you can imagine scenarios in which this isn’t true, the lesson from many different digital ecosystems suggests that we live in a winner-take-all environment.  There is a lot of academic research to back up this idea, starting as far back as the 1970s but the practical experience is also compelling. Very simply, the more you do something the better you get at it. The better you are at something the more likely you are to win in a competitive battle. In technology, there are especially large payoffs because implementing strategy is not a simple matter. Given what a large percentage of IT implementations go wrong, the risk associated with lower skill levels is very high.  See also: Choosing Who We Trust | Opinion  There are two scenarios in which focusing on Ethereum ceases to be a good choice. The first is the multichain future in which market share becomes fragmented across many chains, and so being #1 on Ethereum is no longer such a compelling choice. The second is the possibility in which Ethereum is replaced as the market leader by a new and better chain. Both of these scenarios are, I think, unlikely.  A multichain future is the easiest one to dismiss. Thanks to Metcalf’s law, technology ecosystems love standards. We don’t live in a multinetwork world, we live on Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). From email to web pages to auction sites to social networks, the digital economy is a winner-take-all (or nearly all) business. Blockchains in particular are candidates for this because the whole point is interoperability. It’s easiest to plug my stablecoin into a deposit contract or finance my inventory or sell my NFTs if all the parties are on the same chain. It’s also by far the lowest-risk approach.  History is littered with networks, products and services that tried to enable interoperability and achieved the technical goal without changing the market share model. We’re seeing a similar pattern in the world of blockchain. Bridges and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility make it possible to port both assets and applications out of the Ethereum ecosystem, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that users will follow. Well-funded attackers can buy projects and press releases, but that doesn’t necessarily result in sustainable volume. In enterprise sales, we often see challenger layer 1 blockchains come in an offer to cover the full cost of development if our client deploys on their solution first, but a fully paid deployment cost is not helpful if you launch on a chain with no clients.  Another argument for a multichain future is that different applications need different types of solutions and optimizations. This is, in many ways, a powerful and rational sounding argument. It also doesn’t work very well. I can say the same for network technology or operating systems.  The internet is a wonderful example. We spend our days streaming live video and audio to each other over a network that still doesn’t have any mechanism for managing quality of service. There were absolutely better choices available, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), a network technology that offered the benefits of internet packet data with excellent tools for prioritizing and managing traffic.  ATM did not die for lack of support from the legacy Regional Bell Operating Companies that, in the early 1990s, controlled nearly all internet traffic. The definition of “good idea” to incumbents often looks like “solution that preserves our market dominance.” Enthusiasm for private blockchains by big banks feels very reminiscent of the technology standards battles from the early days of the internet. Spoiler alert: It doesn’t end well for the incumbents. (There is a truly epic account of the whole battle from Wired magazine you can read here.)  My expectation is that the future of blockchain will look a lot like other operating systems and platform ecosystems. There will be one dominant ecosystem and, most likely, one secondary one, not a fragmented market of many different chains.  So, the preference for common technology over the value of optimized individual networks suggests that we’re not headed for a multichain future, but why do I think Ethereum will endure? The answer is that the older technology incumbents become, the harder they are to dislodge. We’ve had one leading PC operating system since the 1980s and one dominant mobile operating system since 2012. There are also secondary players in those markets, and even those have been the same for a long time as well.  See also: Paul Brody on Enterprise Interest in Crypto, Blockchain Use  Every day that Ethereum remains the market leader it becomes more likely to stay that way for a very long time. If the blockchain market ends up looking anything like the PC or mobile operating system market, it seems like there is about a decade-long window for successful platform innovation during which time the role of market share leader can move around quite significantly. It’s entirely plausible that today I could be writing this on some successor of the Commodore 64. My first computer was a Commodore Amiga, an amazing piece of technology that ran circles around the Mac at the time. But being better just wasn’t enough. (This market share chart from Asymco.com illustrates the explosion of innovation and then the triumph of a market leader.)  If the best technology doesn’t seem to win, what separates long-term winners out in these standards battles? I hypothesize that there are two answers. First, developer ecosystem maturity and, second, management team. On the developer side, Ethereum has a dominant share and one that continues to grow. On the management team side, the Ethereum Foundation has long demonstrated the maturity of the ecosystem and its ability to herd all of us cats. The Merge, executed slowly but flawlessly, made this strength visible to the world.  What does this mean for Ethereum’s well-funded would-be assassins such as Solana, Terra, Avalanche and others? I think it means they are zombies, technically still alive but running on borrowed time. How much time? It could be quite a few years. Competitors to the PC kept on going for more than a decade after Windows became the dominant platform.

42373653,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUILl,1666198661,Where Are Web3 Users Coming From? Startup Spindl Aims to Help Companies Find Out,"When web surfers cross between the mainstream internet’s centralized giants such as Google and Facebook and crypto’s wild world of decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, a new startup called Spindl wants to know.  The Miami-based company is trying to rebuild for Web3 a fundamental piece of Web2’s e-commerce back end. That piece is called “web attribution,” and it’s how internet businesses track where their customers came from – and create user acquisition strategies to get more.  Antonio García Martínez, the CEO of Spindl and a veteran of Silicon Valley advertising technology (AdTech), said attribution is integral to internet commerce. “If attribution fails – imagine if running water failed in New York City. It goes to chaos.”  Knowing this trail to sale is crucial to companies ginning up successful ad campaigns; the software industry supporting them – led by big names like Adjust – is worth $1 billion annually, according to Future Markets Insights. But the mainstream attribution platforms aren’t “chain-aware,” said García Martínez: “There's a wall between Web2 and Web3.”  Although the crypto industry already has a healthy sub-sector of on-chain sleuths labeling wallets and following assets, it has yet to develop much in the way of attribution in the Web2 sense, García Martínez said. The result: OpenSea knows who bought this or that CryptoPunk, but not how this buyer landed at OpenSea.  Spindl “measures the funnel” of Discord posts, Reddit forums, ad impressions and other blue links that help people navigate the internet; it then pairs this data with on-chain behaviors such as buying, selling and trading to create profiles that help protocols understand where the traffic comes from.  If companies want users to engage in their platforms, then they’ll need attribution software, crypto-native or not, García Martínez said.  García Martínez said he has raised $7 million from crypto venture capitalist firms including co-leads Dragonfly and Chapter 1, plus Polygon Ventures, Tribe Capital, Multicoin and a smattering of angel investors. He said the money will go toward hiring.  Decentralized debate  “Whether it's Spindl or not, I think there has to be a decentralized protocol for attribution in Web3,” García Martínez said.  The reason: Centralized incumbents such as Google and Facebook have too many conflicts of interest to also serve as the arbiters of attribution truth, he said. Crypto’s focus on creating trustless systems is in his telling the perfect use case for attribution.  If a fully decentralized, completely on-chain, crypto-native entity governed by a decentralize autonomous organization is the solution, then Spindl ain’t it – at least not yet. While García Martínez said he’s “absolutely for decentralization and composability and trustlessness,” convincing crypto companies that Spindl’s data is worth it comes first.  “We’re starting centralized just to solve the near-term pain points,” he said.  García Martínez wants Spindl to take baby steps toward decentralization, distributing power where it makes sense to do so without losing the business down a philosophical trap. The data could be hosted on-chain and in smart contracts, for example. Down the road he thinks a decentralized protocol should form Spindl’s base.  If online ads are to be rewarded for their conversions, though, someone has to fill that role of arbiter: “Everyone has to agree at the end of the day that x caused y to happen.”  Spindl is grappling with this question of causality, García Martínez said. Any number of things could have led to a user’s continued engagement on a crypto platform: the Discord server, the social media posts, the NFTs.  “We kind of have to figure out how reality works in Web3 before we can start wrapping product around it,” García Martínez said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/19/where-are-web3-users-coming-from-startup-spindl-aims-to-help-companies-find-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2370f10f6ad5ea036ba1e0e73310dbc8df0a6fd5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The measures could take effect as early as December, and would only make it easier for exchanges to list crypto assets that are already known to the Japanese market. By March 2024, the JVCEA could also ""scrap pre-screenings"" for tokens that are new to the market, according to the report.  Although Japan's financial watchdogs might sometimes be at odds with the JVCEA, a source familiar with the proceedings confirmed to CoinDesk that regulators could delegate matters like these to the industry association. The JVCEA has already alerted its members to the upcoming changes, the report said.  The measure also aligns with Japan's recent efforts to encourage crypto startups to stay in the country after high taxes prompted some startups to exit the market. The Japanese government is currently considering corporate tax breaks to ease the burden on crypto companies operating in the country.  The initiative to simplify token screening has been in the works since at least June, according to a previous report by Bloomberg Japan.

42373663,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUITJ,1666198212,"Bank of England Must Consider Private Stablecoins in Developing Digital Pound, Lobbyist Says","The Bank of England must take account of the crypto industry’s competitiveness when it decides how to issue a central bank digital currency, fintech lobbyist Adam Jackson said Wednesday at a meeting of a committee of U.K. lawmakers that is considering a measure to regulate stablecoins.  Lawmakers were also warned of risks of fraud from coin swaps and blockchain bridges as they deliberate on the U.K.'s Financial Services and Markets Bill.  There’s a “question whether we could apply a competition objective to the Bank of England, when we think about things like central bank digital currency and how that's implemented,” Jackson, who is the director of policy at Innovate Finance, told lawmakers on the committee. He added that the CBDC “could crowd out innovation and stablecoins unless it's designed in a way that promotes competition.”  The bill, which was introduced by the government in July, would ensure that the Financial Conduct Authority considers the country’s economic growth and international competitiveness when creating rules for the crypto sector. That provision would also apply to the Prudential Regulation Authority, a division of the Bank of England that ensures commercial banks remain stable.  The bill also sets eagerly awaited rules to ensure stablecoins – crypto assets whose value is tied to existing fiat currencies – can be used as payment and is being scrutinized by lawmakers in the House of Commons.  Jackson worries that the U.K. isn't going as far as rival jurisdictions, such as the European Union, which is regulating a much broader set of private digital-asset providers under its recently enacted Markets in Crypto Assets law, and that the U.K. bill as drafted isn’t even clear about its own scope.  “The government has said before that they will be bringing forward proposals for wider regulation of other crypto assets,” Jackson said, but said further legal advice is needed on whether the bill as it stands gives the government the authority to do so.  “If that isn't the case, are we going to have to wait another 20 years before the regulators are given the powers to regulate crypto assets?” he said, highlighting the need for rules for other areas of the crypto industry such as custody and new coin offerings.  Another witness, Mike Haley of Cifas – a nonprofit dedicated to fighting financial crime – told the committee that anti-fraud measures included in the bill haven't kept pace with the fast-moving crypto industry.  Haley asked “whether the legislation is broad enough to be able to include to ensure that the regulator can act on some types of crypto services.  “Already, we're looking at money laundering through coin swap services, which don't need an account and may not be under this regulation,” said Haley, who also cited cross-chain bridges as a potentially unregulated area. The bridges are software that allow users to transfer assets between different blockchains.  Lawmakers on the committee will proceed to a clause-by-clause reading of the bill between now and Nov. 3.

The fundraise pushes Celestia into unicorn status with a $1 billion valuation and was four times oversubscribed, says a person familiar with the matter.  Other participants in the round included Coinbase Ventures, Jump Crypto, FTX Ventures, Placeholder, Galaxy, Delphi Digital and several other venture capital and angel investors. Celestia previously raised $1.5 million in a seed round last March at an undisclosed valuation.  Founded in 2019, Celestia Labs is remaking blockchain architecture by betting on “modular” blockchain networks, which Celestia says makes it easier to deploy and scale blockchains.  Celestia is a stripped-down layer 1 blockchain that focuses solely on ordering transactions and making the data for transactions available. The blockchain does not handle smart contracts or perform computations. Instead, these are functions Celestia’s model outsources to rollups or other blockchains, a core component of its flexible, modular design.  So far, the crypto landscape has been dominated by monolithic blockchains such as Ethereum or Solana, which have struggled with issues such as scalability and outages.  Read More: Blockchain Infrastructure Project Eclipse Raises $15m To Build ‘Universal Layer-2’  “For the past decade, crypto has been bottlenecked by an endless loop of new monolithic [layer 1] smart contract platforms, each racing to the bottom to sacrifice decentralization and security to provide cheaper transaction fees,” said Celestia Labs co-founder Mustafa Al-Bassam. “Web3 cannot scale within the constraints of a monolithic framework.”  A modular blockchain, according to Celestia, allows the core functions of blockchains – consensus, settlement, data availability, and execution – to be decoupled into separate layers, avoiding the trilemma that typically plagues monolithic blockchains.  Developers building Web3 applications in the Celestia network can also mix and match different kinds of infrastructure and still be interoperable.  “Modular designs are unlocking rapid experimentation across the decentralized application stack,” said Bain Capital Crypto partner Alex Evans in a statement. “By minimizing base-layer complexity, Celestia offers cleaner abstractions for developers and greater sovereignty for communities of users.”  Celestia launched its testnet in May 2022, but has yet to announce a token.

42373649,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUIED,1666195746,Binance Becomes Second-Largest Voting Entity on Uniswap DAO,"Binance, the world’s largest centralized crypto exchange by volume, recently became the second-most powerful voting member of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governing Uniswap, the world’s most prominent decentralized crypto exchange.  Uniswap founder Hayden Adams alleged on Twitter that Binance managed to wrangle so much control by amassing UNI tokens – governance votes, in other words – that “technically” belong to Binance users.  The move is also being viewed as the latest example of how centralized entities are vying for control over decentralized infrastructure.  Uniswap – which launched on Ethereum in 2019 but has since expanded to other ecosystems – is what’s known as a decentralized exchange in that it allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies without a middleman.  A group of core developers maintains the Uniswap codebase, but key protocol decisions are governed by the Uniswap DAO, which grants users voting rights according to how many UNI tokens they hold. Users may also “delegate” their tokens to other entities, thereby enabling those entities to vote on their behalf.  Binance currently retains 5.9% of the voting power on Uniswap, second only to venture capital giant a16z, which controls 6.7%.  As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance maintains vast liquidity reserves of the tokens it supports on its platform, including Uniswap’s UNI. The exchange also controls custody of the funds that clients store on its platform – a matter of convenience that can negate certain security advantages and governance rights that go to users that opt to hold tokens in their own crypto wallets.  Binance's elevation within the Uniswap DAO is a “very unique situation,” says Adams, ""as the UNI technically belongs to its users.”  The Ethereum address associated with Binance has not yet voted on any governance proposals, whereas a16z, by comparison, has voted 14 times.  Adams continued: “Normally more gov participation = good, however it’s unclear how Binance intends to engage.”  CoinDesk has reached out to Binance for comment.",NEUTRAL,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | UNI | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/19/binance-becomes-second-largest-voting-entity-on-uniswap-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db8e581310fc17e9699d787ec7de5dd8de943b2e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373644,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUIAR,1666194157,"Do Kwon's Beautiful, Dark, Twisted Fantasy World","Wednesday saw the release of a lengthy, rigorous interview with Do Kwon, international criminal fugitive and founder of the collapsed Terra/LUNA blockchain scheme. In the face of implacable, detailed questioning by A-list crypto journalist Laura Shin, Kwon put on a master class in slippery evasion, victim blaming and motivated reasoning, and a staggering commitment to simply denying the evidence against him.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Among the laughably absurd claims that Kwon advances with a straight face in the interview are:  That multiple rigorous on-chain analyses showing the illicit movement of funds out of LUNA-linked entities during and after the system collapse are simply false (without any contravening evidence)  That bad timing and “the cruelty of the markets” caused the downfall of the UST algorithmic stablecoin, which had no fundamental design flaws  That the use of the Magic Internet Money Degenbox to sell large amounts of UST was merely a response to immense demand, not a way to quietly dump on UST and LUNA holders  That Terraform Labs' carefully concealed pre-mine of $1.4 billion worth of unbacked SDT stablecoins (a token pegged to International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Rights) from thin air at launch was simply a necessity of scaling the system, and in no way a premeditated, self-enriching fraud  That he is not a criminal fugitive because he hasn’t looked at his South Korean arrest warrant and didn’t find the Interpol Red Notice seeking his apprehension when he searched for it on Google; and also because any sovereign nation can respond to an Interpol ""red notice"" at their discretion, and also because the charges against him in Korea are politically motivated, and also because he’s definitely cooperating with investigators even though he still won’t tell them where he is  That the culture of Crypto Twitter is to blame for his own uniquely vicious, condescending behavior both online and in the flesh  That “the hardest thing about the current situation” is the emotional burden that Do Kwon himself carries after destroying thousands of people’s lives  That’s barely the start – almost every sentence Kwon speaks during the interview contains some degree of deception, denial or evasion. His mouth is a black hole that crushes the truth into dust. As Radiant Commons founder Josh Cincinnati summed it up, the interview was “a window into the mind of an unapologetic sociopath.”  The interview is also a clinic in another common trait of sociopaths: They can be very convincing.  Kwon remains consistently calm throughout, despite Shin’s very specific, well-sourced and damning questions. His answers have the air of a patient teacher explaining something to a child – even when he’s entirely evading the question, offering a complex obfuscation or simply making a false statement with utter conviction. Kwon’s favorite phrase (now that it’s no longer “I don’t debate the poor”) seems to be “Just to clarify,” followed by a string of words that do not do that.  See also: 'Down Infinite': A Ham-Fisted Attempt to Rehabilitate Do Kwon's Image | Opinion  None of this diminishes Laura Shin’s incredible professionalism, precision and persistence. This is the first journalistic interview with Kwon since the collapse of his Terra ecosystem (one previous interview was conducted by a content outlet in which Kwon's Terraform Labs was an investor, making it more akin to advertising than reporting). And Shin is at her best here, calmly and valiantly trying again and again to get Kwon to acknowledge the contradictions and inconsistencies of his own statements.  But this is a man living in an alternate reality, whose genuinely impressive glibness allows him to easily produce answers that sound good, but mean less than nothing.  That highlights a crucial distinction on which Kwon’s entire arc may hang: that between a person who is clever and a person who is intelligent.  Do Kwon is clever enough to make superficially reasonable sounds with his mouth, words that are apparently convincing even to himself. What Kwon lacks to a staggering degree is intelligence, including the ability to think beyond his own immediate concerns, to see other people’s perspectives, to interrogate his own assumptions or to conceptualize larger stakes.  (I’m well qualified to question Kwon’s intelligence ­– I understood LUNA and UST better than Kwon himself seemed to, detailing the logistics of its collapse two weeks before it happened and accurately predicting it would go to effective zero as the depegging began on May 9. I'm hardly special – a good number of other people also understood these things better than Kwon, or the equally dimwitted ""professional"" investors who bought his shtick.)  The entire conversation really deserves a line-by-line breakdown, but at least for now I’ll limit myself to one particularly incredible moment. At about the 20 minute mark, Shin very generously gives Kwon a second opportunity to apologize for his failures after her first question to that effect generates a stream of evasive platitudes. Though Kwon does ultimately apologize, he also works in an incredible display of his disdain for his victims.  “I believed in the stability of UST. And I do understand that my statements about how stable and safe UST would be led a lot of traders and holders without the tools to understand the complex economic mechanisms underpinning UST to gain confidence in a system that ultimately failed.” (Emphasis mine).  See also: Do Kwon Is the Elizabeth Holmes of Crypto | Opinion  Gaze, if you dare, upon this Demosthenes of denial, this Balzac of blame shifting. He gets exactly halfway through a sentence about his own culpability before pivoting to insulting the people who made the mistake of believing him. Of course, this is a meaningless defense that only highlights the emptiness of one of Kwon’s favorite rhetorical tactics – protesting that those accusing him of wrongdoing simply don’t understand what he’s doing.  To this very day, Kwon, so clever yet so dumb, doesn’t grasp that there was nothing there to understand, that what he built was always doomed to failure – or, most of all, that there’s nobody to blame but himself.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET,David Z.

Backwardation is an unusual condition in futures markets when contracts for maturity or delivery many months in the future are trading at lower prices than the near-term, or ""front-month,"" contract. It sometimes can signal that traders see prices falling in the medium or long term.  This hasn't happened in the bitcoin futures market for a sustained stretch of time since May 2019, according to Luno. What is rare is the “prolonged” episode of backwardation, as described by Luno. The condition has appeared for short periods of time, including in May 2021 for a few days.  “A steeper futures curve (i.e., a high next-month premium over front-month expiry) indicates bullish sentiment,” the report stated. “A flat futures curve or a downward trending curve implies the opposite – longs require compensation for the risk of exposure in further dated and less liquid BTC contracts.” The report was produced for Luno by the Norwegian crypto-market analysis firm Arcane Research. (Luno is owned by Digital Currency Group, of which CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary.)  Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, said the constant selling isn’t helping change this pattern in the near future. “As impetus for a rally and any further good news in crypto unlikely before next year, the best strategy is calendar spreads i.e. selling puts and buying calls,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/19/bitcoin-futures-backwardation-could-signal-bearish-mood,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02d4df816b27e8458a2ca2a4bed09e88dead242b-1614x567.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373659,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUIPX,1666188054,EU Antitrust Officials Are Worried About Competition in the Metaverse,"Metaverse companies could limit users’ choice and raise prices if they grow to dominate their market, two officials from the European Union’s antitrust authority said in a blog published Monday.  The EU is preparing its own strategy for virtual online worlds in which people can interact, socialize or trade via avatars – and the metaverse could be the latest front in a long-running antitrust campaign against tech giants that threaten consumer welfare.  With Facebook renaming itself Meta Platforms (META) as it seeks to reorient itself around the technology, policymakers are worried the company may seek to create a “walled garden” that users can’t easily leave.  A big company that forms a closed ecosystem “may constrain its consumers, business partners and competitors in numerous ways,” forcing them to buy products from that company, charging exorbitant prices or misusing people’s personal information, said Friedrich Wenzel Bulst and Sophie De Vinck of the European Commission's antitrust unit. The European Commission is the EU's governing body.  The EU has long complained about anticompetitive behavior by tech giants. Last month, it imposed a fine worth over 4 billion euros ($4 billion) on Google for how the company authorized phones running the Android operating system. And in May, it passed legislation called the Digital Markets Act, which could see companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) fined 20% of their annual revenue.  “There are good reasons for competition law enforcers on both sides of the Atlantic to be actively accompanying technological and market evolutions in this area” to keep the metaverse innovative and open, said Bulst and De Vinck, who both work on the media sector unit of the commission’s antitrust division. They called for more discussions with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. on the issue.  Read more: EU Passes Law to ‘Rein In’ Big Tech’s Domination Over Smaller Players  Policymakers are wary about the entry of big tech into the area.  “Meta is in danger of becoming the AOL of Web3,” U.K. lawmaker Matt Hancock told CoinDesk in an interview earlier this month, referring to how users were boxed in to using a single email and search provider in the early days of the internet. “I'd love Web3 to be able to go back to a much more vibrant and diverse range of players.”  But the way to avoid that – through different industry players working together on common standards and technology – poses competition risks of its own, Bulst and De Vinck warned.  The EU’s worry extends beyond competition into areas like data privacy, intellectual property and free speech, De Vinck and Bulst said.

The shocking decline has been one of the worst crypto winters on record, and the market is bracing for continued meltdown. However, a series of on-chain indicators in BTC could provide clues to how close we are to a bottom. Let&apos;s take a look. A Series Of Six On-Chain Indicators Shout: Bitcoin Bottom Is In Bear markets are brutal in Bitcoin or otherwise, because the bottom is only known in hindsight. The feeling that markets will fall forever, creates a fear that freezes investors from buying at long-term lows. Technical analysis is one tool that can be used to find oversold conditions or other signals that support the idea of a bottom. Unique to cryptocurrencies, is a subset of quantitative fundamental analysis that focuses on on-chain signals. Several such tools are potentially suggesting a bottom is in. Here we have the Puell Multiple. The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins (in USD) by the 365-day moving average of daily issuance value.

Servais, who was previously vice chairman of IOSCO's board, will be replacing Ashley Alder. He is also chairman of Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA).  The new chairman is no stranger to the crypto world as the FSMA launched a consultation in July to determine whether cryptocurrencies should be classifiedas securities, investment instruments or financial instruments. He also provided information on cryptocurrencies in a Belgian senate hearing in 2020.  IOSCO, the global standard setter for the securities sector, has been upping its efforts around the crypto sector lately as have many other regulatory bodies in the world that have seen crypto both attract and lose trillions over two years.  The U.S. CFTC is at the center of the debate over future crypto policy, as U.S. lawmakers consider giving it the authority to take a leading role in regulating the trading of digital assets. Its chairman, Behnam, has called for his agency to be able to directly regulate the spot market for trading crypto tokens that aren't securities, such as bitcoin. Legislation now moving through Congress could eventually make that happen.  ""I am honored to continue elevating the CFTC within this important international standard-setting body particularly during this time,"" Behnam said in a statement issued Wednesday by his agency.  Last week, IOSCO called for securities regulators to have the power to demand that foreign crypto ads be taken down, and in July, it published guidance on stablecoin's regulation. Also, IOSCO's fintech task force, which was set up in March, said in June that it would focus on developing global crypto rules.  ""IOSCO plays an increasingly important role in ensuring the smooth functioning of today's capital markets and protecting investors, and I look forward to building on Ashley's legacy after his six fruitful years at the helm of IOSCO,"" Servais said in the press release.  The board also appointed Ariizumi Shigeru, a regulator in Japan, as another vice chairman.  ""The road ahead promises to be difficult, given the current geopolitical and economic context,"" Alder said in the statement.  UPDATE (Oct. 19, 2020 14:36 UTC): Adds picture.

Market Moves  Bitcoin Futures ‘Backwardation’ Could Signal Bullish Mood  By Lyllah Ledesma  Bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange slipped into prolonged backwardation during September, according to a weekly report from crypto platform Luno.  Backwardation is an unusual condition in futures markets when contracts for maturity or delivery many months in the future are trading at lower prices than near-term contracts.  This hasn't happened since May 2019, according to Luno.  “A steeper futures curve (i.e. a high next-month premium over front-month expiry) indicates bullish sentiment,” the report stated. “A flat futures curve or a downward trending curve implies the opposite – longs require compensation for the risk of exposure in further dated and less liquid BTC contracts.”  Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, said the constant selling isn’t helping change this pattern in the near future. “As impetus for a rally and any further good news in crypto unlikely before next year, the best strategy is calendar spreads i.e. selling puts and buying calls,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/19/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-ether-slip-as-uk-inflation-hits-40-year-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72cf4122ade5fa7d357447e27f74ac26bf261088-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373646,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUIBh,1666182381,Terra Developers Unveil 4-Year Plan to Revive LUNA Ecosystem,"Terra developers floated a new proposal earlier this week as they look to revive the once-mighty network, even as Do Kwon, the platform's controversial co-founder, faces a warrant for his arrest on charges of fraud. Authorities have been searching for Kwon since last month, but he has denied that he is on the run.  Termed the “Terra Expedition,” the proposal is a revised version of the developer mining program and developer alignment program that were established when the Terra network started.  The majority of LUNA tokens must be voted in favor of the proposal before it can go into effect.  The new program would be funded with 9.5% of the total supply of LUNA tokens that was earmarked at the launch of a new Terra blockchain. (A new Terra blockchain was started earlier this year after the original network and its two related digital tokens imploded in May.)  The incentive program for the new network would run for four years and be managed by a community-elected committee that will evaluate the plan every 12 months.  The proposal aims to better align incentives across the network and to attract developers, get new users onboard and promote liquidity.  “The Terra Expedition is a four-year program aimed at growing the Terra ecosystem through a series of initiatives with three main objectives, namely: incentivizing developers to build on Terra, deepening liquidity on Terra and onboarding users to Terra,” the proposal read.  LUNA incentives via different programs  Of the allocation, 20 million LUNA tokens are earmarked for a developer grants program. Developers of different apps will be paid upon a successful audit and project launch on Luna's main network. Some examples of projects pointed out in the proposal include decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, stablecoin issuers and derivatives protocols.  Projects will also be eligible for up to $40,000 in reimbursements for their smart contract audits. Crypto security remains a sore point in the world of blockchains: This month is already the worst ever for attacks and exploits in the history of cryptocurrencies.  Another 20 million LUNA tokens would be floated to reward developers building on Terra. Any project deemed “essential” by the community – which has launched an app on Terra's network – would qualify. The tokens are scheduled to be distributed every quarter, the proposal stated.  A liquidity mining incentive scheme of 50 million LUNA tokens, which would be distributed over four years, has also been proposed. These funds would be used to fund the initial liquidity of decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, bridges and other similar protocols built on Terra.  Developers have also proposed to award five million LUNA to users to give them an incentive to use bridges and decentralized applications on the network and to mint non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the platform.  The original proposal earmarked a certain portion of the total LUNA supply to be distributed based on the value locked up on Terra-based protocols, but such an allocation would now “mainly benefit a few protocols,” and thus not have the intended effect of kickstarting the Terra ecosystem.  Terra-related applications lost $28 billion in value following the May implosion of Terra and its LUNA and UST tokens. As of this writing, Terra-based applications have only $40 million in locked value spread over seven protocols.",POSITIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/19/terra-developers-unveil-4-year-plan-to-revive-luna-ecosystem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85ea389d8d87a2a20495830b14814349200c11fb-2600x1950.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394495,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw95od,1666181250,The Web3 Guide to Getting Into the Music Industry,"It’s hard to break into the music industry and even harder to succeed as an artist in the long term. Traditionally molded by industry gatekeepers, curated Top 40 lists,and contracts with legacy record labels, rejection is a common hurdle for new artists climbing the industry ladder.  But blockchain technologies, such as non-fungible tokens (NFT), are shifting the power dynamics within the music industry and creating new opportunities for growth and engagement. Proponents of change say NFTs give artists the tools they need to grow an engaged community from scratch, starting with just a small group of loyal fans. This “1,000-true fans” model was first coined by Wired’s Kevin Kelly in 2008 and suggests that an artist really only needs 1,000 engaged fans to achieve success.  Musicians arguably now have more tools at their disposal to bypass, or at least get a headstart on, the traditional pathway to career success by building their online communities from day one. Web3 – what some are calling the next blockchain-based iteration of the internet – will likely transform the way fans consume music and interact with artists.  “The ethos and focus of Web3 is identity, ownership and community,” said Shannon Herber, managing director of A0K1VERSE, an NFT-gated fan community created by DJ and crypto collector Steve Aoki. Because many new NFT projects are centered around fostering community, having a few thousand followers on social media is what Herber calls “actually quite a large number in terms of Web3 fandom.”  We spoke to industry leaders with collective decades of experience about how to break into the music industry and cultivate an engaged audience using a Web3 toolkit.  Choose the right blockchain tools  “DYOR” (Do Your Own Research) is a mantra used colloquially throughout the crypto ecosystem. It is also applicable to musicians who want to understand the steps needed to build a brand on the blockchain, including creating and minting your first NFT.  “The first stage is always education,” said Inder Phull, CEO of PIXELYNX, a Web3 music company that combines gaming, augmented reality (AR) and the metaverse.  Many established artists have found creative ways to integrate NFTs into their existing business plans. For example, Grimes, Steve Aoki, Kings of Leon and 3LAU have each released new music as NFTs, while Pharrell recently signed on to NFT brand Doodles to produce music for the project.  The technological learning curve for NFTs can be a “key barrier to entry,” said Lin Dai, CEO and co-founder of OneOf, an environmentally conscious NFT marketplace that champions emerging musical artists. “About 99% of all creators have not been able to really participate yet,” Dai said.  If NFTs make sense for your community-building ambitions, it is important to first consider which blockchain to build your project on and what NFT marketplaces offer to best mechanisms to suit your specific needs.  According to Nansen.ai, Ethereum remains the top choice of blockchain for NFT projects. Prior to the recent Ethereum Merge – which upgraded it to a more efficient proof-of-stake consensus method – gas fees on Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces could range as high as $200 per mint, Dai said. This meant that it was previously cost-prohibitive for some artists to mint an affordable NFT collection. In the weeks since the Merge, gas fees have been much lower, making NFT collecting even more accessible.  Outside of Ethereum, a number of artist communities have sprouted up on other blockchains that offer faster speeds, lower minting costs and require less energy consumption.  “Music artists care deeply about the environment,” said Dai, adding that OneOf chose to support the Polygon and Tezos blockchains when it launched in 2021 due to their speed and environmental efficiency.  While the largest NFT marketplace OpenSea has a dedicated catalog for music NFTs, industry insiders say these are some of the most popular music NFT platforms, categorized by the blockchains they are built on:  Ethereum  Zora  Catalog  Sound.xyz  Foundation  Polygon  Arpeggi  OneOf  Solana  FormFunction  Groovetime  Tezos  OneOf  Objkt  Gamify fan engagement  Creating new experiences using game design elements – also known as “gamification” – has become a popular way for Web3 artists and fans to interact with one another.  “The future of fan-artist relationships is now all about co-creation and new ways for fans to show their love for the music and the artist they're passionate about,” said Phull.  As an example, he referenced a music video competition that Pixelynx and Deadmau5 launched last year, where fans were given a number of digital art assets to help create a music video inside game-driven metaverse Core for a new song called “When the Summer Ends.” The gamified experience offered a $50,000 grand prize for the winner, which encouraged thousands of fans to create content.  Independent artists can also experiment with gamification through social tokens, explained p00LS head of community Melanie McClain. Social tokens are like loyalty points minted on the blockchain, which artists can send to their followers as a reward for accomplishing tasks like attending special events, taking weekly quizzes, signing up for newsletters, listening to the latest album release and more.  Web3 supporters feel that the level of fan engagement enabled through social tokens is an upgrade to how consumers traditionally engage with albums on popular streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music. “It shows fans have a deeper understanding,” said McClain. “It’s not just a passive activity, but rather something that’s very, very intentional.”  Online gaming worlds like Fortnite have also welcomed virtual concerts, while metaverse platforms like Decentraland have organized music festivals that bring new listening experiences to users.  Consider creator royalties  Unlike traditional royalty structures within the music industry – which often have a fixed percentage payable to songwriters, music labels and various other rights holders – NFT minting gives artists the ability to choose their own royalty structures. Sometimes called “creator fees,” royalties represent a percentage of every NFT sale when the asset is resold.  For example, an artist may choose to receive 10% of secondary sales as royalties. They can enter the royalty amount at the time of minting, which triggers a smart contract to automatically direct the specified portion of sales to a designated crypto wallet. Some NFT platforms allow artists to include multiple crypto wallets in case they want to share royalties with collaborators, such as bandmates, sound engineers, producers, managers, or friends and family.  Music-focused NFT platform Royal, for example, allows fans to purchase music rights as NFTs, allowing them to benefit from the streaming royalties of their favorite artists’ music.  Not every NFT marketplace allows for such flexibility with NFT royalties, though Rarible is known for having a more robust royalty system than some others. Meanwhile, some marketplaces are trying to opt out of royalty payments altogether.  Blend traditional and Web3 strategies  While Web3 technology can be used to enhance an artist’s reach or engage a community, traditional methods still have their place.  While Herber notes that the NFT market can be volatile, she recommends using NFTs and metaverse platforms as complementary pathways for fundraising and fan engagement – but doesn't suggest moving away from traditional record deals entirely.  One method for utilizing NFT sales is to earmark them as a fundraiser of sorts, she advised, thinking of NFT sales in the way independent artists may use a crowdsourcing platform to fund their first album. Dai agrees, noting that OneOf offers a program called Co//Sign to help emerging independent artists mint their first NFTs and launch new music.  “In a traditional music industry model, you are essentially taking out a loan against your future,” said Dai. “Labels basically are making a lot of bets.”  Herber agrees, adding that an independent artist may still ultimately want a major record label to help them gain exposure to a broader market. “Web3 still has not hit mainstream adoption,” she said. “In terms of reaching the broader music market, you may still have to go through traditional methods to do that.”  While blockchain-based streaming services like Audius have grown in popularity, releasing music across traditional streaming services and as NFTs may help to cast as wide a net as possible and welcome in new fans from a range of spaces.  Create long-term utility for fans  One major tool in creating a thriving NFT community is what’s known as “utility.” Both independent and major artists may attach special privileges to NFT ownership, giving holders access to events, pre-sale tickets, merchandise and more.  “[Buying an NFT] is something like a membership club,” said Herber, adding that “NFTs are sort of the keys to the kingdom” and can unlock special perks.  Dai notes that building out a network of rewards for NFT holders can be especially helpful for independent artists in creating a beneficial feedback loop. “There is a big use case for independent artists to use NFTs as a way to actually set up their career so fans can participate on the upside. When they become famous, the NFTs’ value can increase.”  The “Cosmic Genesis” collection released by DJ Alesso in partnership with OneOf, for example, offered fans a tiered structure for collecting different chapters of his musical NFT based on increasing rarity traits. The final NFT in the collection was only available as one 1-of-1 edition, which came with a trip to space with tourism company World View.  While not every artist can guarantee their fans a trip to space, Dai says that any artist can take a lesson from the superstar DJ’s playbook. “You can kind of see how this applies to the biggest artists and to independent artists,” he said, noting that creators can experiment with the way they create engaging experiences through the timing, pacing and rarity of their NFT drops.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | XTZ | AR,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/the-web3-guide-to-getting-into-the-music-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2772a74330f92d64f6ac0a5816ea4821d1b309d4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AMF Secretary-General Benoît de Juvigny confirmed the country would be winding down its lighter national registration regime for crypto service providers.  France has sought to set itself apart as a crypto hub, and companies such as Crypto.com and Binance have already registered under its legal regime.  As of 2024, that system will be replaced by the EU Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework – which goes much further than the anti-money laundering checks currently carried out by France to include guarantees intended to ensure investor protection, market integrity and financial stability.  “The time for registering under the French regime … will soon come to an end,” Juvigny told a Fintech event in Paris hosted by the AMF and France's central bank. “I invite stakeholders to look, as of now, for the level of obligations which will soon be compulsory under MiCA.”  Juvigny also welcomed new EU rules intended to allow financial-market traders to test out systems based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) as of next year – and confirmed that France will take part in the trials. He said the AMF has already picked favorites to run pilots.  “We have already identified potential candidates,” he said, adding that any other volunteers should make contact. “The AMF will have the interests of participants in this regime at heart.”  French banks like Societe Generale have been keen proponents of the benefits of putting securities on the blockchain. Its subsidiary Forge recently registered with the AMF.  Juvigny will soon be working alongside former bank lobbyist Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, confirmed by lawmakers to chair the AMF more or less while Juvigny was speaking.

42393783,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAmyx,1666178100,Will Censorship Fork Ethereum?,"Ethereum may soon split into two, according to some developers. As the second-largest blockchain network vies for mainstream acceptance, it has increasingly fallen under the microscope of governments and regulators eager to tame the platform.  The U.S. government’s vision for Ethereum – which involves regulating certain kinds of blockchain apps out of existence – is at odds with some of the core principles on which the platform was founded.  Ideas like “censorship resistance” and “credible neutrality” may be thrown out the window as big businesses and average users – folks comfortable with a more heavily regulated crypto experience – enter the Ethereum arena.  The most likely path forward for Ethereum, people tell CoinDesk, may be two versions of the chain: one regulated, one not.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Ethereum’s ideology  Crypto was founded with a strong, albeit hard-to-pin-down ideological bent. Generally, censorship resistance and credible neutrality sit at this ideology’s core.  “I actually think most people in the Ethereum space agree with the notion that on Ethereum everyone is treated equally,” Martin Köppelmann, a long-time Ethereum developer and the founder of the privacy-focused Gnosis blockchain, told CoinDesk.  “If you have an idea for an [app] or if you should deploy an asset, even if you do a Ponzi scheme or whatever, the platform treats you in a neutral way,” he explained. “I feel like it's important to have one place where, even at a geopolitical scale, you don’t have the fear that one party could just, say, freeze the accounts or the assets of another party.”  Köppelmann contrasts this approach with “the Facebooks and Twitters of the world,” where if you do or say something wrong, “suddenly, from one day to another, they say, ‘Sorry, you're not allowed to do this anymore. You’re out.’”  Köppelmann uses the terms “censorship resistance,” “credible neutrality” and “‘permissionless innovation” to describe Ethereum’s hands-off ethos.  Regulators take notice  Increasingly, major financial institutions, giant corporations, and hordes of retail investors are choosing Ethereum as their blockchain of choice. But with them has come more oversight and less tolerance for Ethereum's more permissive founding ethos.  “Ethereum is still by far the best we have, in a way, but I would still say that it's at least scratching on this promise, or starting to violate this promise,” Köppelmann warned.  The most recent example of this oversight – which builders like Köppelmann are calling an act of overreach – has been the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s sanctions against Tornado Cash, an Ethereum “mixer” program that makes it possible for users to send and receive crypto without leaving behind a trail.  Exactly what Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions mean for Ethereum remains unclear. However, many of the U.S.-based nodes that operate the Ethereum network – the folks responsible for writing and confirming transactions to Ethereum’s ledger – have interpreted the sanctions as requiring them to ignore transactions linked to the Tornado Cash program.  A few “censoring” nodes won’t prevent Tornado-linked transactions from making it onto the Ethereum ledger, though it will increase the time it takes them to get there.  “Tornado became a second-class citizen on Ethereum,” lamented Koppelman. “It’s still of course possible to use it and so on, but the fact is your transaction – if it touches Tornado or some of those addresses – will be treated differently.”  If enough nodes were in favor of censoring the chain – enough nodes to make up two-thirds of the network’s “stake” – it would become altogether impossible for Tornado transactions to get written to the Ethereum ledger, at least under the network’s current rules.  A major censorship milestone  Koppelmann has been closely watching the number of nodes that are censoring out Tornado transactions.  Last week, he wrote that Ethereum had reached a “sad milestone in censorship.” According to his data, 51% of Ethereum blocks were censoring out Tornado transactions.  Read more: Censored Ethereum Blocks Hit the 51% Threshold Over the Past 24 Hours  Why was this number a milestone? “This means if the censoring validators would now stop attesting to non-censoring blocks they would eventually form the canonical, 100% censoring chain,” Köppelmann wrote.  Several developers contacted by CoinDesk predicted that Ethereum would, at some point in the future, split into two chains: a censored chain and an uncensored one.  Köppelmann differentiates Ethereum’s “core community” from newer, more financially oriented entrants. It's this divide, he says, which could cause a chain split.  “There are those voices that I would say are not what I would consider the Ethereum core community – but some investors or some VCs – [...] say, “Well, yeah, Ethereum simply needs to be OFAC compliant,’” said Köppelmann.  “Within Ethereum – within what I would consider the Ethereum core community,” he continued, “I don't know a single person that says no Tornado cash transaction should be allowed on Ethereum.”  Justin Drake, an Ethereum researcher at the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation, was one of the developers that told CoinDesk a chain split “will likely happen.”  “What tends to happen with these forks is that one of them is very, very much dominant over the other,” Drake predicted. “We've seen this with [Ethereum Classic,] we've seen this with even [ETH POW],” he said, referring to two previous Ethereum forks.  In terms of its projected size relative to the uncensored Ethereum chain, Drake thinks the censored chain “will be relatively small.” He wagers a guess: “Definitely less than 10%” of the main chain in terms of total value captured.  The primary Ethereum community’s massive decentralized finance, stablecoin and non-fungible token (NFT) economies will make it hard for a new chain to garner that much steam, Drake suggested.  Different strokes, different folks  Drake differentiates the audiences of the potential censored and uncensored chains. For instance, an uncensored chain is “more attractive to builders.”  According to Drake, “When you build an application and there's potential censorship, then your application could be censored.” To builders, Drake says that the potential for censorship would be received as “platform risk.”  As for the audience of a censored chain, Drake thinks “there's this sense that the censored ones could be more attractive to users. And then the reason is that if a specific country says, ‘No, we don't want you to use this,’ I think most citizens will just comply.”  He added, “I think what will happen is that if you want to build infrastructure which is going to last for a very long time, and it's going to be global, then you're going to build on the uncensored version. If, instead, you want to cater to one specific jurisdiction, maybe only the U.S., or if you want to do something specific – just gambling or something – you want to be very, very regulated.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETC | WALLET | FORKS,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/19/will-censorship-fork-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/496681e5a6966a6ccebed69de42f0831b8f6a83d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373664,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUIUZ,1666171937,Bitcoin Stuck in a Rut as BofA Survey Reveals 'Long Dollar' Is Most Favored Trade,"Bitcoin (BTC) was supposedly due for a recovery rally in the seasonally bullish month of October. So far, however, the bounce has remained elusive as sophisticated investors continue to park money into the U.S. dollar (USD).  Bank of America's (BofA) global fund manager survey published on Tuesday revealed that the ""long dollar"" – taking a bullish exposure in the greenback – was the preferred trade for October, with 64% of respondents calling it the most crowded bet. The investment banking giant polled 371 fund managers overseeing $1.1 trillion in assets during the week ended July 13.  The greenback has consistently been the most sought-after asset since July, thanks to Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts to control inflation with unusually large interest rate hikes that have lifted the benchmark interest rate by 300 basis points in six months. The Fed tightening has roiled risk assets, including cryptocurrencies and sent the dollar higher.  Crowded trades are often associated with bubbles and mark major price tops. For instance, ""long bitcoin"" and ""long technology stocks"" were the most sought-after trades last year. Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 in November 2021 and has dropped more than 70% since then. Wall Street's tech-heavy index Nasdaq has tanked 31% this year.  Therefore, some observers expect the dollar to come under pressure in the coming months. A notable pullback in the greenback, if any, would bode well for risk assets.  ""We need the dollar to reverse. That happens in late January,"" crypto trader and analyst Alex Kruger said in a tweet thread early Wednesday, noting the long dollar's overcrowded status.  Per Kruger, the Fed's rate hike cycle may end in February, paving the way for markets to short, or sell, the dollar.  However, according to crypto services provider, Matrixport's head of research and strategy, Markus Thielen, the odds might remain stacked against the dollar bears.  ""Its tough to be USD bearish. The U.S. economy is the one that is booming and is self-'energy' sufficient and a net exporter of energy. That, coupled with the on-shoring of the previously outsourced manufacturing industry, is driving this big boom,"" Thielen told CoinDesk.  The U.S.' relative economic strength and energy sufficiency may continue to fuel demand for the dollar even after the Fed stops raising rates. Besides, the seasonal trends indicate that the first quarter is usually positive for the dollar.  Data sourced from Equity Clock shows the start of the year into early March is a good period for the dollar. The currency often peaks in the second half of the March and bottoms out in early May.  Coincidentally, bitcoin's previous bull markets have peaked in December, paving the way for a price crash in the first quarter. And while the 2018 bear market ran out of steam in the last month of that year, bulls remained on the fence in the first three months of 2019 – a seasonally bullish period for the dollar.  It remains to be seen how things pan out.

42394031,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buO3Q7,1666171800,How Crypto Might Shake Up England’s Ancient Property Laws,"Financial regulators around the world are looking to tighten their control over crypto markets, especially after a turbulent year for digital asset prices and marketplaces. Although regulators can tell crypto companies and even investors how to behave, they don’t actually make the laws that could inform their regulations.  Legislators who put these laws in place, however, could lack the subject matter expertise to actually draft legislation. To address this shortfall, the U.K. government has entrusted an independent body made up of high court judges, lawyers and law professors to study the crypto space and recommend ways to govern it.  The Law Commission for England and Wales, funded by the U.K. Ministry of Justice, is running multiple projects focused on the crypto space to determine the best ways to treat Web3 developments like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and digital assets under new or existing laws.  A Law Commission project completed last November found the existing law of contract in England and Wales can be applied to smart contracts that underlie crypto transactions. It is also working on a conflict of laws project, exploring how to determine which courts should handle digital asset disputes because of their global nature. Recently, the body published a paper for consultation on its view that crypto should be treated as personal property to make it easier for investors to recover losses if they have their funds stolen or lost.  About two-thirds of the Commission’s work ends up being implemented by the U.K. parliament, according to Professor Sarah Green, the commissioner for commercial and common law. The Commission’s work can have influence in other jurisdictions as well. In cases where the U.S. doesn’t have legal precedents, the court ""may consider” the Commission’s consultation paper on digital assets, according to U.S. Judge Martin Glenn, who is currently overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings for crypto lender Celsuis.  With the U.K.’s government set – for now, at least – on turning the country into an international hub for crypto, the Law Commission’s projects may not only be important but also urgent.  CoinDesk spoke to Green about the Law Commission’s projects, which could shape the future of crypto law in England and Wales.  The following interview, conducted via Zoom, was edited for brevity and clarity.  CoinDesk: Why is the Law Commission interested in crypto?  Green: I could spend 50 million pounds sterling on a non-fungible token [NFT]. You could hack into my computer and take it. It's not clear that I would have any recourse in the law because the law at the moment does not know how to treat them.  What has the consultation research for your digital assets project shown you?  Users of NFTs, companies who issue these things, individuals who buy them, they want to be certain that when something goes wrong the law will step in to meet their expectations. When we've been speaking to lawyers on the legal side, they want the same thing because, of course, they have to give advice.  Judges have a similar issue in that they are faced with hundreds of years of commercial law precedent that just doesn’t have anything in it on digital assets because they haven’t been a thing and they haven’t been a problem. There's a quite delicate constitutional balance that judges have to tread. They develop the common law but they have to do it in step with law that comes from Parliament. At the moment, there are a few common law decisions or precedent that suggest intangible things can't be a subject of possessory proprietary rights. That's simply because we haven't really seen things like crypto assets before. The law is just not used to dealing with them.  But the problem now that we do have is that the law hasn't kept up. Some judges feel quite uncomfortable about just making that leap in a court case and saying, well, this thing is intangible but it's not quite like the intangibles – like ideas and depths – that we're used to dealing with.  So a few judges in their judgments have referred this issue to the Law Commission and to Parliament to say some guidance would be helpful, and I am not surprised at all about that because it’s such a big step.  You have recommended creating a new category that would enable digital assets to be treated like personal property. Why set up a new one?  If everybody was wiped out tomorrow but computers weren't, crypto assets would still exist. What we're recommending is that after hundreds of years of there being two categories – things you possess like a car and things in action which are recognized through legal action like you owing someone money – there should now be a third one which is specific for data objects, crypto assets.  If the consultation responses we get agree with that approach and it becomes one of our final proposals the other question is, how do we do it?  Do we sort of make a statement that gives judges the guidance, the assurance and the sort of constitutional underpinning they feel like they need, because we're a statutory body, to develop the common law? Or do we draft a statute which is completely undeniable right? At the moment we don't know. My feeling is that we need at this stage a basic, short statutory piece of guidance and then judges can develop that idea.  Would there be a new definition for crypto assets within this statute?  At the moment everybody is talking about blockchain, everybody is talking about distributed ledger technology, but in five or 10 years it is going to be a different technology. What we don’t want to do is make a statute which is quite soon obsolete. So the approach we prefer to “definitions” is characteristics. What we would rather do is say when an asset has the following characteristics it can be treated in the same way. What we don’t want to do is make every single electronic or digital thing subject to those property rights. There's a very good reason why you don’t have property rights for your average set of photos or word document – one of them being that they are almost infinitely reproducible. So if I send you a Word document I still keep that Word document and that’s no good if we’re talking about property rights because, say I am the bank that advances money on that word document. I’m not going to be very happy if loads of people get exactly the same document and can claim that money from me.  We need to keep it to digital assets which are discreet and unique, which are completely transferable so that when I pass it to you… nobody else can have it and that’s really important.  So what we prefer is pointing out those characteristics and saying where digital assets exhibit these characteristics they will be in this [new third] category.  What are some more examples of cases that would benefit from digital assets being treated like property by common law?  If you've got bitcoin and say a wallet provider is looking after that and they lose it, then it would require our reforms to give you proprietary rights to give you any means of getting anything back from them. Without that proprietary right you would have a contractual right against that wallet provider – which is kind of OK – but doesn't help you in a situation of insolvency because if you have a contractual right you're what's called an unsecured creditor. Everybody else gets their money back first, and if there's no money you just won't get any.  Banks and stablecoins are a bit different because once something is treated as money for technical terms it's subject to a whole new set of rules, but also cryptocurrencies at the moment are not treated as money in English law.  What are cryptocurrencies treated as currently?  We don’t know.  Is your recommended law going to be enough to ensure that clients get their funds back or does there have to be an improvement in technology?  I think it's both and what I'm really hoping is that once legal clarity is there those technological developments will happen a lot quicker and people will be keener to do it.  In your report you said in-game digital assets like those found in the metaverse could not fit in this new category. What could help people have access to their rights in this case?  In situations where you don't have something that fits the criteria, you still have a contractual claim. So if, for instance, you bought in-game assets from a particular provider and then you were prevented from using them, then you would have a claim. You'd have a contractual claim. That's a result of your agreement with the game. They might give you some money back for not being able to use them or they might be compelled by a court to let you use them.  What will your DAO project be looking at and why?  It's really important to know when you set up a company where your liabilities end, and at the moment with DAOs it's not clear what they are.  Ultimately, we want to be able to say if you set up a DAO, this is what you've got to do. And this is what's going to happen when things go wrong.  What will your conflict of laws project be looking at and why?  We don't know what rules will apply [because crypto is decentralized and global]. So, we want to make a list of rules to say which law will apply and which court will decide the dispute when it involves digital assets.

Barbat-Layani, currently Secretary-General at the French economics and finance ministry, is now set to take over from Robert Ophèle as chair of the Financial Markets Authority (AMF), responsible for registering crypto companies as well as traditional financial institutions.  The French government, which is keen to see the country become a crypto hub, has set up one of the first crypto licensing regimes in the European Union. France has anticipated the European Union’s bloc-wide rules, known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), that could take effect in 2024.  But Barbat-Layani also sent a warning to licensed crypto firms, reminding lawmakers that licenses once granted can also be taken away – and that this not a bug of the system but an intended feature.  A recent case where a crypto company was deregistered “shows the benefits” of the French measures, she told senators at a hearing held Tuesday. “Seeing your registration withdrawn has the effect of reverse advertising, which was one of the things that the AMF sought in terms of communication.”  “I greatly admire the approach that was taken by the AMF” in setting up the system and ensuring protections for young investors seeking to get into crypto, said Barbat-Layani, who was Director-General of the French Banking Federation from 2014 to 2019. “It was a form of bet, not necessarily welcomed unanimously at the time … I think that this risk taking was justified.”  Barbat-Layani was likely referring to crypto company Bykep, whose crypto registration was removed without the company’s consent in September – a first for the AMF. The regulator cited “serious failings” in money laundering controls and a costly theft via cyberattack.  CoinDesk was unable to reach Bykep, previously known as Keplerk, for comment. According to the AMF, Bykep had protested that the accusations didn’t justify the removal of its license.  France’s desire to be a crypto hub was restated by Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in an interview published Monday. Major crypto companies such as Binance and Crypto.com have already registered under the country’s regime, which is managed by the AMF along with the central bank.

Monero managed to bounce back twice from its support range of $134.5 XMR remains &apos;in the green&apos; for its intraday, weekly and monthly price readings A surge all the way to $171 is possible for Monero if it moves past its current resistance range The altcoin, for the past few days, has been on a consistent price increase, seeing all-green on its hourly, intraday, weekly and monthly levels. At press time, according to data from Coingecko, Monero is trading at $146.56, being up by 1.8% over the last 24-hours. On a week-to-date and month-to-date basis, XMR increased by 1.3% and 4.5%, respectively. But even with the recent price pumps, Monero is still far from its all-time high value of $542.33 that it hit on January 9, 2018. Still, holders of the crypto should have plenty of reasons to be optimistic over the next days as the asset is leaning towards a bullish momentum. Monero Price Analysis XMR, just like the rest of its fellow altcoins, experienced rigid price correction as the crypto market plunged into yet another bearish cycle. A look at the trading data and chart for Monero shows the cryptocurrency&apos;s fall stopped at $134.5 marker which acted as its support range last month.

42373651,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUIGj,1666161863,Celo Protocol Moola Market Loses Over $10M in Market Manipulation Attack,"Celo-based lending and borrowing protocol Moola Market had over $10 million worth of tokens stolen, and later returned, Wednesday morning after a market manipulation attack.  The exploit was the second of its kind in the last few weeks, with the attackers manipulating the prices of Moola’s native MOO tokens to borrow collateral against their positions – effectively draining the protocol.  Moola developers said the attack started during late Asian hours on Tuesday. “An unknown attacker started manipulating the price of MOO on Ubeswap, allowing the attacker to manipulate the MOO TWAP price oracle used by the Moola protocol,” they wrote. Oracles are third-party services that fetch data from outside a blockchain to within it.  The attacker borrowed a large amount of cUSD and cEUR, two Celo-based stablecoins pegged to U.S. dollar and euro respectively, and CELO from the protocol using MOO as collateral, effectively draining the protocol of its funds. Trading on the platform was stopped at that time.  Developers said they contacted law enforcement shortly after discovering the issue. A while later, an individual identifying as the attacker reached out to the team confirming their involvement. This individual held the private key – a cryptographic value akin to a password for a certain block on the blockchain – to the stolen funds.  Moola said it was then able to negotiate with the attacker. At the time of writing, Moola recovered over 93% of the stolen funds some 12 hours after the incident.

42413881,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAlrln,1666158061,"Effort to Reverse SEC Rejection of Bitcoin ETF Wins Broad Crypto, TradFi Support","An attempt to overturn the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rejection of a bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) has won support from a wide group of major players in crypto and traditional finance, and even ex-officials from the nation's top markets regulators.  Grayscale Investments (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group) already offers the $2 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) that trades on U.S. exchanges like a stock. But it's a trust, and existing shares cannot be redeemed to help balance supply and demand, helping to explain why it has, since early last year, traded at a discount to the total value of its bitcoin holdings.  Grayscale sought SEC permission to turn the trust into an ETF, an investment vehicle where the number of shares outstanding can be reduced, which may make it a more appealing product for investors. The securities regulator denied that application in June, and Grayscale sued to reverse that decision.  This week, some of the biggest names in finance and regulation weighed in, submitting filings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in support of Grayscale.  The Blockchain Association, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center said the SEC had approved a similar yet riskier type of product: ETFs that hold bitcoin futures contracts rather than bitcoin itself (as Grayscale wants to do). The ETF approach is ""ideally suited for investors that desire exposure to bitcoin,"" according to their filing. The SEC's ""'thumb on the scale' approach,"" the groups added, ""does not withstand scrutiny.""  The Blockchain Association's members include Circle, Jump, Kraken and Ripple, while the Chamber of Digital Commerce counts Binance.US, Citigroup, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and Mastercard among its members. Coin Center is an educational and research institution focused on public policy issues related to crypto.  NYSE Arca, the stock exchange that wanted to list the Grayscale ETF, in its own filing pushed back on the SEC's assertion that the risk of market manipulation is one reason not to approve a bitcoin ETF. NYSE Arca, a division of markets giant Intercontinental Exchange, said the index it uses to determine bitcoin's valuation has been used ""successfully for more than six years,"" and is already designed to mitigate potential fraud or market manipulation.  Some prominent former regulators also supported Grayscale. Two former SEC commissioners (including former Chair Harvey Pitt), former Commodity Futures Trading Commission commissioners, a number of senior academics and former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks submitted their own amicus, or friend of the court, briefs. They argued the Grayscale trust addresses the SEC's investor protection concerns, and echoed Grayscale's own argument that the rejection is ""arbitrary"" given the approval of bitcoin futures ETFs.  Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, also filed a separate amicus brief backing Grayscale.  In an opening legal brief submitted last week, Grayscale called the SEC's rejection “arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory.""

MATIC (Polygon) had been trying hard to move past its immediate trading session for a while, and now it has finally been able to do that. It is, however, too early to call this a trend change.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin and Other Cryptos Fall  By James Rubin  Bitcoin sputtered even as it continued to flutter above $19,000 throughout Tuesday trading.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at just over $19,300, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours. Ether followed a slightly more troublesome path, falling briefly below its recent $1,300 support before recovering later in the day. The second-largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands just above $1,300, off 2% from Monday, same time.  Other major cryptos with market caps over $1 billion spent much of the day donning various shades of red, with XRP and ADA recently down about 3%. UNI was up over 2%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, fell by 0.35% over the past 24 hours.  ""Crypto is locked into consolidation mode and that will continue until investors are convinced of the risks of the Fed over-tightening and sending the economy into a severe recession are gone,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.  Crypto prices countered equity markets, which rose for a second consecutive day with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all climbing about a percentage point amid encouraging third quarter earnings reports from several global brands, including Goldman Sachs, which said profits had dropped but surpassed targets. The investment bank has ramped up its interest in crypto over the past year.  In late-breaking crypto, news venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) said that it is not on board with the founder’s vision to break up MakerDAO, one of crypto’s largest decentralized finance protocols, into smaller units. And three trade groups representing a wide swath of the crypto industry filed an amicus, or friend of the court, brief supporting a Grayscale Investments lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for rejecting the firm's proposal for a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund. Coinbase later filed its own brief in the case. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Is bitcoin correlated with stocks?  Evidence Tuesday, as CoinDesk reported, suggests the assets' close proximity throughout much of 2022 has diminished lately. According to IntoTheBlock, a crypto data and analysis firm, the 30-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 has fallen to 0.04 – basically nothing because a correlation near 0 suggests no price linkage whatsoever.  “It's still too early to call for the end of the highly correlated regime, but investors are likely to get a better feel for this following the Microsoft, Google, Apple and Amazon earnings release next week,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock.

Will this year be the Aptos Autumn?  Solana launched last year at the height of a bull market when decentralized finance (DeFi) was just popping off. Ethereum was slow, expensive, and congested, making perfect market conditions for a speedy and low-cost alternative.  Aptos is launching at a time when the only concerns about the price of gas involve petroleum, not the virtual metaphor, according to on-chain data. The average price of gas for a blockchain transaction is now $27 versus over $100 from the end of October 2021.  But Solana, despite its speed, is lacking in something Ethereum has: trust. Data from DefiLlama shows that Solana only has around 1.7% of the total value locked (TVL) for all of decentralized finance.  Part of this is from the number of bad actors that have emerged on Solana.  Ethereum certainly has its share, but given the sheer scale of the protocol it doesn’t have the same high profile. There’s Ian and Dylan Macalinao, who faked the size of the developer community on Solana by posing as 11 different developers. Then there’s Avraham Eisenberg, part of a group that drained $114 million from Solana-based DeFi platform Mango Markets last week before returning $67 million, not by hacking but by exploiting vulnerabilities in the market structure. All of the aforementioned have said that they have interest in moving over to Aptos.  Lots of attention is going to be paid to Aptos’ APT token on its first day of trading, with traders pushing the token down by nearly 34% during its first hour of trading, according to CoinGecko data. Many aren’t happy about the tokenomics of the protocol, which has the majority of tokens sitting with venture capitalists and core developers, who are eagerly taking to the derivatives contracts available from Binance to short the protocol.  But if there’s one thing that’s working as advertised, it's the transactions per second on Aptos. Data from block explorers shows that the TPS has already surged past 25, and has been climbing in its first few hours. Solana is currently processing just over 4,000, but these are early days.  Let’s hope that the brand confusion with Apricot Finance, which also has the APT ticker, subsides. (Editor note: The symbol was later changed to APRT.)

42422182,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0iJth,1666141595,A16z Doesn’t Support Plan to Break Up DeFi Giant MakerDAO,"Venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is not on board with the founder’s vision to break up MakerDAO, one of crypto’s largest decentralized finance protocols, into smaller units.  A16z, an investor in Maker with power to sway votes in decision-making, laid out its own vision for the protocol’s path forward, pushing back against some arguments of MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen’s “Endgame” manifesto on how to make Maker more decentralized and censorship resistant.  Maker is a cornerstone of decentralized finance, where users withdraw and lend crypto in an automated manner. It also issues DAI, the $6 billion decentralized stablecoin backed by some $7.8 billion in assets locked up by investors.  As a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), the platform is governed by blockchain-based codes and votes by maker (MKR) token holders, who discuss all proposals and decisions in the protocol’s forum. A16z owns a significant amount of MKR tokens as an investor and therefore boasts voting power and influence on which proposals will eventually gain approval.  Ongoing debate  The platform is in the middle of a makeover, and the debate between proponents of prioritizing decentralization versus boosting growth touches on a fundamental dilemma for cryptocurrency protocols.  ""Currently, MakerDAO is wrestling with the trade-offs between growing the protocol or hardening it against regulatory risks,” Dustin Teander, an analyst at crypto intelligence platform Messari, told CoinDesk. “Decentralization has to play a part, of course, but a small, decentralized product doesn't actually solve the market problem for the people that need it.""  Read more: Is MakerDAO Becoming ‘a Company Run by Politics’?  The note, authored by Porter Smith, a partner at a16z, advocates for changes that would improve decentralization without impeding growth and comply with the current legal and regulatory environment. This includes improving the current system based on Core Units, instead of breaking up the protocol’s governance structure into smaller units called MetaDAOs.  “The Core Unit structure is arguably already legally decentralized,” Smith wrote. “Introducing MetaDAOs likely does not change this analysis, nor lead to more organizational resiliency from a strictly legal perspective.”  The note said a16z would support “experimentation through smaller, self-contained proposals to get a baseline for how proposed changes might work (or not) in practice.”  “Maybe experimenting with one MetaDAO (or one per type), iterating, and then rolling out an organizational change with real data and live experience could strike the balance here,” Smith wrote in a comment on the forum.  Two proposals are open for voting to MKR holders about how to reorganize MakerDAO’s structure, including spinning off management units of the protocol and turning them into MetaDAOs. At press time, polls show that around 90% of voters support the creation of MetaDAOs at the expense of Core Units.  Rune Christensen unveiled an ambitious roadmap for MakerDAO’s future in May, tagged as the Endgame plan, to make the protocol truly decentralized and resistant to any potential overreach and censorship from governments. His plan included free-floating DAI and ditching centralized assets from reserves that could be, in theory, blacklisted or seized.  In the short term, however, MakerDAO contributors doubled down on growth and voted for incorporating real-world assets such as $500 million of government-issued Treasury bonds into the protocol’s reserves, in an attempt to capture revenue from yields and build in incentives for MKR and DAI holders to attract new users.  Tensions between rival factions in the protocol's governance go back at least to this summer, when investors and founders came face to face in a voting about the protocol’s lending oversight unit.",NEUTRAL,MKR | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MKR | REGULATION | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/19/a16z-doesnt-support-plan-to-break-up-defi-giant-makerdao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3130347b9a49fffdb2dcf9cad7717a1174475058-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The coin gained 1.6% in that time frame. It is, however, still safe to say that the asset is consolidating. In the past week, the XRP price has barely shown any movement, confirming sideways trading. The technical outlook for XRP shows that buyers are losing control of the market as selling strength continues to mount at press time.
