42426622,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNdh,1451410242,From Worst to First: Bitcoin's Price Ends 2015 on Top,"After a year filled with its share of doom and gloom, the verdict is in: Bitcoin won 2015.  As trumpeted by headlines in CNBC and Bloomberg, bitcoin was the best-performing currency of the year, netting near-40% gains, more than double its nearest competition, the Somali Shilling and Gambian Dalasi. The development contrasts with bitcoin's performance from 2014, in which it lost 56% of its value, the most among global currencies.  A look at the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) from October on reveals an impressive upward arch that contrasts with the choppy peaks and valleys of the year's earlier months.  Though the exact reasons are unclear, many pundits are pinning the currency's turnaround on the growing enterprise fascination with blockchain tech and the renewed mainstream attention from stories such as the alleged discovery of bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto.  But as we head into 2016, a big question remains to be answered: Will recent price positivity continue to buoyed by fundamental market improvements?  While only time will provide the answer, we take a look back at the price movements over the last 12 months for clues and considerations.  January  Despite starting the year at just over $300, the bitcoin price crashed to a low of around $170 on 14th January, losing 37% of its value in two days. As an example of just how sudden and dramatic the drop was, even noted bitcoin bull Barry Silbert proclaimed the market had ""capitulated"".  The last time the price had crossed the $200 line had been in late October 2013, before its meteoric rise to more than $1,000.  The low price wasn't bad news for everyone, however. Traders got busy accumulating new positions and exchanges had their busiest day since a price rally in November 2014.  The price rebounded somewhat over the following 12 days to just over $270 and ended the month on a high note as the price rocketed over $300, seemingly at the news that exchange and wallet provider Coinbase had closed a $75m funding round.  February  February started on a low note as Coinbase euphoria waned and the price fell back below $250.  Mid-month, however, the bitcoin price gained nearly $50 in four days of trading. This represented a 23% gain over that period.  Soon, as was to become tediously common, the price once again settled back below $250, undulating around $240 before a slight climb to over $250 to close the month.  March  Bitcoin price gains that peaked at $286 were supported by strong volume growth early in the month. Some 3.67m BTC changed hands on the week ending 7th March, which was a 55% increase over the previous seven-day period.  The second half of the month saw a reprisal of the slump to the low $200s.  April to June  The above pattern was to repeat through the three months April to June, when the price generally sat level at between $220 and $240.  The best one could say about the situation, perhaps, was that the notoriously volatile digital currency had ""found a floor"", a positive for those who consider the digital currency a viable store of value.  The development wasn't so good for traders, of course, but many have said that low volatility is key if bitcoin is ever to go mainstream as a method of payment.  On 17th June, after months of relative calm, the price of bitcoin finally broke out of the doldrums and spiked to a high of $257.  One of the most prominent theories that emerged to explain the rise was related to the market's timing, which roughly coincided with growing indications that Greece would possibly default on its debt obligations – the 'Grexit', as it had been nicknamed.  The fervent hope among many in the bitcoin community was that Greeks would switch to the digital currency as they saw their banks accounts frozen and ways to move money in or out, such as PayPal and Western Union, were shut off in the country while a deal was hammered out with the EU.  Despite media reports selling that line, some commentators said it was just as likely that the price rise was a coincidence and the evidence for Greeks adopting bitcoin was very thin on the ground.  The price dropped slightly in the days after, before finishing June on a high of over $260.  July  On 13th July, the bitcoin price continued to climb, shooting past the $300 mark and reaching its highest level since 10th March.  Many still put the rises down to the economic situation in Greece; others attributed it to the psychological effect of people hoping for such a trend.  Mid-month, CoinDesk launched a reader's poll that concluded that some 62% of bitcoin enthusiasts believed the digital currency would be worth less than $500 at the end of this year. (While the trend is in the right direction to top $500, it's looking like our readers were right as we go to press).  After the possibly-Greek-influenced climb early in July, the price dropped slightly and spent the rest of the month around $275 to $290.  August  A general downward price trend through the month was interrupted by two notable negative events brought about by a single bitcoin exchange.  Firstly, on the 19th August, a 'flash crash' at Hong Kong-based Bitfinex caused the price of a bitcoin to nosedive 14% in a period of just 30 minutes.  The price had been holding steady between $250 and $255, but dropped to a low of $214.36 just before midnight (UTC). In the same period, the Bitfinex price sank 29% to $179.35.  The exchange told CoinDesk at the time that the flash crash was triggered when several leveraged positions were forcibly closed in close proximity to each other.  Then, on the 24th, just a few days later, the price slumped again after Bitfinex closed its order book for seven hours, citing issues with its post-trade processing.  September  Generally uneventful, September's prices hovered in the $230 to $240 range, with a peak at around $245 on 8th September.  What was promising, however, was the signs of a rising trend towards the close of the month, though it closed at just $236.  October  That upward trend noted at the end of September continued through October until it achieved a price of over $260 on 13th October, its highest price in two months.  The raise may have been caused by a sudden surge in bitcoin trading volume driven predominantly by the Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin.  Bobby Lee, CEO of Chinese exchange BTCC, told CoinDesk at the time that his platform has seen a significant volume increase, though he dismissed much of his competitors' volume as ""artificial"".  Those behind the volume, he said, are not traders but consumers sucked into a Russian ponzi scheme, MMM.  The price trend nonetheless continued skywards and on 28th October it broke through the $300 barrier on the CoinDesk BPI for the first time in over three months.  Soon after, the price was at a new high for 2015, peaking at $333.75 on the 30th.  November  The positive trend continued into November, with the price rapidly reaching, first $400 on the 3rd, then over $480 on the 4th of the month.  The sudden rise prompted Wedbush Securities to revise its 12-month projections for the price of bitcoin and revealing it expects the price to rise to $600 over the next year.  After a sharp drop on the 11th that took the price back down to close to $300, it settled down to a new normal of around $325 for much of the remainder of the month, with a rise at the close to over $370.  December  So, here we are in the closing month of 2015, and the price is trending up.  On the 15th, it reached the highest level since September 2014, climbing to more than $465 across most major exchanges.  Despite a slight drop since then, pundits are enthusiastic, with many arguing the industry is poised for a positive start to 2016.  What is your prediction for the bitcoin price in 2016?

42426613,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNNh,1451402143,4 Hype-Free Predictions for Private Blockchains in 2016,"Preston Byrne is a co-founder and COO of Eris Industries and a fellow of the Adam Smith Institute. Previously, he was a securitisation and derivatives lawyer with Norton Rose Fulbright in London and he continues to ""geek out"" on high finance.  It’s been said the only way to win the game of life is for your obituary to run in The Economist.  By that measure, the blockchain (or rather, the idea of a blockchain as a distributed database, rather than merely a backbone for a cryptocurrency) is certainly doing well.  This year alone, the blockchain has chalked up dozens (if not hundreds) of articles in most financial periodicals of record and the cover, no less, of The Economist. Even liberal culture hero Lawrence Lessig recently called the technology ""the most important innovation in fundamental architecture since the tubes of the Internet were first developed"".  I agree with this assessment, albeit cautiously. I was there when bitcoin's earliest adopters were describing their technology in similarly high-flying terms (back in the heady days of Charlie Shrem and Mark Karpeles, before anyone noticed the three transaction-per-second throughput limits or before FinCEN got antsy about MSB licensing).  It’s the same now with blockchains.  Although the technology has considerable potential, given that so few people actually know how to build with it, there is a risk that failing to be sufficiently sober about its capabilities and straightforward about its drawbacks will lead us to apply it in ways that will not showcase this potential at its best.  I would therefore like to humbly offer a few sober and fairly boring predictions for 2016, in the hope that this puts everyone in a hype-free state of mind for the new year.  1. Nobody will own the stack  I’m often asked by journalists and VCs whether the blockchain game is a 'winner take all' proposition.  To ask the question betrays a degree of ignorance about what blockchains actually do. Blockchains allow disparate groups to do things on a peer-to-peer basis that, to date, they have relied on third parties like IBM, Google or Amazon to do for them. They cut the data service provider, whomever that might be, out of the transaction and let the blockchain's pre-set transaction management rules do the heavy lifting.  Let’s take bitcoin as an example.  Most bitcoiners, when asked what problem bitcoin solves, will quickly respond with something like ""trust"" or ""value"" or ""intermediaries."" But if we reread the white paper from a teleological point of view, these aspects of the bitcoin solution were the means to achieving an objective, not the objective itself.  In the most abstract terms, the point of bitcoin is to provide verification and authentication for a particular type of transaction (cash payment) without the provision of personal information by either of the participants. In Satoshi’s own words, the problem bitcoin solves is privacy.  To do this with money, you need to create both new money (bitcoin) as well as a distributed network architecture that doesn’t depend on a central machine (the blockchain). To do this with most commercial data, however, you don’t need to create a new asset class. What you need is to wrest control of network infrastructure away from existing data service providers and allow people to run that infrastructure themselves.  Blockchains make sense because privacy and verifiability are not just problems in payments. Current free-to-use services, from search to email to social networking, are dependent on advertising revenue to fund their operations.  As a result, companies offering these services must – to paraphrase Satoshi Nakamoto – hassle their users for considerably more information than they would otherwise need. This necessity has skewed the Internet toward a more centralized infrastructure than was originally intended, with attendant consequences for personal liberty and data security.  Where bitcoin was designed to solve this centralisation problem in relation to point-of-sale and banking transactions, private blockchains hold the promise of distributing – if not fully decentralising – the logic of all manner of other apps. If we can prove who we are and enforce our relationships with cryptography, we don’t have to share as much data with each other.  For our part, Eris has built a distributed Reddithttps://github.com/project-douglas and distributed YouTubehttps://github.com/eris-ltd/2gather (both open-source, so feel free to steal the code) all with a view to proving one thing: the blockchain, together with other new technologies such as IPFS, is DIY Internet.  Nobody owns HTTP, and nobody’s going to own blockchain.  2. Blockchains will be accepted as general-purpose databases  Last week's news that IBM had developed a free, open-source blockchain and was donating that code to the Linux Foundation was greeted with widespread derision by the bitcoin community, including a number of prominent VCs.  This lack of enthusiasm is extremely odd, keeping in mind the 'DIY Internet' that blockchain tech allows. Although bitcoin fans grate at the idea that permissioned databases should bear the name, it's clear from the white paper that bitcoin and the blockchain are clearly not the same thing.  After all, bitcoin is ""a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash"", while a blockchain is four pages of technical writing that follows the phrase “a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash” and describe the database back-end that runs that application.  If we were to summarise those four pages, we might come up with something like this: a shared datastore for peer-to-peer networks designed to ""reliably (manage) a large amount of data in a multi-user environment so that many users can concurrently access the same data.""  If the latter line sounds familiar, it's because it is. The part in quotation marks is Oracle describing its own open-source database management systems.  Similarly, at Eris, our thesis is simple: what relational database management systems such as MySQL were in the 1990s and 2000s for computing silos, blockchains are in the 2010s and 2020s for distributed networks.  So how is a 'private blockchain' innovative vis-a-vis existing databases? As Tim Swanson wrote about bitcoin, ""while all the individual elements that comprise the bitcoin blockchain have been around since 2001, it took until Satoshi's 2008 white paper to demonstrate how these individual pieces could be cobbled together to work as one.""  Private blockchains simply mix and match new components to better fit particular use cases. Where bitcoin needs (1) a timestamp server (which ‘chains the blocks’), (2) hashcash's proof-of-work algorithm, and (3) a digital signature scheme (ECDSA secp256k1),  Most commercial chains with permissioning systems just keep what we need (the timestamping) and swap out what we don't with better components (eg: the Tendermint consensus algorithm plus EdDSA ed22519 signature algorithm).  In 2016, this proposition will no longer be controversial.  3. Mining will be (mostly) relegated to irrelevance  Mining is not, and will likely not ever be, relevant to running a private blockchain.  The reasons for this are fairly straightforward: bitcoin mining isn’t 'transaction processing' or 'transaction validation', as both of these are done on an ongoing basis by full nodes on the bitcoin network as they propagate valid transactions to one another (verifying digital signatures).  'Mining' is not about validation: it is about fork choice. With a decentralised system like bitcoin's, anyone in the world can add a block to the end of the chain. As a result, a competitive mechanism is needed to penalise bad conduct.  A private blockchain, on the other hand, is designed to suit a very specific coordination and communication need for a very specific person or group of people, some (or all) of which will be known.  If you control those nodes or know who runs them, you can use the same digital signatures that secure a bitcoin balance (a write permission to spend bitcoin) to secure the chain (a write permission to add a block to the end of a chain).  Chain security thus becomes a question of sufficiently distributing your nodes and effective key management. These are difficult problems, but they are (if done well) as effective and significantly more flexible than bitcoin’s approach.  For bitcoin itself, of course, mining is likely to remain relevant for some years to come until a better solution can be found.  4. Code, don't talk  Where 2015 was the year everyone talked about blockchain, 2016 is going to be the year everyone builds on it.  There’s a lot of experimentation, improvement and optimisation left to do. In my personal opinion, we’re two budget cycles away from the first production systems in finance, and I agree with Chris Skinner, chair of the Financial Services Club, that we’re probably 10 years away from mainstream use.  By ""mainstream use,"" of course, I mean that applications with blockchain back-ends are ubiquitous and the end-users don’t even know they’re using a blockchain.  For the time being, however, there are numerous distributed networking platforms – including our own, OpenChain, Tendermint, MultiChain, and IPFS – which exist, work, and are free to use, and which some of the world’s largest corporations are already testing to solve difficult commercial problems, particularly in terms of business process efficiency.  What this means for any financial institution or other business looking to use the tech is that the ball is entirely in your court.  It’s cheap as chips to get started and there’s much to be learned, so there’s simply no excuse not to allocate budget and let your developers loose on this for a year – especially considering that your competitors already are.

42426612,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNRh,1451398318,Report: Blythe Masters' Blockchain Startup Struggles to Close Funding,"Digital Asset Holdings, the startup led by ex-JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters, is apparently having issues closing an inaugural investment round.  Blythe's previous employer JPMorgan Chase & Co has already committed about $7.5m to the undisclosed round, but Digital Asset has been struggling for some time to complete the deal with other investors, according to The New York Times.  Allegedly, major banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have been reluctant to commit to the deal as JP Morgan was ""being given better terms than other investors"", according to Times sources.  More seriously, perhaps, some potential investors have also expressed doubts about the actual software product offered by Digital Asset. The firm plans to use blockchain technology to cut down settlement and clearing times at incumbent financial firms, but has to date acquired most of its technology through acquisitions.  ""The deal would need to improve materially for us to get involved,"" an anonymous executive at a financial company considering participating in the round told the Times. ""It’s not super compelling.""  Digital Asset is hoping to raise $35m to $45m in the funding round, which would value the startup at $100m, according to the report, figures that align with those published in a New York Post exclusive earlier this month.  The news is notable as Masters has become something of a figurehead for the fledgling blockchain industry and, since taking on the role of chief executive at Digital Asset in March, is rumoured to have been working to promote blockchain technology within Wall Street institutions.  Launched in early 2015, Digital Asset has been quiet in public until recently, when it announced it was involved in an open-source blockchain project spearheaded by IBM.  According to the publication, Digital Asset representatives have denied allegations in the Times report.
