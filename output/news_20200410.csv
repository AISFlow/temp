42431714,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5idh,1586553917,Reddit May Use Ethereum for a New Token-Based Points System,"Reddit is experimenting with recording points and perks on a blockchain.      According to a user post on the social media platform and confirmed by a company spokesperson, Reddit is experimenting with “Community Points” – a new system for subreddits (communities) that gives power users extra benefits. These Community Points are apparently stored using Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard.      According to the video by Reddit user MagoCrypto, the site will publish a list of users and their karma every four weeks; allow the community’s users to propose any changes; and then sign off on the list, allowing users to claim Community Points.      In a statement, a Reddit spokesperson said, “We continuously experiment with ways to support communities on Reddit. In this instance, we’re working with one community to test a feature that represents a user’s involvement in a community. We value and seek out community feedback as we continue to explore features that engage our users and communities.”      The spokesperson declined to confirm whether the project was being tested on Ethereum or provide further details.    Polls and perks    These community points differ from karma – Reddit’s longstanding in-house points system – in a few ways, according to the video.      Reddit controls all karma, while the community points are ERC-20 tokens and therefore exist outside of Reddit’s control. Points can also be used to buy “Special Memberships” granting the right to use emojis and GIFs in comments or weight polls, according to the video shared by MagoCrypto.      Reddit users who don’t have enough points can also buy Special Memberships directly from Reddit.      “Community points are fully controlled by the people who own them,” according to the video. “They live on the Ethereum blockchain, which is the same technology as Bitcoin to guarantee property rights and control. Even Reddit cannot take them away.”      Polls conducted in a community with points will show both what the total votes are for vote-per-person, as well as the weighted total for vote-per-point, meaning users with more points will have an outsize impact on the poll.      “This allows the community to see how core contributors feel,” the post said.    Wallets    Reddit users can access their Community Points through the Reddit mobile app, though comments from users indicate that it may only be rolled out to a small number so far. The app has a wallet function that lets users see their total balance.      “Behind the scenes, your wallet is a way to access the Ethereum blockchain,” the post said. “When your wallet is created it generates a public address and a private key.”      The private key is known only to the app’s user, and Reddit advises users to create a backup or write the keys down someplace safe.      While Reddit has not formally acknowledged that it is testing this system on Ethereum, co-founder Alexis Ohanian has publicly been a crypto supporter since at least 2018, and the company has offered support for crypto as a payment tool for years.      Ohanian's venture firm, Initialized Capital, has also funded other crypto projects, including Horizon Games' SkyWeaver, a video game powered by Ethereum.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/10/reddit-may-use-ethereum-for-a-new-token-based-points-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e2a218ddc0c93834c523026adca09df5a3d6d2e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) began developing PIER in 2017 and launched it in early April. In total it cost the bank R$1,300,000, roughly equivalent to $252,700 USD, Press Officer Ivone Portes told CoinDesk.      But BCB is confident PIER will pay off. PIER is a unified data clearinghouse for BCB, the securities regulator (CVM), the private insurance regulator, (SUSEP) and eventually the social security superintendency (PRIVEC), replacing Brazil’s paper-based record sharing procedure with a fully digitized bureaucratic trove.      Tasks like business authorization “that took many hours or days” under the old process “now can take even seconds, since data is available online,” Portes said in an email.      PIER also makes that data more reliable by pulling it from the source, Portes said. It runs on JPMorgan’s open source Quorum blockchain, an Ethereum-based platform that BCB said is overlaid on a “private IT infrastructure.” BNamericas reported that PIER also utilizes Microsoft Azure cloud computing.

42404444,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDm7,1586536565,How Edge Computing Can Make Us More Resilient in a Crisis,"Jalak Jobanputra is founder of FuturePerfect Ventures.      “Edge computing” has been heralded as a way to increase access to real-time information and to analyze that information more efficiently. But in this moment of public health crisis, we should recognize a potentially significant opportunity that these technologies offer beyond efficiency: the ability of edge computing to weather massive disruption.      To see why, it’s worth remembering what edge computing involves. These technologies move computer workloads to “the edge” of networks, shifting the collection, processing, and storage of data from central locations (like servers or the cloud) to individual devices such as cell phones.      See also: Rebuilding the Resilience Economy, Feat. Anthony Pompliano      This is significant because of the massive increase of computing power seen in devices that live away from the center of networks. In 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore famously observed that computer processing doubles every two years, while the cost of that processing power halves in the same time period. The effects of Moore’s Law mean our smartphones now have more processing capability than NASA’s computers when they sent a man to the Moon. This, combined with the associated proliferation of data, enables our devices to get “smarter,” as well as to make select information available to more centralized applications (such as Uber or Instacart) in a more efficient way.    Edge computing during coronavirus    What does this mean for emergency situations like the current pandemic? In times of crisis, the systems on which we depend are closely examined. Dangers test our preparedness, our ability to improvise and our capacity to act and think locally. Globalization through technology over the past few decades has led to an unprecedented level of interconnectivity, but with it has come a vast and complex chain of dependencies. The locus of control is unclear, and often too far from where the crisis occurs. A shock to the system puts pressure on the supply chain and reveals just how extensive and interwoven these dependencies are. Hidden vulnerabilities are revealed and there is no timely way to respond effectively.    A shock to the system puts pressure on the supply chain and reveals just how extensive and interwoven these dependencies are.    The spread of COVID-19 epitomizes this kind of shock. While the virus continues to multiply in waves around the world, the effects are being felt across industries. Consumer-facing businesses like restaurants shut down, leading to millions losing jobs; the effects are rippling through the financial and real estate sectors and beyond. A majority of the workers still employed are forced to work from home, many with children whose schools are also shut down, putting stress on telecom networks and delivery services.    Interdependencies    Chains of dependencies in our economic, financial, and technological systems were undermined long before the pandemic had spread globally. Things quickly spiraled out of control as everyone scrambled to understand the effects at both the micro and macro levels.      To deal with a crisis you need information, tools to analyze that information in real-time, and autonomy to act quickly as well as proactively. Edge computing strengthens the local nodes of a global network by providing them with better quality information at higher speeds, in addition to more independence in the decision-making that affects their own ecosystem.      See also: Jalak Jobanputra - The Central Bank Business Model Is Under Attack      Imagine if every town in every country had access to environmental sensors and location data that, combined with diagnostic data gleaned from other regions, could pinpoint where the next cases had a high probability of community spread. With up-to-date information and reliable communication of likely next steps and best practices, our businesses, families, and essential services would be able better to adapt and offset stress on our entire infrastructure.    Crisis response    As a complement to the cloud, edge computing provides improved strength and security in local networks around the world. These local infrastructures can relieve the pressure on – and provide more visibility into – the existing complex dependencies, and in turn make the wider system more dynamic, flexible and resilient. In a world utilizing edge computing, crisis response can be quicker, more informed, and, hopefully, more effective.      Five years ago, I argued the applications of this tech would prepare us not just for a crisis, but for a more connected world, too. A system like this relies on “the participation of everyone, of all races, in all corners of the world, for the most optimal and efficient global network. It is not only about the algorithm, it’s about what the algorithm collectively allows us, and our hearts and minds, to do.” While many people have discussed the way forward as a tradeoff between efficiency and resiliency, I believe we do not have to choose thanks to new technologies.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jalak Jobanputra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/10/how-edge-computing-can-make-us-more-resilient-in-a-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4865384a28c5092de1de21f61b502aa751f9f2f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Price Sags 7% Ahead of Easter Weekend,"Major cryptocurrency markets fell 7 percent over the past 24 hours, with bitcoin (BTC) retreating below $7,000.      While traditional stocks saw modest gains during early trading hours Friday, the crypto market shed more than $13 billion over the past 24 hours, according to Nomics. Most large-cap cryptos fell more than 8 percent in that time period, with BTC’s 6.8 percent dip being the only exception.      The sell-off appears to have begun early UTC Friday.      According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency fell from about $7,300 at 01:00 UTC Friday to just above $6,800 as of press time, losing nearly $500 over 14 hours.      “Given some of the abruptness of the overnight move, it suggests that some larger holders were inclined to take profits at these relatively favorable prices,” David Nuelle, managing director of Hehmeyer Trading + Investments, told CoinDesk. “Other than that, I don’t see anything that would precipitate the market move.”      Still, Nuelle called bitcoin’s recovery from mid-March lows of roughly $4,100 “pretty impressive.”      “With other markets closed and it being a U.S. holiday, the crypto markets are generally feeling less liquid,” CMS Holdings Partner Bobby Cho told CoinDesk. “I don’t see this being an issue with crypto fundamentals, rather, short-term market liquidity issues.”      Bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) lost the greatest portion of their value among the top 25 cryptos, falling 11 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively. However, both coins saw their respective halvings occur this week, which may have contributed to the price decline.      In contrast to the crypto markets, traditional stock markets capped largely positive weeks. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Index saw major gains in the last four days of trading (markets were closed Friday for the Easter holiday), despite the economic hit caused by record job losses.      The U.S. saw 10 percent of its workforce laid off over a three-week period as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

42404452,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDt0,1586532173,"Money Reimagined: As Tech, Politics and COVID-19 Collide, a Global Reset Looms","Money is a shared fiction. Our mechanism for storing and exchanging agreed-upon units of value, a tool so powerful wars are fought over it, springs entirely from our collective imagination.      Some might find that unnerving. The age-old desire to attach a currency’s value to something earthly, precious and finite is partly founded on a false hope that these tokens, in which we place such faith, have intrinsic value. It’s an understandable instinct, and there’s a strong gold standard argument for curtailing the sovereign’s power to debase people’s savings. But the sense of innate value is just a belief. As with people’s beliefs in other ephemeral concepts – in religion, for example, or in the concept of a nation – the ones most difficult to challenge are those fundamental to society. Indeed, one could argue that if everyone were to acknowledge that money is a fiction, it would cease to function.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      The imaginary nature of money is not a weakness, however; it’s a strength. As Israeli historian Yuval Harari, author of the seminal “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,” explains, our capacity to conceive of and commonly believe in stories is the primary reason why we humans rule the earth, instead of, say, the chimpanzees. It’s what enabled us to organize into communities and, ultimately, to build civilization. The modern world is a direct outcome of our capacity, not just to imagine, but to imagine together.      Now, as a terrifying pandemic forces a retreat from globalization and challenges the foundations of the international capitalist order, society could be in for one of its periodic narrative shifts, a sweeping reimagining of its core tenets. Our idea of money, which Harari describes as “the most successful story ever invented and told by humans,” could experience the most significant transformation of all.      Our money narrative was already gearing up for a new act, even before an omnipresent antagonist called COVID-19 was added to the cast of characters. That’s because an intense competition was underway to establish a programmable standard for digital currencies. This radical new model will replace banknotes with what author David Birch calls “e-cash” and enable software commands within a device-driven, peer-to-peer system of value exchange that bypasses gatekeeping banks.      The race was kick-started by the invention of bitcoin (BTC) 11 years ago. It now involves thousands of competitors. To start with, we users – individuals, businesses and governments – will be offered a much wider choice, as the world moves toward a multipolar, multi-currency structure.      Nonetheless, there will be fierce competition to establish dominant standards across multiple alternatives. It’s a diverse field, encompassing decentralized, standalone currencies such as bitcoin; decentralized, algorithmically managed “stablecoins” such as dai; reserve-backed stablecoins built on open, permissionless blockchains such as Circle and Coinbase, Paxos and Tether; new, privately defined stablecoins built on permissioned blockchains such as Facebook’s Libra; and, last but not least, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) such as China’s Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) system.      The stakes in this battle are high. On the line are the balance of geopolitical power, the public-versus-private boundaries of our economies and the value we place on transactional privacy.      The pandemic has given this all-in game even more urgency. As central banks flood the world with monetary stimulus, setting the stage for a more familiar “currency war” in which countries weaponize foreign exchange depreciation to give their industries an advantage over others, the dollar-centric international monetary system will come under stress. The Federal Reserve cannot indefinitely be the world’s lender of last resort for everything and everyone, not without undermining its independence and threatening global confidence in American leadership.      Meanwhile, the fallout from the crisis and the response to it have highlighted use cases for digital currencies that weren’t previously on people’s radars. Who would’ve thought, even as recently as February, that a digital dollar proposal would make its way into a March congressional bill as lawmakers grappled with how to get relief money directly and quickly into Americans’ hands? Meanwhile, fears over virus contagion appear to have accelerated the case for cashlessness as warnings rise over “germy money” and countries go so far as to burn or disinfect banknotes.      So, yes, a reimagining is coming – hence the choice of title for this brand new newsletter.    Umm, tell me about this bitcoin thing    In this section, we’ll employ data visualizations to explore how money is being reimagined. What better place to start than with CoinDesk’s own metrics on the content journey people take to understand cryptocurrency? In this case, we were interested to know whether, despite bitcoin’s sharp selloff during the first COVID-19 hit to financial markets, people are seeking to learn more about it in these uncertain times. So, we queried Google Analytics on page views for our Bitcoin 101 page. The result: this past Wednesday the page reached its highest daily view number since CoinDesk.com’s new site was launched in mid-November. Here’s its activity since March 1:      These data signals are preliminary. But along with a late-March spike in visits to Nik Custodio’s 2014 CoinDesk piece entitled “Still Don’t Get Bitcoin? Here’s an Explanation Even a Five-Year-Old Will Understand,” they hint that the chaos of the pandemic is reviving interest in crypto among CoinDesk’s “discovery” audience. This is nothing like the newcomer visits we saw during the 2017 crypto bubble. So far, greed, rather than fear, seems the bigger driver of mainstream curiosity. But while it’s painful to think large-scale adoption hinges on an event as horrible as this, perhaps people are this time motivated by deeper, more lasting interests.      Maybe they're asking about decentralized governance, data integrity, privacy, and whether bitcoin is truly “digital gold” – not simply, “How do I make a quick buck?”      Reimagining money is a collective exercise. There is no single author to the narrative. So, this newsletter will necessarily incorporate other voices. Here’s an unscientific survey of relevant stories and ideas.    The global town hall    What a difference a year makes. The Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements, which provides banking services to central banks and issues research reports and policy recommendations, has gone from dismissing CBDCs as pointless to all-out advocacy. In March last year, BIS Chief Agustin Carstens said central banks were “not seeing the value” in the technology. But in August – notably, following digital currency announcements from Facebook’s Libra and the People’s Bank of China – he said CBDCs would be coming “sooner than we think.” At that time, the BIS formed its Innovation Hub and five months later named Benoît Cœuré, a former heavy hitter on the European Central Bank’s executive board, as its leader. Come January, it released a survey of 66 central banks, finding that 80 percent were studying digital currencies and 10 percent were close to issuing them. Now, per an April 3 bulletin, BIS researchers have pronounced that people’s changing relationship with cash during the COVID-19 pandemic would further accelerate the rollout.      How to explain a centuries-in-the-making monetary shift to your grandmother? Conveying this complex concept to the world at large requires combining big, scholarly thinking with accessible, easy-to-digest content. So it’s pleasing to see The Conversation diving into this topic. Backed by an international alliance of universities, the site lives up to its “Academic rigor, journalistic flair” tagline. A Dec. 12 piece entitled “When China and other big countries launch cryptocurrencies, it will kick off a global revolution,” remains highly relevant and readable even though it preceded COVID-19. Its author, Liang Zhao, of Lund University, writes, “While technological change has been incredibly fast in the information era, the system of international payments has lagged behind. But once sovereign digital currencies start taking off, this will suddenly change. Just like smartphones quickly eliminated most old cellphones, no countries will be able to reject blockchain payments for long.”      How will the world’s 1.7 billion “unbanked” fare during COVID-19 lockdowns? Now that virtually all commerce has moved online, people without access to bank accounts are especially vulnerable. As Aaron Klein of the Brooking Institution notes, there’s “a big problem for the coronavirus economy: The internet doesn’t take cash.” The challenge is not just in Africa, Latin America or Asia; it’s in the U.S., where one in 14 households are without a bank account, according to the FDIC. Such families use prepaid cards, which charge high transaction and balance-checking fees and require them to “preposition funds” whereas those of us with credit cards don’t have to. With millions suddenly thrust into unemployment and already struggling to get access to food, the costs of an outdated, pre-digital world of finance are about to become even more burdensome for the poor. It’s for them that this revolution must be fought.      ""The Currency Cold War: Cash and Cryptography, Hash Rates and Hegemony."" Slated for release in May, this book is about as timely as one can get. David Birch, a prolific author on topics of money and identity, and a consultant and prominent speaker on the fintech circuit, has delivered a detailed, rich analysis of the global competition to define electronic money and what it means for our lives. (Disclosure: I wrote the book’s foreword.) Outlining the convergence of cryptography, smartphone technology, identity authentication tools, and digital assets, The Currency Cold War is an indispensable guide to the future of money. (BTW, Dave will discuss these topics during our Consensus: Distributed virtual event on Monday May 11, when he’ll join other leading thinkers in a special livecast “Money Reimagined” online session that I’ll host.)

42404440,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDhC,1586527201,Factom's Two Employees Press On Despite Investor's Call to Liquidate,"After years of being unable to close a Series B, enterprise blockchain company Factom, Inc. slashed its staff from 10 to just two.      The company isn’t going into receivership, however, as its investor, FastForward Innovations, claimed last week, said Factom COO Jay Smith.      “They’ll be putting out a correction,” said Smith. “This has been a long-running argument between us and FastForward.”      FastForward did not respond to multiple requests for comment.      FastForward had been pressuring Factom to put a resolution before Factom’s board of directors to have the company go into receivership. Smith said he put the resolution forward knowing that the board would vote “no” on it. He claims FastForward jumped the gun in issuing a press release.      Read more: Factom Inc. 'Faces Liquidation' After Investors Refuse Request for More Funding      “There was a miscommunication and FastForward heard that we were going to put this proposal to the shareholders,” Smith said. “Because they’re a public company, anything that has a significant impact on the valuation, they have timelines to publish that. They printed out the press release, and we didn’t get a chance to see it. … There wasn’t any malicious intent on anybody’s part.”      Aside from Smith, only CEO Paul Snow is employed full time by the company. Six employees were retained as contractors.      The firm says it is now renegotiating the financial engineering of the Series B fund raising, proposing solutions such as having FastForward’s note be converted into common stock once the raise reaches a high-enough threshold. Smith said the amount of control FastForward had in Factom was scaring off other investors.      Government contracts    Founded in 2014, Factom conducted one of the earliest token offerings, raising $1.1 million in 2015 by selling “factoid” tokens. Users don’t have to touch factoids, however, to use the Factom protocol, which is separate from Factom, Inc. and decentralized among 27 different authority node operators (ANOs). The protocol is often used for recording data.      Currently, Factom, Inc. makes most of its money from contracting its services with the U.S Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other entities. For DHS, Factom’s technology secures data from Border Patrol cameras and sensors. Factom is also part of a project securing data from the national power grid for the U.S. Energy Department.      Despite these high-profile contracts, the company didn’t have the cash flow to be able to survive the market downturn without cuts, Smith said.      After the news of Factom’s alleged receivership broke, DHS called a meeting with the blockchain company to ensure its project would continue, according to Smith. Factom expects to receive three more contracts with DHS for around $200,000 each, Smith added.      Read more: Factom Blockchain Project Wins Grant to Protect US Border Patrol Data      While the recent market downturn has slowed Factom’s pipeline of projects, Smith said the crisis has a silver lining.      “The pandemic has pointed out a lot of problems with the supply chain that we’re a pretty good solution to,” he said.      One former Factom employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity claimed leadership changes at the company made it an unexciting investment opportunity. Peter Kirby replaced Paul Snow as CEO in 2015 and Snow then “took back the reins” in 2017 as chief executive for the second time. Snow said the changes probably cause “a bit of disruption” but weren’t the toughest issue the company faced.      Snow said the most difficult obstacle for Factom was its inability to break into the mortgage market. It had avoided titling, which is complex and focused on loan origination. However, “The longer it took to put solutions in place, the more the status quo established itself and proved to be too expensive to enter the market,” Snow said.    Future plans    Factom plans to focus on data integrity and data organization, which Snow said will be critical for supply chain and internet-of-things security. The company plans to unveil tools for managing data on its blockchain protocol in the future.      Regardless of what happens to Factom, Inc., however, the Factom protocol will live on because of its decentralized nature, Snow said.      Read more: UK Banking Pilot Aims to Streamline Compliance Using Factom Blockchain      “The protocol is going to run whether Factom, Inc. continues or if we get reorganized or if we find an eleventh-hour investment,” Smith said.      Other authority node operators (ANOs) on the protocol agree with him.      “Factom, Inc. hasn’t accomplished much in a long time,” David Chapman, CEO of ANO Factomize, said. “Most people that have been following the Factom Protocol closely are banking on other [ANOs] delivering.”      UPDATE (April 10, 23:14 UTC): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Factom's DHS contracts were worth $600,000 each.

Research out Friday shows profit made through cryptocurrency scams has dropped considerably since the start of the year. On a seven-day moving average, revenue earned by scammers plummeted from $800,000 worth of crypto in the middle of January to below $300,000 at the beginning of April – almost entirely due to the dramatic market drop earlier this year.      Researchers initially thought the coronavirus might make people less susceptible to scams. But they found that just as many people were being affected.

See also: How Imposters Scam Entrepreneurs Out of Their Crypto      What Chainalysis concluded was that the major sell-off in cryptocurrencies sparked by the coronavirus – total market cap fell by $100 billion in mid-March, according to CoinGecko – had a knock-on effect on scammers' revenue.      ""We believe scammers are still receiving those same payments from roughly the same number of victims per month. The payments are just worth less now due to cryptocurrency price drops,"" Chainalysis said in its report.      ""In short, while COVID-19 is providing phishing and blackmail scammers with new fraudulent stories to entice victims, the cryptocurrency price drops spurred by the pandemic have drastically reduced the revenue of the Ponzi schemes and investment scams that make up most cryptocurrency scamming activity.""

42404457,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDuy,1586516646,"First Mover: As Fed Assets Top $6T, BitMEX Has Some Inflation-Busting Advice","Bitcoin (BTC) has been relatively stable in recent days, pausing after a powerful rally that saw prices nearly double in under a month.      What hasn't paused is the Federal Reserve's money machine: A report late Thursday showed the U.S. central bank's total assets surged this week above $6 trillion for the first time in its 107-year history.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Just since the start of 2020, the Fed's balance sheet has increased by nearly $2 trillion, swollen by self-funded purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, mortgage bonds and corporate bonds. Wall Street dealers are taking out emergency loans, companies are issuing bonds directly to the Fed and other central banks have now borrowed $385.4 billion of dollars to smooth out swings in foreign-exchange markets.      The liquidity injections – part of the efforts by authorities around the world to mitigate the economic damage from the novel coronavirus – haven't gone unnoticed in cryptocurrency markets. Some investors and analysts see bitcoin as a useful hedge against inflation because supplies of the cryptocurrency are strictly governed by computer-programming code written 11 years ago when the underlying blockchain network was launched.      And there's little expectation the human-managed Fed's money machine will stop whirring anytime soon.      A report Thursday from the U.S. Labor Department showed unemployment continued to surge last week, with jobless claims numbering 17 million over the past three weeks alone. The dismal reports portend rising U.S. government costs, even as tax revenue shrinks due to the loss of economic activity. More sales of Treasury bonds will be needed to cover the swelling budget deficits.      The Fed separately announced $2.3 trillion of emergency funds, including junk-bond purchases and loans to state governments. There's also financing for a type of instrument called ""collateralized loan obligations,"" which are the small business loan equivalent of the toxic mortgage-backed debt that helped to cause the 2008 financial crisis.      Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted Thursday in a speech the decision to open the money spigot came after ""essential"" financial markets ""had begun to sink into dysfunction."" The emergency programs will continue to be deployed ""forcefully, proactively and aggressively,"" he said.      Enter Arthur Hayes, a prominent figure in the crypto industry because he's CEO of BitMEX, one of the largest exchanges for trading bitcoin futures contracts. Traders can use the derivatives to bet on bitcoin in amounts 100 times their initial deposits. Liquidations are common, according to the website Rekto.      On Thursday, Hayes wrote a company blog post predicting governments are set to ""embark on the greatest fiscal stimulus binge the world has ever seen.""      Because unemployment will be so high, tax revenue won't be sufficient to cover the budget outlays, he predicted.      ""It will not be paid for by tax receipts,"" he wrote. ""It will be paid for by the printing press,"" and at that point, inflation becomes a forgone conclusion.      ""Can the hipsters handle a $40 smashed avo toast?"" Hayes wrote.      Ready to guess where this is going?      ""There are only two things to own during the transition to whatever the new system is, and that is gold and bitcoin,"" according to Hayes.      In crypto markets, this is the view from the top.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $6,900 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $7,390 | 24-Hr Low: $6,881      Trend: Bitcoin is on offer this Good Friday, having failed to put in a positive performance Thursday despite a rally in the stock markets.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading around $6,900 at press time, representing a 6 percent decrease on the day.      Buyers remained on the sideline, even though the U.S. stock markets cheered Federal Reserve’s latest stimulus program.      The S&P 500, Wall Street’s equity index, rose 1.45 percent as Fed’s now $2.3 trillion ""bazooka"" overshadowed the daunting weekly employment figures. The U.S. dollar took a beating in the foreign exchange market and against gold.      Bitcoin, however, remains in a tight range and has traded in the red so far today. Some analysts are citing profit taking as the reason for the cryptocurrency’s lackluster response to the Fed stimulus. That could be the case, as the cryptocurrency rallied by more than 90 percent from $3,867 to $7,450 in the 3.5-weeks to April 7. Such strong rallies are usually followed by profit taking or temporary price pullbacks.      From a technical perspective, Thursday's bullish outlook stands neutralized, as sellers have violated support at the trendline connecting the March 13 and March 20 lows. Further, the cryptocurrency has fallen back below the three-day chart's 200-period average at $7,100, weakening the case for a quick rally toward $8,000.      That said, bitcoin's bias would turn bearish only if prices find acceptance under $6,773 – the low of a bullish marubozu candle created on April 6. To revive the bull case, prices need to end the day above $7,300.      First Mover is CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter.

The firm said in an announcement on Friday that the deal, brokered by BitOoda Digital, proceeded the sale of 106,000 terahashes per second (TH/s) of bitcoin mining power to undisclosed buyers consisting of hedge funds and family offices.      The sale was enabled through the execution of BitOoda's hash contracts, which allow institutional buyers to get exposure to bitcoin mining without having to go through the process of purchasing and setting up equipment.      At the Bitcoin network's current mining competition level, 1 TH/s of computing power would be able to produce about 0.00001709 BTC in a day. As such, the deal would give the buyers a daily yield of about 1.8 BTC – worth around $13,000 – in addition to having the corresponding hardware pledged as collaterals.      Read more: A New York Power Plant Is Mining $50K Worth of Bitcoin a Day      That said, with the Bitcoin network's halving event approaching in about 30 days, the total newly minted BTC in 24 hours will be reduced from right now around 1800 units to 900 after mid-May.      Greenidge said in the announcement it benefits from locking in profits and receiving an upfront source of capital to continue expanding its operations. The firm declined to disclose the amount earned in the deal. But major bitcoin miner manufacturers have been recently advertising around $23 per TH/s for several of their newest machines.      “Providing the same kind of time-tested hedging capabilities seen in traditional commodity markets, such product brings the benefits of clean and energy-efficient bitcoin mining from Greenidge to institutional investors throughout the United States,” Greenidge CFO Tim Rainey said in the announcement.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      In early March, it was reported Greenidge was producing on average 5.5 BTC a day by utilizing 14 megawatts of its total 106 megawatts capacity.      The Bitcoin network's total hashrate back then was around 118 million TH/s on average, which means the firm possessed roughly 357,000 TH/s of computing power at the time.

42404456,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDp4,1586480927,Bitcoin SV's First Halving Crimps Profits for BSV Miners,"Bitcoin SV, the network that split off from the Bitcoin Cash blockchain in late 2018, has cut its miners’ block reward in half for the first time.      Miners on the network produced the 630,000th block around 00:50 UTC time on Friday, which, by design, triggered the halving event that reduced mining rewards from 12.5 BSV to 6.25 per block.      BSV is now trading at $214 as of press time, for a market capitalization of $3.9 billion, making the network the market's sixth largest cryptocurrency. It's down 5.4 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk's price index.      The halving means the daily output for newly mined BSV is now around 900 units, which, at BSV's current price, means the pie of block rewards miners can compete over totals about $200,000 a day.      The total computing power racing on Bitcoin SV has declined by some 25 percent since a recent high around four exahashes per second (EH/s) in early February, following BSV's price plunge from $370 to $110 within a month. The price had bounced back to over $200 over the past several weeks.      The halving event came just a day after the same milestone for Bitcoin Cash, which broke off the Bitcoin network following a heated community disagreement in 2017. Miners on the Bitcoin SV network may face the same profitability issue as those on Bitcoin Cash.      Following Bitcoin Cash's halving Wednesday, the hashing power on the network has dropped from around 3.5 EH/s to 2.5 EH/s. It took miners about 100 minutes to mine the first block after the Wednesday halving, while the average block production time is designed to be 10 minutes.      This week marked the first halvings for the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV networks since their births in 2017 and 2018, respectively.      Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap with currently 105 EH/s of computing power, is around 35 days away from its programmed halving, which will be the third in its history and one of the most anticipated events of 2020.
