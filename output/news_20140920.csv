42377659,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gnx,1411238120,24 Signs You're Obsessed with Bitcoin,"It’s hard not to be captivated by bitcoin.  So many things about the digital currency are novel and the technology of the block chain is so complex that many who become acquainted with bitcoin eventually end up enthralled.  Add in the element of drama that seems to follow bitcoin like a shadow – bankrupt exchanges, arrests, regulatory debate and a polarizing reputation – and the story of this once-esoteric invention becomes even more fascinating.  We bitcoiners lead a peculiar lifestyle. As early adopters of an unprecedented technology, we’re arguably a part of history as we help shape this blossoming industry. We learn new things every day and are fueled by the seemingly endless opportunities this technology has created for innovators.  On the other hand, living with a bitcoin obsession is often an uphill battle. We’re forced to deal with price volatility, skeptical friends and family, regulatory uncertainty and all the other speed bumps that are par for the course for any new technology.  Despite the adversity, the bitcoin community – like the technology – has been impressively resilient. We all have an idiosyncratic passion for bitcoin, and thus we may have more in common than you’d expect.  Here are 24 signs you’re obsessed with bitcoin:  1. You check the price within five minutes of waking up  2. Your friends have been forced to sit through your spiels about all the joys of the digital currency  3. You keep a hawk-like eye out for 'bitcoin accepted here' signs    4. You’ve rehearsed your speech in defense of bitcoin, just in case you ever run into any skeptics  5. You feel a sense of pride whenever you convince someone to embrace digital currencies  6. You daydream about what life will be like once you can use bitcoin to buy everything you need  7. You double (okay, triple) check all of your wallets on a more-than-consistent basis… just to be sure  8. You’re not fazed by price swings anymore, and ‘bad news’ no longer sets you off in an immediate panic  9. The words ‘Mt Gox’ make you physically cringe  10. /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org have become your social networks of choice  11. Whenever bitcoin is brought up, your friends roll their eyes and brace themselves for you to jump into the conversation  12. You go out of your way to shop at Overstock, Newegg, Expedia etc to support their bitcoin business  13. You thoroughly research every new startup to see if they add enough value to earn your support  14. You’ve been to at least one bitcoin conference        15. You scoff at the idea of using Western Union to send money abroad    16. You’ll interrupt someone else’s conversation to correct them if you hear anything inaccurate being said about bitcoin  17. You set aside money every paycheck to buy more bitcoin  18. You’ve bought something you didn’t need simply because you could purchase it with bitcoin  19. You tried out several different wallets/storage methods before settling on your preferred option  20. You’ve done the math to see how economically feasible it would be to set up your own mining rig  21. You felt personally attacked by Leah McGrath Goodman’s exposé on Dorian Nakamoto  22.

42377658,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gmh,1411233611,Dogecoin Advocate Travels Ohio River Supported by Community Tips,"Dogecoin tipping has become a kind of social activity within the digital currency community, making the currency as much a form of expression as a medium of exchange. As evidenced by even a cursory glance at the dogecoin subreddit or community forums, many of those who use the meme-themed currency often donate more than they actually spend in the traditional sense.  The DOGEhio River Adventure is, in part, a test to see just how far one person can go with the power of donated dogecoins. For Erik Barnum, this means undertaking a serious challenge: navigating the Ohio River with only his wits, his canoe and the support of the community.  Barnum provides regular updates on social media, including the project’s dedicated Facebook page, and posts on the dogecoin subreddit. The trip down the Ohio is entirely funded by dogecoin donations and is an experiment to see how digital currency can support real-world efforts through social tipping. For some, this function is one of the altcoin's chief use cases.  Barnum said that the project is a way for him to demonstrate the collective power of the people in the dogecoin community. At the same time, he said the initiative is also about trying to live life to the fullest by going into the unexpected – with a little help from some digital currency.  He told CoinDesk:  “I intend to showcase the strength of the dogecoin community, the value of dogecoin as a currency, the ease of turning Doge to cash armed with only a cell phone, and make a great doge-cumentary about my survival. I also hope to make a bunch of new friends while spreading awareness for adventure.”  Barnum, who goes by the name RiverDoge online and has earned the support of many in the dogecoin community, said that the adventure hasn’t always been easy. But thanks to the support of those who believe in him and a little inspiration from the currency itself, Barnum called the project an adventure that “may never stop”.  Origin of a DOGE adventure  Barnum originally got into dogecoin after mining litecoin with a friend and fellow mining enthusiast. Calling himself an early adopter, he said that he benefited from the altcoin’s rise and, as a result, feels a need to give back and help promote it as best he can.  Prior to embarking on his journey, Barnum worked as a manager at a cell phone store. He said he was “married” to the position and was looking for a way to break out of it. During this time he became involved with dogecoin and began forming ideas about how dogecoin can serve as a vehicle for social commerce and digital value exchange.  Adding that dogecoin could be the future of crowdsourcing art and social initiatives, Barnum told CoinDesk that eventually he knew he had to fully commit to promoting dogecoin through some way.  Barnum explained:  “Quitting a job I began to hate, for an adventure I love was the best decision of my entire life. I could go on and on but I will end by saying if you hate your job, quit! Go on an adventure. If you do it for dogecoin you will not only survive, but you will live well.”  In the wild lands  The Ohio River is a 981 mile-long river that cuts a line through six US states. Stretching from Pennsylvania to Illinois, the Ohio is one of the longest rivers in the country, and the Ohio River Basin is home to 10% of the US population.  According to Barnum, life outdoors hasn’t always been easy. He told CoinDesk a recent experience resulting from exposure to poison ivy was probably the worst part of the trip so far considering the unfortunate circumstances.  “I will spare you the details,” he joked.  Barnum said that one of the best aspects of his journey thus far has been the addition of another to his adventure party. Saying that “he is not an imaginary friend like Wilson”, Barnum explained that he met a fellow river-traveler named Marc who joined his dogecoin-powered adventure after a fateful lunch.  He added that the dogecoin community quickly took to the new companion, dubbing him Yoda for his “esoteric quotes” and sense of humor. For Barnum and his project, this was a big step forward and the journey was changed for the better.  He told CoinDesk:  “After some conversation and eating lunch together, we decided to tie his kayak to the back of my canoe and paddle together. We have been paddling together ever since. The journey was fun solo, but the journeys and adventures have exponentially increased after meeting Yoda.”  To far off places  When asked where he’ll go after he’s finished navigating the Ohio, which empties into the Mississippi River and traces a long line south across North America to the Gulf of Mexico, Barnum said he has no plans to stop.  Saying the ultimate goal is “spreading the doge to new markets”, Barnum suggested that the adventure would arguably continue as long as the community is still around – not to mention the altcoin itself.  Barnum explained:  “I will probably continue paddling down the Mississippi until I hit the Gulf of Mexico. Then peel around South America and hit Brazil. Hopefully at that point I have enough dogecoin to fly to Asia to walk the great wall of China. From there I plan to buy a sailboat with a dogecoin sail, and work on my next album as I sail to Europe.”  This, he joked, would get him as far as next year. While one could argue that the moon might be an appropriate stop after that, Barnum was sure that his DOGE-powered journey had no end in sight.  “This adventure may never stop,” he said.

42377653,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72ggP,1411206927,Cryptocurrency Miners Turn to Exotic Cooling Systems as Competition Heats Up,"Amid Singapore's humid equatorial heat, a group of researchers and faculty at the island's main technical education institute are sweating over an unconventional cooling solution – for litecoin miners.  The institute, known more for strait-laced vocational courses, has partnered with litecoin startup CloudMining.sg to develop a liquid immersion cooling system for the firm's miners, in conjunction with materials science giant 3M.  Neal Blackburn, who runs business development for the startup, said:  ""[Other universities] we approached weren't comfortable enough to take this on as a project. With the Institute of Technical Education, they want commercialised research, we were signing the paperwork in 48 hours.""  No wonder the institute jumped at the project. Its goal is to build a ""beach cooler"" sized module containing an exotic cooling fluid from 3M that quickly dissipates heat. Circuit boards for litecoin mining are submerged directly into the liquid, resulting in energy cost savings of 96%, said Blackburn.  Exotic cooling provides an edge  Miners in the cryptocurrency world are locked in a zero-sum game to discover new blocks. As competition intensifies, miners must find an increasingly elusive edge to beat their rivals. To do this, they're now turning to expensive and specialised cooling systems that were once the exclusive preserve of cutting-edge research laboratories and military installations.  According to Michael Bedford Taylor, director of the Center for Dark Silicon at the University of California, San Diego, liquid immersion cooling is currently ""extremely rare"" in general-purpose data centres, but it could become a common sight in bitcoin mining installations.  ""I can't name any current machines that do immersion cooling [...] I think it's a great possibility [for the bitcoin mining industry],"" he said.  Firms supplying liquid immersion cooling technology and services have reported a spike in enquiries from bitcoin miners.  3M, for example, produces a liquid called Novec that is used to cool circuit boards directly. This means the boards are submerged in the liquid, typically in an 'open bath' system, where they lie uncovered, for easy access.  Michael Garceau, who sells Novec to data centres on behalf of 3M, told CoinDesk:  ""Enquiries have grown exponentially, and sales have grown as well. We're seeing a transition [of bitcoin mining] to an industrial scale now.""  ASICMiner in Hong Kong uses a famously documented Novec system, while CoinTerra has said that it's considering an immersion-based system too.  Different immersion systems  The 3M liquid works by changing from liquid to vapour at a very low boiling point, typically 49 degrees Celsius. As the submerged electronics generate heat, the liquid heats up and evaporates. The vapour rises into a condenser, cools down and then returns to the tank as liquid.  The chief competitor to Novec-based systems is liquid cooling using mineral oil.  Green Revolution Cooling  (GRC), a firm based in Austin, Texas, sets up oil-based systems and counts the United States Air Force, the Department of Defense and the Tokyo Institute of Technology among its customers. It calls its immersion-cooling technology the 'CarnotJet system' (see image at top).  While similar in principle, oil immersion cooling is slightly more complex than Novec-filled systems.  The circuit boards are submerged in an oil-based coolant, as with Novec, but the oil has to be circulated with a pump to remove heat. The oil travels to a heat exchanger, where heat is transferred to water-filled pipes that ultimately connect to a cooling tower, located somewhere outside the building. The cooling tower then dispels the heat into the air.  Moore's Law and miners  Bedford Taylor says chips used in bitcoin mining are now so advanced that they are hitting the limits of semiconductor fabrication, as set out by the famous dictum, Moore's Law.  Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every two years. Transistor counts on a chip are determined by the chip fabrication process. As process technology improves, it shrinks the size of the elements on a chip, allowing more transistors to be arranged on one chip.  The size of transistors on a chip is measured in nanometres. According to the UCSD's Bedford Taylor, chips used in miners are now using the smallest transistors that can be fabricated.  He said:  ""Bitcoin mining chips are now in the most advanced technology nodes of Moore's Law: 20nm and 20nm. The first chips were in 130nm, a relatively old process.""  Bespoke chips and dark silicon  In a paper studying the progress of chips used in bitcoin mining, Bedford Taylor concludes that technological advancement in the area has been ""amazingly fast"" in the face of increasing difficulty. He describes four generations of bitcoin mining chips, starting at regular CPUs and ending with the ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that miners currently use.  The current generation of mining chips represent the first examples of a new era of ""bespoke silicon"" – custom-made chips produced in relatively small batches for a specific purpose – Bedford Taylor argues in a 2013 paper.  ""The latest round of hardware – dedicated ASICs – have been financed, developed and deployed by bitcoin users, which is perhaps an unprecedented event in recent history. One question is whether this model can scale to other application areas and usher in a new era of bespoke silicon,"" he wrote.  Bedford Taylor was one of the authors of a paper that described a phenomenon known as 'dark silicon'.  The dark silicon problem says that, as transistor counts on chips increase, the portion of the chip that is actually utilised, given the the chip's power constraints, drops exponentially. As a result, a portion of the chip remains without power – the dark silicon – and is not utilised.  The researcher said that some bitcoin miners have been advancing so rapidly that dark silicon is already an issue and performance has been reduced as a result.  When immersion cooling makes sense  So if liquid immersion is so effective at cooling these chips that are being pushed to the limits of current technology, why aren't all miners using it? It turns out that immersion cooling systems only make sense when miners face certain constraints.  As Brandon Moore of GRC notes, three factors drive adoption of immersion cooling systems: expensive electricity, expensive real estate and the absence of a legacy cooling system.  ""If they've got expensive power, are space constrained and don't have a cooling infrastructure in place already, then I can come in. Hook up a cooling tower and we're done,"" he said.  Garceau of 3M agrees with Moore's assessment, although he notes that the bitcoin miners he has spoken to are increasingly interested in optimising their installations even without physical or monetary constraints.  He said:  ""If you have real-estate constraints, if you have high cost of energy, then the economics get better. But bitcoin miners are looking for the best economics they can get all round.""  Costs and benefits  Immersion cooling can slash running costs. Allied Control – a Hong Kong-based company that set up ASICMiner's much talked about mining installation in that city, – claims that its Novec-based cooling system saved the miner more than 90% of its electricity consumption. Green Revolution Cooling, meanwhile, claims to cut running costs in half with its oil-based cooling system.  Even with the potential savings, immersion cooling remains expensive. For a conventional data centre, 3M estimates that the cost of using its Novec product can rise to 25% of the cost of the hardware that it's cooling. The firm claims that bitcoin miners, however, operate such high density servers that fluid costs of 2%–5% of hardware are possible.  Research firm IHS finds that special cooling fluids are about five times more expensive than a traditional chilled-water system.  Is the future containerised?  As immersion cooling gains traction, mining farms may take on even more outlandish forms. Both GRC and Allied Control are offering 'containerised' solutions for miners who might want to take advantage of, say, a plum location near a hydroelectric dam.  Green Revolution Cooling can build its CarnoJet system inside a 40-foot shipping container, which it promises is 'plug and play'. Allied Control, meanwhile, touts its DataTank modules, which offers remote, high-definition security cameras as an option.  GRC's Moore said:  ""Not everyone can mine in the Arctic, so if you don't have that luxury, a solution like ours makes sense. You can be efficient anywhere in the world, whether you're in the Amazon or Canada.""  Air cooling remains dominant  Bitcoin mining enterprises may be buying cooling fluids by the litre now, but they remain an oddity to the vast majority of data centres. Almost all existing data centres rely on air-cooling systems, as they remain cheaper to run, less complex to manage and more widely available.  According to research firm IHS, liquid cooling accounts for less than 1% of the data centre cooling market. However, the firm also found that demand for liquid-cooling systems is growing, driven by rising energy costs and the emergence of high-performance data centres. For the likes of 3M and GRC, that's a trend to keep an eye on.  As GRC's Moore says:  ""Bitcoin miners are almost like kids with a magnifying glass over an ant mound: they're burning up hardware and pushing it to the limit as fast as they can. When you're cooling your equipment on shelves with box-fans, there's only so much you can do.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | COMMODITY | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/20/cryptocurrency-miners-turn-to-exotic-cooling-systems-as-competition-heats-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46dc58c7ff179996b6f869b2352fdafaade3ff1f-675x450.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
