42403605,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgNMP,1574892133,Upbit Is the Seventh Major Crypto Exchange Hack of 2019,"The recent Upbit hack is a stark reminder of the danger of storing your crypto on an exchange. We explored seven major hacks that happened this year, each one bolder than the last. The lesson? Not your keys, not your crypto.      Cryptopia went dark on Jan. 15 after it discovered a “security breach” with “significant losses.” It stayed dark, and mostly silent, through the rest of January and deep into February. The site claimed it could not comment during the police investigation of the estimated $16 million hack.      It is not clear how Cryptopia was hacked, but investigators discovered in August that Cryptopia had been pooling users’ funds in a catchall wallet. The New Zealand exchange tried to right its ship after the hack and even briefly reopened trading services in March. But the revival was not meant to be: the exchange went into liquidation in May and 10 days later filed for bankruptcy.      DragonEx of Singapore lost an “undisclosed” amount of user funds in a March 24 hack. It initially declined to estimate how much but days later it revealed over telegram that it lost $7 million in the security breach. DragonEx did not appear to promise users a full refund, as other exchanges generally did in 2019. Instead, it said it was working on a “preliminary compensation plan” that would reimburse victims’ lost funds in Tether or Dragon Token equivalent.            Hackers targeted Bithumb in March for $13 million of EOS and the South Korean exchange later learned it was missing $6.2 million in XRP. The heist came less than a year after another massive hack: $31 million in late 2018. Bithumb suspects that the hack was an inside job as it spotted an “abnormal withdrawal” from one of its wallets. The exchange claims it lost no user funds in the hack.      Hackers stole a massive 7,000 bitcoin haul worth some $40.7 million from Binance in May. The world’s largest exchange by volume found a vulnerability in its hot wallet, though it claims that only 2 percent of total funds were in that wallet at the time of the hack. Funds quickly moved through a network of smaller and smaller wallets as hackers tried to wash their stolen coins. Some of the funds were eventually turned into fiat. In response, Binance shuttered deposit and withdrawal services for a week to beef up security protocols. The exchange reopened services on May 15. It pledged to refund users from its emergency fund.      Singapore’s BiTrue exchange lost $4.2 million of its users’ funds in June. Hackers targeted XRP ($4.01 million) and ADA ($231,800) in a breach that exploited BiTrue’s internal user access review process. Using what they learned, the hackers then transferred 9.3 million XRP and 2.5 million ADA into different exchanges. BiTrue says it worked with partner exchanges to freeze those funds and further promised to refund all users affected.      Japanese exchange Bitpoint lost $28 million in a July hack that hit 50,000 users. It is not known how the hackers breached Bitpoint’s security, though it forced Bitpoint to halt trading for a month. Soon after the hack, Bitpoint’s parent company, Remixpoint, promised to reimburse affected users. Trading in Bitpoint’s five supported cryptos (bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin and XRP) started up again in August.      Upbit is the latest hacking victim after losing $49 million at 9:00 UTC on November 26, 2019. An ""abnormal transaction"" resulted in a 342,000 ether loss in a few minutes. The exchange said that the loss didn't come from user funds and that it has suspended all functions for at least two weeks.      As the year winds down, these hacks represent the massive - and precarious - risks exchanges and users take with their private and public wallets. What will 2020 bring? Here's hoping for fewer losses from fewer big names in the crypto ecosystem.

Such restrictions create widespread ripple effects, since many Lebanese businesses manage imports with dollars rather than the inflationary lira.      “We are slowly running out of imported items and goods,” said the Beirut trader, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity for his personal safety.      “The local butcher didn’t buy meat today because he can’t increase [lira] prices, so he’d rather not get any,” he said, sending photos of nearly empty supermarket shelves.      In that context, remittances are a lifeline, including those sent in crypto.      “I believe bitcoin is helpful, especially for expats looking to send money to help family in Lebanon. I’ve actually been getting a few calls about that today,” another bitcoiner in Beirut said, noting he helped up to 35 families do so this month, with each transaction worth more than $10,000 in bitcoin.      That represents roughly a 20 percent increase from his usual volume. Unlike other traders, this bitcoiner doesn’t accept fiat or local payments for his services – in part, he said, because his Lebanese credit card has been limited to $200 of spending a day. So he charges a small premium in bitcoin and has a network of people who distribute dollars to families in return. Most businesses remain ""operational,"" thanks to a ""creative ways to ensure the circulation of money,"" he said.      A third Lebanese bitcoin trader in Byblos said his customer base went from roughly 30 people a month, converting bitcoin remittances from abroad to dollars, to 200 people this past month.      He estimated up to $6,000 worth of bitcoin flowed into Lebanon through his deals alone, and he is one of four liquidity providers in Byblos. There’s also been an increase in customers seeking bitcoin to send abroad.      “It’s working. It’s sufficient,” he said. “It’s serving many businesses. They are sending money abroad to receive merchandise. One of my clients sent $100,000 (worth of bitcoin) to get his container from Saudi, he exports energy drinks.”    Family Ties    No one is claiming that bitcoin alone can “fix” Lebanon’s problems, popular Twitter memes notwithstanding. Rather, it’s a tool that can be used to bolster resources like family networks that have also made a difference.      “We are a family-oriented culture, so we support each other,” said the first Beirut trader. “I guess you could call it pooling. Anyone contributes as they can, but it’s obvious that people are on a budget and not spending on luxury or entertainment.”      More shopkeepers in Lebanon are keeping paper ledgers of credit for local families, several on-the-ground sources said. This was already an established custom in some cases, but it’s more common in times like these.      “A local supermarket will have a small book that will say, for example, ‘my family lives in this apartment and has been shopping there at the market for the past 10 years,’” said a fourth Lebanese trader, who is currently living abroad.      Meanwhile, his peer in Beirut said he feels the personal risks to bitcoiners are higher these days due to misinformation and political rivalries.      Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah paints economic protesters as political groups “exploited by foreign powers,” which the Beirut-based bitcoiner said stokes animosity and increases violence within the community.      Since bitcoin is often associated with anti-government protests, by nature of its cypherpunk origins, this requires word-of-mouth education to show bitcoin is an apolitical asset, not a foreign get-rich-quick scheme, he said.      “I think if everyone took the time to educate their family and surrounding [community]...the world might be a better place,” the Beirut trader said. “Bitcoiners should help with [education], not saying that bitcoin will make your rich...but why it works and how it can work for us.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/27/lebanese-bitcoiners-show-how-to-talk-about-crypto-at-thanksgiving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/483a1fb68d1c952b12037b4bf8bc0206a27e13d6-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Minister of state for electronics and IT (MeitY) Sanjay Dhotre said Wednesday that the government is drafting an approach paper on the National Level Blockchain Framework which discusses the potential for distributed ledger technology and the need for a shared infrastructure for different use cases.      Dhotre made the announcement in a letter addressing questions about blockchain from members of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament.      In particular, MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma asked whether the government had encouraged and conducted research into potential uses for blockchain technologies, and if so what the outcome of this research is.      In response, Dhotre wrote, “MeitY has identified Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security and so on.”      According to the letter, the Indian government has already built the Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology, a project that develops and conducts research on blockchain technologies and their use cases.      The project is executed by government and research institutions, including the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing and the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology.      Under this initiative, the institutions have piloted a blockchain system for property registration at Shamshabad District, Telangana State, developed proof-of-concept solutions for Cloud Security Assurance, C-KYC and trade finance.      Other ongoing projects include authentication of academic certificates with a proof-of-existence framework, and vehicle life cycle and hotel registry management.      There have been a slew of blockchain projects under development in India.      Last month, India’s information technology services provider Tech Mahindra announced it was teaming up with Netherlands-based blockchain application incubator Quantoz to provide secure digital payments.      Tata Consultancy Services has also launched a multi-brand consumer loyalty platform on R3’s enterprise blockchain Corda the same month.      India's defense minister Rajnath Singh also stressed the potential use cases of blockchain in the defense industry in a public speech on Nov. 4.      While the country might be embracing blockchain, it has created regulatory challenges for cryptocurrency businesses.      The government has proposed fines and jail time for cryptocurrency uses in July, and Facebook announced it would not launch its Calibra crypto wallet subsidiary in India due to regulatory issues.

Blockchain advisory firm Akomba Labs ran bloXroute's ""Blockchain Distribution Network"" (BDN) on an Ethereum node in Singapore between Nov. 11 and Nov. 27, finding that average block propagation time – the time a block needs to be produced and shared throughout a blockchain – dropped to 172 milliseconds, less than half the current average time of 360 milliseconds.      Akomba utilized data from a Chinese mining pool as part of the two-week test.      Akomba’s results indicate BDN could have a modest but potentially cascading effect on block propagation in the Ethereum mainnet, one of the largest public blockchains and one of the more expensive to transact on, with gas prices around 20 cents. It is also a frequent target in the scalability debate.      “Ethereum feels the burn of the scalability bottleneck more than any other blockchain out there,” said Uri Klarman, bloXroute CEO. “It's losing momentum, it's losing market share. They feel the problem. Most others don't.”      BloXroute’s approach is a layer 0 solution that reduces transaction size and thus speeds up block propagation time. BDN could broadcast 4 bytes for a 500 byte transaction, for example.      “We don't send the entire block because if the other gateways know the transaction out of there, you don't need to send the actual data itself – only pointers saying which transactions are there” said Klarman.      BloXroute had previously tested BDN on the ethereum mainnet in September to similar results. At the time, it clocked about 25 percent reduction in block propagation time.      Klarman said that BDN is already running in some large mining pools and will continue to be gradually introduced to larger pools. Once it does, he says block capacity will increase and fees could fall – if, that is, the added capacity outstrips network demand.      In September, ethereum miners voted to raise the GAS limit to 10 million, up 25 percent from the previous ceiling. That move was made to combat network congestion, and Klarman said demand immediately ate the extra space up.      “We know there is demand for these transactions, which lead us to where we are right now,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/27/ethereum-scaling-fix-cuts-time-to-create-a-block-in-half-test-finds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1eacd48c9331b4d1b0328b915b1430f95be0525b-1200x675.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the report, HSBC intends to move its current paper-based records onto its Digital Vault platform by March 2020, allowing investors to track securities in real-time. The U.K.-based bank will specifically digitize its private placement records, allowing investors to quickly check on holdings.      The records are currently held in paper-based records, according to the report. It can be “tricky and time-consuming” to access them in their present form.      HSBC is only transferring 40 percent of its records onto a blockchain, according to the report. The bank holds $50 billion in assets at present.      While using a blockchain platform is intended to save costs, HSBC “could not quantify the amount that could be saved for the bank or its clients,” Reuters said.      An independent consultant, Windsor Holden, told Reuters that he does not expect any savings will be announced before the latter half of 2021 after the platform is rolled out.      The bank has experimented with blockchain tools for more than a year now. In January, HSBC announced it had settled some 3 million foreign exchange transactions using a blockchain platform, conducting some $250 billion in trades in the process. The sum included another 150,000 in payments.      The bank has also hinted at using blockchain to digitize letters of credit in the past.

At a meeting on Nov. 27, the Federal Council – the executive body that constitutes the federal government – adopted a proposal to improve the legislative framework for the nascent technology. According to a notice from Switzerland's federal finance department, the move is aimed at ""increasing legal certainty, removing barriers for applications based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and reducing the risk of abuse.""      The legislation, developed as a ""blanket framework,"" proposes amendments to nine federal acts across civil and financial market law, according to the announcement.      The nation is already known as one that is crypto and blockchain friendly, with its Zug region playing host to a large number of industry firms. Facebook also chose to incorporate the Libra Association in Switzerland.      In 2018, the Federal Council issued a report saying that it would regulate crypto and blockchain largely under existing financial laws, though an amendment to securities laws was also propose to increase the legal certainty of crypto tokens. The same year, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority introduced a new fintech license with “relaxed” requirements that could be applied to blockchain and cryptocurrency firms.      In today's announcement, the Federal Council said the 2018 report had demonstrated that Switzerland's existing legal framework is ""well suited"" for new technologies such as DLT. However, it also showed that there's room for improvement in some areas.      To address those, the Federal Council opened up a number of proposed amendments to existing laws for consultation in March. Following around 80 responses, the amendments have been further revised and, now, adopted by the council.

Claude Waelchli left the Swiss bank, where he was head of portfolio advisory for global ultra-high net worth and institutional clients in July. During his 12 years at the bank, Waelchli explored the blockchain space and learned about digital assets in the process.      “I think it’s no secret that the banks do experiment with new technology a little bit,” Waelchli said. “There’s nothing really substantial that banks are doing at this point in time.”      Like its incumbent rival Securitize, Waelchli’s venture is named for a verb, albeit a deliberately misspelled one: Tokenyz. Others in similar lines of work include SharesPost and OpenFinance.      At launch, Tokenyz, will receive a finders fee from broker-dealers to which it refers clients and a technology fee for structuring transactions.      Over the last six months, the team developed the infrastructure needed to tokenize existing assets on the ethereum blockchain and a user experience for both accredited individual investors and institutional investors. Now, the team is building out standards for digital securities, specifically the ERC-1400 token.      “What we are currently looking into is creating a global alliance of the top experts in the space to provide an open forum for dialogue where you can have conversations and eventually work towards a common standard,” Waelchli said.      Ideally, tokenization makes transfer of ownership easier, increases liquidity in secondary markets, allows for smaller trades and speeds settlement times. Tokenyz admits that tokenization is still nascent with little adoption from institutional investors.

The governor of the West African nation’s central bank, Ernest Addison, said Tuesday that Ghana could issue a digital form of the nation's currency, the cedi, in the ""near future” and is in talks to develop a pilot project in a ""sandbox environment.""      Addison's remarks, made at Ghana’s Annual Banking Conference, were disclosed in a public transcript.      The Bank of Ghana governor said Ghana is undergoing rapid digitization and has a burgeoning mobile banking sector driven by mobile phones. “Mobile money” transfers increased by 70 percent from 2017 to 2018, he said.      In a move to harness that sector, Addison said he had authorized the central bank to issue mobile money backed 1:1 by cedi and held in electronic wallets on Monday – a day before his digital currency announcement. However, he said the mobile money would be different from cryptocurrency, according to Ghanaian news website MyJoyOnline.      “It is just electronic money backed by currency,” Addison reportedly said of the mobile money at the banking event’s press conference. “So [the central bank] cannot create money; they are only having an electronic representation of the cedi that the Bank of Ghana puts into circulation. So it is not crypto.”      The technology behind Addison’s proposed ""e-cedi"" digital currency is as yet unclear. CoinDesk has reached out to the Bank of Ghana for clarification and will update this article if we hear back.      As has been widely reported, China's central bank is well on the way to launching its digital yuan, saying on Monday that it will initially be used to facilitate retail payments.

42403557,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLi5,1574852734,"Bitcoin Is Looking at a Short-Term Bull Reversal if Prices Pass $7,400","View  Bitcoin has created a hammer candle on the three-day chart, a warning of an impending bull reversal. However, a break above the candle's high of $7,380 is needed to confirm the short-term trend change.  A move above $7,380 would activate twin bullish cues on the 4-hour chart and allow a rally to $8,000.  Acceptance below Monday's low of $6,515 would imply a continuation of the sell-off from recent highs above $10,000.    Bitcoin needs to break above $7,380 to confirm a short-term bull reversal and invite stronger buying pressure, the three-day chart indicates.      Specifically, the top cryptocurrency by market value created a hammer candle in the three days to Nov. 26. A hammer candle, which comprises of a long lower shadow and a small upper body, means the three-day period began with pessimism, but ended on a more optimistic note.      Stepping back, the cryptocurrency ran into selling pressure near $7,350 on Nov. 24 and fell to six-month lows near $6,500 on the following day. The drop, however, was short-lived and prices quickly rose back to $7,380 before printing a UTC close at $7,159 on Nov. 26. The recovery from $6,500 to $7,159 represents the long lower shadow of the hammer and the spread between $7,350 and $7,159 represents the body.      While the pattern is considered a bullish signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow-through, preferably a convincing move above the high of the hammer candle. That means a break above $7,380 is needed to confirm a bullish reversal and possibly lead to a stronger recovery rally.      BTC is changing hands at $6,917, representing a 2.4 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, after a sudden drop soon before press time.      Many in the investor community are associating the latest decline with confirmation of a $49 million crypto theft at the South Korean exchange Upbit. The exchange said large ether transfers had been made to an unknown wallet.      Popular analyst Joseph Young, however, believes the price drop seen in the last few minutes may not be driven by the Upbit news.          3-day chart          The long lower shadow attached to the hammer candle indicates seller exhaustion. If the current three-day candle ends (Friday, UTC) above $7,380, a bullish hammer reversal would be confirmed. That would open the doors to $8,000.      On the other hand, a close below the hammer's low of $6,515 would imply a continuation of the sell-off from highs above $10,000.    4-hour chart          A move above $7,380 would activate twin bullish cues on the 4-hour chart: an upside break of the descending trendline and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the line chart.      The latter would create room for a rally to $8,245 (target as per the measured move method).      That target looks possible, as the 14-day relative strength index is reporting oversold conditions with a below-30 reading.      Moreover, the location of the hammer candle is a good reason to believe a stronger bounce is in the offing.      A hammer candle represents bearish exhaustion, as noted earlier and gains credence when it appears following a notable price drop, which is the case here.      The pattern has appeared following a sell-off from $10,350 to $6,515. The candle loses its relevance at market tops and during consolidation.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/27/bitcoin-is-looking-at-a-short-term-bull-reversal-if-prices-pass-7400,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afbc38f9ad02ebfc5146aaa5794524e7c3e41909-1500x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403556,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLh6,1574850000,Charities Put a Bitcoin Twist on Giving Tuesday,"Don’t just Hodl bitcoin this year, donate it.      Charities are leaning into the blockchain space this year with #BitcoinTuesday, a sideways take on the philanthropy movement following Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cybermonday (Dec 3).      Drawing inspiration from one crypto’s more heartwarming stories, the Pineapple Fund – wherein a pseudonymous bitcoiner donated some $55 million towards 60 charities during the 2017 bull market – options for crypto-based donations abound.      “The fact that there were talking about an open-source distributed, user-created project that doesn't have central ownership seems like a perfect product market matc†h,” said Woodrow Rosenbaum, GivingTuesday’s Data & Insights Lead in a phone.      Launched in 2012 by 92nd Street Y and the United Nations Foundation, GivingTuesday received early attention from Mashable, Facebook and Microsoft and raised some $400 million in the U.S. last year, according to the GivingTuesday foundation.    The Giving Block    The Giving Block, a for profit firm founded in 2018, is spearheading this year’s rendition of crypto Giving Tuesday with #BitcoinTuesday.      Rounding up support from Gemini and Brave Browser, among others, the technology company is orchestrating aid for nonprofits such as No Kid Hungry, the Tor Project and Pencils of Promise.      The D.C.-based group is leaning on crypto’s favorable tax status. As with stock donations, donors need pay no capital gains on what they give.      “In times of crisis, to reach those lofty ambitions, we need to be friendly not only to traditional financing mechanisms, but to the crypto community who's been very innovative,” said Ettore Rossetti, global digital lead of Save the Children in a phone interview.      Founded in 1919, Save the Children has accepted crypto donations since 2013. “We feel like children will win if we can unlock new forms of funding,” he said.    BitGive    You can also give through BitGive, one of the oldest crypto-specific non-profits in the field.      Founded in 2013, BitGive uses bitcoin’s blockchain and works with smart contract provider RSK. Its GiveTrack project follows donated money, showing who it benefits. The charity collects less than one percent in fees for processing transactions, according to its website.      “It's a way to be transparent,” said BitGive founder Connie Gallipi in a phone interview. “It says this project was created on this day in this time, this NGO was added on this day in this time and we checked the bitcoin rate on this day at this time,” she said.      BitGive currently sponsors personally vetted NGOs across the globe, including three projects in Venezuela focusing on orphanages, hospitals, and abandoned animals.    CryptoGivingTuesday    CryptoGivingTuesday, a community coalition spun out of the GivingTuesday organization, is another destination for donations.      Through its service, donations can be made in multiple cryptos to NGOs and non-profits including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), the lightning network, binance coin (BNB), bitcoin cash (BCH) and XRP.      GivingTuesday takes a decentralized approach to its campaigns. Communities often adopt GivingTuesday’s branding to promote a campaign in their niche, Rosenbaum said.      “Some of these big payment processor platforms like Facebook and PayPal use GivingTuesday as a great way for them to engage [with their audience],” he said. “So we'll give people best practices. We want to hear how their campaigns went, learn about their results and bring them into that network.”      UPDATE (Nov 27, 16:10 UTC): A prior version of this story said the Giving Block is a nonprofit.

Upbit’s CEO said in a blog post at 9:00 UTC on Wednesday that an abnormal transaction from its wallets had resulted in the outflow of 342,000 ether (ETH) earlier today.

42403567,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLpx,1574845200,Keep Calm and HODL On? 3 Reasons to Look Past Bitcoin's Price Rout,"Don't panic.      That's the message to anyone spooked by bitcoin's brutal sell-off from several bullish experts interviewed by CoinDesk.      The bellwether cryptocurrency has tumbled 11.5 percent in the last week or so, likely due to a lack of positive catalysts entering the picture and China's latest crackdown on digital asset trading. It briefly dipped below the psychological level of $7,000 and as of this writing is trading around $7,117.  But zooming out the lens a bit and taking a macro perspective, experts note at least three plausible reasons to think this may be just a hiccup for bitcoin.      On the demand side, institutional trading platforms like Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Asset Services (FDAS) are starting to see uptake. Retail bitcoin purchases are on the rise at the popular consumer app Square as well. And all else equal, the expected halving of mining rewards next year bodes well on the supply side since it will reduce the amount of new bitcoin regularly injected into the market.      “While the latest drop in price is a short-term cause for concern, the fundamentals around BTC and increasing institutional adoption continue up and to the right,” said Jehan Chu, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Kenetic, a venture capital and trading firm based in Hong Kong.    Bakkt to business    After a disappointing start in September, the Bakkt futures market has started to ramp up in earnest, hitting an all-time high on Nov. 22, with 2,728 contracts traded. That was a 68 percent increase on the day prior while open interest was up 29 percent on the day. Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not yet been settled.      A subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange), Bakkt is a regulated platform and exchange for the purchase, sale and storage of crypto assets aimed at institutional traders and companies.      Its role has been to increase confidence and trust within the crypto-sphere amongst larger funds by offering more sophisticated trading instruments such as futures contracts that can be utilized to hedge against risk.      “It's actually good that it's going to take longer for bitcoin to hit the next all-time high because it shows how the market is maturing and with more institutions jumping in,” said Josh Rager, an analyst and co-founder at Blockroots, an education platform for trading focused on the BTC market and crypto-assets.    High Fidelity    Similarly, platforms targeting large investors, such as FDAS, launched earlier this year by mutual-fund powerhouse Fidelity Investments, provide a vital service for those larger funds seeking a safer avenue to enter crypto without having to rely on exchanges to store their crypto. They are likely boosting long-term sentiment by providing custody options for digital assets, experts told CoinDesk.      Fidelity Digital Assets, the nascent cryptocurrency trading business servicing institutional investors, also features an onboarding service with dedicated client support that makes the process of entering the space more convenient and legit from a large investor’s perspective.      Institutional adoption continues at a “rapid pace,"" said Gabor Gubacs, director of digital assets strategy at asset management firm VanEck.      “Lower BTC prices are more accessible and healthier entry points for new BTC allocators,” said Gubacs.      To be sure, it's not as accessible as some may have hoped. Gurbacs' firm, for example, withdrew a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from consideration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in September, after the regulator signaled it was in no hurry to approve any such vehicle for retail investors. Instead, VanEck is selling shares in an ETF-like bitcoin fund strictly to institutions.    Squaring off    Another encouraging sign for the bulls is the fact that first-time buyers of bitcoin through Square's Cash app have roughly doubled, with the company's bitcoin revenue climbing 244 percent year-over-year to $1.27 billion in the third quarter.      Admittedly, Square only started offering bitcoin purchases in November 2017 (near the peak of the last bull market), so that triple-digit growth is from a small base. Also, the company's profits from bitcoin sales have been comparatively tiny, in the low seven figures.      Still, for Chu, the data bolsters the case for optimism, when combined with the developments on the institutional side.      ""Bakkt trading volumes are steadily increasing, retail purchases on Square are at high levels, and platforms like Fidelity continue to create comprehensive access to Bitcoin for their customers – all of which are bullish long-term signs for bitcoin,"" Chu said.    'Fundamentals are different'    Then there are the key metrics about the asset itself. Rager noted that the hash rate, a measure of how much computing power is being devoted to the bitcoin network, has tripled since the previous all-time price high of $20,000 December 2017.      In his interpretation, institutions are selling to force weaker hands to capitulate, so the larger funds can accumulate BTC at lower prices ahead of the halving expected in May 2020.      Jonny Moe, a crypto day trader and analyst, agreed that the halving was the single biggest factor relating to the bullish long-term case and that BTC itself is a deflationary currency whose purchasing power should grow over time.      “To this point, all the evidence we have is that price has respected this disinflation in supply,” Moe said. “Until we see it stop following this four-year cycle, the most simplistic long term view is to just respect it and let it continue.”      But bear in mind that this point is up for debate. Some traders aren't sure history will repeat itself. Previously, those buying bitcoin in anticipation of the halving had the wind at their back, in the form of an already-bullish market, crypto trader Willy Woo noted recently.      ""Well this time around, we have gone $14k->$7.5k and that's killing off weak miners who are dumping and dying,"" Woo tweeted. ""This adds to the already bearish action, so no happy front running 6-months out due to sell pressure. You can't draw repeat fractals, the fundamentals are different.""

42403576,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLwq,1574841907,Simon Malls Has 5 New Bitcoin ATMs With Bitstop Partnership,"Crypto ATM provider Bitstop is rolling out new machines in partnership with the U.S.’s largest retail shopping mall operator.      Bitstop installed five bitcoin ATMs in Simon Property Group locations over the past month – in Carlsbad Premium Outlets in Carlsbad, California, Mall of Georgia in Buford, Georgia, Miami International Mall in Miami, Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, and The Avenues in Jacksonville, Florida – expanding the company’s exposure to first-time bitcoiners as it eyes a booming crypto ATM market.      They’re part of Bitstop’s drive to woo crypto newcomers: people who shop in malls, don’t understand blockchain and have never opened a bitcoin wallet, according to co-founder and CEO Andrew Barnard.      He said these locations are akin to the old cliche: “If you build it, they will come.”      “Once you put these ATMs down and you give people easy access, the people go and figure out how to use it,” Barnard said.      With these new locations, Barnard says Bitstop is continuing to build out exposure among newcomers and handhold them through the process of buying their first bitcoin. He said the kiosks represent a gateway to first-timers.      Barnard said Bitstop’s data demonstrates a wide variety of users and use cases. He said people purchase from an ATM as an investment, but also to then buy online or send remittance payments home.      The average purchase is $160 dollars. And Barnard said traffic is especially heavy around the first and 15th day of each month, which he said is payday for many users.      Placing them in malls in time for the holiday shopping season positions Bitstop for a customer influx. America’s 10 busiest shopping days are set to come between Black Friday (Nov. 29) and Jan. 1, data analysis firm Sensormatic predicts.      That foot traffic increases exposure and drives new users, who associate longevity with the physicality of the ATMs, Barnard said.      “Having it at a mall makes people go, ‘wow, I guess bitcoin is going to be around for a long time,’” he said.      Bitstop is one of the older players in the American Bitcoin ATM sphere. Barnard said the company launched in 2013 and installed its first bitcoin ATM two years later, in Florida.      However, its network of 130 U.S. kiosks are dwarfed by some of the larger brands. LibertyX, the first company to release a Bitcoin ATM back in 2014, installed its 1000th location this summer.      Bitcoin ATMs are a rapidly-growing corner of the retail crypto space. Kiosks have been installed in convenience chains across the Southwest, Family Dollar stores and gas stations.      There are now some 6017 such ATMs around the world, according to Coinatmradar.com, up 30 percent from its estimate at the start of 2019.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/27/simon-malls-has-5-new-bitcoin-atms-with-bitstop-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03fef60aaa56a4c844301eecdafcd360d2e36795-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The partnership, announced Wednesday, means the London-based Elliptic will monitor transactions passing through Zilliqa, including those in Zilliqa’s ZIL crypto and in the upcoming Singaporean dollar-pegged stablecoin XSGD, set for release in December, according to a press release.      Their goal: shield Zilliqa from risk by proving to governments and regulators around the world that Zilliqa users are not trafficking across their network with potentially illicit funds.      Tom Robinson, Elliptic's chief scientist, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that the company provides tools allowing exchanges and other companies to identify funds being laundered by tracking transactions.      ""Our tools enable these services to identify whether funds are being laundered through their businesses, by tracing each crypto-asset transaction all the way through the blockchain, to its source,"" he said. ""If this source is one of the illicit wallets we have previously identified, the business is alerted and can take steps to prevent the money laundering from taking place.""      The announcement comes at a time of increasing pressure from such regulators. In June, the Financial Action Task Force unveiled its “Travel Rule” guidelines upping compliance steps for crypto exchanges.      And though XSGD will be a Singaporean-pegged stablecoin, its launch coincides with governments’ close scrutinization of stablecoin regimes, including in the US.      Elliptic already has experience routing out such activity. One of the early startups to provide crypto transaction tracking services, the firm issued a report last week tying $400 million in XRP to illicit activities like ponzi schemes.      “While the promise of the digital economy is a truly exciting one, it is also imperative that established standards around security and compliance remain uncompromised,” Amrit Kumar, president at Zilliqa, said in a statement.AML oversight adds another layer to the Zilliqa blockchain.

42403559,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLl2,1574812800,Japanese Conglomerate SBI Injects 7-Figure Sum Into Securitize,"Japanese financial services conglomerate SBI Holdings has invested a seven-figure sum in Securitize, a provider of services for issuing digital securities.      The investment, announced Tuesday, comes just two months after Securitize announced it had raised a combined $14 million from Santander Bank and MUFG.      The exact amount injected by SBI wasn’t disclosed, but Carlos Domingo, Securitize’s founder and CEO, told CoinDesk that there are six 0s at the end of the figure.      He said his company intends to use the funds in part to build out its new Japan office, which will be open by the end of the year.      “We’re going to do business there and that involves not only finding customers in Japan, but also localizing the technology and making sure you know the language for the next similar types of integrations that you might be looking at,” he said.      Securitize already has a subsidiary set up in the country, though Domingo expects to launch with a small crew initially.      In a statement, SBI Holdings CEO and president Yoshitaka Kitao said his company “strongly believes in the future of digital securities,” citing Securitize as one “leading player in the industry.”      The move is part of a broader shift in Domingo’s view. A few years ago, he said much of the interest around the space came primarily from those already sold on the ideas of blockchains and initial coin offerings.      Now, it seems there is more mature interest around security token offerings and similar tools, Domingo said.      “I think that the fact that [SBI is] putting their faith and investing in a company like us [is] signifying the move towards more adoption of security tokens,” he said.      SBI has collaborated with a number of other blockchain-related groups, including payments startup Ripple and the R3 consortium.
