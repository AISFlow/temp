Read more: How Does Ethereum Staking Work?  Sokolin, who focuses on areas of decentralized finance and autonomous organizations (DAO), said Ethereum’s use as collateral in DeFi suggests there are those who are “certainly supportive of ETH as a store of value, ultra sound money type asset.”  Sokolin added that ETH is not only “being used to power the protocol” but it is also oftentimes being used as “a unit of account for all sorts of goods and NFTs inside of Web 3.” NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, give collectors ownership of the digital items they’ve bought.

Bitcoin (BTC) gained significant strength after closing the weekly candle on a high note, with the price remaining above $21,700 for the first time in weeks.

42394820,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVX8p,1663020749,Suggestions That Bitcoin Halving Might Come Sooner Are Mostly Wrong,"Bitcoin’s hashrate – the computational effort required to secure the network – is nearing historical highs, raising concerns from a few people on Twitter about an accelerated Bitcoin halving schedule (the reward for mining a block is halved approximately every four years).  Should they be worried? Not really. Bitcoin’s algorithm prevents acceleration of the halving schedule, a developer highlighted.  Bitcoin miners process transactions and compete to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain roughly every 10 minutes. Several factors (for example, number of miners or technological improvements) can disrupt that 10-minute rhythm, making it slightly easier or a little more difficult to mine blocks.  The Bitcoin algorithm monitors the level of difficulty and adjusts it every 2,016 blocks (approximately every two weeks) to maintain that 10-minute block time.  The algorithm also controls how many bitcoins miners receive as a reward for processing transactions and securing the network.  When Bitcoin was launched in 2009, miners received 50 bitcoins for successfully mining a block. That reward (called a “subsidy”) is halved every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years), and the next halving will take place in 2024.  So can a jump in hashrate push that date to 2023 as some are claiming? The short answer is, no.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty: Everything You Need to Know  Changes in hashrate will not significantly alter Bitcoin’s halving schedule because Bitcoin’s algorithm prevents wild variations in block time by adjusting difficulty to match whatever external conditions exist at the time.  There may be small changes in dates here and there, but nothing significant enough to push the halving schedule from 2024 to 2023.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  MetaMask, one of the largest crypto wallet providers, has integrated the Brazilian government’s payment system Pix and started allowing crypto purchases with Brazilian reals.  MetaMask integrated with Pix via the payment infrastructure company MoonPay, which takes about a 1% commission per transaction, plus a network fee calculated in real time, MetaMask said in a statement on Friday.  In April, MetaMask partnered with MoonPay to allow users buy ether and other ERC-20 tokens through different payment methods, such as cards, bank transfers and Apple Pay.  In Brazil, MetaMask currently requires a minimum transaction of 102 Brazilian reals, equivalent to $20, to buy ether, CoinDesk confirmed on Monday.  Pix, a real-time retail payment system launched by the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) in October 2020, has 126 million users and is already used by leading crypto exchanges such as Binance and Bybit.  In July, MetaMask revealed that Brazil was its second-largest user market after the US.  This article was translated by Andrés Engler, and edited by CoinDesk.

42394786,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVX1w,1663017352,This San Diego Car Wash Is Using NFTs to Drive Up Demand,"In the past year, companies as large as Nike and Pepsi have targeted non-fungible token (NFT)-curious customers during Web3’s transition from a niche crypto concept to a more mainstream movement, netting hundreds of millions of dollars along the way.  But amid the biggest names in branding all vying to launch successful NFT projects, efforts from smaller companies have also yielded impressive results. Among them is a car wash company called Soapy Joe’s, which began its own NFT campaign at the beginning of July.  The scavenger hunt-style promotion allows members of the San Diego car wash chain to collect a different Ethereum-based NFT from each of its 17 locations. The more NFTs a customer collects, the more rewards are unlocked, ranging from physical key chains and hats to amusement park tickets and a free annual membership to the car wash.  “We are seeing numbers that we have never seen in our 11 year history in terms of people going to multiple sites,” Anne Mauler, Soapy Joe’s vice president of marketing, told CoinDesk in an interview. “They are blowing it out of the water.”  In the two and a half months since the promotion began, Soapy Joe’s customers have minted more than 10,000 NFTs between around 2,000 wallets. Mauler says the company has also seen a 10% increase in web users since the start of the promotion, with the amount of customers visiting more than four locations increasing significantly.  The NFTs themselves are based on the design of the air fresheners Soapy Joe’s has always given out with every wash, which have become a cult collectible among the company’s loyal “Soapy Squad.” Mauler described the admiration for the physical air fresheners as “like NFTs in real life.”  To redeem the NFTs, Soapy Joe’s sends a link via email to its customers after each visit. The company says its NFT-related emails have so far seen a 71% open rate – far higher than its normal promos.  The inspiration for the campaign dates back to April 2021, when Mauler was first exposed to NFTs while watching an episode of ""The Ellen Degeneres Show"" that had a “stick cat” NFT segment.  “Seeing Ellen with her little cat image, saying ‘This is something that we can do.’ We are known for being a little bit wacky, definitely on the cutting edge, liking to be innovative and doing the unexpected, and we definitely do not see ourselves as playing toe-to-toe with other car washes,” Mauler said.  The company’s “Summer Passport” promotion officially ends Sept. 30, but it won’t be the brand’s last NFT venture. A representative from Soapy Joe’s said it has plans to build on its digital collectible strategy in the coming months, though concrete plans have yet to be announced.

El Salvador established a purchase price of $910 for the bonds maturing in 2023, and a $540 price for those bonds maturing in 2025. Each bond is worth a total of $800 million.  In July, when El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele presented the repurchase plan, it was seen as an attempt to counter speculation about a potential default by El Salvador amid strained relations between the Central American country and the traditional credit market, particularly after El Salvador established bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender in September 2021.  As of now, El Salvador is down roughly 50% on its sizable investments in bitcoin, representing a potential loss of $52.4 million, according to CoinDesk data based on Bukele's announcements.  El Salvador’s $1 billion bitcoin bond (also known as the Volcano Bond) still does not have a launch date, despite being announced in November 2021 by Bukele. Bitfinex and Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino, who has worked closely with El Salvador on the bitcoin bond project, said last month that government officials have told him to expect passage in September.  The bond repurchase offer will be available between Sept. 12 and Sept. 20, El Salvador said, adding that the “settlement of validly tendered and accepted notes is scheduled to occur on or about Sept. 22.” Deutsche Bank Securities will serve as the dealer manager.  El Salvador added that the offer is “subject to an aggregate amount not to exceed $360 million to purchase the principal amount of notes accepted for tender and pay accrued interest and any premium with respect to such notes.”  Read more: Bitcoin City: El Salvador’s Dreams for Utopia on Hold  CORRECTION (Sept. 12, 2022 21:23 UTC): Corrected purchase price of bonds maturing in 2023 to $910, and that of bonds maturing in 2025 to $540.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/12/el-salvador-launches-2-debt-repurchase-offers-amid-uncertainty-over-its-bitcoin-bond,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a72666c22991d135c9d40f93b0d75b0bd17f9de-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394791,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVX7q,1663015481,Market Wrap: Ether Falls Despite Merge Anticipation; Bitcoin Climbs as Investors Await Inflation Data,"Price Action  It's Ethereum Merge week, and much of the crypto world is eyeing ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value, as its blockchain protocol moves from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The shift is expected to occur Thursday between 02:38 UTC and 03:52 UTC.  Where bitcoin’s (BTC) price appears linked to Tuesday’s latest inflation reading and subsequent interest rate actions by the U.S. central bank, ether’s (ETH) price movement appears tied to Merge expectations. Despite the divergent catalysts, BTC and ETH remain highly correlated, with a 30-day correlation coefficient of 0.90. The correlation remains high (0.89) when the measurement is narrowed to 10 days. A reading of at least 0.70 is considered high, while one of 0.30 is considered low.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose 3% on Monday, with an initial push occurring during the 07:00 UTC hour. The price continued to move higher throughout the day. Daily trading volume was normal for BTC, when compared with its 20-day moving average.  Ether (ETH) fell 4.8% on Monday, on moderate volume. The price accelerated during the 07:00 UTC hour before declining later.  Economic calendar: The British economy grew at a slower pace than expected, with July GDP of 2.3% growth versus expectations of 2.6%. The figure was an improvement over last month’s 1.9% growth rate.  Investors’ attention will shift to Tuesday’s U.S. inflation data. The consensus estimate of analysts projects an 8.5% increase in prices while “core inflation,” which excludes food and energy costs, is expected to be 5.9%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will be examining inflation data to determine whether to accelerate or slow its pace of interest rate hikes.  U.S. equities: Traditional equities markets were higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite indexes recently rose 0.7%, 1% and 1.2%, respectively.  Commodities: In energy markets, natural gas rose 4.9% in price, while crude oil was 1.4% higher. Copper, often viewed as a barometer for overall economic activity, rose 1.2%. Traditional inflation hedge gold increased in price by 0.5%  The Dollar Index (DXY), which maintains an inverse relationship to BTC prices, declined 0.57%. Its correlation coefficient relative to bitcoin is -0.9.  Altcoins were higher. Polkadot’s DOT rose 0.3% and Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana (SOL) increased 4% and 6%, respectively.  Latest Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $22,410 +3.2%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,725 −2.7%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,110.41 +1.1%      ●Gold: $1,737 per troy ounce +1.2%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.36% +0.04      Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  ETH Markets Appear Cautious Ahead of Merge  In what may just be “pre-Merge” jitters, ETH sold off relative to BTC on higher-than-average volume on Monday. As volume can often communicate the level of conviction behind an asset’s price movement, the ETH/BTC pair traded at double its normal volume.  Ethereum’s move from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol is the most significant recent development for ether, its currency. In addition to the reduction in energy consumption, proof-of-stake will potentially have a deflationary impact on ETH supply.  The relevance to ETH holders is that a decrease in ETH’s supply should lead to an increase in ETH’s value. The 40% increase in ETH relative to BTC because July indicates optimism leading to the Merge, while the 9.2% decrease since Sept. 8 implies a degree of caution directly ahead of it.  The below chart highlights the recent decline, along with a decline in the Relative Strength Indicator for ETH/BTC from 75.7 to 41.4 in recent days. RSI is a technical indicator that measures price momentum. Values above 70 imply that an asset is overvalued, while values under 30 imply that an asset is undervalued. The 41.4 reading is neutral.  ETH’s RSI relative to the USD is 57, less neutral than the ETH/BTC pair, but also not ringing overbought alarms.  ETH funding rates are negative, implying bearish sentiment. Funding rates are payments between buyers and sellers of futures contracts. When rates are positive, buyers (longs) of contracts pay sellers (shorts). When rates are negative, the opposite occurs.  ETH funding rates were positive each day between May 1 and Aug.14, and negative for every day but five since then. According to data from the FTX exchange, the average annualized 30-day funding rate for ETH is -12.16%, while the average annualized funding rate over 90 days is currently -5.65%. By comparison, ETH’s all-time funding rate is 13.03%.  Investors, particularly on the institutional side, could be waiting for the results of the Merge prior to allocating more capital. Additionally, recent on-chain data shows a slight increase in ETH being sent to exchanges. An increase in assets deposited on exchanges can often be a precursor to additional selling.  Altcoin Roundup  Ethereum Blockchain’s Upgrade May Lead to Greater Institutional Adoption of Ether, according to a Bank of America research report: The bank said investors who are barred from buying tokens that run on proof-of-work (PoW) systems may be able to buy ether (ETH) after the blockchain switches to proof-of-stake (PoS), a transition known as the Merge.

The duo became entangled several years ago when Wright accused Hodlonaut of defamation for tweets calling Wright a ""fraud"" for claiming to be Nakamoto, starting a complex legal battle.  Hodlonaut is far from the only bitcoiner ensnared by Wright in court. Last year, for instance, Wright served claims against 16 Bitcoin developers, asking them to turn over funds to him that aren’t likely his. Developers argue that the threat of legal action from Wright is dissuading their peers from working on bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency, depriving its blockchain network of improvements needed to one day bring the crypto to the masses.  Hodlonaut’s ambitious aim is to reverse that trend by stopping – or at least slowing down – Wright's lawsuits.  ""This community campaign aims to make sure my fight is brought to its successful conclusion, with court judgments that effectively put an end to any further bullying of bitcoiners, developers and companies,"" Hodlonaut said on Twitter.  Read more: Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi? Hodlonaut and Wright Go to Trial to Find Out  When CoinDesk reached out to Wright through a publicist, he responded that ""Hodlonaut is the only bully here,"" because Hodlonaut is the one pursuing legal action this time around. (Hodlonaut filed the suit in Norway after Wright’s attorneys sent him a legal notice in the U.K., and weeks after Wright placed a $5,000 bounty on Hodlonaut’s real identity.)  Hodlonaut's case has aroused widespread support in the bitcoin community, with his donation campaign raising nearly $1.5 million and thousands of users changing their profile pictures to his icon of an astronaut cat. In another show of support, CryptoCloaks, a company that prints a variety of bitcoin gear in 3D, is now selling a 3D-printed space-cat helmet in an effort to raise funds for Hodlonaut.  Wright's claims  Wright's claim to be Bitcoin’s inventor is dubious. When he first came out saying he was Satoshi back in 2015, he said he could prove it with cryptography. But cryptographers shot that claim down. Security expert Dan Kaminsky called him the ""world's first cryptographically provable con artist,"" and other experts echoed that analysis. Shortly after Wired published an article stating Wright was “probably” Satoshi, it wrote another article admitting “he may be a hoaxer.”  Since then, Wright has been caught lying on other occasions. In a parallel court case with the estate of his former business partner, Dave Kleiman, Wright claimed he was the owner of some particular bitcoin.  During the case, the actual owner of the coins – whoever they are – signed the following message: ""Craig Steven Wright is a liar and a fraud. He doesn't have the keys used to sign this message."" Only the owner of the coins can ""sign"" a message, which anyone can then verify with cryptography.  Read more: Craig Wright Called 'Fraud' in Message Signed With Bitcoin Addresses He Claims to Own  In another defamation case Wright waged against podcaster Peter McCormack, U.K. High Court Judge Martin Chamberlain ruled that Wright put forth ""false evidence.""  And though Wright initiated legal action in the U.K. against Hodlonaut, Hodlonaut later filed a suit against Wright in Norway as a shield, ""claiming a declaratory judgment that my tweets were lawful, covered by truth and freedom of speech and that I am not liable to pay damages to Wright.""  Consequences for Bitcoin  The wider concern for many Hodlonaut supporters is that the threat of legal action from Wright makes other bitcoiners (whether developers, journalists or companies) not want to work on the digital currency out of fear that they will be sued as well.  Former Bitcoin Core developer and cryptographer Greg Maxwell said in a Reddit thread: ""His actions have contributed to at least four of some of the most prolific and longest standing developers discontinuing or substantially curtailing their involvement with Bitcoin.""  Maxwell is one of the 16 developers targeted by Wright in the U.K., though a judge has since rejected Wright’s claims, according to financial media outlet Blockworks.  Bitcoin Core developers work on the key software underpinning Bitcoin, churning out a variety of improvements (privacy, security, user experience, etc.) at the base layer of Bitcoin. The best-known recent example is Taproot, a change that will pave the way for substantial privacy improvements in Bitcoin.  By serving claims against these developers, Wright tangles them up in legal proceedings rather than allowing them to focus on the technology they want to improve. Further, it discourages other developers from getting involved.  Read more: Crypto Twitter Took Center Stage During the First Day of Hodlonaut vs. Craig Wright  ""The deck is stacked enormously against [Hodlonaut] and Wright's other targets: Wright's laughable claims across multiple countries should have been possible to discharge in a summary judgment, limiting the legal costs to merely hundreds of thousands [of dollars] instead of millions – but since he has nothing to lose he'll tell whatever lies are required to keep the litigation going for as long as possible,” Maxwell said.  “And with Wright burying his opponents under a hundred of thousands of documents (a substantial percentage of which are forgeries), he easily can drive trial costs into the millions or tens of millions of dollars,” Maxwell added.  Uphill battle  Supporters hope a Hodlonaut victory will impede Wright. That said, many Hodlonaut backers aren’t under any illusion that Hodlonaut's case will fully undermine Wright's legal strategy.  ""Helping [Hodlonaut] continue his fight is merely necessary, it's not sufficient. It's unlikely that Wright will be stopped by even a complete victory by [Hodlonaut], only slowed by it,"" Maxwell said.  Against that backdrop, at least two legal funds have opened so developers don't have to figure out how to respond to Wright's (and others’) litigation on their own. In January Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey opened a legal defense board to defend developers against legal action. Nonprofit OpenSats opened a similar fund last month.  But even with this legal aid, a Bitcoin developer who wished to remain anonymous told CoinDesk that the litigation can be draining.  ""Despite the excellent legal representation that we developers have right now, the lawsuits still consume time and emotional energy, for some more, for some less,” the anonymous developer said. “Personally, I am not too much affected by the lawsuits, but I suspect for other developers it was one of many reasons to reduce or completely cut their involvement.”  Even if battling with Wright is an uphill battle, Maxwell remains optimistic.  ""Wright's fraud is an attack on Bitcoin,” he said. “Not a conjectural or hypothetical attack, but a real one that has already done significant damage. I'm confident that this is an attack Bitcoin will survive because I'm confident that when people will stand up to fight for it.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/12/bitcoins-health-may-hinge-on-a-legal-feud-in-norway,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92860aca5a337acd6b4697eed3dbf8a6a384bd41-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The BA PAC will contribute to the campaigns of “pro-crypto candidates” from both parties, according to Kristin Smith, the Washington-based association’s executive director. The timing – dated Monday in the group’s filing with the Federal Election Commission – is too late to make a splash in November’s midterm elections that will decide if Republicans will surge into power in Congress or whether Democrats will maintain their tenuous hold. But the PAC will be in a position to exert influence in the presidential election year in 2024.  The PAC will still donate to candidates for this November's election, though a press release declined to identify which candidates.  “We believe crypto is by definition a non-partisan issue,” Smith said in a tweet on Monday. “We will support candidates in that spirit, seeking the best champions for this technology no matter which side of the aisle they come from.”  Smith herself has donated to candidates from both parties, as well as right-leaning fundraising group WinRed, according to FEC data.  The industry has quickly become one of the dominant forces in political giving, with its new PACs outpacing many of the political efforts from more established industries. Crypto billionaires such as Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX crypto exchange, have poured tens of millions of dollars of their own money into U.S. politics over the past few years.  Julie Stitzel, vice president of public policy at CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, will be the PAC's chairwoman.

42394785,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVWyz,1663004355,Crypto Twitter Took Center Stage During the First Day of Hodlonaut vs. Craig Wright,"OSLO, Norway — The harsh culture of crypto Twitter is the emerging key theme in a legal battle between crypto Twitter personality Hodlonaut and Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who has long claimed to be the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.  The trial, which kicked off here Monday, is one of two simultaneous defamation suits centered around a series of tweets posted in 2019 by Hodlonaut (known in real life as Magnus Granath) – at the time, a public school teacher with less than 8,000 Twitter followers – in which he called Wright a fraud and a scammer.  The seven-day trial seeks to determine whether the tweets in question were protected by freedom of speech in Norway. If Hodlonaut wins, it would mean Wright would be unable to collect damages for libel in relation to the tweets in his lawsuit against Hodlonaut in the United Kingdom.  In their opening statements on Monday, attorneys for Hodlonaut delved into the lore surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto and laid out a history of Wright’s widely disputed claims – and his alleged penchant for forging documents and falsifying evidence – to support his case.  No new evidence, either in regards to Satoshi’s identity or Wright’s alleged fraud was offered during Hodlonaut’s attorney Ørjan Salvesen Haukaas’ opening remarks, which largely consisted of him reading news articles about Wright’s connection – or lack of one – to Bitcoin’s creation off an iPad.  Other evidence offered to District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen included documents from previous litigations involving Wright, including the 2021 suit brought by the estate of Wright’s former friend and business partner Dave Kleiman, as well as documents stemming from his 2015 legal trouble with the Australian Tax Office, in which Australian authorities accused Wright of falsifying evidence and fraudulently claiming to be Satoshi.  Read more: Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi? Hodlonaut and Wright Go to Trial to Find Out  The climate of crypto Twitter  Things took an interesting turn, however, when attorney Marie Bjørk Myklebust attempted to place Hodlonaut’s tweets about Wright in the broader context of Crypto Twitter.  In their initial complaint, Wright’s attorneys claim that a hashtag created by Hodlonaut in the March 2019 tweets – #CraigWrightIsAFraud – caused “serious harm to [Wright’s] reputation” and “caused [Wright] to suffer injury to his feelings.”  But Myklebust pointed out that, of the thousands of tweets containing a similar hashtag (#Faketoshi) about half were published from November 2018 to March 2019 – well before Hodlonaut’s tweets about Wright.  She went on to read the court a series of tweets from various users calling Wright a faker and demanding he provide cryptographic proof he is Satoshi – as well as his often-vitriolic responses, calling his critics and other well-known figures in the crypto space “losers,” “scum,” “frauds,” “soy boys” and “cucks,” the latter two of which she had to translate into Norwegian for the judge.  “Mr. Wright himself contributes to making a climate with strong words, strong statements,” Myklebust told the court. “He is not interested in objective conversation about his evidence” that he is Satoshi.

42394781,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVWv3,1662999347,US Inflation Data Could Test Bitcoin’s Rally,"The U.S. consumer price index report is expected to show slower inflation in August, which is one of the reasons why the price of bitcoin (BTC) has been rising since Friday.  But the new data could show that while price pressures are cooling, they are still too hot for Federal Reserve officials to ease off on tightening monetary policy.  “August inflation gauges will likely be very soft, but that won’t change the bottom line,"" economists at Bloomberg wrote. ""The ‘totality’ of the data that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will follow shows few signs of cooling in the economy, and perhaps even some acceleration.”  The latest CPI report will be released by the Labor Department on Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET (12:30 p.m. coordinated universal time). According to a survey by FactSet, the CPI in August was probably up 8.1% over the past 12 months. That pace would represent the second straight monthly decline, down from 8.5% in July and a four-decade high of 9.1% in June.  The expectation is that prices for gasoline, airfares, hotels and used cars were down last month, while food prices were up. The Federal Reserve's target is 2% annually.  Bitcoin gained 15% over the weekend in a rally that started after the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 75 basis points, or a 0.75 percentage point, the largest increase in ECB history.  In addition, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said Thursday that the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely move ahead with an aggressive rate hike on Sept. 22 even if the latest CPI number shows cooling price pressure Still, he said the Fed might not have to push rates above 3.5% “that soon,” implying that the Fed could take a more dovish stance in the future. The federal funds rate is now between 2.25% and 2.5%.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest crypto asset by market capitalization, was trading at $22,153 at press time, its highest price since mid-August.  “It may take some time for inflation to return back to the Fed’s target, but even a moderation from the current torrid pace should be very good for overall consumer sentiment,” said Brendan Murphy, head of global fixed Income, North America, at Insight Investment.  “The Fed has spent most of 2022 coming to grips with the implications of higher prices and committing to tighten monetary policy as much as needed to ensure those price increases return to target. This means higher rates and tighter financial conditions until inflation is under control,” Murphy said.  A report by the International Monetary Fund showed that the U.S. unemployment rate, now at 3.7%, may need to go as high as 7.5% in order for inflation to slow to the central bank’s target of 2%, Reuters reported.  Even though the Fed is convinced that a “soft landing” is still possible, the research concluded that ""a painful and prolonged increase in unemployment"" is inevitable to tame inflation.  From a technical standpoint, the recent rally in bitcoin might not last very long.  “BTC technicals continue to look bearish in the short term,” David Duong, head of institutional investment at crypto exchange Coinbase wrote in a report. “A further rally may be capped from here.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/12/us-inflation-data-could-test-bitcoins-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ef3020b54aacf4c21456f2ff01680ff611a24d2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411378,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQJI,1662998226,Bitcoiners Owe Andrew Ross Sorkin a Big Thank You,"Anyone who holds bitcoin (BTC), monero (XMR) or another censorship-resistant cryptocurrency should be lining up to shake Andrew Ross Sorkin’s hand.  The New York Times columnist took a victory lap this weekend when the International Standards Organization (ISO) created a new merchant category code (MCC) for credit or debit card purchases at gun stores to make those transactions stand out. Until now, such stores have been included in the broader category of sporting goods stores (code 5941, should you be wondering).  For years Sorkin had been advocating the creation of such a code to help financial institutions flag suspicious activity in the hopes of preventing mass shootings, and criticizing Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) for resisting such calls. His campaign followed a Times investigative series on the unwitting role the banking industry played in financing such massacres.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Amalgamated Bank, the union-owned New York lender, applied for the code’s creation earlier this year, was rejected, then tried again. In the wake of the May school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, the second application succeeded. On the eve of the code’s creation, Sorkin declared that it would “test the resolve of business leaders and their commitment to American lives.”  Never mind that gun buyers trying to fly under the radar now have an incentive to pay with cash (or perhaps cryptocurrency, where it’s accepted), or to make the purchase at Bass Pro Shops rather than a specialist firearms retailer.  Read more: As the Gun Market Moves to Crypto, Deeply Private Owners Reveal More Than They May Know  Never mind that, as Sorkin acknowledges, it’s an open question whether the code will be used. That’s up to the “acquiring” banks that plug merchants into the card networks. Shrewd acquirers, subject to audits by Visa and Mastercard, might advise gun-shop clients to start selling tents to justify using a different code.  Never mind that, depending if the code is used and how “suspicious activity” is defined, law-abiding gun buyers could end up the subjects of suspicious activity reports (SAR) filed by bankers erring on the side of caution. Those SARs, including subjects’ sensitive personal information, will sit in a government database for an indefinite period. The code is also likely to become a “high-risk merchant” category, meaning gun sellers would end up paying steeper fees for access to the card networks, to compensate banks for the added monitoring burden, payments industry veterans said.  Never mind that clamping down on how mass shootings occur is at best a short-term fix, and not the same thing as addressing the reasons why they occur.  If nothing else, Sorkin has succeeded in further politicizing the payment system and further deputizing financial institutions as unpaid informants for law enforcement. And that, all else equal, is bullish, over the very long term, for bitcoin and perhaps a few of its competitors.  To be clear: I am not claiming that Sorkin’s victory will have any direct or immediate effect on the price of any coin. You will find no “trading signals” in this article. I am talking, rather, of second- and third-order effects.  Read more: In Defense of Crime  A dangerous precedent  Those cheering the ISO’s decision and Sorkin’s crusade should rewatch a classic public service announcement from the 1980s.  A man confronts his son about a box of drug paraphernalia found in the teenager’s closet. “Who taught you how to do this stuff?” asks the father.  “You, alright?” answers the boy. “I learned it by watching you.”  Imagine what the right wing is learning by watching Sorkin.  Following a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, abortion is now illegal or soon to be in more than a dozen states. Lawmakers in some conservative states have floated measures to penalize those who help residents get out-of-state abortions, including by paying for the procedure or travel expenses. If such laws pass, why shouldn’t those states demand the creation of a special merchant code for abortion clinics (which now presumably fall under 8099, “Health Practitioners, Medical Services – Not Elsewhere Classified”)? After all, it would help the states flag what would now qualify as “suspicious activity” when, for example, a local resident’s card is charged at an out-of-state family-planning center.  Read more: Why the 3D-Printed Gun Debate Matters to Crypto (2018)  From the perspective of the anti-abortion movement, also known as the pro-life movement, such a code would “test the resolve of business leaders and their commitment to American lives.”  “Don’t give them ideas, Marc,” I hear some of my blue-state brethren saying. I’m not. Andrew Ross Sorkin is giving them ideas, by ratcheting up the trend of commandeering financial infrastructure to achieve political goals outside any democratic legislative process.  What’s next? Will the right wing insist on a merchant code for transgender care clinics (which, in their minds, are practicing child abuse)? Will the left counter with an MCC for books expressing “hate speech,” the better to detect the “extremists” who purchase them?  None of this would be good for the country or for its banking system. But it’d be great for crypto!  Read more: Crypto Becomes Lifeline for Russian Emigrés Opposing Putin’s War in Ukraine  Enter crypto  Bitcoin has no merchant category codes. A transaction is a transaction. As long as you control the private keys to a wallet, the network will follow your instructions to process the payment, no matter if the recipient is a narcoterrorist or a nun.  Of course, the Bitcoin network in its raw form isn’t private. Those who want to cover their tracks on the open ledger have to take extra precautions – or use privacy coins like XMR, which boast stronger cryptographic protections but are harder to buy or sell for cash than BTC. Cryptocurrencies remain a clunky but serviceable solution for the desperate.  So don’t count on a spate of gun shops suddenly accepting crypto payments. Don’t expect slumping coin prices to roar back as a result of Sorkin’s achievement. I won’t bother looking up what the BTC price did in the days since the ISO caved to the pressure. Trying to draw a straight line between the two would be dumb.  But directionally, Sorkin has highlighted cryptocurrency’s fundamental value proposition: its cash-like neutrality. For that, crypto holders owe him their gratitude.",POSITIVE,BTC | XMR,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XMR,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/12/bitcoiners-owe-andrew-ross-sorkin-a-big-thank-you,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1da31f5f07224c551b95e9785c3959705c00e2e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, which has a virtual computer attached, which enables lots of clever things like DeFi (decentralised finance), NFTs (a kind of unique digital entity) and a number of other potentially revolutionary technical innovations.The trouble is, it is driven by a system called proof of work (&apos;POW&apos;).

In the battle of &apos;proof of work,&apos; computers race to solve a huge, nasty mathematical puzzle. The first to solve wins the prize of adding the next lot of information to the Ethereum blockchain and gets a reward equivalent to thousands of dollars. The problem with this proof of work arms race is that it is driven by computing which is in turn driven by electricity and that&apos;s not a popular mechanism right now.

42411370,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQ2l,1662993573,There’s No Future for DeFi Without Regulation,"Believe it or not, the blockchain era is really America’s second experiment with decentralized finance (DeFi). Long before blockchains, the U.S. was the very last of the major industrial countries to establish a central bank. The Federal Reserve System was created in 1913, more than a century after the Bank of England was established and most big European countries had their own central banks as well. Even then, the Fed was established somewhat reluctantly after a series of financial crises.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist. Rodney Ramcharan is a professor of finance and economics at the University of Southern California.  Prior to the establishment of the Federal Reserve, banking in the U.S. operated like DeFi does today: a kind of “Wild West” with little regulation and no lender of last resort. As a result, a crisis at one bank could quickly lead to contagion at others. The specific crisis that triggered the creation of the Federal Reserve came from a highly leveraged short squeeze that went wrong, leaving the financing company, the Knickerbocker Trust, illiquid. Knickerbocker’s collapse led to a broader stock market plunge and a wave of bank runs.  As in 1913, the idea that regulators had a role to play wasn’t necessarily popular with everyone. The argument then, as it is now, is the same: Bank crises are painful, but they are a form of market discipline, and crypto ecosystems, because they lack central banks, offer a higher standard of discipline and performance.  Crypto was supposed to be better than 19th century banks. The extreme transparency that blockchain technology enables should have made it clear which funds and firms were operating on the edge, exposed to risky products. Four factors came together to make it hard for a transparent, disciplined market to emerge.  Four factors  First, many companies and protocols have started to blend on-chain DeFi with off-chain but still unregulated centralized finance (CeFi). Instead of on-chain components that should be clear and transparent, the trail dead-ends in off-chain assets that are unknown or, worse, pledged to multiple owners. If an asset is pledged as collateral on-chain, that’s entirely visible to others. If the same asset is pledged off-chain, however, a firm might have liabilities far in excess of what people can determine by looking at on-chain data.  Consequently, if the firm doesn’t share that information, assessments made based on-chain data will be dangerously incomplete. Some of this was certainly out-and-out fraud. Much of it was evidence of how badly some firms scaled as they failed to segregate funds or monitor their own processes. It will likely be many months before some of the biggest bankruptcies are fully reported and investigated for us to find out.  Maturing the DeFi sector matters because it is the future of banking.  Second, transparency has its limits. It’s all well and good that fully decentralized and on-chain systems are readable by end users. That doesn’t mean end users can understand what they are buying or how to evaluate the risks. Only a tiny fraction of crypto buyers have the technical knowledge (never mind the time) to fully understand the most complex DeFi protocols. In short, as in traditional banking, end users or depositors are dispersed and lack the monitoring expertise to sufficiently discipline these institutions.  Not only are most users not equipped to understand protocols, you cannot have a “flight to quality” without effective benchmarks and other standards for on-chain and off-chain financial services. Banks are subject to liquidity and capital quality standards established by regulators and the results are published.  Finally, markets are not rational in the short run. A speculative frenzy sent everything upwards in the first part of the cycle in early 2021 and despair led people to liquidate quickly in the plunge, which began in November 2021 and continued through much of 2022. Reason may prevail over time, but, in the moment, investors tend not to behave rationally. The automated and interconnected nature of DeFi may accelerate the cascade of panic as well.  Read more: Why DeFi Might Be Safer Than Traditional Finance  It is definitely true that some very well-governed DeFi protocols came through the worst of this crypto winter with little damage. MakerDAO, is a good example. Maker – a DeFi lending system that issues the DAI stablecoin – only briefly de-pegged from the dollar and recovered quickly. The other category of firms that have held up well are CeFi firms that have aggressively courted regulators and auditors with an eye on the long game. The reporting rigor required to get a Big 4 auditor or to go public on a U.S. stock exchange is a powerful incentive for organizations.  Maturing the DeFi sector matters because it is the future of banking. And banking crises do much more systematic damage to the economy than other industry problems. The purpose of financial systems is (or should be) to channel capital to firms that make investments and drive productivity and growth in the economy. When they stop working, the effects hit across the whole economy. The 1907 banking crisis in the U.S. led to a decline in industrial production of 11% and a drop in imports of 26%. By way of comparison, this is about the same level of decline that occurred in the global financial crisis in 2008.  While the impact of financial crises may not have changed dramatically before and after the creation of the Federal Reserve, the frequency did. In the 19th century, the U.S. had banking crises and panics in 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1884, 1893 and 1896 – and nearly every one of those led to a recession. In the 20th century, however, we had just one major crisis, the Great Depression. So far in the 21st century, we’ve also had one major crisis, the Global Financial Crisis, though its impact was far smaller than the Great Depression, thanks to the vision and insights of then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.  For blockchain business ecosystems, the lessons are clear: Without embracing regulatory compliance, government-backed insurance models and fiat currencies built atop professionally run central banks have no viable future. Even the best-run firms will not be able to embrace nearly any level of acceptable risk required to produce a decent return or multiply the value of capital. And without that, there’s no real future for DeFi.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Paul Brody, Rodney Ramcharan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/12/theres-no-future-for-defi-without-regulation,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42411369,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQ64,1662993552,A Stable Asset to Law Enforcement,"Much has been written about the benefits of secure, asset-backed stablecoins – as distinguished from “unstablecoins” like terraUSD (UST) – as powerful tools for promoting financial inclusion, facilitating payments and driving the Web3 economy. But what is less known is that the leading U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins – tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC) – are also powerful tools for fighting crime. Indeed, the issuers of these tokens have become critical partners of law enforcement seeking to trace and freeze illicit proceeds in real time before bad actors cash out and reap the rewards of their crimes.  Jason Weinstein is the director of the Blockchain Alliance and the co-chair of both the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency group and the Investigations and White Collar group at Steptoe.  Why is a stablecoin like USDT so valuable to cops, as opposed to criminals? It’s because of tether’s ability not just to follow the money but to freeze it – anywhere, at any time, in any wallet. Regardless of how bad actors obtained the USDT – and even if held in self-hosted wallets – Tether, the stablecoin's issuer can disable those tokens so the bad actors cannot move them or cash them out. Circle, one of the companies behind USDC, has the ability to do the same pursuant to appropriate legal process. This is a remarkably powerful tool for investigations of all types of crimes, as well as terrorism financing and other national security threats. (Full disclosure: Tether and Coinbase [COIN] are clients of my law firm, Steptoe.)  The founding ethos of cryptocurrency was that the flow of money should be unstoppable. However, like other responsible participants in this ecosystem, Tether will intervene in response to valid law enforcement requests in order to combat criminal activity. As just one example, in the past few months Tether has implemented approximately two dozen freezes totaling tens of millions of USDT at the request of U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors in a fast-moving, high-profile cybercrime/national security investigation, working with prosecutors around the clock to execute the freezes in real time. Tether, which is based overseas and does not operate in the U.S, provides this assistance voluntarily based on valid law enforcement requests. Numerous DOJ prosecutors have praised Tether for its proactive assistance and strong support for DOJ investigations, and observed that Tether represents the antithesis of “jurisdictional arbitrage.”  Indeed, as a sign of the growing importance of DOJ’s partnership with Tether, the FBI has asked Tether to make an exception to its U.S.-customer prohibition and allow the FBI itself to be a Tether customer.  Tether’s and Circle’s commitment to support law enforcement while protecting users and their privacy is nothing new. Since 2015, I have had the privilege of leading the Blockchain Alliance, a nonprofit public-private partnership co-founded by the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center. The Alliance is made up of more than 150 participating digital asset companies and government agencies in the U.S. and around the world, dedicated to the mission of working together to prevent, detect, and address criminal activity involving digital assets.  The Alliance serves as a resource for law enforcement and regulators, providing education, training, and technical assistance to help government agencies respond to challenges faced during investigations. Through the Alliance, companies and government agencies engage in dialogue about technical issues, policy questions and other areas of concern. The overall goals of the Alliance are to make the digital asset ecosystem more secure, build trust between industry and government, promote compliance, and foster the growth of this transformative technology. Coinbase and Circle (the co-founders of the Centre Consortium, which launched USDC) and Tether are long-time members of the Alliance.  As policymakers focus on approaches to regulate asset-backed stablecoins, it is increasingly common to hear discussions about the need to protect consumers and financial markets. Both are unquestionably important goals. But no discussion of stablecoin regulation is complete without a fuller understanding of the important role of the two leading U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, USDT and USDC, in promoting financial integrity and protecting national security and public safety.",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT | USDC,Jason Weinstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/12/a-stable-asset-to-law-enforcement,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Ethereum Merge To PoS Di lorio made his remarks a few days before the anticipated switchover of the Ethereum blockchain from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system to a quicker, more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. However, some influential business people think that PoW has plenty of room. Before the Merge, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, purchased ETH for millions of dollars and advocated for a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain to maintain PoW consensus. Proof-of-Work may not have the backing it needs to continue to be a force, according to Di lorio, current CEO and creator of Decentral and Jaxx. It takes into account &apos;the time and effort that the Ethereum [Foundation] has invested&apos; as well as the quantity of &apos;important actors who consider PoS a superior approach.&apos; Di lorio noted that it had been evident since the inception of Ethereum that the network would eventually switch to a PoS protocol.

42422357,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kIZh,1662990951,"First Mover Americas: Countdown's On for Ethereum Merge, but Price Is Slipping Versus Bitcoin","Price Point: The clock is ticking toward Ethereum's shift to a more energy-efficient system, known as the Merge. The landmark transition is now expected to occur on Wednesday, but the price of the ether was lower Monday. Bitcoin, by contrast, rose above $22,000, its highest price since mid-August.  Market Moves: There's a lot of hoopla surrounding the Ethereum Merge. But the price of ether can't seem to break away from bitcoin, Omkar Godbole reports. The ratio between the two prices has topped out around 0.08 multiple times since May 2018.  Chart of the Day: Historically, during monetary-policy cycles, prices for risky assets haven't rallied until after the Federal Reserve's first cut.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  It’s a big week for the crypto industry as digital-asset traders await the Ethereum blockchain’s landmark Merge expected later this week – a potentially historic shift to a “proof-of-stake” system that’s supposed to be 99% more energy efficient than the current “proof-of-work” system that Bitcoin uses.  Key questions include whether the new technology will work as intended and also what the impact might be from a potential revolt or “fork” by crypto miners who have their livelihoods and equipment invested in proof-of-work. It’s such a big deal that Google has added a countdown clock. (That suggests the switchover – a function of the speed and timing of the current blockchain – will happen on Wednesday.)  “You are going to see a lot of people coming out of the woodwork and trying to do something around this major event that is happening now in order for them to capitalize somehow and push an agenda or push a particular fork that comes out of this,” Anthony Di Iorio, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday.  The price of ether (ETH), the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, was down 0.9% over the past 24 hours to $1,755.  Bitcoin (BTC), for its part, could be due for fresh price volatility as the U.S. government releases its monthly consumer price index, a key gauge of inflation, on Tuesday. The report is expected to show the rate of price increases in August slowed from July’s elevated rate, reflecting softness in the prices for gasoline, airfares, hotels and used cars, though food prices were higher.  As reported on Friday by Jocelyn Yang, bitcoin has recently been trading more closely in sync with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index of large U.S. stocks. The largest cryptocurrency was up 3.1% over the past 24 hours to about $22,311, its highest price since Aug. 19.  CoinDesk Market Index  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad composite of 148 digital assets unveiled last week, was up 1.2%, led by Ribbon Finance’s RBN token and Solana’s SOL. Losers included two of last week’s biggest pumpers, Terra’s LUNA and the retired-but-still-trading luna classic, or LUNC.  Near Protocol (NEAR) tokens also rose as First Mover lead writer Lyllah Ledesma broke the news that code overseer Near Foundation announced a $100 million ecosystem fund on Monday.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures were higher, and the U.S. dollar index fell for a second day. The speculation is that a slowdown in inflation would relieve pressure prices for risky assets, because central banks might be able to ease up their aggressive campaigns to tighten monetary policy.

Market Moves  Ether Lags Bitcoin As Ethereum Merge Nears. Here's Why  By Omkar Godbole  With the U.S. dollar restrained and the Ethereum blockchain's software upgrade known as the Merge almost here, stars seem to be aligned in favor of ether (ETH). And yet, the native token of Ethereum has been underperforming bitcoin (BTC) since Friday.  While bitcoin has rallied 15% to $22,300 since Friday, ether has lagged, gaining just 7% to $1,750, according to CoinDesk data.  Ether's underperformance stems from traders rotating money out of ETH and into BTC, some observers told CoinDesk. In contrast, others blamed caution ahead of the Merge and increased interest in buying the staked ether (stETH) token.  ETH/BTC triggers rotation of money out of ETH  ""With the ETH/BTC ratio trading back to previous highs, some have started to unwind their long ETH/short BTC trade, and this has caused a +10% rally in BTC. Beta adjusted, bitcoin has outperformed ether during the last week,"" Markus Thielen, chief investment officer at British Virgin Islands-based IDEG Asset Management, said in an email.  The ETH/BTC ratio topped 0.085 on Sept. 7, which was its highest level since December, amounting to a 73% rally from July lows, as traders piled into ether ahead of the long-awaited Merge.  The momentum has weakened since then, however, perhaps with traders lightening their ETH long and BTC short positions. That typically happens when an asset runs into key resistance after a strong rally. The level of 0.08 has capped the upside multiple times since May 2018.     Lewis Harland, a researcher at Decentral Park Capital, made a similar observation, citing a rebound in bitcoin's dominance rate from long-held support as a catalyst for the movement of money out of ETH and into BTC.  ""With bitcoin dominance at 39% and its chart showing a bullish RSI divergence, traders seem to be moving money from BTC to ETH,"" Harland said, referring to the relative strength index. ""Thirty-nine percent has been the BTC dominance floor since 2021.""  Read the full story here.  Chart of The Day  Risk Assets Likely to Bottom After First Fed Rate Cut, Past Data Shows  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin jumped nearly 10% last week, registering its best performance since March.  But it may be too early to say the cryptocurrency has bottomed out, as historically, U.S. equity markets have turned higher after the first Fed rate cut.  Bitcoin tends to move in line with stocks.  Strategists at ING expect the Fed to cut rates in June 2023.  Latest Headlines  Bank of America Says the Ethereum Blockchain’s Upgrade May Lead to Greater Institutional Adoption of Ether: Investors who are barred from buying tokens that run on proof-of-work systems may be able to buy ether after the blockchain switches to proof-of-stake, the bank said.

This recent news follows the announcement of the Vasil upgrade which aims to improve usability and scalability. A simple Twitter search of ADA will result with tweets of happy and confident traders and investors. &apos;Here is the White House energy report showcasing #Cardano as the largest proof of stake blockchain in the world. Probably something,&apos; said Dan Gombardello in a recent tweet. At the day of the announcement, ADA&apos;s price went up 7.43 percent with a high of $0.5243 before stabilizing at the range $0.5215 to $0.4992. Using the regression trend tool, we can clearly see an uptrend forming even several days before the White House announcement. This uptrend formed clearly after the recent crash in the early half of August. Cardano Gets Some Lift From White House Announcement During this crash, the coin experienced a 25.18 percent drop in price. It continued stabilizing at the $0.4354 support line. Trade volumes have also risen since the announcement at 3.63 million. This solid but slow uptrend coupled by the announcement further solidified confidence in the coin. Trade indicators also point to buy signals as the price further stabilizes at the 50% percent Fib level which sits at the $0.4992 range.

The address has now moved 607 bitcoins in stolen funds so far since the exploits.  Tracking tool MistTrack showed the attack swapped more than 1,000 ethers to 80 renBTC, a representation of bitcoin on Ethereum, in the early hours of Monday. The attacker then converted the 80 renBTC to actual bitcoin.  The move came weeks after the same address converted stolen funds to more than 300 renBTC over several days in July. The attackers used the Ren Gateway, a bridge, to make these moves. A bridge in blockchain technology is software that allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchains.  Cream Finance didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  The lending service was previously hit by multiple exploits – the latest being a $130 million attack in late 2021 – which damaged its reputation in crypto circles and contributed to a 94% decline in the price of its native CREAM token. That attack was one of the first “flash loan” exploits in the crypto sector. It involved 68 different assets and cost over nine ethers in gas, or transactions fees.  Flash loans are a popular way for attackers to gain funds to conduct exploits on decentralized finance (DeFi) systems. Such loans allow traders to borrow unsecured funds from lenders using smart contracts instead of third parties.  In April, the Beanstalk stablecoin protocol was drained of $182 million in a flash loan attack, and in June, more than $1.2 million was taken from Inverse Finance. In July, Nirvana was drained of $3.5 million in a similar attack.  Cream had previously floated proposals to make those affected by the exploits whole.

42422353,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kIJh,1662987600,White House Crypto Mining Report Draws Praise From Advocates and Critics Alike,"The Biden administration’s new findings on bitcoin (BTC) mining’s environmental impact united industry advocates and critics: Both sides declared their views had support from the highest levels of the U.S. government.  On Thursday, the White House’s Office for Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) released a much-anticipated 45-page report on bitcoin (BTC) mining. It detailed the pros and cons of the industry’s impact on the environment and energy grids, calling for more research so that federal agencies can come up with standards to minimize harm.  If these measures prove inefficient, the report said, the administration and Congress should consider limiting or eliminating energy-intensive technologies like proof-of-work, the system that powers the Bitcoin blockchain and, for now, Ethereum.  Bitcoin mining in particular has faced criticism for its energy usage and carbon emissions, but the industry has argued that it can actually support the world’s transition to renewables.  Read more: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?  Two sides of the same coin  Advocates said the report highlights the positive potential of bitcoin mining, whereas critics noted the OSTP tried to debunk some of the miners’ arguments.  “Every major bitcoin influencer going on national TV should be hammering the point that the White House report found that PoW mining could yield positive results for climate change,” tweeted Joe Carlassare, who co-chairs the Cryptocurrency, Blockchain and FinTech group at law firm SmithAmundsen.  The White House report said that bitcoin mining “can be good for the environment” and is “incredible progress,” Dennis Porter, who advocates for bitcoin mining as co-founder and chairman of the non-profit Satoshi Action Fund, said on Twitter. He posted parts of the reports that said crypto mining could be used to help capture otherwise vented methane to support his statements.  On the other side of the debate, the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a non-governmental organization (NGO) that has been advocating to change the Bitcoin network code to reduce its energy consumption, also praised the report.  “Today’s report confirms that digital assets are using a significant and growing amount of electricity, and contributing more climate pollution,” a statement on their site read.  Alex de Vries is one of the industry’s most vocal critics and has argued that bitcoin mining is a “dirty” industry that contributes to global emissions and waste, in research that is heavily contested by the industry. He tweeted that the report actually “dismantles most of the beloved talking points by bitcoin influencers.” Research from de Vries was quoted in the report.  For example, the section on methane flare-powered mining “immediately takes aim at a bitcoiner favorite: ‘Mining operations that replace existing methane flares would not likely affect [carbon dioxide] emissions,’” de Vries said.  The middle ground  Others saw the White House’s attitude in the report as more of a middle-of-the-road approach that is still taking shape  The report was praised by some mining industry insiders and experts for its research, particularly with regard to how it considered the potentially climate-positive effects of flared-gas mining and how it can support the development of renewable energy.  The OSTP produced a report that showed “a nuanced understanding of the implications of #crypto for climate and energy,” tweeted Jesse Morris, CEO and founder of Energy Web, a company trying to build transparency around mining’s energy use.  Elliot David, who is head of sustainability engagement at Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP), said that “the bulk of the report” is “pretty positive.” It signals regulators want to learn more “and are willing to work directly with the industry as they've done with other sectors, which is all we are asking for,” he said.  Troy Cross, a professor of philosophy and humanities at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, and a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, tweeted that even though the report might look bad, it shows the Biden administration is trying to gather all the data necessary to make sound policy.  It “represents a shift in a very good, truth-responsive direction,” contrary to the “fear-mongering” of earlier politicians’ moves on the industry, such as the letter sent to the Environmental Protection Agency by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in July, Cross said.  The report also lays out what concerns the administration, which is making miners’ jobs easier, Cross said: “We show the worries are unfounded. We tick all the boxes.”  “As soon as this issue is fully studied and the rhetoric starts to fade, it will become apparent that proof-of-work mining is a boon to resilient, abundant, renewable energy,” Rachel Silverstein, general counsel and senior vice president of compliance at bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK), told CoinDesk.  Silverstein added that the firm looks forward to working with the White House to set standards for the industry.  New York-based bitcoin miner Bit Digital’s chief strategist, Samir Tabar, said the company applauds “the administration's ambition to combat climate change,” and recognizes that there have been “growing pains” as the industry has boomed in the U.S. However, he found parts of the report to be “myopic.”  The OSTP didn’t mention the “overarching benefits” the industry can bring to local communities, such as jobs, and that increased energy use, which the report found problematic, “is often a precursor, or prerequisite, to economic development.”  “We firmly support regulating the less eco-friendly aspects of the industry, but well intentions must be fully informed and carefully balanced to yield effective policy,"" Tabar said.  Read more: The End of the Texas Bitcoin Mining Gold Rush  The backlash  Mining insiders, however, took issue with other aspects of the report, including the possibility of banning the consensus algorithms that underpin bitcoin mining as it exists right now.  Should the standards “prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high-energy-intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining,"" the report said.  Mitch Klee, who writes for Bitcoin Magazine and was previously with Compass Mining, said that “banning PoW is banning GDP and innovation at the expense of the American people. We already know what happens at the end of this story. Re: China.”  Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining service firm Luxor Technologies, urged U.S.-based miners in a tweet to learn about other regions such as Northern Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia.  In a LinkedIn post, Lee Bratcher, founder and president of the Texas Blockchain Council, a state industry association and lobbying group, also picked out the possibility of banning the industry.  In his view, an attempt to do that with an executive order would be “on questionable legal ground” and Congress “has trouble passing legislation in general … [C]ertainly a ban on PoW mining, with many elected officials from both parties supporting the industry, the chances of this are quite small.”  SBP’s David said the office likely added that in order to “be implacable, because they know that any attempt to eliminate PoW will be infeasible and unpopular.”  However, according to SBP’s David, die-hard bitcoin advocates are unlikely to reach any other conclusion: “Unless the OSTP came out and said, ‘bitcoin is going to save the planet from climate change’ and offered total support of the industry, the community will perceive it as an attack,” which is understandable because the industry has been so villainized, he said.  “I worry that this notion of us ‘needing to be on offense’ will make it difficult to work with environmental experts,” David said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/12/white-house-crypto-mining-report-draws-praise-from-advocates-and-critics-alike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15e32fcf3e6ee12fb523f32201dfbd76cae5702b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422358,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kIXh,1662984487,Ether Lags Bitcoin as Ethereum Merge Nears; Here's Why,"With the U.S. dollar restrained and the Ethereum blockchain's software upgrade known as the Merge almost here, stars seem to be aligned in favor of ether (ETH). And yet, the native token of Ethereum has been underperforming bitcoin (BTC) since Friday.  While bitcoin has rallied 15% to $22,300 since Friday, ether has lagged, gaining just 7% to $1,750, according to CoinDesk data.  Ether's underperformance stems from traders rotating money out of ETH and into BTC, some observers told CoinDesk. In contrast, others blamed caution ahead of the Merge and increased interest in buying the staked ether (stETH) token.  ETH/BTC triggers rotation of money out of ETH  ""With the ETH/BTC ratio trading back to previous highs, some have started to unwind their long ETH/short BTC trade, and this has caused a +10% rally in BTC. Beta adjusted, bitcoin has outperformed ether during the last week,"" Markus Thielen, chief investment officer at British Virgin Islands-based IDEG Asset Management, said in an email.  The ETH/BTC ratio topped 0.085 on Sept. 7, which was its highest level since December, amounting to a 73% rally from July lows, as traders piled into ether ahead of the long-awaited Merge.  Read more: The Final Countdown to the Ethereum Merge Has Officially Begun  The momentum has weakened since then, however, perhaps with traders lightening their ETH long and BTC short positions. That typically happens when an asset runs into key resistance after a strong rally. The level of 0.08 has capped the upside multiple times since May 2018.  Lewis Harland, a researcher at Decentral Park Capital, made a similar observation, citing a rebound in bitcoin's dominance rate from long-held support as a catalyst for the movement of money out of ETH and into BTC.  ""With bitcoin dominance at 39% and its chart showing a bullish RSI divergence, traders seem to be moving money from BTC to ETH,"" Harland said, referring to the relative strength index. ""Thirty-nine percent has been the BTC dominance floor since 2021.""  Bitcoin's dominance rate refers to the leading cryptocurrency's share in the broader crypto market. The dominance rate crashed from roughly 49% to 39% in nearly three months to Sept. 8 as the impending Merge drew a demand for ether.  At press time, the dominance rate stood at 41%, with the bullish divergence of the relative strength index, a popular gauge of price momentum, signaling scope for a continued rise.  Caution ahead of the Merge  Some investors seem worried about the Merge running into problems or failing to live up to expectations.  ""The funding rate disparity between ETH and BTC has switched, as investors hedge themselves against the possibility of an underwhelming receipt of the Merge,"" James Webb, research associate at London-based data aggregator and index provider CryptoCompare, said.  ""In doing so, there is now a resultant decrease in short interest in BTC – also allowing bitcoin to continue to outpace ether in returns,"" Webb added.  Read more: Ethereum Merge: What You Need to Know  The funding rate refers to the cost of holding long or short (bullish or bearish) positions in the perpetual futures market.  While the probability of the Merge failing is quite low, it may not immediately bring a store-of-value appeal to ether, as trading firm QCP Capital recently warned.  Increased preference for stETH  According to IDEG's Thielen, traders are increasingly looking to purchase Lido's staked ether token at a discount, taking away buy side pressures from the ether spot market.  Early this quarter, traders snapped up ether and sold futures to collect a potential Ethereum fork token ETHPoW for free without directional risks. However, the incentive to take the so-called ETHPOW trade has now weakened, and traders could make a higher return by snapping up stETH while heading into the Merge.  ""Notably, by some estimates, the 'expected' PoW airdrop was initially priced at $90-100 and now is expected to be just around $19-27 (1.1%-1.5%),"" Thielen said, referring to proof-of-work. ""The discount between staked Ethereum on Lido vs. Ethereum has now narrowed to just -2.8% and might offer better value for Ethereum investors as any PoW fork will unlikely lead to a significant airdrop.""  At press time, stETH was changing hands at 0.974 ETH on decentralized exchange Curve, up from the low three-month low of 0.955 ETH reached early last week.  ""Volumes for stETH (on Lido) have dramatically increased from just $6-8 million to $44 million by end of last week. As prices were rising, this is a sign that many traders would rather own the stETH than participate in the airdrop,"" Thielen noted.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/12/ether-lags-bitcoin-as-ethereum-merge-nears-here-is-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e178bf21856e413fd4037ade3610f9ae7278aef-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Merge is the first of five upgrades planned for the Ethereum blockchain, and lays the path for the Surge.  The notable reduction in energy consumption after the Merge may allow some institutional investors to purchase ether (ETH) for the first time – those who were barred from buying tokens that run on blockchains that use the PoW consensus mechanism, the report said.  “The ability to stake ETH and generate a higher-quality yield (lower credit and liquidity risk) as a validator or through a staking service rather than on black-box lending/borrowing applications may also drive institutional adoption,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  Bank of America says that a higher-quality yield also has ramifications for the Web3 ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps). A dapp is an application that uses blockchain technology to keep users’ data out of the hands of the organizations behind it.  A decentralized insurance protocol such as Nexus Mutual needs to generate a return on its reserves to allow it to become a feasible alternative to traditional insurance companies, the bank said. Insurance companies normally invest their reserves in corporate and government debt, but instruments with similar risk and reward characteristics are difficult to find in the digital asset ecosystem. Staking on Ethereum may be the closest alternative, it added.

Read more: Will a Proof-of-Stake Ethereum Lead to More Centralization?  Di lorio’s comments came just days before the Ethereum blockchain’s expected migration from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a faster, more energy efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Yet, some industry leaders believe there’s ample room for PoW.  Tron founder Justin Sun has bought millions of dollars worth of ether (ETH) ahead of the Merge and is campaigning for a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain that would sustain PoW consensus.  Di lorio, who is now CEO and founder of Decentral and Jaxx, said proof-of-work may not have the support it needs to remain a force, considering “the amount of time and energy that’s been spent by the Ethereum [Foundation]” and the number of “major players who consider PoS a superior system.  Di lorio added that since Ethereum’s creation, it was clear the network would one day move to a PoSprotocol.  “That was a very important thing that was discussed since the very beginning and was implemented and now, it’s being carried out,” he said.  The “difficulty bomb” developers had placed in the code was a warning sign to miners that one day the transition would happen, Di lorio said. The difficulty bomb, as explained by Ethhub, is intended to “freeze” the chain by increasing “the difficulty level of puzzles” for the proof-of-work algorithm, which would result in reduced block production times and reduced rewards for miners.  ""[Proof-of-work] is going to go by the wayside, but not before people are able to capitalize on that situation,” Di lorio said.

Some economists expect the data to show inflation slowed for a second straight month in August, figures that might influence the Federal Reserve to turn less hawkish in its outlook.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 stock index gained as much as 1.69% Monday, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.83%, and Germany’s DAX added 1.57%. The euro jumped to a more than three-week peak against the dollar as European Central Bank officials pushed for further aggressive monetary tightening.  Two months of falling gasoline prices – down 8% in July and 13% in August – could fuel another year-on-year decline in the consumer price index report, economists at crypto fund GlobalBlock said in an email to CoinDesk.  In the past 24 hours, bitcoin (BTC) has gained 3% to more than $22,000, adding to its 13% rally last week. It dropped to as low as $18,700 last week. Ether (ETH) traded at just under $1,800, while solana (SOL) and BNB tokens added 5%.  Near Protocol (NEAR) tokens also rose as code overseer Near Foundation announced a $100 million ecosystem fund on Monday. Elsewhere, luna classic (LUNC) lost 20% during the same time period as the hype around a recent fundamental catalyst cooled.  Analysts at trading firm Exness said in a Monday note that while bitcoin benefited from the fall in the dollar value as investors moved toward riskier assets, the asset could see a “new round of price corrections” if the U.S. inflation data turns out to be worse than forecast.  The analysts, however, say they expect ether to outperform bitcoin in the coming weeks if the Ethereum's Merge software update goes as planned. Peers such as cardano (ADA) and solana could also see some selling pressure from ether’s progress, they said.  Matt Senter, a co-founder of bitcoin rewards app Lolli, told CoinDesk that bitcoin’s 10% recovery from last week's nadir, which was its lowest level since mid-June, reflected the leading cryptocurrency's resilience amid adverse market conditions.  “While bitcoin’s recent price movements have made headlines, it has remained relatively stable and strong this summer, trading consistently within a band of $18,00-$24,000,” Senter said. “While bitcoin is down by more than 50% from its all-time high, it continues to perform strongly compared to more than a third of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, which are down by roughly 90% from their respective all-time highs.”  Headwinds for bitcoin’s continued recovery remain, however, he said.  “September has historically been a bleak period for bitcoin’s price; during the same five-year period, bitcoin has averaged an 8.5% drop in September,” Senter said, cautioning that the Fed’s projections of persistent inflation and further rate increases could cause the “hyper-sensitive” crypto and equity markets to see price fluctuations.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LUNC | NEAR,BTC | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING | NEAR,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/12/analysts-warn-of-headwinds-as-cryptos-gain-ahead-of-cpi-data-luna-classic-pares-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b88f3bd02529b906ce58e139827e7346cf1e2adf-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The innovation behind virtual reality has been around for a while and is only now starting to gain ground. Most of the current success of the metaverse can be attributed to the growth of gaming in the space that has seen players earn while enjoying this blossoming virtual reality. However, as more projects come out, it has begun to be a repeat of the same thing, with users in the space becoming bored with repetitive titles showing little creativity. Primarily, there have been those who have found success with these same tedious systems, but the current shift in the market suggests that a change needs to happen if the metaverse is to retain current players and onboard new ones.

42422347,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kILh,1662976800,Near Blockchain Moves Ahead With Phase One of Sharding Upgrade,"Layer 1 protocol Near on Monday initiated a key phase of its “sharding” upgrade meant to increase the blockchain’s processing speed, and slashed the price for stakers hoping to participate in how the network runs.  Near, which launched in 2019 with then-unrealized plans to boost transaction speeds by splitting its network into parallel processors (so-called sharding), kicked off Phase 1 or its “Nightshade” playbook facilitated by Near contributor Pagoda. This phase sees the introduction of specialist “chunk-only validators” that feed into the sharding mechanism but are easier to set up than full nodes.  Paired with an 86% decrease in the collateral requirements for all participants of the proof-of-stake chain, the changes seek to radically lower the barrier to entry for Near validators and thus increase decentralization.  “The more users the network gets, the more decentralized the network gets as well. This enables the ability to kind of continue adding more validators as there's more demand for the network,” said Near co-founder Illia Polosukhin.  Pagoda estimated in a press release that the changes could lead to 200 additional validators joining the 100-strong network. Polosukhin was more iron-clad, stating in an interview with CoinDesk that Near “will go from 100 to 300 active” validators. Regardless, Polosukhin claimed the new validators will increase decentralization on Near.  Read more: What Is Near Protocol and How Does It Work?  Sharding is a chain-splicing mechanism that Near utilizes to grow the network’s output. According to Polosukhin, separating the chain into smaller chains makes the network more efficiently process transactions.  Near’s plan to shard the network will be done through a four step program called Nightshade. Earlier this year, it began Phase 0 of sharding the network, and will complete the upcoming phases of the upgrade in 2023.  Near, a proof-of-stake layer 1, has been historically seen as a threat to Ethereum due to its cheaper and faster transactions. However, the upcoming Merge, which will take the network from its current proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake, brings competition back into the limelight.  Polosukhin said that although Near’s vision was “aligned” with Ethereum since the chain was developed in 2018, it hasn’t “delivered on scalability.” Through its sharding upgrades, Near seeks to make a scalable, efficient network for those who interact in the ecosystem.  “Near’s vision is that you should not have limited throughput,” said Polosukhin. “You should be able to continue expanding demand by adding more capacity.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | TRADING | NEAR,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/12/near-blockchain-moves-ahead-with-phase-one-of-sharding-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0224cf2d6420273ca493cc309cb3e87388a1d21b-4503x3377.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422342,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kI7h,1662976800,Near Protocol Forms Working Group to Promote DeFi Governance,"The Near Protocol, a blockchain network on which developers can build decentralized applications (dapps), is forming a working group to set standards for self-governance.  The initiative, called the Near Digital Collective (NDC), is aimed at further decentralizing the ecosystem’s decision-making by moving it onto its native blockchain, according to an announcement on Monday. The move will make the Near community more transparent and fairer, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk.  Self-governance initiatives in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, where developers from around the world are building financial applications that cut out traditional intermediaries, are having a moment. Usually, these initiatives are run by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which are blockchain-based organizations or companies where members who hold a native digital token can vote on key business and management decisions.  Although the NDC will move decision-making on-chain, and Near tokens have been set aside to function as the governance token for the collective, the protocol’s co-founder Illia Polosukhin avoided calling it a DAO during an interview with CoinDesk.  “I'm usually thinking in blockchain terms, so it’s more of a protocol of how people interact and make decisions. And then we codify some of it in smart contracts, part of it will be codified in the constitution, part of it will be codified in the processes built around it,” Polosukhin said. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute transactions when preset conditions are met.  As for the Near constitution, Polosukhin explained that the NDC will work to create and ratify a set of shared values and basic rights for all community members. The collective will also set up governance frameworks and plans, establish a complementary legal structure for risk mitigation and publish engagement guidelines to curb bad behavior from community members that could harm the network.  “It's really easy for these kinds of communities to become somewhat toxic. And so there's a whole workstream [looking at ways to] enable positive and constructive behavior,” Polosukhin said.  While the NDC constitution group has 40 members so far, Near is also looking to attract interested parties from diverse disciplines like political science to law to join the collective, Polosukhin said.  The Near ecosystem has about 550,000 community members, 4,000 of whom are developers, according to its website. Entities like Web3 startup Pagoda and move-to-earn platform Sweat Economy are built on Near.

""There are several risks associated with the Merge, which could be detrimental to assets held on the Ethereum network (including DeFi platforms) if they were to materialize,"" Aaron Loh Cheng Lee, one of the interim judicial managers, said in a statement to creditors on Saturday. DeFi refers to decentralized finance, a term for software-controlled financial applications.  According to the statement, a particular risk of the Merge, which is set to take place on Thursday, relates to so-called pricing oracles, which feed data to the smart contracts that govern DeFi protocols. The Merge may lead the oracles to ""give out erroneous prices during the transition,"" leading smart contracts to automatically liquidate the company's assets.  Under the Merge, Ethereum will shift to a proof-of-stake method of maintaining its network from a proof-of-work one. If the blockchain splits, or forks, so that a proof-of-work version continues to operate, it's possible the oracles will source pricing data from the wrong system.  ""One of the ways of mitigating such risks in advance of the Merge would be for Hodlnaut HK to unwind the tokens deployed on the DeFi platforms, which may result in material losses,"" Loh Cheng Lee said. Hodlnaut HK is one of the Singapore entity's operating companies.  Hodlnaut was placed under interim judicial management, a form of creditor protection and debt restructuring, on Aug. 30, three weeks after it froze withdrawals because of ""difficult market conditions."" The company was one of several that crumbled under the pressure of this year's crypto market downturn.

42422354,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kITh,1662973200,"A Bitcoin ETF Is Long Past Due, Crypto Lobbyists Say in New Report","The question of whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should be forced to permit spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETF) is now inching through the courts, but industry lobbyists are making another public push to declare the regulator is wrong in opposing the product.  The Chamber of Digital Commerce, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, commissioned a report set for release Monday that will accuse the SEC of harming U.S. investors by depriving them of a type of trading vehicle already available in other countries.  “It has determined that the American public cannot yet handle the responsibility of familiar, cost-effective, liquid, transparent and regulated access to the bitcoin markets,” according to the report. “The SEC continues to force U.S. investors who wish to invest in this transformative asset class into unregulated or foreign alternatives.”  A fund allowing investors to easily trade bitcoins has long been seen as a major step toward accessibility for an industry whose assets are still widely seen as overly esoteric and volatile for the general public. Such ETFs would plug the tokens into the same kind of packaged funds that have long allowed investors to dabble in highly tailored industry sectors, various flavors of bonds or wide stock indexes without locking down their money or incurring management fees.  Though the industry won approval for bitcoin (BTC) futures ETFs, 16 separate applicants have been denied in setting up a spot-market version – meaning funds that actually hold bitcoins. The agency has consistently cited the same concern: potential market manipulation.  The agency says it can approve an application when the product has “a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size.”  The Digital Chamber’s report says the SEC’s position is inconsistent with its past practices and has never budged even as the industry sought to answer agency objections.  Earlier this year, the SEC did approve a futures ETF from Teucrium that was filed under the same law that the spot ETF applications relied on, which has further sharpened frustrations for those seeking the spot funds. But SEC Chair Gary Gensler has argued that he’s fine with the futures ETFs under the law, because it enshrines certain consumer protections.  Still, this week’s report is unlikely to sway the regulator, which is preparing to defend its stance in court.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, Digital Chamber founder and CEO Perianne Boring said she believes the report is “the first comprehensive document to detail the arbitrary and capricious behavior” of the SEC in reviewing the myriad bitcoin ETF applications.  “Capturing the historical record in one place is crucial to building awareness and accountability for not only these specific denials, but the Commission’s treatment of the industry as a whole,” she said.  In a Monday interview on CoinDesk TV, Boring accused the SEC of trying to pick industry winners and losers.  “The SEC is discriminating against this asset class, holding it to a higher standard,” said Boring, who attributed to a “larger political agenda” at the agency.  “Chair Gensler has been very clear that he wants his authority expanded,” she said. “He's holding things like the bitcoin ETF hostage until he gets his way.”  UPDATE (Sept. 12, 2022, 15:51 UTC): Adds comments from Boring on CoinDesk TV",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/12/a-bitcoin-etf-is-long-past-due-crypto-lobbyists-say-in-new-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e4374a65aaefa8faacac748d5fa5cea0ecede6a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, with decentralization comes a lot of uncertainty. How can different blockchains connect? Can we find anything universal about them? It is clear that there are many dilemmas here, which is why blockchain interoperability has become a hot topic in the last few years. This phenomenon is bound to have a profound impact on the crypto sphere and beyond and will undoubtedly lead to more innovation and growth. But what is it? How does it work? More importantly, what does it mean for you? Let&apos;s find out! Blockchain Interoperability Explained Blockchain interoperability is a highly complex technology from a scientific point of view. However, what it does is simple — it allows different blockchains that operate independently to connect and communicate. Thanks to interoperability, blockchains can share data, information, and more. In other words, regular users get to use different blockchains without worrying about compatibility issues. For a better understanding, it&apos;s best to consider emails. When you send an email to someone, you don&apos;t have to worry about choosing the same provider the other person uses.

However, the streak of bullish candles takes a hit at the 200-day SMA as the uptrend struggles to beat the suddenly increased selling pressure. So, will the prices sustain above the psychological mark of $100 or take a bearish reversal to complete the head and shoulder pattern?

It applied to be put under judicial management on Aug. 13, five days after it froze withdrawals. Judicial management is a form of debt restructuring that sees an entity manage the business, property and assets of a distressed company. During the process the company is protected from legal proceedings from third parties.

42411077,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBzc4,1662962400,Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi? Hodlonaut and Wright Go to Trial to Find Out,"OSLO, Norway — Crypto Twitter personality Hodlonaut and Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who has long claimed to be the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, will face off in an Oslo courtroom on Monday to settle a years-long legal dispute.  The 7-day trial seeks to determine whether a series of Hodlonaut’s tweets in March 2019 – in which he wrote that Wright’s claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto were false, and called him a fraud and a scammer – are protected by freedom of speech in Norway.  The suit, brought by Hodlonaut, is one of two concurrent lawsuits between the two men over the tweets. Wright has also sued Hodlonaut (known in real life as Magnus Granath, but more commonly known in the crypto sphere by his pseudonym) in the United Kingdom. If Hodlonaut emerges victorious in Norway, Wright would be unable to collect damages for libel in connection to the tweets in the U.K..  Hodlonaut is far from the only person to question Wright’s claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto: Wright has been widely discredited, largely due to his refusal – or inability – to offer concrete proof that he is Satoshi.  Nor is Hodlonaut the first to face legal action for speaking out against Wright. Just last month, a verdict was reached in a similar libel suit brought by Wright against podcaster Peter McCormack, who called Wright a liar and a fraud in 2019.  Though a British court found that McCormack’s statements caused “serious harm” to Wright’s reputation, Wright was penalized for giving the judge “deliberately false evidence” – and awarded a single British pound in damages.  The suit against Craig Wright, explained  The trial in Norway, initiated by Hodlonaut, seeks a declaratory judgment (essentially a legally binding determination by a judge) that his tweets were protected by freedom of speech, as provided for in the Norwegian constitution.  If Hodlonaut wins his suit, it would prevent another, simultaneous libel suit initiated by Craig Wright against Hodlonaut in the United Kingdom from moving forward.  Hodlonaut filed the Norwegian suit in May 2019, after receiving a legal notice from Wright’s lawyers via Twitter two months earlier. The notice demanded that Hodlonaut “delete all tweets and other online or other publications in which [he] alleged that [Wright] had fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto,” as well as tweet a statement – written by Wright’s lawyers – apologizing to Wright and “accepting” him as the creator of Bitcoin.  In April 2019, Wright’s supporters placed a $5,000 bounty on Hodlonaut’s real-life identity, which was not known at the time. According to Hodlonaut, Wright’s lawyers petitioned Twitter to disclose his identity, while bounty hunters and private investigators simultaneously worked to dox him.  By mid-May of that year, Hodlonaut was outed as Magnus Granath after a private investigator posing as a police officer convinced his employer to turn over his phone number and other personal information. (Note: CoinDesk takes doxxing very seriously. We weighed the benefits of using Hodlonaut’s real name in our coverage of this case, and ultimately decided that, because his name is a matter of public record in an ongoing litigation, it made sense to include it – and the details of how it was discovered – in our coverage).  Anticipating a suit by Wright, Hodlonaut filed his own participation for declaratory judgment three days after he was doxxed. Less than a month later, Hodlonaut’s fears were confirmed when Wright’s legal team filed a libel suit against him in the U.K..  Over the convoluted course of the following two years, both Wright and Hodlonaut filed petitions to throw out each other’s suits, all of which were ultimately unsuccessful (and expensive).  Unintended consequences  The legal battle has also had unintended consequences outside of its impact on Wright and Hodlonaut’s lives – it also led to a wave of exchanges delisting BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision), the native token of the fork of Bitcoin created by Wright.  After the bounty was placed on Hodlonaut’s identity, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted “Craig Wright is not Satoshi. Anymore of this sh!t, we delist!”  Two days after his Twitter threat, CZ tweeted: “Craig Wright is [a] fraud…the real Satoshi can digitally sign any message to prove it. This is as simple as breathing for him/her. And we have the pub[lic] key. Until then, everyone is Satoshi, except Craig Wright!”  On April 15, 2019, three days after CZ’s initial threat, BSV was delisted from Binance.  The following day, Kraken announced it would follow suit in delisting BSV.  “The team behind Bitcoin SV have engaged in behavior completely antithetical to everything we at Kraken and the wider crypto community stands for,” the company wrote in a press announcement. “It started with fraudulent claims, escalating to threats and legal action, with the BSV team suing a number of people speaking out against them. The threats made last week to individual members of the community were the last straw.”  SLAPPing down critics  Wright’s libel suit against Hodlonaut is widely considered to be a SLAPP suit (an acronym for “strategic lawsuits against public participation”) meant to intimidate and censor both Hodlonaut and future critics from publicly opposing Wright.  Financially backed by online gambling magnate Calvin Ayre, who claims to be a billionaire, Wright has the means to pursue litigation that is financially burdensome – and for many people, impossible – to defend against.  Ayre has spoken openly about this: In April 2019, he tweeted, “No need to sue everyone, just waiting for a volunteer to bankrupt themselves trying to prove a negative and then letting Craig show the proof. Who will be this moron?”  Wright has avoided similar suits against outspoken critics with deeper pockets, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, who has openly and repeatedly called Wright a scammer.  The Bitcoin community has rallied around Hodlonaut, raising money for his legal defense through donations and auctions. At the time of publication, 70.7 bitcoins (worth around $1.5 million USD at press time) had been donated, along with $64,000 in fiat donations, from over 2,500 donors.  Though Wright has grounds to sue Hodlonaut in the United Kingdom – he has been a resident of London since 2015 – a more cynical take on Wright’s choice of venue is that he is much more likely to win a defamation suit there than he is in Norway or anywhere else.  Due to its strict libel laws that place the burden of proof on the defendant, rather than the claimant, the U.K. is famous for being the “libel tourism” capital of the world. Journalists and media personalities have historically been targeted by political leaders, companies and wealthy individuals.  With more money and without the burden of proving their critics wrong, the plaintiffs usually win – often resulting in substantial verdicts for the plaintiffs and, for the country, a chilling effect on the freedom of speech.  A history of litigation  Wright’s twin defamation suits against Hodlonaut and McCormack are not his first foray into the courtroom.  His claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto have been followed by a string of lawsuits, where Wright is often the plaintiff and occasionally the defendant.  His penchant for suing Bitcoin developers (demanding, among other things, that they give him access to funds stolen in the infamous Mt. Gox hack) and groups that host the Bitcoin white paper online led Block founder and CEO Jack Dorsey to set up a non-profit legal defense fund earlier this year.  In 2020, the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) was created by Block and joined by other tech companies, including Meta, to pool patents and preserve the industry’s open-source ethos.  In 2021, COPA filed a lawsuit against Wright over his attempts to copyright the Bitcoin white paper.  Last year, Wright also faced Ira Kleiman – the brother of Wright’s friend Dave Kleiman – who sued him in a Miami court over the ownership of Satoshi’s bitcoins. While the jury found that Wright and Kleiman were not business partners, and that Wright did not owe his estate any bitcoins (which he has not been able to prove ownership of, anyway), he was ordered to pay $100 million in compensatory damages for conversion (a type of theft) of intellectual property.  When CoinDesk asked Vel Freedman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, how much of that $100 million Wright has so far paid to the Kleiman estate, 9 months after the verdict was issued, Freedman answered:  “Not a dime.”",NEUTRAL,BSV,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BSV,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/12/who-can-say-who-is-not-satoshi-hodlonaut-and-wright-go-to-trial-to-find-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92860aca5a337acd6b4697eed3dbf8a6a384bd41-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prices  Bitcoin Remains Steady Above $21K  By James Rubin  Bitcoin held fast above its latest $21,000 threshold over the weekend as investors continued their hopeful wait for positive U.S. inflation data in the coming week.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at approximately $21,800, up about 1% and somewhat higher than where it began the weekend. BTC spiked more than 10% at one point on Friday amid market optimism that with prices starting to fall, the U.S. central bank would be able to ratchet back its current diet of robust interest rate increases and liquidity tightening next year.  While noting bitcoin's encouraging rebound from $18,500 earlier in the week, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital also said that such resurgences have not been unusual for cryptos during down markets. ""While bulls will welcome this bounce, it is important to note how continued bearish price action has intermittent relief rallies, especially as short position holders take profit,"" he said.  Ether recently sank about 1% but was still trading well above $1,700 level it regained late Thursday.

Equities  The crypto price surge tracked stocks, which ended a three-week losing streak on Friday with the tech-focused Nasdaq closing up 2.1% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively amid a lull in risk-off sentiment stemming from inflation optimism. The link between bitcoin (BTC) and equity prices, particularly tech stocks, is growing closer again.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday and economic observers widely expect another slight decline in inflation at least partly because of falling energy prices. The price of Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy markets, is now hovering around $90 per barrel, down roughly 25% since topping $123 in early June. July's 8.5% CPI fell slightly from the previous month, although it remains near a four-decade high.  In remarks Friday, St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard said he had become more supportive of a third straight 75 basis-point rate hike and that investors should not not underestimate the possibility of continued high rates in 2023.  In crypto news, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin surprised attendees at the Kyiv Tech Summit on Friday to show support for war-torn Ukraine. And LUNA, the cryptocurrency of the Terra blockchain’s recreated version after dramatically imploding earlier this year, tripled in price within a few hours time Friday, trading close to its all-time high set in early June when the token was introduced. The token’s price skyrocketed to almost $7 from less than $2, according to data by cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko, although it was more recently trading under $6.  BitBull's DiPasquale said he was ""skeptical of a continued rally from here on in the absence of fundamental macroeconomic improvements,"" and that the upcoming Ethereum Merge and meeting later this month by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to decide on the size of the interest rate increase ""remain key events to watch.""  Insights  Thai Interest in Crypto Grows, but Regulation Lags  By Sam Reynolds  Forward, a Thailand-based decentralized finance (DeFi) project building a decentralized derivatives exchange, just closed a $5 million funding round.  And this isn’t any old round: Venture arms of two of the nation’s biggest banks participated.  Kasikornbank bank and Bank of Ayudhya both put in an undisclosed amount. Udomsak Rakwongwan, Forward’s co-founder, notes that this is the first time two regulated banks have invested directly in DeFi because they want to digitize and transform banking.  But while Thai banks need to operate in a heavily regulated environment – a product of the 1997 financial crisis – there just isn’t a clear regulatory environment for crypto.  Rakwongwan notes that Forward, despite being a Thai project, is incorporated in Singapore because of regulatory clarity there.  Siam Commercial Bank, another large bank in the country, has a blockchain venture fund and is “opening the gate for future regulation,” given its measured approach and positive relationship with regulators, Rakwongwan said. SCB recently dropped out of a deal to buy a majority of local exchange BitKub, on the advice of regulators.  Rakwongwan told CoinDesk that it has been in contact with the Thai SEC, with a meeting scheduled soon, and so far the reception his project has gotten has been positive.  But progress is slow. Meanwhile, the country is suffering from a brain drain. A low cost of living locally means that salary expectations are low, and Thai talent is competitive overseas. Web3’s remote-first work environment means collaboration happens without borders.  “I believe that there is hope for Thailand to become a center of innovation and technology. We have investors who are ready to support new talent,” said Chanon Charatsuttikul, another co-founder.  A $5 million round goes a long way in Thailand, Rakwongwan added. But there won’t be too many rounds like that invested in Thai companies until the regulation becomes clearer.
