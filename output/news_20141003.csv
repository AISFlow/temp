42426097,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiavh,1412373359,Russia Proposes Monetary Penalties for Bitcoin Use and Promotion,"The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation has released the full version of the draft bill that, if passed in current form, would effectively ban the creation and distribution of software that allows for the use of money substitutes, including bitcoin and all digital currencies.  First announced as a proposal in August, the news marks the first time that the Ministry of Finance has made the proposed law public, as well as its definition of ""money surrogates"" under which bitcoin and digital currencies may be prohibited.  The two-page draft bill details a series of administrative fines to be imposed on both businesses and private citizens who issue, create or deliberately disseminate information about the release or operation of digital currencies, the language implying that the law would apply to much of the bitcoin industry, from bitcoin users to miners and service providers.  For example, individuals who are found to issue or create bitcoin or digital currencies will be penalized with fines of 30,000–50,000 rubles ($750–$1,250). Similarly, officials found to engage in such practices will be subject to fines of 60,000–100,000 rubles ($1,500–$2,500), while legal entities will be eligible for fines of 500,000–1m rubles ($12,500–$25,000).  A similar series of fines is also detailed for those found to have disseminated information that ""permits the release of money substitutes"". Individuals engaging in this practice would be subject to fines 5,000–50,000 rubles ($125–$1,250); officials, 20,000–100,000 rubles ($500–$2,500); and legal entities 500,000–1m rubles ($12,500–$25,000).  At press time, much of the domestic industry was still reacting to the news. Anton Vereshchagin, founder of InterMoneyExchange, which had planned to launch in Russia but has since moved to other markets, told CoinDesk:  ""If earlier Central Bank statements suggested Russia would follow the FATF and other recommendations and regulate bitcoins, now it seems that the chances are very very small.""  He added: ""In fact, the restrictions and prohibitions are only getting worse.""  Amended definitions  The draft bill also calls for the amendment of the definition of money surrogates in Russia to include language that would cover new financial technologies such as digital currencies.  Under the revision, the definition would include any ""monetary unit"" issued as a means of payment or exchange and not allowed under federal law.  The law would also be revised so that those who promote or encourage such activities are also in violation of the law. One provision calls for the law to be amended to ""prohibit the dissemination of information that permits release (emission) of money substitutes and (or) the operation with their use.""  Confirming fears  The latest language in the draft bill confirms fears long harbored by many other Russian market observers.  Artem Tolkachev, managing partner at the law firm Tolkachev & Partners, who has spoken publicly at Russian bitcoin conferences and who advises bitcoin startups on local regulation, told CoinDesk in September that he was pessimistic the law might only apply to those seeking to exchange fiat money for digital currencies.  In particular, Толкачев pointed to statements from the Ministry of Finance in September that suggested the bill might make this interpretation. The statement read:  ""We are not going to prohibit people to play checkers and to call checkers money. What we prohibit is to exchange substitutes to money and vice versa.""  Толкачев also pointed to the gradual evolution in statements from Russian authorities as well as the milder positions of the Bank of Russia, the country's central bank.

The company earned the competition's $50,000 ‘Top Startup’ award with cBridge, its first crypto product targeted at international banking and financial institutions.  Epiphyte  CEO and founder Edan Yago said it was “very gratifying” to win the prize at the world’s largest banking convention. He added that banks, bitcoin and other distributed ledger systems have a lot to learn from each other.  Epiphyte specialises in distributed ledger solutions for the mainstream financial system with the broader goal of connecting banking networks with cryptocurrency networks.  Following the win, Yago said:  “We have spent the last year and a half working with banks to help them integrate distributed ledger and block chain based technologies in a low-risk and compliant way. We are building the bridge between established finance and cryptofinance.”  Block chain tech for banks  Epiphyte’s cBridge beat out 280 competing FinTech startups. The criteria were simple: judges were asked to determine the likeliest startup to have the biggest impact on the future of the financial industry.  Each of the semi-finalists pitched their ideas to audiences that would decide which of the startups would be invited to the Sibos Grand Finale at Sibos for global exposure and receive the cash prize.  Kevin Johnson, SWIFT Innotribe Startup Challenge manager, suggested that while his product may have sold itself, Yago's pitch to the attendees was equally compelling, saying:  “I feel Epiphyte’s pitch at the startup competition was voted by the audience as the winner, due to the connection he made to the audience, showing how they can benefit from this technology and the business model.”  Epiphyte technology allows banks to facilitate consumer-to-merchant payments using cryptocurrencies. Bank customers can perform the transactions in familiar fiat currencies like dollars and euros, and the banks themselves do not have to hold cryptocurrencies.  New payment rail  Jo Lang, Epiphyte’s product lead and co-founder, said as many as 500 million bank customers are now able to make purchases using this new payment rail.  “Epiphyte is helping our banking customers see additional revenue by providing a service that a growing number of customers want,” said Lang.  The solution was designed to offer a low level of risk and compliance. Banks can use Epiphyte software to integrate crptocurrencies with traditional protocols like SWIFT.  The company, founded in 2013, plans to roll out a pilot implementation of its new product sometime in the next few months.

42395311,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHKo,1412355404,Ross Ulbricht: Hero or Villain?,"A year on from the arrest of Silk Road's alleged founder, CoinDesk takes a look at how the man at the centre of the scandal is dividing opinions in the bitcoin space.  A lot of people in the bitcoin realm have strong opinions on Ross Ulbricht. To some, he's a libertarian hero, to others, he's a villain, intent on making his millions off the back of murder, narcotics and other nefarious goods and means.  Arrested a year ago this week, Ulbricht – if you listen to the FBI's version of events – masterminded and operated anonymous online drug bazaar Silk Road under the pseudonym 'Dread Pirate Roberts' (DPR).  The site didn't only facilitate the purchase of drugs (using bitcoin), but weapons, fake passports, forgeries and much more.  Differing opinions  The FBI's portrayal of Ulbricht as a dangerous criminal couldn't be further from the picture painted by the 30-year-old's friends and family.  Those who know Ulbricht describe him as highly intelligent, kind, peace-loving and generous. His nearest and dearest assert that he had never before had even the slightest brush with the law, with his housemate René Pinnell telling The Verge there must be a case of mistaken identity.  ""I don’t know how they got Ross wrapped into this, but I’m sure it’s not him,” he said.  — Free_Ross (@Free_Ross) October 1, 2014     Despite the protestations of Ulbricht's friends and family, the Texas native has been incarcerated for a year now and is currently awaiting trial, charged with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. He has protested his innocence all along, claiming he is not DPR.  Bitcoin's big names weigh in  Some big names in the bitcoin industry are divided when it comes to their opinions on Ulbricht and the site he supposedly controlled.  Roger Ver  is one of Ulbricht's staunchest supporters, having pledged $160,000 to the Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund.  Ver believes that, if Ulbricht is indeed behind Silk Road, he should be applauded, not condemned, for creating a platform that enables people to buy and sell what they please without restriction or surveillance.  ""Ross is accused of providing a platform that allowed peaceful people to engage in peaceful and voluntary trade with others, beyond the purview of the state. Serving even one day in prison for creating such a wonderful tool to advance human freedom would be unjust,"" he said.  This is a view shared by Erik Voorhees, founder of bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice. He said that, if Ulbricht is the person the government is alleging, the only thing he's guilty of is ""being an entrepreneur who provided a voluntary service to peaceful people"".  ""Does such behavior warrant life in prison? Of course not, but history is replete with examples of peaceful people being locked in cages by men with guns who dislike their peaceful behaviour,"" he added.  A positive step for bitcoin  While some in the space see the closure of Silk Road and the incarceration of its alleged founder as an abomination, others view it as one of the best things that has happened to bitcoin.  Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's VP of marketing, believes the closure of Silk Road helped the bitcoin cause and feels cryptocurrency's reputation has improved since the episode.  ""While bitcoin is in the early stages, the market has grown significantly over the past year. And throughout it all, both the currency and the network continue to thrive in so many areas,"" she explained.  A spokesperson from the Bitcoin Foundation cited the prompt increase in the price of bitcoin following the closure of Silk Road as a signal that the bitcoin community regarded the site as a ""liability"".  Like Wargo, the spokesperson doesn't believe the Silk Road fiasco had too much of a negative impact on the wider world's perception of bitcoin.  She explained that, in 2013, VC's invested approximately $100m in bitcoin businesses. In 2014, after the Silk Road closure, VC's invested over $100m in the first two quarters alone.  ""Silk Road's takedown paved the way for the building of the ecosystem's infrastructure,"" the spokesperson said, adding that it actually did bitcoin a favour as it illustrated cryptocurrency is not a ""magic cloak for criminal behaviour"".  No deterrent  Voorhees disagrees with the idea that the FBI's closure of Silk Road and arrest of its alleged founder has acted as a deterrent against the creation of similar sites.  ""It was clearly not a deterrent,"" he said. ""Here we are one year after Silk Road was closed. Did online drug e-commerce dwindle after that? No, it has expanded.""  Voorhees cited Silk Road 2.0 as an example and said it's bigger than its predecessor ever was, adding:  ""This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are a few dozen other competitors that have sprung up over the past year. So the online drug trade is considerably stronger today than prior to Silk Road's closure.""  Crypto-anarchist Cody Wilson agrees that Silk Road's closure didn't act as a deterrent. He said it served only to show aspiring dark market operators what not to do.  The solution, he said, is to not have a central point of failure – to follow bitcoin's example and create a distributed marketplace that has no central administration.  Wilson, who founded Defense Distributed, an online, open-source organisation that designs firearms, said: ""With instances like OpenBazaar, there are serious attempts to have distributed, p2p markets that excise the whole one-admin, one-host problem that crippled Silk Road.""  The bigger picture  Voorhees acknowledges that the FBI's intention in arresting Ulbricht may have been to act as a deterrent, but he stressed the driving force behind the whole saga is the US government's war on drugs.  The Panama resident claims this war steals billions of dollars from taxpayers in order to harm and imprison people for making voluntary choices with their own bodies.  He doesn't believe it can go on for much longer, though:  ""It is a campaign that will be viewed unfavorably by future generations, and what DPR did was bring that future closer to us.""  Ver is also vocally opposed to the war on drugs, and he believes the US is already on the path to failure.  ""Thanks to bitcoin, and blockchain technology, the war on drugs is 100% certain to be lost by the violent men calling themselves the state,"" he said.  Ver explained that distributed new technologies like OpenBazaar will enable people to anonymously buy and sell whatever goods they please, even if the authorities class them as illegal.  It seems the FBI disagrees, with an FBI spokesperson telling Forbes this time last year: ""No one is beyond the reach of the FBI. We will find you.”  Whether or not this is true, and whatever the prevailing opinion about Ulbricht, DPR and Silk Road, one thing is for certain – it's the juiciest story to come out of bitcoin yet and there's no doubt it will go down in the cryptocurrency history books.

42426088,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIialh,1412350281,Bitcoin Could Transform Internet of Things into Vast Data Marketplace,"UPDATE (22nd Oct): A version of the working paper, co-authored by Noyen, Volland, Fleisch and Wörner can be found here.  As sportswear giant Nike expands its wearable technology applications, it will need more data to feed its gadgets and software.  To do that will be a simple matter in the future. A Nike executive will simply pull up a list of sensors operated by a private weather station, selecting the ones from which she would like to buy data.  With a click, the executive will pay individual sensors – perhaps thermostats mounted in a Central Park pathway particularly favoured by joggers – for their data, using bitcoin.  The weather sensors will be just one part of a future market filled with data collected by machines on the 'Internet of Things'. The only difference would be that humans will now be able to pay the machines directly for their work, in bitcoin.  Turning sensors into data-hawkers  That's the scenario described in a new paper by two researchers in Switzerland, titled, When Your Sensor Earns Money: Exchanging Data for Cash with Bitcoin. The paper was presented at UbiComp, an annual conference on 'ubiquitous and pervasive' computing organised by the Association for Computing Machinery. The event was held in Seattle last month.  The paper sketches a theoretical framework for sensors to interact with the bitcoin block chain and to receive payments in exchange for their data. This would solve the current problem of growing but silo-ed sensor networks whose owners have no incentive to share their data, the paper says. The authors write:  ""There is no way for third parties to leverage today's sensor deployments considerably. [...] Attaching a bitcoin address to a sensor could empower the sensor immediately to take part in a worldwide data market.""  The paper's authors are Dominic Wörner and Thomas von Bomhard, researchers at the Bosch Internet of Things and Services Lab at the University of St. Gallen. Wörner says the original work on the concept was done at ETH Zurich, with Kay Noyen, Dirk Volland and Elgar Fleisch.  Helping sensors get paid  The authors describe a framework consisting of software for the sensor and the human data customer, the bitcoin network and a sensor repository that would list all sensors who wish to sell their data and their bitcoin wallet addresses.  A data buyer would check the sensor repository to browse the available data. Once a piece of data has been selected, she would send bitcoin to that sensor's wallet.  When the sensor has received payment, it would send the data to the buyer over the bitcoin network using the OP_RETURN field. The data would be written to OP_RETURN and included in the block chain.  The authors say this is a framework for 'sensing-as-a-service', a play on the popular software-as-a-service model deployed by firms like Salesforce.com.  They point out that their current framework has several problems, including bloating the block chain with sold data and leaving the data open to free-riding because it's publicly viewable on the block chain.  Still, they remain optimistic about the chances for a ""world-wide data market"", concluding:  ""We expect it is only a matter of time until machines not only exchange data but also money. This opens up a whole new dimension for ubiquitous computing.""  Bosch, an engineering and electronics conglomerate headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, is not the only corporation looking at bitcoin and the Internet of Things. Technology giant IBM revealed last month that it too is developing an open-source platform called Adept that will use block chain technology.

42426107,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIibBh,1412330736,Australian Senate Launches Inquiry into Bitcoin and Digital Currencies,"The Australian Senate's Economics References Committee announced this week it would hold an inquiry into bitcoin and digital currency implications, aiming to present its findings to parliament in March 2015.  Chaired by Senator Sam Dastyari of the Australian Labor Party, the committee will examine the potential economic impact of digital currencies across various industries, including banking and retail.  A further aim is to help decide Australia's framework for regulating and taxing digital currency-related activities, in the hope that legal clarity will see the country take a leading role in developing the new technology.  Industry support  Ronald Tucker, who heads industry lobby group the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA), welcomed the news and praised both Senator Dastyari and the Economics References Committee for its foresight on the matter.  In a statement, Tucker said:  ""ADCCA recognises the need to bring digital currencies under the auspices of appropriate regulatory bodies such as the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) to ensure the highest standards of consumer protection and safeguard national security.""  By encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship, he said, Australia's parliament will help create more jobs and make the country a financial technology leader.  Tucker also called for ""a correction"" to Australia's current tax treatment of bitcoin provided by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) in August.  Many in Australia's bitcoin industry expressed dismay at the definition of digital currencies as a taxable supply, a condition that adds 10% to the price of bitcoins sold on Australian exchanges and forces businesses to keep detailed records of transactions and price fluctuations.  Tax issues  In August , the ATO defined bitcoin and digital currencies under existing tax laws, which subjects them to Australia's Goods and Services Tax (GST) for sales and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in a manner similar to assets such as equities.  Exchange and payment processor CoinJar posted on its blog that bitcoin sales to customers would include 10% GST starting 3rd October.  For customers converting bitcoin to Australian dollars, it said, ""the guidance is more complicated"". People converting bitcoin for personal use up to $10,000 would not be subject to tax, but anyone selling bitcoin on behalf of a GST-registered business would need to keep tax invoices for every transaction.  CoinJar also joined the call for changes to tax rules:  ""In many ways the guidance has brought clarity to the position of bitcoin users in Australia. However, we don't believe the ATO's guidelines are ideal for bitcoin in this country. We believe in a simpler financial system, and we will continue work with the ATO to help them discover a fairer position.""  Call for self-regulation  The ADCCA is promoting a self-regulatory approach to digital currency industry governance, stating the following in a newsletter:  ""An emerging common consensuses is that a self-regulatory model through countries industry associations, along with healthy government oversight, may be the most practical and effective means of addressing the need for an international conversation as well as eventual framework on global FinTech matters, such as bitcoin and other digital currencies.""  Australia will host a summit for G20 nations in Brisbane this coming November, and Tucker sees this as a great opportunity to discuss issues surrounding new currency concepts in a formal setting; hopefully, he said, with Australia as the leading voice.  The ADCCA also participated in last month's Responsible Finance Forum in Perth, organised in part by the World Bank, IMF and G20. Digital currencies and surrounding issues were ""very much a hot topic"" at the event, the association said, adding that was a forerunner to the main summit.

42426090,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIianh,1412300156,Butterfly Labs to Resume Limited Business Operations,"Embattled bitcoin mining manufacturer Butterfly Labs has announced that it will resume limited business operations following discussions with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  The Missouri-based company will not be allowed to serve new consumers when it reopens, and will be restricted to fulfilling existing customer orders. Butterfly Labs further confirmed it will remain under the direction of a court-appointed receiver who will oversee the business.  Butterfly Labs  suggested that it aims to use this opportunity to rebuild its market perception, which it acknowledged has been impacted by the recent FTC actions.  The company wrote:  ""Butterfly Labs views the order as a promising sign for the future of our company, our customers and our employees. This lawsuit has severely damaged our reputation and it is up to Butterfly Labs to attempt to repair that damage.""  The announcement follows a report from The Kansas City Star that suggested Butterfly Labs was holding initial discussions with the FTC about reopening its business earlier this week.  However, the actions by the FTC may not be a validation of the company and its efforts. In past filings, the FTC has indicated that Butterfly Labs should be awarded ancillary relief only as necessary to reduce the likelihood of consumer injury.  Reputational damage  Butterfly Labs said that though it is pleased with the announcement, it still finds past statements by the FTC to be contentious.  The company wrote:  ""There are a number of unsubstantiated claims circulating about Butterfly Labs. We intend to address all inaccuracies in due course, including the false claims around burn-in testing and Butterfly Labs inappropriately mining bitcoins with customer equipment.""  New documents in the case filed on 27th September levied such allegations against the company, suggesting that Butterfly Labs conducted extended testing of its machines after they were purchased by customers to profit from their production.  The FTC has also claimed that Butterfly Labs employees profited from mining rigs that were returned by customers or left in company custody after the consumer was issued a refund.  Challenging times  Butterfly Labs ended its statements by acknowledging the furor around the company in recent weeks, thanking those who have stood by its business.  ""Butterfly Labs thanks its many customers, employees and business partners for staying with us during this challenging time,"" the statement reads.  Prior to its shutdown, Butterfly Labs was besieged by manufacturing delays and customer complaints, however, it was an early market leader, having been in operation since 2010.  Butterfly Labs was formally shut down in late September following months of customer complaints that it failed to deliver products as advertised.  CoinDesk has reached out to the FTC for comment, but has not received an immediate response.
