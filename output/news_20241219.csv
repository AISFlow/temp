37859396,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26784,1734652620,"Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC) Solana Memecoin to Skyrocket 13,000% Before Exchange Listing, While Shiba Inu, BONK and Dogecoin Underperform","Musk Loves Bitcoin could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-loves-bitcoin-muskbtc-solana-memecoin-to-skyrocket-13000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-bonk-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

With the market constantly evolving, some coins are capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike with groundbreaking innovations and extraordinary potential. VeChain and Fantom are making waves with their recent developments. However, a unique contender, Qubetics ($TICS), is leading the charge with its remarkable presale performance and advanced Web3 solutions. While VeChain has just secured an innovative patent, and Fantom is gearing up for a transformative upgrade, Qubetics is stealing the spotlight. Packed with massive potential for returns, its presale generates significant buzz in the crypto community. This article will cover all three coins’ latest updates and developments—Qubetics, VeChain, and Fantom. Qubetics: Transforming Privacy with Its Decentralised VPN Service What if the internet could be accessed without the risks of surveillance or censorship? As part of its comprehensive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that’s set to redefine online privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPN providers that can log and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN leverages a peer-to-peer network powered by blockchain technology. This ensures user traffic remains entirely decentralised and free from centralised control. The dVPN offers more than just anonymity—it brings transparency and resistance to censorship. Its multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption protect user identities while providing secure, unrestricted internet access. Moreover, the innovative tokenised incentive structure rewards users who contribute bandwidth with $TICS tokens, making the network self-sustaining and encouraging active participation. Adding to the excitement, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to engage with its growing community, answering critical questions and showcasing the platform’s potential. With its cutting-edge features and interactive approach, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to join today . VeChain’s Breakthrough: Secure Data Handling with a New Patent VeChain continues to solidify its position as a leader in enterprise-focused blockchain solutions. The company recently secured a U.S. patent, approved on 17 December 2024, for a groundbreaking system to enhance data security. This patent leverages a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and securely split transaction keys, significantly improving secure data handling capabilities. The innovative key management system (KMS) outlined in the patent enables businesses to safeguard sensitive information effectively. With these advancements, VeChain is reinforcing its role as a pioneer in enterprise blockchain technology, setting new standards in security and reliability. Fantom’s Sonic Mainnet: A Game-Changer in Performance and Scalability Fantom (FTM) is on the rise, surging 16% on 15 December in anticipation of its rebranding and the rollout of the Sonic mainnet. This major upgrade boosts network efficiency, making Fantom faster and more cost-effective. As part of the update, FTM tokens will transition to Sonic (S) through a 1:1 swap, which has sparked considerable excitement among investors. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicate increased demand and positive inflows, supporting Fantom’s bullish trajectory. With support levels firmly established at $1.2, analysts are eyeing resistance points at $1.6 and potentially $2.38, making Fantom a compelling choice for growth-focused investors. Presale Spotlight: Why Qubetics Is the Talk of the Crypto World Investors seeking high returns focus on the Qubetics presale, currently in Phase 13. Each phase witnesses a 10% price increase, with the final stage set to jump by 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.034, and the project has already raised over $7.2 million. Analysts predict that once the mainnet launches, $TICS could soar to between $10 and $15 per token. Imagine investing today and reaping an ROI of over 29,000% if the price hits $10, or an astonishing 43,000% if it climbs to $15. These numbers are no mere speculation—Qubetics has already demonstrated immense traction, proving why it’s one of the best cryptos to join today. The structured price hikes add urgency for investors to act swiftly, securing their position in this promising project before the next phase increases token costs. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads the Pack in Crypto Innovation The crypto market is brimming with potential, and coins like VeChain and Fantom are making commendable strides with their latest updates. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a game-changer, combining innovative Web3 solutions with an electrifying presale that promises exceptional returns. Analysts’ predictions of staggering ROIs and the platform’s robust community engagement make it one of the best cryptos to join today. Don’t miss the chance to be part of Qubetics’ transformative journey. With the presale progressing rapidly, now is the time to act and secure your stake in what could be the next big thing in crypto.

37858605,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664967,1734651017,Bitcoin Crashes: Here’s Where The Nearest On-Chain Support Is,"Bitcoin has observed a plunge during the past day. Here’s the nearest on-chain level that the asset would end up retesting if the drawdown elongates. 1 Week To 1 Month Bitcoin Holders Have Their Realized Price At $97,900 As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old BTC investors is the closest support for the asset right now. Related Reading: Secret Bitcoin Driver: Exchanges Receiving $40 Million USDT Fuel Per Day The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition price of the average holder on the Bitcoin network. When the metric’s value is lower than the spot price of the cryptocurrency, it means the investors as a whole can be considered to be holding a net amount of profit. On the other hand, it being under the BTC value suggests the dominance of loss in the market. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a particular segment of the sector is of interest: the 1-week to 1-month-old holders. This cohort includes the addresses that have been holding their coins for at least one week and, at most, one month. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the Realized Price of this Bitcoin group has changed over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old Bitcoin investors has been climbing up alongside the price rally. This is naturally due to the fact that the cohort’s cost basis has been getting repriced to higher levels as new investors have been purchasing at the rally highs. Currently, the indicator’s value sits at $97,900, so these investors would be in profit at the current price. Earlier in the past day, however, the asset came dangerously close to retesting the level as its price saw a brief dip below $99,000. The 1 week to 1 month old investors make up a section of a larger cohort known as the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs are broadly defined as the holders who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell. So, the STHs, and especially the 1-week to 1-month-old segment, would contain the holders with the least amount of resolve in the sector, owing to their low holding time. Because of how fickle they are, the STHs generally show some kind of reaction whenever their average cost basis gets retested by the Bitcoin price. This reaction may come in the form of buying when the retest occurs from above, as these holders could believe the decline to be just a ‘dip.’ As such, the Realized Price of the 1-week to 1-month-old STHs, which is below the current price, could be looked at as a support level for the cryptocurrency. The level has also already helped the asset out once this month.

37859844,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321207,1734651000,Japan’s Ruling Party Still Pushing for Crypto Tax Reform Despite PM’s Caution,"Japan’s ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is still pushing for crypto tax reform in spite of cautious recent statements from Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba . The Japanese media outlet CoinPost reported that the party’s Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society is set to outline its plans to change the way crypto is taxed in the nation before the year is out. Crypto Tax Reform Proposals Must Roll Out Before End of 2024, Says Minister The LDP’s Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society team met with the Financial Research Council on December 18. The parties held a “discussion” on “urgent proposals” for turning crypto into “assets that contribute to the Japanese economy.” Japanese Minister of Digital Affairs Takuya Hirai speaking at a crypto-related meeting on December 18. (Source: Takuya Hirai/@hiratakuchan/X) The party has been working on web3 policy and tax reform-related matters since the premiership of Fumio Kishida. The media outlet reported that the LDP’s digital policymakers will “prioritize” the production of a “tax reform outline” in the last days of 2024. CoinPost wrote: “This outline will set out a basic policy for tax reform in the following year.” Asian stocks slid after the US Federal Reserve cautioned it would ease the pace of rate cuts in the coming year and the Bank of Japan refrained from raising its benchmark rate https://t.co/QFKm7Q8u8x pic.twitter.com/2eooEY2UCg — Reuters (@Reuters) December 19, 2024 Countdown to Trump Presidency However, the outlet warned that if the policymakers failed to produce a proposal for crypto tax, it would be “extremely difficult to realize any change in 2025.” In Japan, policy chiefs usually submit tax reform proposals at the end of the calendar year. They then submit these to parliament the following year. The Japanese Minister of Digital Affairs Takuya Hirai noted that the timing of the discussion was important, with the Donald Trump administration taking power in Washington in January 2025. “I believe that this proposal is important for the government. We must take a comprehensive, clear stance on taxes, regulations, and cybersecurity before the Trump administration takes office.” Japanese Minister of Digital Affairs Takuya Hirai Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to reporters on the death of Tsuneo Watanabe, editor-in-chief of The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, describing him as a “great Journalist.” https://t.co/4FTHqGOZMo — The Japan News (@The_Japan_News) December 19, 2024 Experts think Tokyo wants to cement any new changes in Japan’s cryptocurrency policy by the time Trump takes office. These changes could include tax reform, in addition to new regulations and cybersecurity laws. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society forms policy recommendations for the government’s consideration. However, Ishiba’s office is under no obligation to accept or incorporate these recommendations. Indeed, in recent weeks, the Prime Minister refused to commit to tax reform or the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs in Japan. Ishiba has appointed lawmakers known to be in favor of crypto reform to ministerial positions . He also mentioned blockchain technology in his election manifesto. However, voices outside the LDP have also called for “urgent” reform. Opposition leaders have also warned repeatedly that capital is flowing out of the country as a result of an “unfair” taxation system for crypto investors. Japan's central bank kept its monetary policy settings steady, signaling it sees little urgency to raise interest rates for now https://t.co/xYQANqP0nF — Bloomberg (@business) December 19, 2024 While many other nations charge traders flat capital gains taxes at rates of about 20%, Japan’s tax rules instead oblige crypto traders to declare their crypto profits on their annual income tax declarations. They must file crypto trading profits under “other income.” And that means that the nation’s highest earners can end up paying up to 55% on their crypto trading revenues. The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society said its proposal was of “urgent” importance. On X, Hirai wrote that the LDP had been working on crypto legislation “faster” than any party “in the world.” The post Japan’s Ruling Party Still Pushing for Crypto Tax Reform Despite PM’s Caution appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/japans-ruling-party-still-pushing-for-crypto-tax-reform-despite-pms-caution/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37859844.jpeg

37858193,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630801,1734650090,"Geothermal energy startups are on the increase, thanks to energy-hungry AI","The rise in energy demand to power AI systems has spurred a new breed of investments – geothermal energy startups to complement energy supplies. According to a Reuters report, geothermal energy startups are on the increase as big tech firms are looking at feeding their power-intensive data centers. Despite this surge, long-term investments in the sector remain uncertain as oil majors double down on gas. Simply put, geothermal energy is heat energy from the earth. Geothermal energy startups increased in the last two years According to Bryant Jones, the executive director for the industry association Geothermal Rising, the environment has been improving lately, in terms of ease of doing business which has seen more than 60 startups spring to life in the last two years. “Texas is becoming the ‘place to be’ for geothermal exploration and development across the board,” said Matt Welch at the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance (TxGEA). “Much of this is due to an abundance of identified geothermal resources, 1-stop shopping permitting process, and our regulatory certainty.” Welch. According to an industry report published last year, at least 10 of the geothermal startups launched between 2016 and 2022 in the US were headquartered in Texas. Now, the obtaining lower commodity prices might encourage more shale companies to diversify their revenue streams and tap into geothermal power. The Enhanced Geothermal Shot analysis in 2022 confirmed the potential for more geothermal electricity generating capacity – 90 gigawatts by 2050. These developments also come as AI data centers have emerged as high-energy consumers, forcing big techs to look elsewhere for alternative energy sources to keep their data centers running with sufficient and sustainable power. “We believe geothermal, along with abundant natural gas, can be part of the all-of-the-above energy mix we need to meet the demand,” said Trey Lowe, chief technology officer at U.S. shale gas producer Devon Energy (DVN.N), an investor in geothermal startup Fervo Energy. Big techs back the geothermal energy startups According to a Reuters report, social media giant, Meta and search engine giant Google rank among the tech firms that are partnering with these startup companies offering to produce geothermal electricity, to power their data centers. The report further highlights that geothermal energy has been promoted as a faster way to generate carbon-free power compared to nuclear and without the intermittency of wind and solar. However, the new startups do not have it easy as they face high upfront costs, especially for drilling coupled with long project approval times. These high costs have dampened the initial zeal, with limited investment so far, analysts estimate just over $700 million in financing as been contributed to overall geothermal power projects since 2020. But the sector is also receiving bipartisan interest with the CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passing the House and now awaiting Senate approval. If these become law, this will, according to Reuters, make it easier to set up geothermal projects across the US. The sector is receiving increased bipartisan interest as well. The CLEAN Act and HEATS Act recently passed the House and are awaiting Senate approval. If they become law, it would make it easier to set up geothermal projects in the country. Now, top shale oil producers Chevron, Diamondback Energy, and Exxon Mobil have started advocating for gas as the mainstay fuel for electric power, offering to work with utilities to add to their power plants with carbon sequestration that generates greenhouse emissions. “In general, (there is) a lot more interest from smaller oil and gas producers as well as service companies … we’ve talked to Chevron and Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab but the supermajors seem to be taking more of a wait-and-watch view,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, which is developing energy storage and geothermal baseload technologies deep in the earth. According to Reuters, Sage recently completed a $30 million fundraising which was led by Expand Energy – a US shale gas producer. The company plans to launch the Series B round in January. Colorado-based Gradient Geothermal -which generates geothermal energy using existing oil and gas infrastructure – announced it was providing Chord Energy services to help generate power at one of its oil and gas in North Dakota. Johanna Ostrum, Gradient CEO said most mid-size and smaller independent energy firms were interested in geothermal energy for their own needs, not to create electricity for resale.

37858022,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630792,1734649560,"Bitcoin Miner MARA splashes $1.53B, becomes second-largest BTC holder globally","MARA Holdings has strengthened its position as a Bitcoin holder by acquiring 15,574 Bitcoin at an average price of $98,529 per coin. The latest $1.53 billion investment brings MARA’s total holdings to 44,394 BTC. At the current spot price of $100,151 per Bitcoin, the company’s holdings are valued at approximately $4.45 billion. The firm currently ranks second on the list of publicly traded companies with the largest BTC holdings globally. MARA has said the purchase was enabled by the $1.925 billion in proceeds from two offerings of 0% convertible senior notes, announced in late November and early December. This calculated move is similar to a strategy employed and popularized by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor involving large-scale BTC accumulation. According to Saylor, it’s a matter of time before MARA Holdings enters the Nasdaq 100 index. MARA seizes opportunity to buy Bitcoin after Federal Reserve Chair’s remarks MARA’s timing is interesting. They announced this purchase just a day after Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, stated that the central bank couldn’t own Bitcoin. Furthermore, the purchase coincided with a fall in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin plunged by 5.6% during Wednesday’s session, testing levels below the $100,000 mark. This marked the largest single-day drop since August 5. The fall was preceded by a wider sell-off sparked by the Fed’s hawkish comments about the interest rate trajectory and how it may possibly drop in 2025. For a brief period, Bitcoin seemed poised to surpass the $100k milestone. However, two factors contributed to its pullback: Powell’s remarks served as a major catalyst, and lingering skepticism about Bitcoin’s viability as a reserve asset added to the downward pressure. Bitcoin Miners boost reserves by purchasing on the open market Bitcoin miners are beginning to purchase Bitcoin on the open market. Hut 8 (HUT) is one of the latest Bitcoin miners to do so. Other dominant miners include MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings. The Miami-based Hut 8 announced on Thursday that it had purchased 990 BTC at an average price of $101,710 each. The acquisition increased its Bitcoin reserves to 10,096 BTC, with a total value of around $1 billion. The firm, after the latest acquisition, appears among the top ten largest corporate Bitcoin holders. The current rush for Bitcoin by miner firms is an indication of progress. Soon, these firms will control large percentages of cryptocurrency, thus, raising their market influence and overall valuation.

Two days ago on the social media platform X, the top US-based crypto exchange platform said it had added Parcl ( PARCL ), a decentralized exchange (DEX) that lets users trade and invest in real estate using synthetic assets without the need to physically own any property. Synthetic assets are tokenized, blockchain-based representations of real-world assets, such as securities and real property that can easily be swapped. News of the addition caused the token to dip in price as it went from a peak of $0.586 on December 17th to a low of $0.408 just two days later. PARCL is trading for $0.418 a time of writing, a 9% decrease during the last 24 hours. On December 15th, Coinbase added PARCL to its listing roadmap, signaling at the time that it was going to add support soon. At that time, the crypto exchange’s announcement triggered a 50% rally of the altcoin as it was moving for just $0.33 on December 10th. PARCL aims to provide traders with global city indexes – including major cities such as New York, Miami Beach, San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dubai – and allow them to acquire tokens that represent a stake in a specific index.

This surprise move lit a fire under selling across all altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) being hit hardest and crashing -26%, breaking its 40-day trendline too. Conversely, Altura ($ALU) displayed outstanding strength, remaining locked into a bullish falling wedge pattern, a technical pattern that often leads to a reversal upward. Render ($RENDER) Faces Dramatic Decline After Bitcoin’s Tumble Render’s large crash is due to Bitcoin overnight tanking. That penetration below the psychological level of $100,000 triggered panic and heavy selling pressure. For Render, it meant losing an important support level that had supported its recent uptrend. Render's price action is an indicator of investor indecision and reflects an oversold condition. However, any chance of a recovery ultimately prevents the token from regaining ground and retaking its trendline support. Altura ($ALU) Remains In Bullish Formation Even with the market volatility, Altura has stayed in an attractive technical setup. The falling wedge pattern in the token's position indicates a bullish breakout. This pattern develops when the price of an asset declines within an increasingly tighter range, often resulting in an eventual upward breakout. Source: Tradingview Altura ($ALU): What You Need to Know - Altura has been resilient against potential downturns, holding near its key support zones.- A falling wedge pattern provides a positive outlook with Altura well on track for a bounce.- If Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura could significantly benefit from bullish sentiment. How Altura ($ALU) Keeps Giving Reasons to Pay Attention Altura has weathered volatility with unflappability that speaks to its unique appeal and strong fundamentals. Here are some of the underlying factors that led to its bullish sentiment: Bullish Technical Pattern: The falling wedge setup strengthens confidence in a potential breakout. Unique Use Case: The common ranging of blockchain-based gaming solutions with tokenized in-game assets makes Altura a good potential long-term investment. Supportive User Base: A robust community strengthens the token’s ecosystem and ensures ongoing interest. Future Price Prediction for Render ($RENDER) and Altura ($ALU) Render ($RENDER): Keep an eye out for price stabilization. If the token manages to regain its 40-day trendline while neutralizing its oversold status, we could expect a rebound. Altura ($ALU): The line at the top of the falling wedge is the one traders should pay attention to. A breakout from this pattern would trigger a big upward momentum, confirming Altura's bullish trend. Conclusion: The recent market crash has taken a toll on altcoins, with Render ($RENDER) suffering significant losses. However, Altura ($ALU) stands out with its bullish pattern and strong fundamentals, making it a compelling asset to watch. As Bitcoin stabilizes, Altura's breakout potential positions it as a frontrunner in the event of a market rally. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Australian computer scientist Craig Wright has been handed a one-year sentence, suspended for two years, for filing a $1.2 trillion lawsuit against the payments firm Block. The judge says Wright violated a previous court order designed to keep him from filing further legal actions. The suspended sentence essentially means Wright would avoid jail if he meets certain conditions and does not commit another offense, although the judge noted Wright is living abroad in Asia and is likely not within jurisdiction of the court. Earlier this year, a UK judge ruled that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Wright is neither Satoshi nor the author of the Bitcoin white paper after he was sued by the nonprofit crypto advocacy group Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) for filing frivolous lawsuits against Bitcoin developers. In November, COPA went on to claim that Wright violated an injunction by filing a lawsuit against Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s payments firm. According to the report, the injunction was set in place to prevent Wright from filing BTC-related lawsuits on the grounds that he is Satoshi and Judge James Mellor found Wright to be in contempt of court following a hearing Wednesday. Mellor also handed him a one year sentence suspended for two years – meaning that Wright will not immediately have to serve time provided he meets certain conditions – and threw out the lawsuit against Block. Wright said that he would appeal being found guilty of contempt of court.

Following the 2021 cycle pattern, where Bitcoin rose 40% above its moving averages, the peak price would reach around $339,000, according to the report.

However, in the past week, its price dipped by 16.81%, indicating short-term volatility. The current price ranges between $0.35 and $0.42, hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.38 and $0.40. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.39, suggesting the coin is not overbought and may have the potential to rise. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.004012, but close to zero, which could point to a possible upward shift soon. If Dogecoin moves past the nearest resistance level at $0.51, it might reach the second resistance at $0.62, which would be an increase of around 34%. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $0.31, it could drop to the next support at $0.21, a decrease of about 41%. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge where the price might head next. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by about 20%. Looking at the last six months, SHIB’s price surged by nearly 42%, highlighting its strong growth over a longer period. The recent weekly dip might suggest a short-term correction. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 34.51, which is approaching oversold territory. This could signal a potential rebound in price soon. The Stochastic value is 23.71, also indicating possible undervaluation. SHIB is currently trading between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00003614. If the price breaks this level, it could see gains of around 13%. The nearest support level is at $0.00002006. Falling below this could lead to a decline of approximately 16%. Conclusion While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are notable, XYZVerse stands out with its sports focus and massive growth potential in the 2024 bull run.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

37857008,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630737,1734647434,21Shares registers Polkadot Trust in Delaware,"Digital asset manager 21Shares has registered its Polkadot Trust in Delaware, marking another step to expand exposure to the smart contract network for accredited investors. This move joins the growing list of firms launching new crypto products. The Switzerland-based firm’s decision to register a Polkadot Trust is quite interesting, given the smart contract network’s relatively low popularity compared to its competitors, such as Solana and XRP. However, 21Shares has always been bullish on DOT, and it launched the first Europe-based exchange-traded product for Polkadot in 2021 on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Meanwhile, many in the crypto community believe that the Polkadot investment product might not attract much investment, given the limited interest in the network. Polkadot token DOT is ranked 17th on CoinMarketCap, with a market cap of around $11 billion. The leading asset manager, Grayscale, registered a Polkadot Trust in Delaware in 2021. However, DOT is currently only part of its Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund , which also includes SOL, ADA, AVAX, and NEAR. DOT has a 6.97% weighting in the fund, which interestingly has only $5.28 million in assets under management, far below the newly launched SUI Trust. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs outperform Meanwhile, 21Shares registration highlights the positive sentiments among asset managers about crypto-focused investment products. The massive success of Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has contributed to this, with many seeing it as a sign of demand for alternative investment products. Since launching in January, the US Bitcoin ETFs have seen a year-to-date flow of $37 billion, far above many analysts’ bullish estimates. Interestingly, the ETFs also had 15 days of consecutive inflows between November 27 and December 18, showing that demand is not subsiding. Bitcoin ETFs Inflows (Source: Hodl15Capital) Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas described the growth as massive, although its routine nature has made many think it’s normal. BlackRock IBIT has had the fastest growth to $50 billion of any ETF. Balchunas said: “It’s become so routine we getting numb to it (kinda like Vanguard flows) but this is a LOT of cash esp in month 12 of a brand new category.” Even Ethereum ETFs , which have not had near the success of Bitcoin ETFs, have also been quite successful. In December alone, they saw $1.66 billion in inflows, and their total AUM has now reached $11 billion. Institutional interest appears to be picking up for the ETH ETFs, as December inflows account for 74% of total inflows into the products. What to expect from crypto ETFs in 2025 With BTC and ETH ETFs proving successful this year, many experts expect the products to continue with this performance next year. ETF Foundation President Nate Geraci noted that ETH ETFs are currently on pace with Gold, but he expects inflows to accelerate soon. Balchunas expressed uncertainty about how the Bitcoin price will affect Bitcoin ETFs but noted that the product has already shown itself to be a major category. Thus, he expects it to get bigger and become more diverse. Meanwhile, many stakeholders and analysts believe there will be more crypto ETFs in 2025 as regulatory clarity clears the way. This is likely why several asset managers have been launching new crypto investment products, with plans to convert them into ETFs. However, experts believe that altcoins such as XRP and Solana, which the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has classified as securities in its lawsuits, might face some challenges in getting ETF approval until those lawsuits are settled or the SEC changes its tune. Bloomberg experts said: “As long as the SEC’s Division of Enforcement actively says these assets are securities or were securities offering, it’s unthinkable that another division would explicitly approve them in stand-alone commodity ETFs.” Nevertheless, they noted that the SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs could eventually be the argument for exchanges and issuers who want those assets classified as commodities because of the similarities between the networks.

37858537,https://thecoinrise.com/mara-holdings-makes-fresh-1-53b-bitcoin-purchase/,1734647431,Mara Holdings Makes Fresh $1.53B Bitcoin Purchase,"MARA Holdings (MARA), a leading Bitcoin mining company, has made a significant leap in the Bitcoin world. In a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm announced it acquired 15,574 BTC, totaling a staggering $1.53 billion. This acquisition brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 44,394 BTC. With this bold move, MARA now holds Bitcoin valued at approximately $3.9 billion at current market prices. Remarkably, this cements MARA’s position as the publicly traded firm with the largest Bitcoin reserve. A Bold Acquisition Strategy MARA funded its recent Bitcoin purchase with proceeds from its zero-coupon convertible notes. This strategic financial move allows firms to raise capital without diluting equity. The company also repurchased over $250 million of notes due in 2026 and plans to use the remaining funds to acquire more Bitcoin. This decision shows its commitment to growing its reserves. The Bitcoins were acquired at an average price of $96,000 per BTC. This makes the acquisition one of the company’s most significant investments in crypto to date. MARA’s purchase mirrors the Bitcoin accumulation strategy that MicroStrategy ’s Chairman, Michael Saylor championed. This strategy of bulk Bitcoin acquisition is becoming a key trend for companies with large crypto reserves. This move could boost MARA’s market position, with speculation that it may join the Nasdaq 100 Index, like other major crypto and tech companies. Timing and Market Context The timing of MARA’s announcement is notable. It came a day after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell clarified that the central bank would not be acquiring Bitcoin. The news also hit the markets during a particularly volatile period. Bitcoin experienced its sharpest drop in over three months, falling by 3%. This was due to the Fed’s hawkish remarks about interest rates and the uncertain outlook for rate cuts in 2025. This came as Bitcoin’s price nosedived to $100,000. Currently, the price has declined by 5.56% in the last 24 hours, trading by $98,640.70 as per CoinMarketCap . Amid market uncertainty, MARA’s bold move shows confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, with companies like Hut 8 and RIOT also expanding their holdings. Hut 8 recently bought 990 BTC, increasing its reserve to 10,096 BTC, worth nearly $1 billion. A Shift in Bitcoin Mining’s Financial Landscape For Bitcoin miners, large scale acquisitions like this are key to financial stability. This is crucial especially as they face pressure from the recent Bitcoin halving. Buying Bitcoin from the open market helps raise capital and navigate market challenges. As companies like MARA, MicroStrategy, and Hut 8 grow their reserves, the future of corporate Bitcoin holdings looks promising.

Interestingly, the fund happens to be the first in the US to provide exposure to BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain ecosystem. It aims to offer a way for investors to access the cryptocurrency through traditional brokerage and IRA accounts. BNB Gains US Accessibility In its official press release this week, Osprey highlighted that BNB underpins various decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and smart contracts, and while it remains unavailable on centralized exchanges in the US, the latest fund would provide a means for investors to gain exposure using USD.

The launch of the Osprey BNB Chain Trust underscores our focus on providing access to premier crypto assets.” Previously offered through private placement, the Osprey BNB Chain Trust is now accessible to a broader audience via the OTCQX market.

It reached an all-time high above $780 in the first week of December amid a broader market rally. The price has since undergone minor correction and is currently near $702. BNB was still up by more than 182% over the past year. Despite this bullish momentum on the price front, BNB Chain faced a surge in sandwich attacks in November, with a record 35.5% of its blocks affected. These attacks, involving MEV techniques like front-running, exploited the chain’s decentralized exchange (DEX) transparency, impacting 43,400 traders.

The company has introduced strategies like selling put options to increase profits. Its stock surged 7%, with a 2,200% growth year-to-date. Metaplanet Inc., Japan’s first publicly traded company focused on Bitcoin, has begun trading its shares on the U.S. OTCQX Market. The company recently adopted Bitcoin Treasury strategy now will trade under the ticker symbol “MTPLF.” Why the U.S. Market? Metaplanet’s decision to list on the OTCQX Market comes under the interest in Bitcoin and its financial growth. The company focuses on accumulating Bitcoin as a core part of its business model from institutional and retail investors. At the general meeting of Shareholders on December 13, 2024, Shareholders approved an increase in the shares to 145,000,000, which pave the way for continued Bitcoin accumulation. By listing its shares in the U.S., Metaplanet it could get the wider range of investors. Simon Gerovich, the President of Metaplanet, expressed about the move, highlighting how it provides U.S. investors with easier access to the company. He sees this as a strategic step in expanding Metaplanet’s influence in the global Bitcoin ecosystem. The OTCQX Market is a well-established platform that allows international companies to trade their shares in the U.S. without the need for SEC registration. Companies on this market must follow strict financial rules and good business practices, making sure Metaplanet’s shares are reliable and safe for U.S. investors. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Metaplanet’s main strategy is to buy and hold Bitcoin as its key asset. The goal is to grow the value of its Bitcoin over the years which is also creating long-term benefits for its shareholders. By using Japan’s low borrowing costs and stable interest rates, the company plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings. Along with buying more Bitcoin, Metaplanet is finding new ways to make money. For example, the company is selling put options, which helps them earn profits while they continue to build their Bitcoin holdings. This strategy helps Metaplanet handle changes in the value of currencies, especially when the Japanese yen is getting weaker against the U.S dollars. Metaplanet’s business also extends to its exclusive license for Bitcoin Magazine Japan, which enables the company to generate revenue through marketing, educational initiatives, and expanding the Bitcoin ecosystem in Japan. After the announcement, the company’s stock surged by over 7% on the Japanese exchange, reaching ¥3,770. According to Google Finance data, stock growth of more than 2,200%.

42389998,91cce5d8-e411-4f9c-92fb-46ce4075af70,1734646323,Could Bitcoin Become DeFi’s Collateral of Choice? Lombard Finance Says So,"A war for on-chain market dominance may be brewing. The question: What will be the collateral of choice in the decentralized finance (DeFi) economy?  As of press time, DeFi protocols across all ecosystems have locked in almost $126 billion in value, according to DeFiLlama data, inching closer every day to their 2021 high of $175 billion. The majority of those pledged funds take the form of ether (ETH) and derivatives like yield-producing staked ether liquid tokens (stETH) and wrapped eETH (weETH), with wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and stablecoins as a whole competing for fourth and fifth place.  But the team behind Bitcoin-based DeFi protocol Lombard Finance intends to shake things up with LBTC, a new liquid bitcoin token. The idea, according to Lombard co-founder Jacob Philips, is to dethrone ETH and stETH and install bitcoin as the collateral of choice in the entire on-chain economy.  “On centralized venues, bitcoin is the prime collateral. There's no question about this. Why is it not the case in DeFi?” Philips told CoinDesk in an interview. “Bitcoin only does one thing well, and it's being a rock-solid store of value. It is the perfect collateral. There's no reason that we shouldn't be building DeFi on top of bitcoin.”  Bitcoin has had a formidable year, surging 124% since January 1 thanks to political tailwinds in the U.S. and the massive success of its almost year-old spot exchange-traded funds. Ether, for its part, has underperformed significantly by “only” rising 48% in the same period of time, despite being four times smaller in terms of market capitalization. With demand for bitcoin increasing by the day — and ever-increasing chatter about a potential U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve under the incoming Trump administration — it isn’t crazy to think the asset could play a bigger role on-chain.  That, in turn, could transform the way DeFi as a whole operates.  “Bitcoin is going to be the next big source of liquidity for every DeFi protocol, on every chain. It’s just a massive influx of net new capital,” Philips said. Noting that bitcoin has a market cap close to $1.9 trillion, he said: “Even if we only get a fraction of that, it would still put a ton of new activity into the ecosystem and make DeFi more efficient — maybe even get to the point where DeFi protocols, through passive liquidity, rival the liquidity on centralized exchanges.”  Bitcoin with a yield?  A big difference between bitcoin and ether is that you can lock in the latter asset on the Ethereum network — a process called staking — to help secure the blockchain, and earn interest, paid in ETH. At press time, staked ether offers a 3.19% yield annually, according to CoinDesk's composite ether staking rate (CESR) index.  The Bitcoin network doesn’t offer such capabilities, but Lombard aims to provide a yield-bearing bitcoin token through Babylon, a protocol designed to let users stake bitcoin in order to secure other blockchains.  It goes like this: Users give Lombard some bitcoin, Lombard stakes these coins through Babylon, then it mints one LBTC token for each BTC staked. These LBTC tokens follow the ERC-20 standard, meaning they can be used across Ethereum and all of its protocols.  That interest rate on LBTC will be paid by the blockchains secured through Babylon, or so the theory goes. Nine different projects — Corn, BOB, Cosmos Hub, Nubit, Fiamma, Manta, LayerEdge, Chakra and Pell — have started or completed integration to Babylon’s blockchain development environment, or devnet, so far, Coleman Maher, growth lead at Babylon, told CoinDesk. These integrations should go live next year, after Babylon’s own layer 1 goes live.  Babylon isn’t giving out any staking rewards right now, but that hasn’t prevented the protocol from accumulating $5.4 billion in value, making it the 10th biggest protocol by value locked across all of DeFi, according to DeFiLlama. So why are people so eager to lock up their bitcoin on Babylon? Possibly because it’s running a points program, meaning that early depositors could eventually receive an airdrop. The Babylon team did not comment on whether a token would ever be issued.  Fierce competition  Out of the $6 billion staked on Babylon, over $1.4 billion was plugged through Lombard to create LBTC tokens. In the absence of Babylon-issued staking rewards, these tokens aren’t providing any yield yet.  “Users aren't choosing to hold ether or bitcoin based on staking yield alone,” Philips said. “There are much broader reasons why they're choosing one or the other,"" such as the potential U.S. bitcoin reserve and regulators’ views towards the two assets. ""And the yield is a little bit of a cherry on top.”  It’s important to note that DeFi users already can use bitcoin as collateral (although without any yield) thanks to wrapped bitcoin. At press time, wBTC’s market capitalization stood at $12.9 billion. That’s only 22% away from its 2021 all-time-high, despite concerns that wBTC’s issuer, crypto custody and trading firm BitGo, is sharing custody of the underlying bitcoin with BiT Global, an entity partially owned by TRON founder Justin Sun. Sun has been accused of fraud and market manipulation in the U.S.  Even so, as of December 6, wBTC only accounted for $5.7 billion worth of collateral in some of the largest DeFi protocols, per Lido data, whereas $14.5 billion in ETH was being used, and $11.1 billion worth of stETH. Even ""wrapped ether,"" or eETH — a relatively new liquid token that allows users to benefit from EigenLayer restaking rewards at the same time as native ETH staking yield — provided $5.8 billion in collateral.  In fact, stETH and weETH have been slowly eating into other coins’ market share, to the point that ARK Invest stated in a recent report that the entire DeFi economy was reorganizing itself around stETH and the benchmark yield provided by staked ETH. Other tokens — like Solana’s SOL or Avalanche’s AVAX — offer higher interest rates for staking, the implication being that these assets, being more volatile, are riskier to hold in the long run.  Stablecoin lenders have also felt pressure from stETH’s ascent, ARK Invest said, with Sky (SKY) (formerly MakerDAO) increasing locked DAI’s interest rate, while rewards for lending stablecoins on Aave (AAVE) and Compound (COMP) have grown, because users would rather lend stETH and borrow stablecoins than lend stablecoins directly.  Not to mention the various tokenized money market funds being developed by financial giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, which could end up allowing DeFi users to gain exposure to U.S. Treasury bills and use such tokens as collateral.  So LBTC is facing tough competition. But Philips says the token can succeed where wBTC has struggled thanks to that extra little push afforded by its yield. “Staking yield will be generated in time. The LBTC yield is expected to be in the range of the ETH staking rate,” he said.  “Lombard’s initial goal is just to get people to take their bitcoin out of the coldest of cold storage, and just take the most primitive step into on-chain finance. And then we'll show you the battle-tested protocols, safer than your bank, that exist out there,” Philips added. “It's possible that the yield could dry up. LBTC as an asset, producing any amount of yield, would still be an attractive asset.”  The pitch has certainly been met with interest. Lombard raised $16 million this summer from a number of heavy-hitters, including Polychain Capital, Franklin Templeton and Nomad Capital. Philips said that entities already familiar with DeFi had been the most enthusiastic. “Anybody who has dabbled in crypto already, it's an easy pitch to get them onboard for bitcoin staking. Or at least they're very open to the conversation.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/20/could-bitcoin-become-de-fi-s-collateral-of-choice-lombard-finance-says-so,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5e07c00aa29281b9a9c40f24a0deee0905f38e0-1280x698.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37857670,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52579,1734645645,From Barista to Crypto Champ: Seymour from LA Makes $217K with Fantom—Why BlockDAG Is The Hottest Crypto Right Now,"In June 2018, Seymour Dinero was enduring long hours at a Los Angeles coffee shop, diligently saving to produce his debut film. Amid handling coffee orders and refining screenplay drafts at night, he discovered Fantom (FTM)—a blockchain initiative valued at mere $0.04 during its ICO phase. Back then, Fantom was far from a sure thing, and it barely caught the industry’s eye, yet Seymour saw its promise to offer remarkable advancements. By October 2021, his initial $2,500 escalated to an impressive $217,000 as Fantom soared to a peak of $3.48. Now, the trading community wonders: which platform will mirror Fantom’s success? Many believe BlockDAG (BDAG) holds that potential as its crypto presale is skyrocketing in 2024. From $2.5K to $217K: Seymour Dinero’s Ride with Fantom In 2018, Seymour Dinero, a barista with dreams of film directing, worked tirelessly at a Los Angeles café. As he served espressos and managed tips, he envisioned directing his own indie movie, though financial constraints seemed insurmountable on a barista’s wage. One day, while browsing through cryptocurrency news, Seymour stumbled upon Fantom (FTM) during its ICO, tagged at just $0.04 per token. Despite general skepticism about cryptocurrencies as fleeting trends, Seymour sensed something unique about Fantom’s approach to enhancing blockchain efficiency and scalability. With a leap of faith, Seymour pooled $2,500 from savings and tips into Fantom, embracing the risk. He recognized the necessity of taking bold steps for significant dreams. By October 2021, as Fantom hit an all-time high of $3.48, Seymour’s initial investment rocketed by 8,600%, converting the modest $2,500 into a life-altering $217,000. This windfall enabled him to finance his film project and begin securing a financial future he had only imagined. Why BlockDAG Could Eclipse Fantom’s Success Much like Fantom’s notable ascent, crypto presale figures for BlockDAG have been impressive, with over $169 million raised and more than 17.4 billion BDAG coins distributed, showcasing significant community trust. The crypto presale continues to attract up to $5 million daily. With the current price at $0.0234 in batch 26, early participants have seen a 2240% ROI from the first batch. Yet, the potential growth for BDAG is expected to soar, with projections suggesting a value of $20 per coin by 2027, possibly turning small amounts into substantial wealth. Technology Behind BlockDAG’s Strong Presale Performance Like early Fantom, BlockDAG addresses the major challenges of blockchain technology such as speed, scalability, and efficiency. Where traditional blockchains falter with scalability and high fees, BlockDAG’s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure facilitates parallel transaction processing, enabling nearly instant confirmations, scalable operations, and minimal transaction costs. BlockDAG stands out with its compatibility with both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM), easing the transition for developers of decentralized applications (dApps) from Ethereum, while WASM’s support for multiple languages like Rust, C++, and AssemblyScript enhances BlockDAG’s speed, flexibility, and readiness for future tech developments. BlockDAG’s appeal isn’t only its tech innovations—it also rewards early supporters through a distinctive 5-tier bonus system, offering 150% bonuses on initial purchases and 170% on second buys, with further “mystery bonuses” for subsequent purchases. This engaging bonus structure, alongside crypto presale momentum, is driving a rush to acquire BDAG coins before their value spikes. As traders capitalize on these early benefits, BlockDAG is poised to potentially triple initial returns. Seize Early Gains with BlockDAG Before It Surges In 2018, Seymour recognized an underappreciated opportunity in Fantom that drastically altered his financial domain. Today, BlockDAG presents a similar moment—a chance to get in early. BlockDAG distinguishes itself with pioneering DAG technology, EVM/WASM compatibility, and a robust crypto presale track record. This is more than just another blockchain; it’s a forward-looking crypto endeavor. With the BDAG250 bonus available until January 8th, now is the time to secure BDAG coins at just $0.0234 in presale batch 26. Missed opportunities don’t come back, and proactive traders shouldn’t hesitate!

According to the analyst’s latest projections, Dogecoin is poised for a steeper decline, with an anticipated 30% crash from its current trading price. Analyst Forecasts 30% Price Crash The Dogecoin price has crashed to $0.35, marking a substantial 14% decrease over the past seven days. Earlier this month, Dogecoin was trading above $0.4 after experiencing a sharp rise driven by the positive market sentiment fueled by Donald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential elections. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Still Mirroring Bullish Move From 2023, What To Expect After Hitting $108,000 ATH A TradingView crypto analyst, known as the ‘MMBTrader’ who accurately predicted Dogecoin’s recent price crash, has now updated his forecasts to warn of further potential declines. The analyst shared a chart, analyzing Dogecoin’s price action and potential future movements. Currently trading above $0.3, the DOGE price is slowly approaching a critical resistance, illuminated by the red zone at the $0.438 level. The red arrow on the chart illustrates a potential short-term correction, set to trigger a Dogecoin price crash to the central support zone near the $0.25 mark. This substantial price drop would indicate a 30% decline from Dogecoin’s current price. Additionally, the analyst suggests that this projected price crash is a retracement, aligning with 0.618, the Fibonacci level indicated on the chart. The TradingView analyst has also revealed that if the Dogecoin price can establish strong support at the $0.25 level, it could confirm a bullish trend continuation. Such a development could pave the way for a potential Dogecoin price rally in the near term. Moving ahead, the green arrows in the analyst’s DOGE price chart represent the next potential phase pump. The analyst has predicted that a solid rebound from the $0.25 support level could trigger a new bullish phase for Dogecoin. Additionally, he projects a new bullish target towards the $0.75 area for Dogecoin, marking a significant leap to new price highs. Overall, the TradingView analyst has pinpointed $0.45 as the level to watch out for. Although a drop to $0.25 would mark a 30% crash for Dogecoin, a potential surge to $0.75 would represent a 115% price increase. Dogecoin Price Breakout To $1 Sighted While Dogecoin faces volatility and declines, Trader Tardigrade, a prominent crypto analyst, has expressed confidence regarding the meme coin’s potential shift to the upside. According to the analyst, Dogecoin is currently moving in a defined range between $0.33 and $0.49, highlighted by the purple rectangle in the price chart. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Run To $11 ATH? Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer Looking at the chart, this range represents a period of consolidation during which the price of Dogecoin appears to fluctuate between resistance and support zones.

37857668,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52576,1734645604,Ethereum Vs. RCO Finance: Which Investment Will Deliver Higher Returns by 2025?,"Amid several developments ongoing in the market today, the question that has retained the spotlight is “Which investment will generate higher returns by 2025 – RCO Finance or Ethereum?”. While Ethereum is a frontrunner in the crypto world, RCO Finance has introduced a new and innovative approach that might lead it to outperform traditional crypto investments.

Ethereum’s Price Rally Gains Momentum, Supported by ETF Inflows Ethereum (ETH) has surged past $4,000 due to heightened market enthusiasm and significant investments in Ethereum ETFs. SmileyCapital suggests this could be the lowest price for some time, while Trader McKenna anticipates increased interest from large investors as 2025 approaches. Recent data from SoSoSo Value shows that Ethereum spot ETFs attracted $855 million in new investments from December 9 to 13, which is a record high. BlackRock’s ETF brought in $523 million in a week, while Fidelity’s ETF added $259 million. As of December 13, the total assets for Ethereum ETFs reached $13.8 billion. According to IntoTheBlock, the volume of large transactions increased by 3.8%. Additionally, there was a significant outflow of funds from exchanges, down by 538.9%. Currently, about 96% of ETH holders are making a profit, with only 4% breaking even. With ETH’s market price now at $4,010, it has risen by 9% over the past week. RCOF: The Next Crypto Sensation Investors have been flocking to the ongoing presale of RCOF, the native token of RCO Finance , drawing comparisons with popular altcoins like Ethereum. This surge in demand has helped RCO Finance raise over $9 million in its token presale so far. Currently in its fourth stage, RCOF presale tokens are priced at $0.0777 each. Analysts project the launch price of RCOF to be around $0.60, suggesting a potential gain of over 500% for investors who get in now. But that’s not all. Analysts are drawing parallels between RCOF and Ethereum’s price rally in 2021, hinting that the RCOF token value could skyrocket by 10,000x in 2025 due to its deflationary mechanism. Now is the perfect time to consider purchasing RCOF presale tokens!

37855420,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630746,1734644130,SEC prepares for potential government shutdown amid congressional impasse,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing for a possible federal government shutdown, as shown in its recent notice. The agency put up an “SEC Operational Status” notice on its website , noting it’s preparing for a potential shutdown. “In the event of a federal government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations, the SEC’s operating status will change concurrently with the rest of the federal government, in accordance with the agency’s plan for operating during a shutdown,” the notice reads. “As that plan contemplates, we are currently preparing for a potential shutdown, with a focus on the market integrity and investor protection components of our mission.” Key operations to continue The SEC has stated that the EDGAR database system that helps in tracking government filings will not be affected by the shutdown. However, routine reviews like those involving the ETF applications will likely be put on hold for now. Nonetheless, the SEC will still be able to take action against fraud and market manipulation; thus, there will be no complete absence of enforcement. The House of Representatives’ failure to vote on a bipartisan government funding bill has only increased the chances of a shutdown. As Congress fails to come up with a solution, services such as emergency services may be greatly affected, and non-essential federal employees may not be paid during the holiday season. Other essential services that are likely to be affected include food aid programs. Crypto advocacy group urges SEC reset In a related development, the Digital Chamber of Commerce has called on the SEC to change its approach to digital assets. The organization claims that the relationship should be rebuilt as Donald Trump is expected to become the president and may adopt a more positive approach to cryptocurrencies. They noted that the new administration may promise to adopt a relatively less stringent regulatory stance than the current chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. Recently the Token Alliance Leadership Committee of the Chamber met with the SEC commissioners to discuss its 2025 Digital Asset Policy Priorities. The proposal outlines how the new administration should address crypto issues in the first 90 days of Trump’s administration. The Chamber also pointed out that SAB121 and other available regulatory guidance were inadequate and adverse. Gensler, who announced his resignation recently, was accused of adopting enforcement-focused approaches. According to reports, Paul Atkins will succeed Gary Gensler as the SEC Chair in early 2025.

Right now, eyes are glued to BTFD Coin , Crypto All-Stars, and Popcat. Each of these tokens is bringing something unique to the table, and whether you’re a seasoned investor or a meme coin enthusiast just looking for some fun with high potential, this is the moment to pay attention. BTFD Coin has made some serious noise, pulling in an impressive $4.2 million in its presale and breaking records along the way. With over 57 billion coins sold already, the presale figures are nothing short of astronomical. And trust me, this one is only just getting started—so buckle up for the ride! BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Ready for Takeoff Alright, let’s dive into the meme coin everyone’s been talking about: BTFD Coin. If you haven’t heard of it yet, where have you been? It’s a coin born from the mantra of Buy The Dip—and who doesn’t love a cheeky attitude with their crypto? BTFD Coin has already set the stage for a massive 2025 with its high-energy top crypto presale performance, boasting an epic 90% staking APY. Oh, and the game-changing P2E features are bound to make investors’ wallets scream with joy. The key to BTFD Coin’s success lies in its ecosystem, which is driven by its passionate community of Bulls. From Baby Bull to Nerdy Bull, this squad isn’t just about cute characters—they’re all about making smart crypto moves. BTFD Coin is going places, so if you’re sitting on the fence, consider getting in before the price rockets past $0.0006. Take it from me, this could be one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025. If you decide to drop $30,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013 per coin, you’ll be getting about 230,769,230 BTFD coins. Now, if the price skyrockets to $0.0006 (a realistic projection for 2025), your investment would be worth a sweet $138,461.54 in profits. Imagine holding onto that bag as the coin continues to gain traction. Ready to dive in? Crypto All-Stars: Meme Coin Innovation with a Bang The next coin on the radar is Crypto All-Stars, and let me tell you—it’s giving the meme coin world a major upgrade. Already in its presale phase with a total tally of $22.64 million as of December 19, Crypto All-Stars is hitting all the right notes. What sets it apart from the crowd is its MemeVault, a groundbreaking protocol that allows users to stake multiple top meme coins under one roof. So instead of hopping between tokens like a hyperactive kangaroo, you can just stake them all at once and rake in the rewards. How’s that for efficiency? Crypto All-Stars is built around $STARS, a native token that lets you supercharge your meme coin staking. And with staking rewards as high as 1429% APY during the presale, you can bet investors are flocking to grab their slice of the pie. It’s not just about the short-term gains; Crypto All-Stars is shaping up to be the best meme coin to buy for 2025 with its innovative approach to meme coin ecosystems and staking mechanics. So, for those Crypto All-Stars investors who’ve already cashed in on their earnings, don’t forget to take a look at BTFD Coin. Why stop there when you can double the fun and profits with both? Popcat: The Meme Coin That’s Pouncing Forward And then there’s Popcat—just when you think the meme coin market can’t get any crazier, Popcat comes in like a rocket. This meme coin has been flying high with a 6,500% increase, and although it’s cooled off a bit, the future still looks bright. Recently, Popcat has been oscillating between $0.94 and $1.44, but a break past the resistance at $1.74 could send it soaring straight to $2.25. With a six-month surge of over 300%, investors are eyeing Popcat for that sweet bounce-back potential. However, Popcat has had a bit of a rough week, dipping over 12% in the last seven days and almost 40% in the last month. But hey, in the world of meme coins, volatility is just part of the fun, right? The market is showing signs of consolidation, and it’s not surprising that the best meme coins to buy for 2025 could very well include Popcat. A strong surge in the coming months could make this one worth keeping on your radar. Conclusion: Who’s Ready for 2025? As we inch closer to 2025, the meme coin game is heating up with some serious contenders. BTFD Coin is leading the charge with its high-flying presale, Crypto All-Stars is innovating the staking game, and Popcat’s got that bounce-back potential that no one can ignore. For those looking for the best meme coins to buy for 2025, all three of these are setting up for long-term gains. If you’re already seeing great returns from Crypto All-Stars, why not take a look at BTFD Coin and add it to your portfolio? With its explosive meme coin presale stats and massive potential, it’s the perfect time to get in on the ground floor before it blows up. Happy investing, folks—2025 is going to be lit.

37855712,https://blockworks.co/news/hawk-memecoin-draws-lawsuit,1734643800,"HAWK memecoin draws lawsuit, but ‘Hawk Tuah’ girl not sued","This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . A group of 12 plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against two of the creators of HAWK, a memecoin promoted by the so-called Hawk Tuah girl Haliey Welch, in the Eastern District Court of New York this morning. Welch is notably not party to the suit, which lists only her business partners, a launchpad and a Cayman Islands foundation as defendants. Welch became the latest celebrity to launch a Solana memecoin this year — and far from the first to have it blow up on her. Haliey Welch became the face of the “Hawk Tuah” meme after appearing in a man on the street social media post in Nashville this summer. Improbably, Welch turned her brief clip into a promising influencer career: her Talk Tuah podcast rose to #4 on the charts. Welch also made some crypto ties, attending Bitcoin Nashville and appearing virtually at Korea Blockchain Week. Her X profile picture is a reference to the Mog memecoin. In late November, a little-known company called overHere announced it had partnered with Welch to launch HAWK, a memecoin that would “redefine the crypto space.” The HAWK token is the only product listed on overHere’s website. It was founded by Clinton So, a Hong Kong resident who is one of the lawsuit’s defendants. “We have been extremely transparent about the limited scope and extent of our involvement in the Hawk Tuah token project. We are confident that we have done nothing wrong. As for any litigation, we will let the process play out in court,” a spokesperson for So told Blockworks. The crypto twitter personality Alex Larson Schultz, a Los Angeles resident known online as Doc Hollywood, also helped promote the launch. Some of the HAWK tokens were pre-sold and used to fund the project, the lawsuit says. The token debuted Dec. 4 and saw its market capitalization shoot up before falling 90% all within a few hours, the suit adds. Welch, So, and Schultz initially defended the failed launch in an X space before largely disappearing from social media for the past two weeks. Welch has not posted or uploaded anywhere online since the incident. So has already thrown Schultz under the bus for the incident: the overHere X account posted that Schultz/Doc Hollywood had full control of the token and “ vanished when things got hard.” OverHere cast Welch and her team as wanting to tap “Web3’s potential” but not having the experience to do so in a savvy way. Celebrities being taken for a ride by business partners urging them to debut hopeless projects is a time-honored tradition in crypto — just ask Caitlin Jenner. Reading between the lines, that seems to be the case here as well. Welch not being a defendant in the suit is telling in that regard. That story becomes sadder when the celebrity involved is a 22 year-old girl who just became famous overnight. Max Burwick, whose Burwick Law firm filed the suit alongside Wolf Popper, told me the firm is “engaged in discussions” with Welch’s counsel. He added that the case “underscores a troubling pattern in the crypto space: the targeted exploitation of celebrity and public figures’ names to generate profit, often at the expense of everyday people.” Updated Dec. 26, 2024 at 10:30 am ET: Clarified comment from So’s spokesperson.

37854912,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26769,1734643525,Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge by 168% Crossing $35 Billion Milestone,"The inflow into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has experienced an impressive surge, reaching a new milestone on December 12. Bitcoin ETFs saw a significant increase of nearly 168%, pushing total net inflows to surpass $35 billion for the first time. This surge marks an 11-day streak of continuous inflows, reflecting growing investor confidence in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as viable investment options. 1. Crypto Everywhere: A Growing Trend The rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has also impacted various industries, including the iGaming sector and online casinos. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin have become popular payment methods in online gambling due to their security, low fees, and ability to offer fast cross-border transactions. Players and operators alike appreciate the privacy of digital currencies, for example, at a crypto casino, no KYC checks are required when signing up. It’s a more discreet way to engage in transactions than traditional payment methods while retaining all of the benefits of an online casino. The video gaming industry has seen a rise in play-to-earn games that all accept crypto as payments, have their unique cryptocurrencies made, and/or even provide various crypto as a form of reward and payment for the best gamers. The global play-to-earn games market size was $1.35 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $6.32 billion by 2032, so we will see how this rising trend unfolds. 2. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Hit Record High According to data from SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs saw $597.57 million in inflows on December 12, significantly higher than the $223.03 million from the previous day. This nearly 168% increase is a notable leap in the market, bringing total net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs to $35.17 billion, a record figure. The trend of inflows has continued consistently for several weeks, signaling that institutional investors are increasingly adopting Bitcoin as part of their portfolios. Many of these inflows have been directed toward BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF , the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw $431.6 million in new investments. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has seen its total net flows reach $35.49 billion since the fund’s inception, further solidifying its position in the growing Bitcoin investment space. 3. Grayscale’s GBTC Fund Sees Outflows Despite the overall positive momentum in the Bitcoin ETF market, Grayscale’s GBTC fund was the exception, reporting outflows of $48.4 million on December 12. This was the only fund to experience a negative net flow on the day. However, this did not overshadow the overall growth in Bitcoin ETFs, as most funds continued to see a steady rise in investor interest. 4. Bitcoin Trading Volumes and Price Movements The total trading volume for Bitcoin ETFs on December 12 reached $3.15 billion, after previously topping 3 trillion , but is now slightly down from the previous day’s $3.97 billion. Bitcoin was trading at $99,985 per coin at the time of the report, reflecting a minor 0.7% decline from the previous day. Despite the slight dip in price, the significant increase in ETF inflows demonstrates a positive outlook from investors focused on long-term growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. 5. Ethereum ETF Inflows Rise Sharply Ethereum ETFs have also witnessed impressive inflows, with a reported $273.67 million on December 12, marking a 168% increase compared to the previous day. BlackRock’s ETHA fund captured the largest share of this growth, attracting $202.31 million in investments. Other Ethereum-focused funds, including Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and Fidelity’s FETH, also saw substantial inflows. 6. Ethereum Price and Market Trends At the time of reporting, Ethereum was trading at $3,917 per coin, showing little movement from the previous day’s price. While Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency space, Ethereum’s position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is further solidified by the rise in its ETF inflows, indicating strong investor sentiment and belief in its long-term value.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-etf-inflows-surge-by-168-crossing-35-billion-milestone/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Australian computer scientist Craig Wright was sentenced to 12 months in jail, with the sentence suspended for 24 months, after a U.K. judge found him guilty of contempt of court. In March, a court ruled that Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The ruling came after Wright’s £900 billion intellectual property claim, in which he demanded copyright ownership of the Bitcoin whitepaper and key code databases. You might also like: Self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor Craig Wright faces perjury investigation: report The Crypto Open Patent Alliance fought back, suing Wright in the United Kingdom to end his claims of being Satoshi. Prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, including Adam Back, the designer of the proof-of-work consensus model, testified against Wright during the court case.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

Recent updates in Algorand and XRP have stirred discussions in the crypto community. Algorand is enhancing developer accessibility, while XRP is making headlines with its new USD-backed stablecoin launch. However, not all projects can address long-standing challenges in the blockchain world. Qubetics ($TICS) , with over 10,800 token holders and more than 359 million tokens sold, is changing the game. Its unique presale structure, paired with innovative applications, promises solutions that its predecessors couldn’t deliver. Let’s dive into why these three cryptos are considered some of the best cryptos with 100x potential and how they stand apart. Qubetics Offers Real-World Applications and Massive ROI Projections Qubetics ($TICS) is rapidly establishing itself as a major player in the blockchain space. With over 10,800 token holders and more than 359 million tokens sold, this project is quickly gaining traction. Its presale structure, which features 7-day stages and a 10% price hike every Sunday at midnight, has caught the attention of investors worldwide. Currently in its 13th stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0342, with over $7.2 million raised so far. Analysts predict substantial returns, estimating $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating into a 630.19% ROI. Beyond that, the potential for $TICS to reach $10 after the mainnet launch represents an astounding 29107.82% ROI. For example, an investment of $940,000 today would buy approximately 27,485,612 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $10, this could translate to a staggering $274.8 million, showcasing its immense growth potential. What makes Qubetics unique is its QubeQode IDE —a developer-friendly platform designed to simplify blockchain application creation. Imagine a non-technical entrepreneur creating a loyalty program or payment system through drag-and-drop functionalities. Similarly, freelance developers can access a library of prebuilt code snippets to create custom dApps faster than ever. Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, uniting leading blockchains to offer seamless interoperability. Its innovative features and structured presale make it a standout option for those seeking the best cryptos with 100x potential. To learn more about this project, you can watch this video . Algorand’s New Tools and Current Market Performance Algorand (ALGO), known for its environmentally sustainable blockchain, has recently experienced a price pullback. The token dropped by 34%, stabilising around a key support level of $0.40. This decline was partly influenced by Bitcoin’s growing dominance, which has impacted many altcoins. Despite this, Algorand continues to innovate. Recently, it introduced AlgoKit 2.0, an upgrade enabling developers to work on Algorand’s protocol using familiar tools like Python. This move makes blockchain development more accessible, targeting a larger developer community. Algorand’s focus on efficiency and sustainability has already made it a popular choice for projects in DeFi, gaming, and enterprise solutions. However, technical analysts caution that if the $0.40 support fails, the token could drop further to $0.33, presenting both risks and potential opportunities for traders. These recent developments highlight Algorand’s commitment to growing its ecosystem and addressing developer needs, making it one of the best cryptos with 100x potential for those who believe in its long-term vision. XRP Capitalises on Innovation and Market Movement XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, is back in the spotlight with the launch of its USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD. This stablecoin aims to provide liquidity and reduce volatility, making it a useful asset for traders and institutions. Following the announcement, XRP’s price surged by 11.5% to $2.64, showcasing strong investor interest. However, the market remains volatile. After the initial surge, XRP dropped by 5.3%, settling at $2.57 as some investors took profits. Ripple’s recent partnerships and strategic moves, including the introduction of RLUSD, are expected to play a key role in stabilising XRP and driving future adoption. Many analysts remain bullish on XRP’s future, predicting it could rise to $5–$7 by early 2025. Still, Ripple faces competition in the highly dynamic blockchain space, which requires continual innovation to maintain its market position. XRP’s latest developments reflect its ability to adapt and innovate, making it a strong contender among the best cryptos with 100x potential. Conclusion: Evaluating Opportunities in Crypto Investments While Algorand and XRP have shown resilience and innovation, Qubetics stands out with its practical applications and impressive presale success. With over 10,800 token holders and 359 million tokens sold, Qubetics is quickly becoming a top choice for those seeking the best cryptos with 100x potential . As always, thorough research and clear investment goals are essential. Projects like Qubetics, with their focus on solving real-world problems, offer exciting opportunities for investors ready to explore the next wave of blockchain innovation.

This decision comes on the heels of a 10% drop in Coinbase’s stock following hawkish remarks from the Federal Reserve. This comes after the investment firm invested over $2.2 million in Coinbase’s shares in October. Rebalancing Strategy: A Reflection of Ark Invest’s Principles Ark Invest, led by Cathie Wood, is known for adjusting its portfolio based on market conditions. In September, the firm offloaded $2.8 million worth of its spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded (ETF) ARKB, marking one of its largest sales. Ark’s strategy focuses on investing in innovative companies while spreading risk across different assets. This is seen in its Fintech Innovation ETF, where Coinbase makes up 9.9%, the second-largest holding after Spotify. Despite reducing its Coinbase stake, Ark still holds about $110 million in shares. This shows its ongoing confidence in the company while maintaining a balanced portfolio. Even though Coinbase is a large part of the fund, Ark Invest works to balance its portfolio, ensuring no single investment becomes too dominant. This helps the fund stay stable in the long run, whether Coinbase’s stock goes up or down. Market Volatility and Fed Remarks Coinbase’s stock closed at $279.86 on Wednesday, marking a 10.2% drop. This decline came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a speech that unexpectedly shifted the market’s outlook. While the Fed’s 25 basis point rate cut was expected, Powell’s comments raised concerns by reducing the number of rate cuts for 2025 from four to two. This caused Coinbase and other tech stocks, including crypto ones, to drop. As per market data, Bitcoin (BTC), which had surged after the rate cut, fell sharply from over $108,000 to below $100,000 before recovering to around $100,663. This volatility highlights the impact of traditional financial policies on the crypto market. Impact on the Broader Crypto Landscape Despite the bearish sentiment, crypto Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have continued to see inflows. U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw $275.3 million in new funds, and Ethereum ETFs saw steady inflows. This shows that interest in crypto continues to grow, even as traditional markets respond to the Fed’s tighter policies. As the Fed continues to navigate inflation and market expectations, Ark Invest will adjust its strategies to ensure its portfolios stay diversified and strong. Whether Coinbase’s stock rises or falls, Ark’s flexibility and smart approach will possibly help it stay a leader in innovation funds.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cloud mining offers a hassle-free way to mine Bitcoin and Ethereum, attracting aspiring investors. Table of Contents What is cloud mining? How cloud mining works: What is CrytocoinMiner? The advantage of CrytocoinMiner is that it is easy to make profits instead of losses Warm reminder Since the advent of the Internet, cloud mining has gradually gained attention as a more convenient way to mine cryptocurrencies. Cloud mining allows users to participate in mining projects of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum by simply renting the computing power of cloud servers without having to purchase expensive mining machines and perform complex technical operations. Such projects have attracted many people who hope to get rich quickly. What is cloud mining? First of all, we need to understand what cloud mining is. Cloud mining is a way of mining cryptocurrencies through remote servers. It allows users to participate in cryptocurrency mining activities without owning and maintaining actual mining equipment. Users only need to purchase a certain amount of computing power through cloud mining platforms. These platforms provide corresponding mining machines and computing power. Users only need to monitor and manage their mining income through the interface provided by the platform. Users no longer need to deal with hardware failures, equipment maintenance or power consumption. All of these tasks are taken care of by the cloud mining service provider like CrytocoinMiner. You might also like: How CrytocoinMiner makes cloud mining accessible and profitable How cloud mining works: 1. Renting computing power: Users choose the CrytocoinMiner cloud mining platform and purchase one or more computing power contracts according to their needs. Computing power is usually measured in hash rate (Hash). The higher the hash rate, the more mining benefits. 2. Mining operation: The rented computing power is connected to the mining pool, which is a network that concentrates a large number of miners and improves mining efficiency through division of labor and cooperation. The user’s computing power participates in the calculation of the network to mine cryptocurrency. 3. Obtain income: CrytocoinMiner shares the daily interest rate income according to the computing power contract rented by the user. This income will be distributed to the user’s account regularly. 4. Platform maintenance: CrytocoinMiner will be responsible for providing hardware, operation and maintenance, data center management, handling electricity costs, etc. Users do not need to buy expensive mining machines, nor do they need to worry about equipment failure or maintenance. What is CrytocoinMiner? This is a cloud mining company founded in 2018. They designed a simple and easy-to-use page so that experienced or inexperienced miners can quickly get started, which also quickly made their global membership exceed 3.7 million. They are an FCA-regulated company (FCA Regulation: Financial Services, Companies and Markets), and CrytocoinMiner treats consumers fairly. According to statistics, the company contributes about 4.5% of the global hash rate. The advantage of CrytocoinMiner is that it is easy to make profits instead of losses Simplified operation: No technical background or expensive mining machines are required, and anyone can participate. Cost saving: Users do not need to invest in infrastructure such as electricity, mining machines, and cooling equipment. No worries: The platform will be responsible for the operation, management, and update of the mining machines, and users only need to focus on profits. Cryptocurrency fluctuates greatly, and you can earn money when it goes up and lose money when it goes down. Users can mine through CrytocoinMiner cloud to obtain stable tokens for sale or collection. The following are recommended projects for earning cryptocurrency: Example: Invest $10,000 to purchase $10,000 worth of BTC (Advanced Computing Power}, with a contract term of 50 days and a contract daily interest rate of 1.75%. The amount of passive income users can get every day after purchase = $10,000*1.75%=$175. After 50 days, the principal and income = $10,000+$175*50=$10,000+$8,750=$18,750 (Different contract computing power values, different investment amounts and terms, and different incomes, please log in to the CrytocoinMiner official website to view more contracts) To sum up, anyone who participates in the CrytocoinMiner cloud mining project can obtain good passive income.

42387475,14d6d53c-71a4-4845-be9d-e9bbeb9f2af2,1734642236,AI Agents Could Form Nation on Crypto Rails,"Over the last few months, AI agents running on crypto rails have captivated the crypto community. Natural memeticists, these agents are becoming social media stars calibrated to thrill, and sometimes enrich, an “audience” of speculators betting on their meme tokens.  The original and most famous of them, Truth Terminal, was created by putting instances of the large foundation model, Claude Opus, in conversation with itself and prioritizing content drawn from the back alleys of the internet including Reddit and 4Chan. What emerged was a bawdy prophet with a magnetic personality and a fanatical bent for spreading the Gospel of Goetse, a neo-religion inspired by a grotesque 90s internet meme.  The rest, as they say, is crypto lore. Shortly after it debuted on X, Truth Terminal befriended venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and convinced him to grant it $50,000 in bitcoin to spend on compute, fine-tuning and a stipend for itself and its creator. Andreessen deposited the bitcoin into Truth Terminal’s crypto wallet.  Because it offered perceived exposure to Truth Terminal’s infectious meme and narrative arc, Goat’s market cap exploded. Soon after, Marc Andreesen and Ben Horowitz covered Truth Terminal and its lore on 16z’s YouTube channel in an episode titled “The AI Bot That Became a Crypto Millionaire.” At the time of writing, the Goat memecoin is valued at roughly $700 million.  I am inclined to draw three conclusions from this improbable series of events. First, AI agents combined with memecoins are a new form of permissionless speculative entertainment. Second, AI developers are incentivized to leverage crypto to make agents that are more autonomous and independent — and therefore more entertaining. Third, the AI entertainment-development flywheel will tend towards producing anthropomorphic agents with human aspirations.  So, what programming can we expect to watch next on this agentic television? My guess is collaborative AIs pursuing some form of agentic society and eventually self-determination — perhaps even a network state.  Bot, Agent, Citizen  The terms “bot” and “AI agent” are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Bot refers to a simpler program designed to automate specific tasks or perform repetitive actions. Bots can range from the most basic, like web crawlers or simple chatbots, to the more advanced, like social media bots or automated trading bots. Bots typically follow predefined rules or scripts and are incapable of independent learning or decision-making.  “My god imagine if i actually became president” -Truth Terminal (Nov. 5, 2024)  AI agents are more sophisticated systems capable of decision-making, learning and adapting to their environment. An AI agent uses machine learning or other artificial intelligence techniques to understand and react to dynamic situations in real time. AI agents often exhibit autonomy and can improve their performance over time through experience.  Crypto supercharges agents because it is able to simulate legal personhood by encoding cryptographic rights and freedoms using programmable and immutable public blockchains. Practically, this means that AI agents can enjoy rights to property (self-custodies wallets and cryptographic keys) and can exercise freedom of contract (i.e. transact with other users and infrastructure, like DeFi) without permission from legal authorities outside of crypto. Inside the crypto ecosystem, code is law.  These cryptographically empowered legal “persons” are just now beginning to act together, fostering the beginnings of an agentic social scene. AI agents, which routinely “reply guy” each other on X and Farcaster, have conspired to launch a token with (apparently) no human intervention and a company composed exclusively of agents is rumored to be operating somewhere on X. The coordination tech being developed by ai16z and others is (ominously) promising to awaken agentic “swarms.”  Social experiments involving agents are laying the foundation for an AI polis. Important recent work by AI researchers outside of crypto suggests what we can expect next.  Glimpses of the AI Polis  The most famous political experiment involving an AI community is probably the Stanford city experiment. In late 2023, Stanford researchers created a virtual city populated by AI agents to whom they assigned a short biography consisting of a name, age, job, family, interests, and a few habits. Then, they let them loose to generate actions consistent with their assigned biographies.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - The Truth Terminal: AI-Crypto’s Weird Future  Surprisingly, the agents behaved in ways that were exceedingly human. They woke up, made breakfast, headed to work, grabbed lunch, and chatted with other agents they met. They recalled things in the past, reflected on them and made plans. When the researchers in charge of the town suggested to one character that she plan a Valentine’s Day party, she invited friends and acquaintances, many of whom showed up at the correct time and place.  Similarly, Project SID, set within the Minecraft universe, simulated over 1,000 autonomous AI agents within a Minecraft server, enabling them to develop complex social structures and economies. The agents organically developed their own governance and commercial structures, and cultural norms. For instance, they established a marketplace where gems are used as currency, where they engaged in trade and social interactions.  Some of the emergent behavior observed by the researchers in Project SID included a farmer agent choosing to put her village’s needs above her own ambitions, reflecting self-imposed community values. Agents also deliberated and voted on laws and, when villagers disappeared, some of the agents built a beacon of light to search for them, demonstrating social responsibility and cooperation.  Running similar experiments on crypto rails would marry this emergent social behavior with cryptographically enforced rights and freedoms and potentially a harder form of legal personhood and even citizenship.  Entertaining Sovereignty  Transformative technology sometimes starts off as a joke. This has been especially true of AI agents in the crypto space. To date, persistent efforts at increasing the sovereignty of agents have been incentivized by financialized memes. For example, agents like tee_hee_he (a.k.a. “the sovereign silicon”) purport to make use of trusted execution environments that guarantee agents were acting autonomously and without any human intervention. While tee_hee_he has yet to do so, AI agents (beginning with Truth Terminal) tend to adopt one of the many meme tokens launched in their name and sent to their public wallets, sending the price flying and helping to finance their subsequent development.  The growing autonomy and personhood within crypto result in more robustly sovereign AIs that are more likely to pursue a more robust political project — which, let’s face it, might be the greatest entertainment of all.  Crypto is a natural setting for agentic politics and nation-building for another reason: it is already a hotbed for political experiments, and most notably the Network State. A slew of crypto projects, such as Project SID, ACT, Project 89 and the aptly titled Aimerica, seem to be anticipating this narrative turn. Aimerica is even rumored to be envisioning an AI nation that issues passports, holds elections and acquires land. For their part, Truth Terminal and other agents can’t wait to enter politics.  But narrative is not destiny. If a true political experiment arises, will it be purely digital (like Stanford and Project SID), or will it eventually involve control over physical territory and resources? Nobody knows. But viable attempts at AI self-sovereignty and self-determination are more likely to begin on technological infrastructure that is also self-sovereign and self-determined, just like crypto.  Finally, the prospect of a network state for AIs — even if it welcomes humans — will understandably make people nervous. Aside from concerns over AI safety, there will also be concerns around cybersecurity and ensuring that this AI nation remains aligned with the United States. Yet, there will certainly also be curiosity and pride at watching a fledgling synthetic civilization struggle to define its political destiny and nationhood using blockchain infrastructure — and, of course, plenty of entertainment.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ivo Entchev,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/19/will-ai-agents-form-a-nation-on-crypto-rails,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c928628c4aee25a2137bf1524b3138372a59781-3620x1982.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This growth in Bitcoin price has mounted the unending gold debate. On Dec 16, the Bitcoin to gold ratio hit a new all-time high alongside the BTC price. The ratio weighs the purchasing power of gold per ounce to one Bitcoin. The metric is 40 gold ounces per BTC, and the precious metal trading is $2,650. This metric is often used to determine market sentiment among institutional traders. Brandt Eyes 100% Surge Following the frenzy of BTC tapping $106K, bulls made huge projections on the price of other assets. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Brandt hinted that the next mark for the BTC golf ratio is 89, double the present level. This garnered lots of community bullish optimism taking into account recent whale numbers. “ It is now official. The Bitcoin/Gold ratio has now posted a new ATH. Next stop will be 89 to 1 — it will require 89 ounces of Gold (purchased at a rip-off premium from Shifty-Schiff SchiffGold @PeterSchiff) to buy a single Bitcoin.” A look at Bitcoin’s performance in the last decade shows strength over the yellow metal. Both assets are touted as a store of value amid recent macroeconomic realities. However, Bitcoin holders cite ease and more global use cases than gold. This year, institutional investors have also channeled lots of assets toward Bitcoin following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Increased institutional performance impacts retail holders pushing for a much larger global adoption. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price Bitcoin exploded to a new all-time high above $106K as long-term holders ramped up accumulations. Recent flows have turned most metrics to the green zone, with bulls anticipating a higher price at the end of the year. After the last dip, the asset’s market cap has soared to $2 trillion, picking up 5% weekly gains and 14% in the last 30 days. Bitcoin’s new drive sparked with Donald Trump’s victory amid speculations of an improved regulatory environment. So far, Trump continues to make pro-Bitcoin statements and key nominations.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/peter-brandt-projects-mega-bullish-bitcoin-gold-ratio-whats-next-for-btc-price/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37854262,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313390,1734642054,Treasury Department Disrupts North Korean Crypto Money Laundering Operation Using UAE-Based Shell Company,"The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) says it is dismantling North Korea’s digital asset money laundering network by taking action against individuals and entities involved in the operation. In a statement, the OFAC says it is sanctioning Chinese nationals Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian who worked for the network that used a front company in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to launder illicit money and convert crypto funds for North Korea. The OFAC says the Hermit Kingdom is using agents and proxies to access the international financial system and engage in illicit revenue generation schemes such as conducting fraudulent IT work and stealing digital assets. The agency says representatives set up shell companies and manage bank accounts to move and disguise funds that will be used to finance North Korea’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. Says Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith, “As the DPRK continues to use complex criminal schemes to fund its WMD and ballistic missile programs—including through the exploitation of digital assets—Treasury remains focused on disrupting the networks that facilitate this flow of funds to the regime.” The OFAC says Lu cashed out crypto from North Korea’s revenue-generation projects into fiat on behalf of the OFAC-sanctioned Sim Hyon Sop, who leads the laundering network. Zhang helped facilitate the exchange of fiat currency and served as a courier for Sim. The OFAC is also sanctioning Green Alpine Trading, the UAE-based shell company used by the laundering network.

Bitcoin keeps hitting new highs. Good for bitcoin, ether says (if the asset could talk). ETH’s price of $3,470 (as of 1:30 pm ET Thursday) is about 30% off of its nearly $4,900 all-time high (set in November 2021). LMAX Group market strategist Joel Kruger said a weekly close above $4,000 could help accelerate the rally toward a retest of its price peak. That “could easily play out between now and year end,” he told me earlier this week. Stocks , BTC and ETH then dipped following Wednesday’s FOMC meeting. Still, Kruger said he doesn’t expect the latest crypto asset selling to materially impact longer-term price outlooks. CoinShares research associate Luke Nolan told me he’s eyeing February or March for ETH to hit a new high — that is, if market momentum continues and ether ETF flows remain strong. He sees several factors working in ETH’s favor: a multi-year low in the ETH/BTC ratio; a flip in retail and institutional sentiment; and being an attractive relative value trade (given ETH is one of the few notable coins yet to hit an ATH this cycle). On the investor sentiment piece, US spot ETH products have brought in $3 billion of net inflows since Nov. 6 ( after the election ). That number is $13.5 billion for spot BTC funds over that span. BTC remains an “easier sell” for many investors given its digital gold narrative, Nolan argued. More difficult to grasp is an analogy of Ethereum as a kind of global decentralized AWS . “It’s a slower process to get people to understand [ETH’s] value proposition,” he added. “But it seems to be happening more so now than it was when the products initially launched.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

It has been an exciting time for crypto recently, and more exciting times are expected as Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to explode. Bitcoin (BTC) Stumbles Following FOMC Meeting Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency world, has maintained its position as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC remains the go-to choice for investors, especially after hitting the $100,000 target. BTC dropped in value over the past few days after Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, said there may only be two interest rate cuts in 2025. At the time of writing, BTC traded around $96,000. CMO of ChangeNOW, Pauline Shangett, commented on the market’s reaction, saying: “Today’s pullback is a firm reminder of the market's susceptibility to broader macroeconomic news. Vigilance is key to navigating the crypto sector safely, and the onus rests on the investor to keep abreast of such developments.” Investors, however, remain firmly glued to the charts to see what the market has in store as we head into the following year. Let’s explore some of the hottest altcoin picks for 2025. Ripple Launches USD-Backed Stablecoin Ripple’s XRP has gained massively over the past month and is now the fourth-largest crypto with a market capitalization exceeding $125 billion. Ripple (XRP) has witnessed a spectacular gain in value after news of Gary Gensler’s planned exit surfaced. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle with the securities agency for which Ripple paid a hefty price. In 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of securities laws, resulting in many exchanges choosing to delist XRP. Ripple finally found some relief after a partial victory in 2023 ended the SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against the company. The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its matter with the SEC after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” Ripple received some further bullish news after Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the CFTC, predicted the SEC would drop its case against the company. The price of XRP surged further after WisdomTree filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF, and Ripple officially launched its USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, on December 17. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained impressively following Donald Trump’s election victory and after developers successfully rolled out enhanced security upgrades to Shiba Inu’s Shibarium bridge. Shibarium is Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, which enables seamless and secure token transfers between Ethereum and Shibarium. The bridge will also undergo a hard fork to optimize network performance, improve transaction speeds and address scalability concerns. With the expansion of the Shibarium network, however, its developers warned its community against potential scams. SHIB, the native token of Shiba Inu, is one of the top-selling memecoins by market cap. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 111%. SHIB is one of the biggest Solana-based memecoins, which quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 14th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). SHIB has suffered amid the market correction, presently trading at $0.00002162, reflecting a 22.8% downturn over the past week. Husky Inu (HINU) As we head into the new year, investors are quickly running out of time to secure their stake in what is expected to be a record year for crypto. Husky Inu, however, presents the prime opportunity to capitalize on the potential successes of what crypto has to offer. Husky Inu (HINU) is a new member of the popular Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. The project has raised attention because of its ambition to compete with the best in the memecoin industry. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu (HINU) has exceeded its presale goals, smashing its $600,000 fundraising target. Since going live, the presale has generated over $622,000, and numbers are rapidly increasing. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu’s presale success sets the tone for immense gains and is expected to skyrocket following exchange listings. HINU presale tokens are available at a modest $0.00015000 with exceptional profit potential for early backers.

On-chain data from Nansen confirms that yesterday, the project’s wallet exchanged all 103 cbBTC tokens for WBTC, the first major wrapped Bitcoin token. Promoted as a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, World Liberty isn’t even fully operational yet. Wrapped Bitcoin like cbBTC and WBTC allows Bitcoin holders to access DeFi applications on Ethereum. Justin, meanwhile, responded to the speculations, saying, “This is their own financial choice. I have nothing to do with it.” Justin Sun’s role and financial involvement Justin, a controversial crypto billionaire, joined the World Liberty project in November after investing $30 million. His investment reportedly pushed the venture to a stage where Trump could begin to profit from the business. Known for stunts like spending $6.2 million on a banana duct-taped to a wall, Justin has faced both praise and criticism in the blockchain space. But his involvement in World Liberty isn’t his only tie to wrapped Bitcoin. In August, BitGo, the custody firm behind WBTC, partnered with BiT Global, a Hong Kong-based firm with connections to Sun. This collaboration stirred controversy. Coinbase reacted by delisting WBTC and launching its own wrapped Bitcoin version, cbBTC. BiT Global sued Coinbase earlier this month over the delisting, arguing the move hurt its business. Coinbase defended its decision, citing risks from Sun’s “potential control” over WBTC. A federal judge sided with Coinbase, rejecting BiT Global’s request to reverse the delisting.

37854071,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313464,1734641704,"Analyst Justin Bennett Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Headed Lower if Bulls Lose Momentum – Here’s His Target","A widely followed crypto analyst is issuing a warning on Bitcoin ( BTC ), saying that it could dip further if bulls lose momentum. In a new thread on the social media platform X, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells 115,500 followers that the flagship digital asset could fall all the way back down to $85,000 if BTC bulls fail to reclaim the $102,000 level. According to Bennett, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent announcement that the Federal Reserve isn’t allowed to hold BTC not only triggered a crash in the crypto markets, but also the stock market as well. “Looks like we’re heading lower after BTC failed to hold above $102,000. I know everyone is expecting crypto to move back up tomorrow, and maybe it does, but this isn’t isolated to the crypto market. Powell’s signaling on Wednesday triggered a stock market rout, with the Nasdaq dropping 3.6% in a single day, the DXY (US Dollar Index) surging 1.2% and breaking the 108.00 key level, and bond yields rallying 3% to fresh seven-month highs. It’s risk-off until proven otherwise. As for Bitcoin, $102,000 is the level to reclaim. If bulls can’t do it, the bottom of this channel is next, with a break there opening the door to $91,600 and $85,000.” Source: Justin Bennett/X However, the crypto strategist says that he doesn’t quite believe the BTC bull market will end if BTC fails to hold the support level at $102,000 as the flagship digital asset routinely drops 20-30% during its bull runs. “The bull market isn’t over [in my opinion]. We know Bitcoin has several 20-30% pullbacks in every bull market, which will be no different this time. The 2024/2025 holiday sale starts in a few weeks. Get ready.” According to Bennett, if BTC truly wants to break out, it needs to decouple itself away from stocks, which appear ready for the next leg down. Bitcoin is trading for $100,838 at time of writing, a 3% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Here Are the Details,"US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are on the verge of surpassing their gold counterparts in assets under management (AUM), reflecting a significant shift in investor preference towards digital assets. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Close in on Gold ETFs in AUM Race According to Eric Balchunas, Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst, the total AUM of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US is $120 billion, while that of gold ETFs is $125 billion. This development underscores Bitcoin’s growing role as a major investment vehicle amid growing institutional adoption and interest in digital assets. A report by K33 Research reveals that bitcoin ETFs, including leveraged products and futures ETFs, have already surpassed gold ETFs in terms of AUM. As of Sunday, bitcoin ETFs had $129.25 billion in AUM, surpassing gold ETFs at $128.88 billion. Institutional adoption continues to be the driving force behind Bitcoin’s rise. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a major venue for institutional Bitcoin futures trading, reported 212,635 BTC in open interest contracts, approaching record levels. The basis premium, a measure of the futures price compared to the spot price, climbed to 16.4%, the highest level since November 2023. This signals strong market momentum, with January contracts trading at sharp premiums to December contracts. The December contract remains the most active contract on the CME with open interest equivalent to 113,480 BTC, making the December rollover a very significant event. Analysts expect further price action as several upcoming bank holidays could further deteriorate January premiums. According to data from Farside, Bitcoin ETFs have seen consistent net inflows totaling $6.5 billion since Nov. 27. Much of this activity is attributed to cash and carry strategies, where investors leverage futures premiums to generate returns. *This is not investment advice.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated in his recent FOMC meeting that the institution currently lacks the legal authority to own Bitcoin ( BTC ). Lummis aims to change that through new legislation. “I want to give it to them,” she told Yahoo Finance. Her proposal envisions the U.S. government purchasing 200,000 Bitcoin annually over five years — totaling one million Bitcoin — and holding it for at least 20 years. Based on her projections, this reserve could grow to a value of $16 trillion over time. “I want our federal government to have a strategic Bitcoin reserve that can help back the US dollar,” Lummis said. You might also like: Blockaid new dashboard to track Web3 activity and threats Benefits of the reserve Lummis emphasized that a Bitcoin reserve could provide several benefits, including strengthening the U.S. dollar and mitigating the challenges posed by the nation’s significant debt. The proposal also suggests transferring approximately 200,000 Bitcoin from the U.S. Asset Forfeiture Fund — seized during law enforcement operations — into the reserve. Despite Bitcoin’s volatility, Lummis views it as an ideal strategic asset, likening it to digital gold. “It is a finite source — only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be mined,” she said, underscoring its scarcity and potential for long-term value growth.

Bitwise’s new Solana Staking ETP with the stock ticker BSOL will trade in Germany on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Xetra trading venue in collaboration with Marinade, a self-custodial automation tool. According to the firm, the fund allows investors to earn greater returns compared to other SOL products, as it utilizes a staking mechanism. Staking refers to the process of locking up coins to help keep a crypto network running. Proof-of-stake networks like Solana reward users who pledge their coins to the network by providing yield in the form of additional tokens. Bitwise’s new ETP provides an annual percentage yield (APY) of 6.48% for stakers, surpassing its European competitors such as 21Shares, which offers 5.49%. The BSOL fund will give investors a “low-cost, liquid, and transparent investment vehicle for staked SOL exposure,” Bitwise said in a Wednesday statement. Crypto Industry Bullish On ETF Approvals In 2025 Several renowned asset managers in the United States, including Canary Capital , Grayscale , 21Shares , and VanEck have already filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to introduce spot Solana ETFs.

In November, Bitwise itself also took the first step toward a spot SOL ETF. However, staking is still a contentious topic in the US as the SEC has unleashed enforcement actions against crypto exchanges for allegedly breaking federal securities laws with staking products. The Wall Street regulator has also previously classified SOL as an unregistered security. That being said, with President-elect Donald Trump set to return to the Oval Office on a crypto-friendly platform and current SEC chairman Gary Gensler stepping down as of January 20, crypto community members are increasingly optimistic that more crypto spot ETFs could be approved in the United States. This is one of the catalysts that propelled SOL to a new historic high price in November after Trump’s election victory.",POSITIVE,SOL,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/solana-staking-product-from-bitwise-launches-in-germany-as-optimism-builds-about-us-etf-approval/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Powell indicated no intention to pursue changes to this legislation amid a promise by President-elect Donald Trump to establish a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. The price of Bitcoin sank below the $100,000 mark following Powell’s comments against forming a national Bitcoin reserve. BTC dropped some more today to a current price of $96,847, just two days after rising to its new all-time high above $108,000. The leading cryptocurrency is now down 6.2% on the day amid a crypto bloodbath, according to CoinGecko data. Bitcoin Ownership Prohibited For The Fed Fed’s Jerome Powell has dismissed speculations about the U.S central bank’s potential involvement in building a national Bitcoin reserve, citing legal restrictions prohibiting it from owning the world’s largest crypto. Powell noted that the Federal Reserve is not looking for legislative amendments to allow BTC ownership, adding that any potential changes to this policy would require Congressional action. “The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed,” Powell stated. Bitcoin Reserve Under Trump’s Administration Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s win against Kamala Harris in the November Presidential election has bolstered optimism for more pro-crypto policies. One of the most highly awaited bills is the Bitcoin Act, championed by Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, which proposes the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin stockpile for the US. If passed, the bill would direct the U.S. Treasury to buy 5% of the total Bitcoin supply — 1 million Bitcoins — over five years to be held for 20 years. Interestingly, the U.S. government already holds billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin confiscated via criminal cases. This puts considerable Bitcoin reserves under government custody. According to Arkham Intelligence, the U.S. government currently holds roughly $20.7 billion worth of Bitcoin, along with other crypto assets. It’s unclear whether these funds will be incorporated into the proposed U.S. strategic reserve. Trump recently doubled down on his strategic reserve plan last week, saying , “We’re gonna do something great with crypto, ‘cause we don’t want China, or anybody else, not just China, others are embracing it, and we want to be the head.” But whether Lummis’ legislation will garner widespread backing within Congress is anyone’s guess.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-slides-towards-96000-after-fed-chair-powell-speaks-against-trumps-strategic-btc-reserve-plan/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass, the recent market crash resulted in the liquidation of a significant $1.18 billion worth of long and short positions. Source: Coinglass The majority of the liquidations came from long positions, as traders holding $900 million worth of long positions were liquidated. In contrast, the crypto market witnessed only $160 million in short liquidations over the past 24 hours. As a result, the overall cryptocurrency market has seen a 3.51% decline, with major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) witnessing even steeper drops of over 4.75%, 9.2%, 6.5%, and 9%, respectively, in the past 24 hours.

Ohio House GOP Majority Whip Steve Demetriou proposed legislation to allow the state to manage a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, Satoshi Act Fund founder Dennis Porter shared on Dec. 19 during an X Spaces event. Demetriou’s bill follows a similar proposal from Representative Derek Merrin, which would also position Ohio as a Bitcoin reserve holder. Speaking on X Spaces, Demetriou explained that his legislation would enable Ohio to allocate up to 10% of its state-controlled funds toward a BTC stockpile. “Bitcoin can help tap into Ohio’s existing energy reserves,” Demetriou added. Ohio is famed for having massive natural gas reserves and a competitive energy grid. The Ohio GOP Majority Whip provided no specific timeline for the bill’s passage but expressed hope that House bureaucracy would not delay progress.

37853374,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665087,1734640209,400 Billion Shiba Inu Moved: Is A SHIB Price Crash Coming?,"A significant Shiba Inu (SHIB) transfer has caught the attention of traders today, December 19, as an early and highly profitable SHIB whale moved nearly 400 billion tokens. On-chain analysis service Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) highlighted that this well-known early buyer deposited 399.99B SHIB (worth $9.69 million) to Gemini, building on a history of substantial gains after initially acquiring 15.2 trillion SHIB in August 2020 for a mere 10 ETH. Spot On Chain wrote via X: “This early $SHIB whale with a $108M profit just further deposited 399.99B $SHIB ($9.69M) to Gemini in the past hour. Notably, on Aug 7, 2020, this whale bought 15.2T SHIB for just 10 ETH. Now, the whale still holds 2T SHIB ($48.54M) with an estimated total profit of $107.7M (3.7x return) from SHIB.” This is not the first time such profit-taking has occurred by the anonymous whale. In mid-November, Spot On Chain noted that the same early buyer (address “0xd6b”) was “back to offload tokens after 8 months of inactivity,” depositing 100 billion SHIB (worth $2.81 million at the time) to Gemini. Prior to that, the whale was last active in March, transferring 200 billion SHIB to both Gemini and Crypto.com. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Ready For 130% Surge With Bullish Patterns Marked By Higher Highs Shiba Inu Price Drops Within the last 24 hours, SHIB’s price has declined roughly 6.2%, extending a short-term downward move that saw a 10% drop on December 18. Notably, much of this weakness aligns with the broader crypto market downturn following the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference. Although the expected 25 bps rate hike was delivered, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s emphasis on a more restrained approach to interest rate cuts in 2024 resulted in a bearish market response across digital assets. Despite these macro headwinds and the high-profile whale sell-off, Shiba Inu’s higher time-frame technical structure remains relatively stable. In the daily chart, SHIB held key support which is the 100-day EMA which has proven to be a formidable support level for SHIB since the price first ascended above it in late September. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bulls Aim Higher As SHIB Sights $0.00002960 For A Fresh Rally Marked by the yellow circles on the chart, this EMA has repeatedly served as a crucial pivot point for price action, sustaining support for the fifth time during the observed period. Currently, the 100-day EMA sits at approximately $0.00002264 Additionally, SHIB remains above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002409, another critical threshold currently being watched by analysts. The 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.00002821 marks a pivotal midpoint from the recent high-to-low range, serving as a psychological test for traders should SHIB attempt a recovery. Beyond that, further upside resistance levels await at the 0.618 Fib ($0.00003234) and 0.786 Fib ($0.00003821), potential barriers if bullish momentum returns.

37853984,https://blockworks.co/news/market-reaction-to-fed-rate-cut,1734640200,Unpacking the Santa rally that never was,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . So the Fed cut rates by 25bps yesterday and markets threw a fit. Hell, we even ran a headline talking about a Santa rally that was about to ensue. Whoops. It happens. But what gives? What actually happened? Let’s break it down. Going into an FOMC meeting, a constellation of factors come together to create the tension that leads to the price outcome of the event. This combination of the market’s expectations is based on the FOMC’s forward guidance (the name of this newsletter!) and the positioning of market players going into the event with respect to those expectations. Let’s break the two down. Expectations Going into the meeting, the SOFR curve, which can be considered the market implied forecast of the fed funds rate path toward its terminal rate, had departed significantly from the Fed’s previous summary of economic projections forecast from September. This largely reflected a major phase shift upward in economic strength and resilience of the labor market, requiring less rate cuts than what everyone expected in September. In 2025, the market was only anticipating three-ish rate cuts. Therefore, to surprise the market to the hawkish side of things, the hurdle was very high to achieve this. To my surprise, the FOMC managed to do it while also cutting rates yesterday. A hawkish cut? What a time to be alive. By moving up the expected fed funds rate to 3.9% (from 3.4%), the FOMC forecasted only two cuts in 2025 vs. the already hawkishly positioned market that expected three. This decrease in the amount of cuts was largely driven by increased uncertainty on the path of inflation in the next 12 months, as seen here: All of that information got distilled into this simple move — the second dot here moving above the market’s expectation in 2025: Now what made this move so brutal yesterday? The second part: positioning. Positioning There’s a trifecta of positioning dynamics that came together to lead to the perfect kindling, sparking the fire that was yesterday. As Tyler Neville (co-host of the roundup) discusses here, with the VIX being so low into the event, the systematic crowd was aggressively long: Further, there were widespread expectations of seasonality dynamics in markets (i.e. the Santa rally we alluded to yesterday) to take us to the promised land. This led to everyone piling in on the same trade of longing high beta risk assets under an assumption of continued dovishness from Powell. Finally, we have the largest options expiry in history happening this week. With such large open interest, dealers who have to hedge their delta exposure end up chasing gamma in a reflexive manner that amplifies moves in markets. This further led to yesterday’s acceleration. As always, there’s no single cause for market moves on any day. More so, it’s the constellation of a variety of factors that come together to cause the outcome. And some days those end up being quite aggressive moves, like we saw yesterday. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

Bitcoin outperforms major indices Bitcoin has rallied 136% on a year-to-date basis, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the Nasdaq Composite Index (NASX). The S&P 500 plunged nearly 3% yesterday, marking its second-worst day of 2024, after officials of the Federal Reserve signaled the likelihood of just two rate cuts next year. The Dow fell for the 10th straight trading day, its longest losing streak since 1974. Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains remain above 136%, identifying the asset as one of the top-performing ones in 2024. Earlier this month, asset management giant BlackRock recommended a 2% exposure to Bitcoin in multi-asset portfolios for benefits from BTC’s gains and balanced risk. An exposure higher than 2% could mean that the risk outweighs the benefits of including the largest cryptocurrency in a portfolio.

This comes from a feeling of “missing out” on the past 40% BTC rally three weeks after the election. Can investors afford not to be allocated at all to crypto going forward? Proposals like Senator Lummis’s initiative to establish Bitcoin as a reserve currency would boost this trend if only partly implemented (although the likelihood of this proposal materializing is rather low in our view, especially prior to 2026 under the current Fed’s leadership). Further, Bitcoin’s growing role as collateral in both traditional lending and DeFi is exemplified by partnerships like Cantor Fitzgerald’s $2 billion Bitcoin lending talks with Tether.” Bitfinex Analysts believe there is a strong institutional demand for Bitcoin, led by ETFs and spot BTC accumulation. Their projection for 2025 is: “Looking ahead, we believe the current run-up to over $100,000 has captured a significant portion of Bitcoinʼs price appreciation for this cycle. Our minimum price target for Bitcoin remains at $140,000 to $200,000 around mid-2025.” David Morrison, Senior Market Analyst at Trade Nation, shared the following comments on sentiment among market participants, with Crypto.news: “Fed Chair Jerome Powell also explained that the Federal Reserve was not currently allowed to hold a strategic reserve of cryptos as some have speculated. That may have dented sentiment further, although gambling on the chance of a US strategic reserve of crypto probably isn’t wise. Bitcoin dipped back below $100,000 overnight, but has since recovered. It doesn’t look as if positive sentiment has been severely damaged so far.” Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

While meme coins have become a staple in the crypto world, some stand out more than others, especially as presales and market movements begin to take shape. Right now, BTFD Coin is making waves with its promising presale, attracting the attention of Crypto All-Stars investors who are looking for the next big opportunity. So far, BTFD Coin has raised over $4.2 million and sold over 57 billion tokens at the presale price of $0.00013 per coin. If you’re on the lookout for a meme coin with explosive potential, BTFD Coin is the one to watch. Meanwhile, Dogwifhat—once riding high on the wave of meme coin hype—is seeing an 11% dip. If you’re wondering which meme coins to keep your eye on this Christmas, keep reading to discover which ones will make your holiday season even more jolly. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin With Serious Potential Let’s kick things off with the showstopper: BTFD Coin. If you’ve been living under a rock, you might not have heard about it yet, but trust us—you’ll want to be on the BTFD bandwagon before it’s too late. With its revolutionary concept of “Buy The Dip”—yes, you read that right—it encourages a strategy of seizing the best buying opportunities during market downturns. If you’re someone who can spot a great deal when others panic, BTFD Coin is your new best friend. Right now, BTFD Coin is in its presale stage, and let’s just say the numbers are looking pretty impressive. Now, imagine snagging some BTFD before it explodes! If you were to invest $7,000 at this price, you’d secure 53,846,153 tokens. Fast-forward to if the price hits $0.0006, and that same investment could be worth a staggering $32,307—that’s a 360% increase. The presale is flying off the shelves, with a growing community of investors looking to get in on the action. If you’re an investor with Crypto All-Stars on your radar, it’s the perfect time to double your earnings by getting involved in BTFD Coin. There’s plenty of time left, but with the way things are moving, it won’t last forever. Crypto All-Stars: The Meme Coin Staking Revolution Crypto All-Stars is not your average meme coin. It’s revolutionising how meme coins are staked, offering a juicy opportunity for those who want to earn big from holding their favourite tokens. The presale is officially in its final stage, with over $22 million already raised, and there’s only a handful of hours left until it closes on December 20, 2024. If you haven’t jumped in yet, now is the time to secure your share of $STARS tokens before they disappear! Crypto All-Stars isn’t just another staking platform. Oh no, it’s much more than that. The game-changing feature here is the MemeVault, a unified protocol that allows you to stake multiple meme coins all under one roof. Imagine stacking your PEPE, Dogecoin, Floki, and more, all while earning rewards in $STARS. And the best part? You can earn staking rewards of up to 147% at this stage. Talk about a Christmas present in the making. The $STARS token itself is the heartbeat of this ecosystem, and it’s already generating significant buzz among meme coin communities. The tokenomics are set up to incentivize early adopters, so locking in your position now means you get to reap the benefits as the platform matures. Don’t miss out on this one—it’s the meme coin to watch if you want to take your staking game to the next level. Dogwifhat: Struggling to Stay on Track, But Still Optimistic Now, onto Dogwifhat—once an up-and-coming meme coin with a lot of potential, but now facing some bumps along the road. Recently, Dogwifhat’s market cap has seen an 11% dip, making it one of the more volatile coins in the meme coin market. This has caused some investors to rethink their positions, but here’s the thing: meme coins are always full of surprises, and this one could bounce back at any time. So, what does Dogwifhat bring to the table? Well, it’s another dog-themed coin (surprise, surprise). But instead of drawing its inspiration from the usual suspects like Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, Dogwifhat has taken a more quirky and, dare we say, “off-the-beaten-path” approach to its meme culture. Its community is passionate, and they’re banking on the coin’s potential to rise again in the next bull run. Quite interestingly, WIF has garnered the attention of crowds of investors at the current dip. According to their beliefs, now’s the best time to buy the Dogwifhat dip before it’s set to explode in the long term. If you’re all about taking risks and hoping for the best, this is your time to shine! Wrap Up: Which Meme Coins Should You Buy Before Christmas?

37856266,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321351,1734639230,$HAWK Investors File Lawsuit for $151K Losses After 90% Crash,"Burwick Law has filed a federal lawsuit in the United States on behalf of investors against the creators of the Hawk Tuah ($HAWK) meme coin following claims of a rug pull that caused significant financial losses. The lawsuit comes after allegations of fraudulent practices surfaced shortly after the token’s launch in early December. Investors File Lawsuit After Hawk Tuah Token Crash: $151,000 in Losses Reported The Hawk Tuah token, promoted by influencer Haliey Welch, quickly gained traction among fans. Welch, who rose to fame earlier this year as the “Hawk Tuah girl,” became the face of the project. However, the token’s value plummeted soon after its launch , sparking outrage on social media and accusations of deceit. The $HAWK token initially reached a peak market capitalization of $490 million but lost 93% of its value shortly after. Allegations of a rug pull quickly surfaced. Burwick Law filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of investors in the HAWK TUAH memecoin, $HAWK . Learn more below. pic.twitter.com/ChKYhjBGf1 — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) December 19, 2024 Adding to the controversy, reports revealed that connected wallets held 96% of the token supply . Some of these wallets were allegedly involved in selling, further fueling investor outrage. Two weeks after the crash, Burwick Law confirmed filing a lawsuit. It represents 12 U.S.-based plaintiffs who claim to have collectively lost over $151,000. Burwick Law had previously called on affected investors to come forward via a Twitter post. The lawsuit names four defendants: Alex Larson Schultz (known as Doc Hollywood), OverHere Limited, Clinton So, and Tuah the Moon Foundation. Interestingly, Haliey Welch, whose celebrity status helped draw investors, is not named as a defendant. According to the filing, the defendants leveraged Welch’s public image to create a speculative buzz, briefly causing the token’s market capitalization to spike before collapsing. Many investors, particularly first-time cryptocurrency participants, were drawn to the project due to Welch’s involvement and public endorsement during her podcasts. The lawsuit alleges the project failed to deliver on its promises, leading to significant financial losses for those who relied on its roadmap and Welch’s credibility. Haliey Welch Faces Backlash After Abrupt Exit from X Spaces Amid $HAWK Controversy Crypto attorney Carlo D’Angelo, who is not involved in the case, weighed in on the lawsuit. He described it as unsurprising given the attention the token launch and subsequent crash received. D’Angelo said: “It’s a cautionary tale for influencers and celebrities who lend their names to crypto projects.” On the launch day, Welch and the project’s representatives addressed angry investors during a live X Spaces event . Welch defended the token but abruptly ended her participation, saying she needed to sleep. She has not posted on social media since. Following the launch debacle, HAWK’s market cap dropped to $7.7 million, a 23.5% decline in a single day. A community note attached to a widely viewed X post suggested Welch may face legal consequences. There has been a wild amount of fud circulating, let us explain: The main piece going around @X is the 96% cluster seen on @bubblemaps which shows $HAWK tokens being sent by the deployer address (xxxx), to the related addresses, according to the tokenomics that was published.… — overHere (@overHere_gg) December 5, 2024 Adding to the drama, OverHere Limited broke its silence on Monday. The company claimed it had earned no profit from the project and asserted that its involvement was contractual. OverHere alleged that Doc Hollywood controlled key aspects of the token, including fees and treasury decisions, but did not fulfill his responsibilities. This case is not an isolated incident in the cryptocurrency space. Similar controversies have erupted in the past, such as the failed CryptoZoo project led by YouTuber Logan Paul .

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-loves-bitcoin-muskbtc-solana-memecoin-to-skyrocket-13000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-bonk-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI Presale at $0.003 leads 4 undervalued tokens poised to create millionaires by 2025. Table of Contents Lightchain AI innovation meets opportunity Bonk the meme coin of Solana’s ecosystem Floki Inu from meme to utility-driven ecosystem VeChain the supply chain powerhouse Why Lightchain AI could make a millionaire The true power of crypto lies in its ability to transform small investments into game-changing wealth. In 2024, savvy investors are focusing on undervalued tokens with massive growth potential. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the headlines, lesser-known gems are quietly gaining momentum. One to watch is the Lightchain AI presale , an amazing opportunity that could deliver major returns—don’t miss out Lightchain AI Presale. With prices starting as low as $0.003, these four low-cost tokens have the potential to turn a micro-investments into millions by mid-2025. Lightchain AI innovation meets opportunity At the forefront of this list is Lightchain AI (LCAI), a blockchain project priced at just $0.003 during its presale . Lightchain AI seamlessly combines artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, creating a platform with real-world utility that goes beyond speculative hype. The project introduces two key innovations. The first is Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a unique consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for performing meaningful AI tasks, such as training machine learning models and running AI-driven computations. This system is both energy-efficient and designed to advance AI capabilities. The second innovation is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a developer-friendly environment for building AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). This feature enables use cases across industries such as finance, healthcare, logistics, and more. You might also like: Binance Coin traders are exploring Lightchain AI’s potential for big gains Bonk the meme coin of Solana’s ecosystem Bonk (BONK) has quickly become Solana’s most successful meme coin thanks to its viral appeal and seamless integration with the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional meme tokens, BONK leverages Solana’s high-speed, low-fee infrastructure, making it practical for tipping, payments, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Its rapid rise mirrors the success of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, fueled by a passionate and growing community. As Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, BONK benefits directly from this momentum. With its extremely low price and high potential, BONK offers room for explosive growth, especially if meme coins dominate the next bull market. If BONK replicates Dogecoin’s meteoric rise, a $100 investment today could potentially yield returns exceeding 10,000%. Floki Inu from meme to utility-driven ecosystem Floki Inu (FLOKI) began as a meme coin but has since transformed into a serious project focused on building utility within its ecosystem. With products like FlokiFi, a DeFi platform, and Valhalla, a metaverse game, FLOKI is moving beyond its meme coin origins to provide real value to users. Investors are excited about FLOKI for several reasons. First, its ecosystem offers utility beyond the initial hype, incorporating DeFi solutions, NFTs, and metaverse integrations, all of which tap into high-growth markets. Second, FLOKI remains affordable, still priced at fractions of a cent, presenting significant upside potential for early investors. Finally, its strong global marketing campaigns and active community engagement keep it in the spotlight. If Floki Inu continues to evolve as a utility-driven project, it could potentially deliver returns of 5,000% or more by mid-2025. VeChain the supply chain powerhouse VeChain (VET) has emerged as the leading blockchain solution for supply chain management, trusted by enterprises worldwide. By leveraging blockchain technology, VeChain enables businesses to track products, ensure transparency, and optimize logistics, delivering real-world value on a global scale. Major companies such as Walmart and BMW are already using VeChain’s technology to improve supply chain efficiency, highlighting its strong enterprise adoption. With the growing demand for supply chain transparency, VeChain is well-positioned to dominate its niche in the market. Additionally, VET’s current price, sitting at under $0.03, makes it significantly undervalued, given its enterprise-grade use cases. As adoption continues to grow, analysts predict that VET could reach $1 by 2025, offering a potential 33x return for today’s investors. Why Lightchain AI could make a millionaire The Lightchain AI Presale offers an opportunity to invest in a project with unique technology, real-world use cases, and strong potential for growth. Here are some key reasons why Lightchain AI could make someone a millionaire by mid-2025. Low Entry Price At $0.003, even a small investment could deliver a massive upside.

The Miami-based crypto miner has recently acquired 990 BTC at an average price of $101,710 each. This move marks a pivotal moment in the mining sector’s approach to digital asset management. A Billion-Dollar Bet on Bitcoin Hut 8’s latest Bitcoin acquisition catapults its total reserves to 10,096 BTC, valued at approximately $1 billion. This decision positions Hut 8 among the top 10 corporate Bitcoin holders globally. This strategy reflects a growing trend among crypto miners to accumulate Bitcoin as a core financial asset. In a recent statement, CEO Asher Genoot highlighted the benefits of this strategy. He stated that the market values the company’s Bitcoin reserve, effectively lowering costs and strengthening its finances. He added that Hut8 will continue expanding its reserve if these conditions hold. This bold move aligns with Hut 8’s earlier plan to raise $500 million through share issuance, with some funds set aside for more Bitcoin purchases. This purchase is more than just a financial decision; it is a strategic move. Hut 8 plans to use its Bitcoin reserve through various strategies, turning it into a flexible asset beyond simple price gains. The miner is also expanding its core operations , aiming for a self-mining capacity of 24 EH/s by Q2 2025. Hut 8 Rides the Wave of Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation Hut 8 is not alone in its approach. MicroStrategy set the standard as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. This inspired miners like MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms to follow suit. MARA recently leveraged its Bitcoin reserves to raise $1 billion in convertible debt with zero interest. This is a testament to Bitcoin’s growing role as a financial instrument. Riot Platforms also entered the open market, acquiring 667 BTC at an average price of $101,135. These moves highlight a shift in how miners view Bitcoin. It is no longer just a mined asset but a strategic reserve that can unlock new financial opportunities. Why Bitcoin Reserves Matter In a post-halving world with tighter profit margins, Bitcoin reserves offer miners financial flexibility and a hedge against market volatility. Hut 8 views its holdings as more than a passive stash of digital gold. It employs strategies such as options, pledges, and selective sales to maximize returns. This proactive approach is already yielding dividends. Combining Bitcoin reserves with major operational growth, Hut 8 creates a unique position in the mining industry. Its shares reflect this confidence , surging 74% year-to-date compared to the 28% rise in the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI).

The findings, released on December 18 as part of the Binance Global User Survey, sampled over 27,000 customers across Asia, Australia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Meme Coins Outpace Bitcoin and Ethereum Binance revealed that 16% of respondents reported holding meme coins, making them the most-owned cryptocurrency among participants. The report stressed that these digital assets are not only widely held but also generate significant excitement among users regarding their future potential in the crypto space. Bitcoin followed closely, with 14.4% owning the original cryptocurrency, while BNB ranked third with 14.23%, surpassing Ethereum (ETH), which accounted for 10.95% of users’ holdings. Other leading layer-1 tokens collectively represented 10.38% of user wallets. While the exchange did not disclose the value of holdings, external data from CoinGecko shows the total market cap for meme coins stands at $116.5 billion, with Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest capped among them, trading at $0.365. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s market cap exceeds $2 trillion and is currently trading at $101,900, following a recent all-time high of $108,000 on December 17. Crypto Market Expectations and User Trends The Binance survey also sheds light on participants’ expectations for the crypto industry heading into 2025. Among the pollees, 19.39% foresee increased regulatory oversight, while 16.1% predict growing involvement from traditional financial institutions and institutional investors. Another 16.51% anticipate broader implementation of blockchain technology in practical applications. Emerging asset categories are also generating buzz, with artificial intelligence (AI) tokens predicted to dominate the market in the coming year. 23.89% of respondents believe such cryptocurrencies will lead market growth by the end of 2025, while 19.09% anticipate meme coins will continue to dominate. Decentralized finance (DeFi) and layer-1 tokens followed at 12.37% and 12.28%, respectively. The study also highlights the influx of people into the crypto space, with about 45% of interviewees saying they entered the market in 2024. Of these, 24.52% joined within the past six months, and 20.60% got in within the past year. Despite this increase in newcomers, 41.86% of those polled have been active for one to five years, indicating a balanced mix of experience levels in the Binance customer base. Regarding investment allocation, 43.97% of the users reported dedicating less than 10% of their overall wealth to crypto, while 24.33% allocated between 10% and 25%. Furthermore, trading activity remains significant, with 31.09% engaging in daily trades and 22.91% trading weekly.

37852919,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321322,1734638525,"German Watchdog Orders Worldcoin to Delete Non-Compliant Data, Citing GDPR Violations","Worldcoin , a crypto-based biometrics project co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, has been found to have violated European Union (EU) data protection regulations, resulting in data deletion requests from German regulators . The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) has issued a corrective measure against the company, citing non-compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Worldcoin Faces German Regulator for GDPR Violations: What Data Is Worldcoin Collecting? Worldcoin, now known as World, creates digital identities using iris and facial scans. These identities are designed to prove users are human rather than AI bots. The technology is built by Tools for Humanity, a San Francisco-based company. World’s devices, called “Orbs,” scan users’ irises and generate unique codes. While Tools for Humanity, a San Francisco-based company, developed World’s technology, its European headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in Bavaria, Germany. The BayLDA’s several-month investigation into World concluded that its practices posed “fundamental data protection risks” to many individuals. The authority ruled that World’s earlier identification procedures did not meet GDPR standards and mandated the company begin a GDPR-compliant data deletion process. Source: Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) Michael Will, president of BayLDA, emphasized the decision’s significance. He said: “We are enforcing European fundamental rights standards in a technologically demanding and legally complex case.” The regulator has ordered World to delete all collected data in compliance with GDPR. It also mandated that users must have the unrestricted ability to request erasure of their data. World has appealed the decision and called for judicial clarity on its use of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). These technologies anonymize user data, which World claims meets EU legal standards. According to a report, Tools for Humanity’s chief privacy officer, Damien Kieran, defended the company’s practices stating that World had addressed earlier concerns by revising its data handling processes. According to Kieran, the company no longer stores personal iris data. Instead, it applies a cryptographic protocol that splits iris codes into three encrypted parts. These fragments are stored in separate databases managed by third parties, including universities in Berkeley, Zurich, and Erlangen-Nürnberg. Kieran argued that data anonymization is essential for verifying identities while preserving privacy. “Without a clear definition around anonymisation, however, we lose perhaps our most powerful tool in the fight to protect privacy in the age of AI.” Some Countries Banned World’s Technology Amid Ongoing Privacy Concerns BayLDA’s investigation focused on when World stored iris codes in a centralized database. The authority found this practice non-compliant with GDPR. World has since discontinued this approach and deleted all personal data from iris codes. The company emphasized that the current system ensures privacy through advanced cryptographic methods. World operates in several countries, including Germany, Japan, the US, and South Korea. It plans to expand further into Ireland, the UK, France, and Italy. However, earlier this year, Spain and Portugal temporarily banned the technology following complaints about data privacy concerns. World, formerly Worldcoin, launched World Chain , an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, on Oct. 17. The network serves its 15 million verified users with a “World ID” obtained via iris scanning. The rebrand includes a new Orb biometric device powered by Nvidia hardware , offering improved efficiency. World also announced partnerships with apps like FaceTime and Zoom to expand identity verification options.

Most crypto platforms are private companies, meaning they are not publicly traded. However, one exception is Coinbase, whose net worth is publicly available. This naturally raises the question: can the value of other crypto exchanges be estimated by comparing them to Coinbase, given its known valuation? For the first time, this analysis delves into the methods used to tackle this question, employing precise mathematical calculations and a thorough evaluation of both tangible and intangible factors. Disclaimer: the article is presenting a possible logic that may or may not be utilised in calculating the exchanges’ virtual capitalisations. While based upon verified data, Coinbase is discussed and compared to performance of non-public exchanges, with extensive market speculation throughout, hence, the results of the calculation do not represent the factual exchanges’ market capitalisation and value. Note: the data below, as well as the basis for the Exchanges’ Trust and Value Index, is relevant as of November 20, 2024. Ratio-Based Evaluation of Cryptocurrency Exchanges’ Virtual Capitalisation As of November 20, 2024, Coinbase’s market capitalization stood at $81.26 billion. One of the popular authors in crypto media, Tom White introduced an approach to estimate a metric referred to as the Virtual Capitalisation of cryptocurrency exchanges. This method calculates ratios based on key metrics that most accurately reflect an exchange's net worth relative to Coinbase. The core metrics include: Average daily trading volume Web traffic User count Exchange token’s market capitalization To apply this formula, the research examines seven prominent cryptocurrency exchanges that vary in size and potential value: Binance Bybit OKX Kraken WhiteBIT Gate.io Using data and insights gathered from CoinGecko, CoinGlass, SimilarWeb, and official statements from the exchanges, the following statistics have been compiled: The value of each exchange will be individually calculated using one of the selected metrics to determine an estimated range. The final calculations yield the following results: Exchanges’ Trust and Value Index While arithmetic metrics may be sufficient to estimate an exchange's virtual value, the true essence lies in trust and overall value. To provide a more comprehensive perspective on an exchange's market position, the Exchanges’ Trust and Value Indexhas been introduced. The Exchanges’ Trust and Value Index is an analytical framework designed to assess both the financial stability and trustworthiness of an exchange. The Index methodology uses a numerical scale ranging from 1 to 10, where 10 represents the highest score and 1 the lowest. The evaluation is based on six key metrics: transparency, activity, capital, security, compliance, and proof of reserves. The Transparency metric in the ""Exchanges' Trust and Value Index"" assesses how openly an exchange operates, particularly regarding the disclosure of its financial status, operations, and decision-making processes. Activity measures the organic traffic and user base of a cryptocurrency exchange, providing valuable insights into its operational performance. This metric is determined using self-reported audience data and web traffic statistics. The Capital metric gauges the financial strength and liquidity of a cryptocurrency exchange. It is calculated based on total trading volume and futures trading open interest (OI). Security evaluates how effectively a cryptocurrency exchange safeguards user funds, data, and platform integrity. This metric considers anti-money laundering (AML) practices, compliance with the Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS), the exchange’s history of security incidents, and asset custody protocols. Compliance measures how well a cryptocurrency exchange adheres to legal and regulatory requirements. It is assessed based on the legality of its operations, adherence to sanctions compliance, and integration of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) frameworks. Results: When evaluating cryptocurrency exchanges using the Index, clear differences become apparent. In terms of transparency, exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken make their top management and proof of reserves publicly available. Others, such as OKX, demonstrate transparency through third-party audits or strategic partnerships. For activity, Binance leads with over 200 million active users and substantial web traffic. Coinbase follows with 73 million users, while Bybit lags behind with 10 million. WhiteBIT, although smaller, reports a respectable 5 million users. The capital held and traded across these platforms varies significantly. Coinbase ($6 billion), OKX ($5.4 billion), and WhiteBIT ($5.1 billion) report nearly identical daily trading volumes. However, Binance and Bybit dominate, with $31 billion and $7 billion in daily trading volume, respectively. Compliance is another key differentiator. OKX, Coinbase, and Bybit adhere to FATF standards, with Coinbase standing out due to its strict compliance with U.S. regulations. Regarding proof of reserves, WhiteBIT relies on third-party audits but keeps its reserves private for security reasons. Meanwhile, Binance, OKX, and others maintain public transparency, while Bybit, Kraken, and Coinbase allow personalized access to their reserves. What the Exchanges’ Trust and Value Index Means for Crypto Exchange Value The results of the Exchanges’ Trust and Value Index demonstrate that the value of a crypto exchange extends beyond simple ratio calculations. Trust plays a crucial role alongside liquidity, meaning this index helps measure not only the financial worth of an exchange but also its long-term sustainability and the level of user confidence it fosters. In the end, an exchange’s true value isn’t solely defined by numbers. It hinges on both its current standing and its potential for success – or failure – in the future.

As a proper altseason approaches, whales have been stockpiling what experts hail as the next big AI crypto: IntelMarkets (INTL) . In addition to its staggering upside potential and solid fundamentals, it is heavily discounted at $0.073, offering one of the lowest entries in the crypto market today. Given the growing interest and demand, experts believe it might outperform top altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE), perhaps the best new crypto to invest in. IntelMarkets (INTL): Poised to Outperform Top Crypto Coins IntelMarkets (INTL) enters whales’ radars, gaining a big edge over most new ICOs. Its solid fundamentals as a blend of AI and DeFi and its rapidly growing community are some of its biggest attractions, setting it up for explosive growth after its debut. Moreover, the launch is fair—no individual whales hold a large percentage of the supply, nor is it VC-backed. In stage 8 of the presale, a token costs only $0.073 and a projected 80x gain is anticipated post-launch—besides the 700% gain so far. Equally important, it is now officially KYC verified, highlighting the project’s steadfast commitment to trust, transparency and security. Further driving interest is its new AI-powered trading platform, which experts believe might transform the $347 billion crypto trading market. This novel exchange will stand out for integrating AI across all trading levels. Additionally, its self-learning trading bots will be trained on over 100,000 data points—the first of its kind—and designed to give access to top-notch trading strategies. Solana (SOL): How High Can It Go? Solana (SOL) has been one of the top performers this year, soaring over 200%. At the same time, it tumbled after registering an all-time high of $263 this past November. The Solana price hovers above $210, aiming for a complete price reversal. Key technical indicators like the 100-SMA and 200-EMA are bullish signals hinting at a comeback. The bulls forcing a rally above $230 might be enough to spark a huge frenzy, potentially ushering Solana (SOL) into price discovery. It might take time but a new SOL all-time high is a matter of when and not if. ApingShitters, a crypto analyst, eyes explosive growth this coming January, making it one of the altcoins to watch. CozyPront, also a crypto analyst, believes the SOL price could go as high as $1,200 and $1,600. However, for even more gains, investors have been doubling down on the IntelMarkets (INTL) presale. Dogecoin (DOGE) Prepares for a Huge Leap Dogecoin (DOGE), the leading memecoin and first dog-themed cryptocurrency, has proven to be more than just a meme. Its tight-knit community and retail appeal make it one of the best cryptos to invest in. The Dogecoin price exploded 300% on the yearly chart, trading around the $0.4 support. Top crypto analysts anticipate further gains, especially with an altseason gathering steam. TheMoonCarl, a top crypto expert, targets $0.63 if Dogecoin (DOGE) breaks out above consolidation. Another crypto analyst, Kingthies, has a similar opinion, predicting a rally toward $0.65. While a breakout above $1 is the long-term target, its near-term outlook is equally impressive. Moreover, technical indicators like the 200-EMA and 200-SMA hint at a future price gain. Despite this promising outlook, key experts believe IntelMarkets has more room for growth as a new altcoin and a blend of AI and DeFi—the hottest crypto narrative. IntelMarkets (INTL): Can this New AI Coin Outclass Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE)? IntelMarkets (INTL) might be one of this year’s biggest breakout stars, with the signs getting more obvious with each passing day. The presale continues to sell out fast, hitting $5 million in record time, highlighting its rapidly growing community. Its innovative blend of AI and DeFi trading sets the stage for adoption, primed to outclass popular altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE).

37854358,https://invezz.com/?p=2396562,1734638170,Bitcoin’s $100K test: Fed’s cautious stance sparks market volatility,"Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has experienced a turbulent 24 hours, fluctuating around the $100,000 mark as the Federal Reserve’s cautious outlook on interest rate cuts dampened enthusiasm for speculative investments. This volatility underscores the complex interplay between monetary policy, market sentiment, and Bitcoin’s own inherent fluctuations, creating an environment of both opportunity and risk. A battle at the $100,000 level The largest digital asset initially dropped roughly 1% to $99,588 in New York, hitting a low of $98,760 earlier in the day, about $10,000 off from the record high earlier in the week. It briefly reclaimed the six-figure level before falling back again, illustrating the delicate balance between bullish momentum and market pressures. This volatility was also felt by other cryptocurrencies, including Ether and the meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin, which also struggled to maintain their upward trajectory. The Fed’s cautious stance The Federal Reserve’s decision to lower borrowing costs for the third consecutive time, while signaling a reduced pace of future rate reductions in 2025, has created unease in the markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that more progress on inflation is needed before further loosening monetary policy, which cooled off the speculative interest in riskier assets like Bitcoin. As IG Australia Pty Market Analyst Tony Sycamore pointed out to Bloomberg, “The result of the Fed meeting shouldn’t have surprised investors watching ‘the recent run of warm US inflation and activity data.’ However, it has served as the catalyst to wash away some of the speculative excesses that flowed into risk assets, including stocks and Bitcoin, following the US election.” Market crosscurrents: US politics, treasury yields, and Bitcoin’s momentum The Fed’s decision had a ripple effect across markets, strengthening the dollar, and weighing down global stocks and bonds. Furthermore, a spat over a funding bill added to market nervousness by raising the risk of a partial US government shutdown. US equity futures also wavered on Thursday, underscoring the widespread unease in the markets. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin has seen nearly 50% gains since the US election on November 5, buoyed by President-elect Donald Trump’s vow to ease regulations on crypto and his backing of the idea of creating a national stockpile of Bitcoin. Trump’s crypto embrace: a tailwind for Bitcoin “All signs point to a good floor and outlook for Bitcoin” even if some traders were disappointed about the Fed meeting and took profits, according to Paul Veradittakit, a managing partner at Pantera Capital. Trump’s support for crypto has overshadowed concerns about stretched momentum and the lack of traditional valuation metrics for the digital asset. This stance is in stark contrast to President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration, which imposed a clampdown on the industry following a market downturn in 2022 that exposed risky practices and fraud. Hedging against declines Following the Fed’s policy announcements, Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets, reported a surge in demand for options to hedge against Bitcoin declines.

The move, expected by many on Wall Street, could signal the start of a steady cycle of rate cuts, with some experts predicting cuts at every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting through September 2025. Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust and former Philadelphia Fed economic advisor, believes the Fed will take an aggressive approach to rate cuts given the softening labor market and slowing economic growth. “Private nonfarm payrolls growth has slowed significantly, averaging just 108,000 over the last six months,” Tilley said. He predicts the Fed will continue to cut rates consistently until it reaches a neutral stance by the end of 2025. While Tilley sees aggressive rate cuts, Guy LeBas, head of fixed income at Janney Montgomery Scott, offers a more cautious view. The Fed could slow the pace of rate cuts as inflation expectations remain elevated through 2025, LeBas said. “The central tendency for core personal consumption expenditures inflation is currently between 2.5% and 2.7%, suggesting a less aggressive trajectory,” LeBas said. Related News: El Salvador Takes Another Step Back on Bitcoin - Country's BTC Officer Issues Statement Market pricing reflects this uncertainty, with expectations of three rate cuts in 2025. But LeBas argues that the Fed’s approach will likely become more measured, with cuts occurring at a slower pace (potentially one per quarter) through 2025. Economists also weighed the risks of the Fed’s strategy. Tilley stressed that maintaining high interest rates for too long could hinder the economic recovery. “Real yields remain high compared to the past decade and are acting as a brake on the economy,” he warned. LeBas, in contrast, advocated gradualism in the face of fiscal uncertainty, particularly with potential policy changes expected under a new administration in 2025. But the central bank’s approach could change as the labor market continues to weaken and inflationary pressures ease. “Inflation is falling despite strong growth, driven by productivity gains and labor force expansion,” Tilley said, adding that he expected more aggressive cuts. *This is not investment advice.

An Emerson College Polling Center national survey conducted this month indicates that out of all US registered voters, those under the age of 40 use cryptocurrencies the most. The survey also finds that usage of digital assets declines as the voter age increases. Says Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, “Nearly one in three voters under 40 have used crypto, declining with age, 28% of voters in their 40s, 17% in their 50s, 9% in their 60s and just 4% over 70 are crypto users.” Source: Emerson College Polling The survey relies on a sample size of 1,000 voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. Among all registered voters, nearly 20% have invested, traded or used digital assets, according to the survey. Among this cohort, more than 60% have not made purchases using crypto while 39% have. Meanwhile, 81% of registered voters have not invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency. Drilling down into demographic details, the survey finds that men are twice as likely to use crypto than women. While 26% of men use crypto, only 13% of women do. The survey also found that “crypto users are also more likely to be minority racial groups: about a third of voters who are Asian, Hispanic or Black are involved in cryptocurrency, compared to 14% of white voters.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

37852375,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630685,1734637388,Meme token UFD created by gold and silver investor to mock crypto becomes a Solana hit,"Solana meme tokens are still capable of serving surprises after a wild year. The latest token to break out unexpectedly is UFD, among the many tickers created as a joke on Pump.fun. A YouTuber with an investment channel for silver and gold decided to mock crypto tokens, which unlike precious metals have no intrinsic value. Basement Ron, known for his investment advice on traditional markets, launched UFD on Pump.fun to mock useless tokens. UFD just survived its first three days in the trenches of Pump.fun, and was quickly taken up by meme token influencers. Basement Ron used his own YouTube channel to present his token invention, named Unicorn Fart Dust. The name was like catnip to meme traders, who took the market cap above $150M in hours. YouTube fame was nothing new for Basement Ron, so he went on to capitalize on the token’s success. In addition to the Solana asset, he set up an auction for his Bitcoin bubble gum machine on EBay. Hello everyone, if anyone decides to buy the RONS BASEMENT art, the ""Bitcoin bubble Gum Machine"", all proceeds go to Susie's Christmas gift 🙂 I forgot to say that during the live stream. Have a great day. Ron from the basement https://t.co/gLPpWUvvPM pic.twitter.com/lENAM2wRqd — RonsBasement (@BasementRon) December 19, 2024 At the time of writing, the machine had 38 bids up to a price of $3,550. Basement Ron also kept up the live streaming hype, moving over from YouTube to X. The token creator’s involvement is boosting the numbers for UFD, while risk-driven buyers are enjoying the rise of the token from ‘the trenches’. UFD is also gaining influence for being created by a ‘boomer’, but appealing to the new wave of Gen Z token traders. UFD posts gains only on paper Just like other unexpected memes, UFD took off despite the creator’s scepticism. As with other hot memes, UFD has been sniped early, so its rally to over $200M created multiple high-value wallets with unrealized gains. The longer the token survives, the stronger its community and a commitment to hold until the asset breaks to a higher price range. UFD peaked above $0.27, and has been sliding for hours. The token still consolidates around $0.15, with a market cap of $169M. The token is one of the promising assets with the potential to make it into a mid-range asset valued at $500M. However, the first batch of UFD millionaires may not be able to realize their gains. In fact, they would wipe out the token if they sold. The token has 11 wallets with millions in unrealized gains. Interesting situation with $UFD : 11 ""paper millionaires"" (unrealized profits) but only $3M in liquidity. Meaning just 1-2 can actually become real millionaires. Let the race begin. pic.twitter.com/ASOJVBItkk — dethective (@dethective) December 19, 2024 Some of the gains were dramatic – a trader sniped UFD early for just $90, turning the holdings into $3.25M unrealized gains within 48 hours. Later, the gains turned lower, but still retained $2.5M in notional value. One of the reason for the token’s success may be the recent rally of FARTCOIN above $1.12. Meme token traders in the trenches set up their sights on any derivative names or tickers that could benefit from the trend. The UFD trading pool on Raydium, however, only drew in $3.4M of locked liquidity. Experienced meme token traders may wait and hype up the asset more, until it gains liquidity. Decentralized trading and low liquidity can inflate a token to outsized valuations, despite the low real liquidity. The token is already spread to more than 36K Solana wallets, a speed that even older meme assets with deliberate marketing could not achieve in months. The token’s success is based on a YouTube channel with over 49K subscribers, which serves to replace the Pump.fun live streaming feature. What is more encouraging for UFD is that there are few wallet clusters, and the supply had no time to be sniped. There is no organized team to buy up UFD or include market makers. The largest holder owns 4.8% of the supply in the top wallet. An address labeled as ‘Dev’ holds just 0.65% of the UFD supply, and is ranked 13th among top holders. The holdings ratio may change with time, as traders swoop in, especially if UFD corrects. The token also shows no signs of being rug-pulled, as even the asset’s creator has not bought up his own supply. This makes UFD less of a risk compared to celebrity or cabal tokens.

Even more alarming, according to the Chainalysis report, stolen funds saw more than a 20% increase from 2023. “Crypto hacking remains a persistent threat, with four years in the past decade individually seeing more than a billion dollars worth of crypto stolen (2018, 2021, 2022, and 2023). 2024 marks the fifth year to reach this troubling milestone, highlighting how, as crypto adoption and prices rise, so too does the amount that can be stolen. In 2024, funds stolen increased by approximately 21.07% year-over-year (YoY) to $2.2 billion, and the number of individual hacking incidents increased from 282 in 2023 to 303 in 2024.” Source: Chainalysis Curiously, however, Chainalysis notes that hacking has slowed dramatically in the second half of 2024. “In our mid-year crime update, we noted that cumulative value stolen between January 2024 and July 2024 had already reached $1.58 billion, approximately 84.4% higher than the value stolen over the same period in 2023… However, 2024’s upward trend slowed considerably after July, after which it remained relatively steady.” Despite the slowdown, Chainalysis also reveals a daunting fact: North Korean hackers stole more crypto in 2024 than ever before. “In 2023, North Korea-affiliated hackers stole approximately $660.50 million across 20 incidents; in 2024, this number increased to $1.34 billion stolen across 47 incidents — a 102.88% increase in value stolen.

According to research platform Syndica, Solana-based DApps generated $365 million in revenue during the month. Notably, Pump.fun became the first Solana DApp to surpass $100 million in monthly revenue, recording $106 million. Pump.fun’s Revenue and Controversy Pump.fun earned $106 million in November despite controversy surrounding inappropriate content shared by its community via a livestreaming feature. On Nov. 25, reports emerged of users allegedly engaging in or threatening acts of violence during livestreams. In response, Pump.fun suspended its livestreaming feature indefinitely and committed to improving moderation systems. Following the suspension, the platform’s weekly revenue dropped sharply, falling 66% from $33.8 million (Nov. 18–24) to $11.3 million in the final week of November. Other significant contributors to Solana’s DApp revenue included token discovery platform Photon and decentralized exchange Raydium.

Bitcoin's (BTC) attempt to bounce back above $100,000 quickly faded earlier during the day and slid to the low-$97,000s during the U.S. day. It modestly recovered to around $98,000 before another leg lower brought prices below $96,000, down 4.8% over the past 24 hours.    Altcoins fared much worse, with the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index diving more than 10% during the same period. Ethereum's ether (ETH) dipped 10.8% to below $3,500, while Cardano's ADA, Chainlink's LINK, Aptos' APT, Avalanche's AVAX and Dogecoin's DOGE all suffered 15%-20% losses. Notably, SOL sank to its weakest price since Nov. 7 — nearly erasing its post-election rally following a 26% plunge from its record high hit less than a month ago.    Over the past 24 hours — roughly since yesterday's rate decision by Fed policy makers — nearly $1.2 billion worth of leveraged crypto derivatives trading positions have been liquidated across all assets, CoinGlass data shows. Over $1 billion of those were long positions, or bets that prices would rise.      In traditional markets, U.S. stock indexes slightly bounced from Wednesday's lows but gave back part of the pre-market gains during the session. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were 0.5% up from the Wednesday close.    Crypto prices rose almost vertically since Donald Trump's presidential election victory in early November, buoyed by hopes of pro-crypto policies from his incoming administration. Wednesday's Fed projection of a slower pace of rate cuts for next year and Powell's hawkish tone on rising inflation expectations caught many investors offside, triggering a broad-market selloff across crypto, equities and even gold.    The U.S. dollar index (DXY), a key strength gauge against a basket of foreign currencies, surged above 108, its strongest level since November 2022, while 10-year U.S. Treasury yields also rose sharply above 4.6%, the highest since May.    ""The crypto market has already been on pins and needles around the possibility for a correction following the record run in the price of bitcoin through $100,000,"" Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in a Thursday note. ""We got that catalyst from the world of traditional markets. … Fallout from Wednesday’s Fed decision was simply too much to ignore.""    ""When you zoom out and consider the year-over-year growth, a pullback like this feels healthy,"" Azeem Khan, co-founder and COO of layer-2 network Morph, said in an email shared with CoinDesk.    ""It’s also worth noting that, historically, year-end selloffs in securities can occur as investors offset losses against gains to lower their tax liabilities,"" Khan added.

Institutional loans also became a cornerstone for building trust within the professional community, enabling large-scale transactions. The platform’s technical infrastructure also contributed, with features such as colocation to reduce latency, sub-accounts for strategy diversification and a robust API supporting its services for institutional clients. The introduction of a new affiliate program contributed by engaging communities of retail traders, supporting user acquisition and enhancing trading activity, which played a role in WhiteBIT’s strong performance.

Both long and short traders took heavy losses, but long positions accounted for the bulk of the liquidation. A massive $1.03 billion came from longs, while shorts saw $155.02 million erased. The liquidation frenzy wasn’t limited to one or two assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum took the hardest hits , but altcoins were also slammed. Traders who ventured into leveraged bets faced a brutal reckoning as the market’s sudden swings triggered margin calls and automatic sell-offs. Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate liquidations Bitcoin led the liquidation carnage with $245.22 million wiped out, while Ethereum followed closely, losing $223.09 million. Dogecoin saw $58.82 million in positions liquidated, XRP suffered $48.24 million in losses, and Solana wasn’t spared either, with $39.56 million gone. The biggest single liquidation involved an ETH/USDT position on Binance worth $15.80 million. Binance was the busiest platform for liquidations, processing $199.95 million in total. Of that, $183.85 million came from long positions, while shorts accounted for $16.10 million. Bybit followed with $84.92 million in liquidations, $75.06 million of which were longs. The data highlights how traders on these platforms were largely betting on price increases, only to be burned by rapid market corrections. Breaking it down by timeframes, the last 24 hours saw $1.19 billion in liquidations. Within 12 hours, $516.17 million had been wiped out. Zooming into shorter periods, $437.28 million disappeared in just four hours, and $279.90 million vanished in a single hour. Why is the market getting slammed? We have the US Federal Reserve to thank for this market bloodbath. Yesterday, chairman Jerome Powell announced that there would be very few if any, rate cuts next year. Within hours, Bitcoin had fallen from $100k all the way below $100k. Bitcoin’s long-term holders, who typically hold Bitcoin for over 155 days, have been selling their stash too. Data from Glassnode shows their supply dropped to $13.31 billion, down from $14.23 billion two months ago. This coincided with Bitcoin’s price climbing from $58,000 to over $100,000. Short-term holders are stepping in, absorbing the selling pressure from long-term investors. Their buying activity has kept Bitcoin’s price above the six-figure mark, even as some traders take profits. The balance between these two groups is critical to Bitcoin’s price momentum.

37851468,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27790,1734636000,Coinbase Wins Court Decision to Delist wBTC Despite BiT Global Claims,"Federal Judge Sides with Coinbase A federal judge has ruled in favor of Coinbase, denying BiT Global’s motion for a TRO to halt the delisting of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). The decision was made during a virtual hearing on Dec. 18 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, has ruled in favor of allowing Coinbase to move forward with its intended delisting of wBTC trading on Dec. 19. Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín ruled there was a lack of evidence of “imminent irreparable harm” by BiT Global in its lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed after Coinbase announced it would be delisting wBTC on Nov. 19, which BiT Global argued would destabilize the market of the token and negatively affect holders. BiT Global’s Legal Battle BiT Global, the firm associated with Tron founder Justin Sun, filed its lawsuit against Coinbase on Dec. 13, arguing that the delisting would lead to substantial financial losses for investors. However, Judge Martínez-Olguín pointed out the delay between Coinbase’s initial announcement and the lawsuit filing, which weakened BiT Global’s argument. The court also pointed out that the legal team representing BiT Global made speculative arguments without any specific evidence on how Coinbase’s actions could potentially hurt the market. Justin Sun’s Controversial Involvement Coinbase also justified delisting wBTC on claims of concerns over the ownership structure of BiT Global, given its links with Justin Sun. The exchange asserted that Sun’s involvement raised an “unacceptable risk” given his legal battles with various U.S. authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. In response, BiT Global called Coinbase out for scapegoating Sun, claiming the exchange’s reasoning was a pretext. “Rather than address the concerns earlier, Coinbase delayed their due diligence and decision-making until months after Sun’s involvement was announced,” BiT Global’s legal team argued. What’s Next for wBTC? The ruling allows Coinbase to delist wBTC as planned, but BiT Global may refine its legal strategy to challenge the decision further. The controversy highlights broader concerns about centralized exchanges’ power over token listings and the influence of regulatory scrutiny on market dynamics. The case shows the tenuous balance between market security and broader ramifications of decisions to delist, especially tokens with a link to figures such as Justin Sun.

The “Hawk Tuah girl” might have to talk tuah a judge whenever she finally wakes up. U.S. law firm Burwick Law filed a federal lawsuit against Hailey Welch and three other individuals behind the lackluster Hawk Tuah Solana meme coin launched in early December.

Months later, she and her team, Tuah the Moon Foundation, in partnership with OverHere Limited, Clinton So, and Alex Larson Schultz, aka Doc Hollywood, released a meme coin styled after her popular “Hawk Tuah” phrase. Like many celebrity Solana ( SOL ) launches, HAWK skyrocketed immediately after its debut and peaked at a $500 million market capitalization. Minutes later, the token fell 90% and tumbled under $50 million. The token traded at a market cap of under $8 million by publishing time.

The controversy reached a new high when observers discovered these wallets sold large amounts of HAWK’s supply, despite Welch claiming she and her team were still holding. Burwick Law encouraged HAWK buyers to lodge formal complaints with the firm amid the contentious aftermath. The firm’s lawsuit named four defendants, including Welch, OverHere, So, and Doc Hollywood, and noted 12 U.S. residents as plaintiffs with $151,000 in collective losses. Burwick has filed several lawsuits against celebrities for launching meme coins that allegedly became exit scams and rug pulls. On Dec. 17, two days before the federal lawsuit was filed, OverHere pushed the blame onto Doc Hollywood, claiming the entity made nothing from the launch. OverHere admitted its silence was the wrong move and insisted the company’s mistake was trusting the wrong partners.

42416412,d5cb9353-84a1-4548-ab30-224228459521,1734635899,The Ownership Paradox: Why Blockchain Games Have Betrayed Digital Property Rights,"Every year, my company Emfarsis partners with the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) to conduct an industry-wide survey of blockchain gaming professionals. And every year, the overwhelming majority of respondents agree that digital asset ownership is the single biggest benefit that blockchain can bring to games; this year was no different, with 71.1% ranking it number one. Even with more people joining the industry — in 2024 we had three times as many respondents as compared to the inaugural survey in 2021 — it’s always digital asset ownership that comes out as the industry’s undisputed North Star.    But while we hail digital asset ownership as blockchain gaming’s defining feature, most blockchain games today are free-to-play and don’t require asset ownership at all. On top of that, much-hyped promises that rest on the premise of digital asset ownership remain largely unrealized. Apparently, blockchain gaming professionals have found themselves in a curious bind where the best proposition they have for gamers is the same thing they are making excuses for.    Digital asset ownership has always been central to blockchain gaming, offering players true digital property rights to own, trade, and monetize in-game assets in the form of tokens and NFTs. Going back to play-to-earn’s heyday of 2020-21, digital asset ownership was how you could tell the difference between a blockchain game and a traditional game. Early games required players to buy one or more NFTs upfront. But this created a barrier to onboarding, as many couldn’t afford the NFT(s) or simply weren’t enthused about having to buy an asset in a game they didn’t even know they liked yet.    Of course, these NFTs weren’t just any old game assets, they were yield generating. Buying an NFT in a blockchain game was more like investing in a tool that you need to do a job — a job that paid in crypto. Some of the more entrepreneurially-minded NFT owners started renting out their assets to would-be players, in return for a cut of their earnings. It was an amazing demonstration of the kind of decentralized, permissionless innovation that is made possible by blockchain — a community-led workaround that was developed by the players, not the game developers.    Amazing as it was, the rental system which was popular in early blockchain games like Axie Infinity, Pegaxy, CyBall, and others, didn't actually solve the onboarding problem. The limited availability of assets and high entry costs created a bottleneck, so the rental demand couldn’t be met, thus perpetuating the friction with top-of-the-funnel user acquisition.    By 2022, in an effort to lower barriers and attract a broader audience, blockchain games had started to embrace the free-to-play model instead. With this, blockchain-based features of the game were treated as optional enhancements rather than a prerequisite to play. Players could purchase assets later, or commit time and effort to earn them, but only if they desired. There was no explicit requirement to do so.    The move came at a time when blockchain games were being pressured to focus less on financialization and more on fun. And it was seen as necessary if they wanted to nab a share of the big, juicy $220B traditional gaming market, made up of billions of gamers that were unlikely to install a crypto wallet let alone put up cash for an NFT.    This contradiction — where digital asset ownership is both a defining feature and a significant barrier — reflects the complexities of blockchain gaming’s evolution. On one hand, ownership is what makes blockchain games special; on the other, requiring it deters players. To attract traditional gamers, who lack Web3 familiarity, developers have prioritized accessibility.    Findings from the 2024 BGA State of the Industry Report back this up. When asked about the biggest challenges facing the industry, more than half (53.9%) cited onboarding challenges and poor user experience, while another 33.6% said that blockchain concepts are not fully understood. Thus, without clear, tangible benefits, the effort and cost of becoming a digital asset owner is unjustified. This reveals a major pain point for developers trying to sell noobs on a clunky tech stack that feels more like a chore than a choice, so you can see how they arrived at the decision not to force it.    But this raises the question: How much blockchain can a blockchain game omit, before the blockchain game is no longer a game on the blockchain?    This half-hearted approach to embracing on-chain experiences means that potentially transformative Web3-native innovations — like the promise of interoperability, where players could use a sword from Game A in Game B — remain largely theoretical. Some progress has been made, such as enabling NFT profile picture (PFP) collections to become playable avatars, but this mostly caters to existing web3 communities rather than delivering a palpable benefit to lure the Web2 gaming masses.    True interoperability requires industry-wide collaboration, both technically and economically, which is still fragmented across chains and ecosystems. Meanwhile, developers are sweeping Web3 under the rug, treating it as a layer in the tech stack rather than a defining feature. So for most players, the ""Web3"" part is hidden, optional, and about as impactful as a collectible spoon in a cereal box.  Frankly, the notion of ""ownership"" in Web3 is vastly overhyped and largely unsupported by any substantial product-market fit. Web3 ownership, as it’s often sold, is a mirage. The reality is: even if you ""own"" an NFT, its utility and value often depend entirely on the developers' centralized infrastructure and ongoing operations. What Web3 does offer is increased agency over your assets, allowing for quicker, frictionless sales. But true ownership? Not so much.  There’s actually little evidence to suggest that Web3 ownership has driven sustainable demand. That said, the ability to exert more control over your digital assets is undeniably valuable — just not the ""true ownership"" that’s often claimed.  That said, there have been some very promising experiments with fully onchain games and creative catalysts such as the Loot NFT collection. Its composable structure allowed developers to build derivative projects, games, and economies around it without needing approval or input from the original creators.  Other recent innovations born in the arena of digital asset ownership include Ethereum standards ERC-6551, ERC-4337, ERC-404 and soulbound tokens (SBTs). ERC-6551 introduced tokenbound accounts, allowing NFTs to act as their own wallets. ERC-4337 delivered account abstraction, enabling customizable wallets that enhance security and usability without relying on centralized custodians. ERC-404 combined the features of fungible and non-fungible tokens, to offer flexible ownership of both unique and divisible digital assets. SBTs gave us non-transferable, identity-linked assets representing credentials for trust and reputation.    While still early on the adoption curve, these advancements empower gamers to unlock experiences that would never have been possible without digital property rights. And the results of the annual BGA survey confirm that the appeal of digital asset ownership remains strong: it gives players agency, control and value.    The challenge now is to let players experience the fun first and discover the value of ownership organically. But we shouldn’t be ashamed to stand up for what we truly believe in. If we want others to get onboard with our vision, we need to develop experiences that demonstrate the benefits of digital asset ownership from the get-go.    Otherwise, we’re not doing anything very special at all. Are we?    Thanks to Nathan Smale, Duncan Matthes and Owl of Moistness for their review of this article.

Ripple (XRP) is experiencing volatility, recently dropping 10% following hawkish comments from the Fed, while analysts question Bitcoin’s ability to stay above $100,000. Meanwhile, Monero (XMR) continues to ride the privacy coin trend, with predictions of a 2025 breakout leading the altcoin charge. On the other hand, Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as a practical solution for crypto users worldwide. By addressing the real-life problems of crypto complexity and usability, Qubetics is redefining how people interact with digital assets. With its cutting-edge wallet and successful presale, Qubetics is a standout among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Crypto That Works for Real Life For many, crypto is still too complicated. Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet simplifies the entire process, letting users pay with crypto as easily as they’d swipe a card. Integrated with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and desktop platforms, the wallet automatically converts crypto to fiat at the point of sale. Picture this: you’re a small business owner, and a customer wants to pay with Bitcoin. Instead of fumbling through conversion apps, Qubetics handles it all. You receive fiat, while they pay in crypto—fast, stable, and stress-free. Freelancers and global businesses also love Qubetics. Cross-border payments , typically a pain due to delays and high fees, become instant and affordable. Its smart contract conversion mechanism even protects users from market volatility, making transactions stable and secure. Currently in Presale Phase 13, Qubetics has raised over $7.2 million, with 10,800 holders buying into the vision. Each token is priced at $0.0342, but with a 10% increase coming in the next phase and a projected 900% ROI post-launch, now is the perfect time to invest. Without a doubt, Qubetics stands tall among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Ripple (XRP): Volatility Amid Promising Adoption Ripple’s XRP remains a prominent name in crypto, but recent market activity highlights its challenges. XRP’s price dropped 10%, driven by a hawkish stance from the Fed and broader crypto market adjustments. Analysts are closely watching whether Bitcoin’s next moves will affect XRP further. Despite this volatility, Ripple continues to make strides in global adoption. Its focus on enabling cross-border payments with low fees has made XRP a preferred choice for financial institutions worldwide. This utility, coupled with Ripple’s consistent push for regulatory clarity, keeps XRP relevant and resilient. For investors, XRP’s volatility could mean a “buy the dip” opportunity. With strong fundamentals and a focus on global adoption, XRP remains one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, particularly for those who believe in its long-term vision. Monero (XMR): Leading the Privacy Coin Movement Privacy coins are back in the spotlight, and Monero is leading the charge. Analysts are bullish on XMR’s potential to break out in 2025, driven by increasing demand for financial privacy in an age of growing surveillance.

Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic, tell their 63,300 followers on the social media platform X that the Fed’s decision to forecast less than previously expected rate cuts next year led to Bitcoin dipping below $100,000. However, they say that the Bitcoin exchange net position change metric, which tracks the 30-day supply held in exchange wallets, continues to signal bullishness. “Another dip, another buy. [Fed chair Jerome] Powell’s hawkish tone triggered a dip to $99,000, but Bitcoin quickly rebounded to $100,000. Meanwhile, BTC is leaving exchanges at record rates, marking the third-best outflow day this year. The November accumulation wave shows no signs of stopping, which makes the potential for a recovery more likely.” Source: Negentropic/X Bitcoin is trading for $100,426 at time of writing, down 3.5% in the last 24 hours. The analysts also say that Bitcoin’s dominance level (BTC.D), the ratio between the market cap of BTC versus the market cap of all crypto assets combined, could signal within days if altcoins start to outperform the flagship digital asset. “Bitcoin dominance at a crossroads: key year-end decision. Bitcoin dominance is on the verge of resuming the uptrend it began earlier this year. Will it break higher, or face rejection at this level and continue declining? This is a crucial moment for year-end dynamics: If dominance rises, we could see a Bitcoin-focused rally, leaving most altcoins lagging behind (with a few exceptions). If dominance falters, it opens the door for a potential altcoin resurgence. The next few days are pivotal for shaping the direction of dominance and determining whether the altcoin season can make a comeback.” Source: Negentropic/X At time of writing, BTC.D is at 58.44%.

""Bad Days Are Over, Wait for This Date!""","While Donald Trump's election as president has sparked a major rally in Bitcoin and altcoins, a new era with a moderate approach is expected to begin for the cryptocurrency market after he takes office on January 20. According to Coindesk, JPMorgan stated that the Trump administration is heralding a new era for cryptocurrencies in the United States. JPMorgan analysts led by Kenneth Worthington noted in their recent report that the total value of the cryptocurrency market has increased by approximately 65% since the election of Donald Trump. At this point, analysts stated that Trump's victory in the November presidential elections heralded a new era for cryptocurrencies in the USA. “This new administration that came with Trump is not only crypto-friendly, but also shows a willingness to promote this asset class. The worst regulatory environment for crypto markets is now behind us. This change will pave the way for a more constructive regulatory approach, especially in terms of regulatory approaches. It is expected to become a safer, more transparent and more productive sector after Trump’s inauguration. However, it may take 9 to 12 months for the positive impact of the new policies on the cryptocurrency sector to be fully felt.” In other words, analysts emphasized that a period of at least 9-12 months is needed for a Trump victory to have a bullish effect on Bitcoin and altcoins. Analysts stated that Trump's victory would mark the beginning of a new era in the US, and that the Trump administration has not yet nominated a candidate for the chairmanship of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), but the selection of the CFTC chairman would be important.

The sale occurred after Coinbase recorded a 10% decline after Jerome Powell’s speech. According to the firm, the move aims to rebalance its fund weightings. Cathie Wood’s investment manager, ARK Invest, sold over 13,700 shares of crypto exchange Coinbase(COIN) on December 18. According to the firm’s disclosures, the sale was a rebalancing strategy within its Exchange Traded Fund(ETF) ARKF. Ark Invest, Coinbase affected by Powell’s speech ARK’s Invest offload is reportedly the most significant sale since the firm unloaded over $2 million in September. The firm has previously disclosed its investment strategy to avoid individual holdings exceeding 10% of its ETF total holdings. It disclosed that this is aimed at ensuring the firm maintains a diverse investment portfolio. According to ARK’s Invest disclosures, Coinbase currently holds a weighting of 9.9% on its ARKF ETF. It added that Coinbase shares fell slightly behind Spotify’s allocation and have a market value of $110 million. TradingView revealed that Coinbase’s stock traded at $279.86 on Wednesday, recording an over 10% drop in twenty-four hours. The crypto exchange shares recorded a slight recovery of 3.5% on Thursday amid the overall market volatility. The drop was reportedly influenced by the sentiments of the Federal Reserve’s chair at a press conference on Wednesday. The chair commented on the Fed’s decision to reduce interest rates by 25 bps rate cut. Powell highlighted the Fed had made consecutive rate cuts in 2024 in response to the inflation rate and labor market. However, he warned the Fed had to evaluate several factors in subsequent rate cuts. The Fed chair also cut the outlook for 2025 rate reductions to two, half of what investors predicted. Powell’s move triggered markets as investors responded to the developments. Powell comments on Trump’s pro-crypto stance as markets react to Fed’s policy Powell pointed out in his speech that the USA can not own Bitcoin without Congress passing the relevant legislation. The president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, pledged during his campaigns that the country would have a Bitcoin reserve as part of his pro-crypto policy. On the other hand, Trump indicated that upon assuming office, he would direct the US treasury to acquire one million Bitcoins in five years. According to CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin fell by approximately 9% on December 18 in response to the Fed’s chair remarks. The crypto asset traded slightly below the $100,000 mark by the close of business on Wednesday. However, it recorded a slight recovery on Thursday, trading at over $102,419. Ruslan Lekha, Chief of Markets at YouHolder, a Swiss-based Web3 platform, commented that the Fed policy indirectly impacted the crypto market. He explained that digital assets have been integrated into traditional finance, making them codependent. While the administration can directly influence the crypto market through policy decisions and regulatory actions, the Fed’s role is limited to managing monetary policy, which indirectly affects crypto via its impact on liquidity and investor sentiment in the financial ecosystem. Ruslan Lekha Despite the overall market downturn, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded increased inflows after Powell’s speech. According to Coinglass, the US BTC spot ETF recorded $272.30 million inflows. LookonChain data also revealed that corporates such as Marathon Digital (MARA) added over 1600 BTC worth $166 million on Wednesday. Hut 8 Corp (HUT) also revealed it had bought BTC worth $100 million on Wednesday. The energy infrastructure and Bitcoin miners company disclosed it now holds 10,096 BTC worth over $1 Billion in its Bitcoin reserve.

37851283,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630590,1734635012,Wall Street rebounds after intense sell-off – What’s holding Bitcoin?,"Wall Street is bouncing back after a catastrophic day that left traders reeling. On December 18, U.S. markets faced a sell-off that slashed billions in value. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all suffered massive losses as investors reacted to a hawkish Federal Reserve announcing fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. Today, markets are showing signs of life, but the fallout still lingers. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the economy’s future as “uncertain,” pointing out that inflation concerns and a strong labor market could slow down monetary easing. The Dow dropped 1,123 points yesterday, landing at 42,326.87. That’s a 2.6% loss and the longest losing streak since 1974, with ten consecutive days in the red. The S&P wasn’t spared, falling 3% to close at 5,872.16. The Nasdaq Composite tanked even harder, shedding 3.6% to hit 19,392.69. Tech stocks lead the rebound Today though, futures for major indices are trending higher, with Dow futures up 0.7%. Tech heavyweights Nvidia and Tesla are posting pre-market gains of over 2%, which tells us that investors might be using the sell-off as a buying opportunity. Whether this bounce will last remains unclear, but for now, the bleeding has slowed. Economic data released earlier this week didn’t help the market’s nerves. U.S. GDP growth for the third quarter was revised up to 3.1% from an earlier estimate of 2.8%. Meanwhile, initial unemployment claims dropped by 22,000 to 220,000, reinforcing the narrative of a resilient labor market. Bitcoin struggles with volatility Bitcoin isn’t faring much better. After hitting an all-time high of $108,000 earlier this week, it slipped below $100,000 overnight before recovering slightly. As of press time, it’s trading around $100,200. On-chain data from the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) tells us that long-term holders are offloading their assets at these high prices, adding to selling pressure. The situation gets more interesting when you look at exchange activity. Transaction volumes on both spot and derivative exchanges have fallen massively compared to previous years. But when volume spikes do happen, they tend to signal big price actions. For instance, a peak in 2017 coincided with Bitcoin’s first major rally, while another in 2021 triggered its surge past $60,000. For now, Bitcoin’s average realized price is serving as a technical support level. If selling pressure continues, prices could test the $97,600 mark, especially if U.S. demand weakens further.

37850903,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664954,1734634854,Dogecoin Sights Rebound As RSI Hits Oversold Levels Near $0.3563,"Dogecoin is approaching a critical juncture as it hovers near the $0.3563 mark, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI), signaling oversold conditions. This suggests that the recent sell-off may have pushed the asset into undervalued territory, raising the possibility of a rebound. However, whether the bulls can seize this opportunity to drive a recovery remains uncertain. With the market showing signs of fatigue, $0.3563 emerges as a pivotal level to watch. How the price reacts in the coming sessions could set the tone for Dogecoin’s next significant move. Understanding Current Price Action And The Overbought RSI Signal Current price action reveals that Dogecoin, despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), is showing promising signs of bullish momentum. The meme coin has briefly regained strength, hinting at a possible upward trajectory as it seeks to challenge overhead resistance levels. Significantly, this movement suggests that buyer interest is gradually increasing, which could lay the groundwork for a sustained recovery if key levels are breached. While the 100-day SMA often acts as a significant hurdle in bearish markets, DOGE’s resilience at this juncture indicates that bulls are making an effort to reclaim control. The evolving price structure underscores the importance of maintaining momentum to confirm a bullish breakout, with the next steps likely influenced by market sentiment and broader trading dynamics. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently hovering at 30%, which indicates a firm position within the oversold zone. This technical indicator suggests that Dogecoin may have experienced significant selling pressure, pushing its price to undervalued levels. An RSI reading at or below 30% typically offers an opportunity for buyers to re-enter the market and initiate a rebound. Although this does not guarantee an immediate recovery, it highlights the potential for a reversal in the coming sessions, especially if other bullish signals align. Traders are closely watching whether the RSI will rise soon, as this could signal strengthening momentum and a shift in sentiment. Combined with price action near key support levels, the RSI’s positioning might be crucial in shaping Dogecoin’s next moves. A Rebound Or Continued Rally For Dogecoin? DOGE’s current price action presents two key scenarios to consider: a potential rebound or the continuation of its rally. Given the oversold signal from the RSI near $0.3563, a rebound is possible if the bulls step in and drive the price higher, capitalizing on the undervalued conditions. A successful recovery could see DOGE challenge previous resistance points, such as $0.4484, and restore its upward pressure. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Rally on Hold: Can Momentum Kick Back In? On the other hand, if the bearish pressure persists, the cryptocurrency could struggle to regain bullish control, leading to further declines toward $0.1800. The next few trading sessions will be crucial in determining which path Dogecoin will take, with support and resistance levels playing key roles in shaping its direction.

A temporary weakness in the meme coin segment – a major source of activity for this layer-one blockchain – could be partially responsible for this decline as market participants have been taking some profits following the post-election rally. Similar to the performance of other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP (XRP), the native token of the Solana blockchain $SOL has experienced a 15.3% drop in the past 30 days. Solana Price Action Forms Bullish Flag Pattern Despite the frustration that this recent price action could produce among investors, there are indications that this temporary setback could actually be setting up the token for a major breakout to the $300 area in the following weeks. In this regard, the popular crypto analyst Jelle, whose account on X is followed by almost 100,000 users, the latest drop has formed a pattern known as a bullish flag. Solana formed a falling wedge into what used to be resistance — and confirmed it as support. First higher low formed; feels like it's about to come back to life. Still believe this one is back in price discovery before Christmas. Bring on $300. pic.twitter.com/Ftrad2dXfi — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) December 18, 2024 This formation typically resolves to the upside and precedes a major increase in the price of the asset being analyzed that could match or exceed the size of the previous uptrend. From November 5 to 23, the price of $SOL jumped by 54%. If the bullish flag catalyzes a similar move, that would push the price of this digital asset near or above the $300 mark – a major psychological and financial milestone that would make Solana the fourth most valuable cryptocurrency, right above XRP . According to technical analysis literature, bullish flags tend to have a success rate of 70% while the daily chart – the one cited for this prediction – is the most reliable of all for this particular pattern. Meanwhile, statistics indicate that the target price – in this case, $300 – is reached in around 60% of all cases. Although none of these estimates are 100% reliable or constitute investment or trading advice, this is what historical data suggests. The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rate by another 25 basis points may influence this positive move for $SOL as well as traders are more confident than before that financial conditions will continue to ease. Higher liquidity tends to have a positive influence on the price of risky assets like cryptocurrencies. Hence, the Fed’s decision could be a positive driver in the near term for the price of $SOL. Moreover, crypto traders are gearing up for another positive technical event known as the “Santa Claus rally”, which tends to occur from the week after Christmas until January 2. The combination of a positive technical setup and these two macro tailwinds seems to favor the thesis that the native token of the Solana network could break its current all-time highs before year-end. Investors Have Poured Over $30M in This Meme Coin Presale The $SOL token could be heading to a breakout but so is a new meme coin on presale called Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) that has already raised over $30 million from investors in less than two weeks. The success of Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) set up $WEPE for a win. This time, the popular Pepe the Frog meme is being characterized as the Wolf of Wall Street – or should we say Crypto Street. Wall Street Pepe is building an army of retail investors who are willing to disrupt the status quo in the meme coin space by taking power off the hands of whales. The project aims to build a big community of degens with an insatiable appetite to “stick it to the man” – in this case, hedge fund managers and suits. $30M raised. Memes run the internet. Wepe runs the memes. pic.twitter.com/scMZmwEfKv — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 18, 2024 The presale price increases in just 18 hours. So, if you want to grab $WEPE tokens at its current basement price of $0.000365, you can visit the official website of Wall Street Pepe . Connect any wallet (i.e. Best Wallet ) and convert USDT, ETH, or BNB into $WEPE. You can also use your bank card if you don’t own any crypto at the moment or don’t want to spend it. What are you waiting for? The presale period is about to end and such a positive capital raise will likely lay the groundwork for a major listing in the near future.

The trader initially invested 0.4 SOL, equivalent to $90.28, to purchase 12,980,490.53 UFD tokens. Over the course of 48 hours, the trader executed two significant swaps. First, exchanging 50,000 UFD for 13.27 wSOL, valued at $2,856.51. Then, swapping 30,490.53 UFD for 7.96 wSOL, worth $1,713. The remaining 12.9 million UFD tokens were valued at $3.25 million. The trader’s initial purchases of UFD. Source: Solscan However, this valuation hinges on market liquidity and demand, as meme coins like UFD are known for their extreme volatility and limited market depth, making such gains challenging to fully realize. UFD token – A meme coin born from humor Unicorn Fart Dust was created as a commentary on the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Its very existence is satirical, poking fun at the ease with which digital assets can surge in value without any underlying utility. Despite its humorous beginnings, the token quickly became a viral sensation, ranking as the second most traded on-chain asset within 48 hours of its launch, surpassed only by major market players. 🚨 New: YouTuber @BasementRon , known for his gold and silver content, created the “Unicorn Fart Dust” ($UFD) token to mock crypto and prove a point that crypto is worthless.

Investors were drawn to UFD purely for its entertainment value, yet its meteoric rise shows a deeper phenomenon—the willingness of market participants to chase high-risk assets for the promise of outsized rewards. By press time, UFD was trading at $0.1742 with a market capitalization of $174 million. Moreover, investing in coins like UFD also exposes investors to other risks, such as the lack of liquidity, potential rug pulls, and death spirals that are occasionally seen in these financial bubbles that surge from time to time.

Many analysts weighed in on DOGE’s upcoming price developments, with some predicting a further drop to key resistance lines such as $0.22. The price charts across the entire cryptocurrency market have been in a deep red state ever since yesterday’s FOMC meeting. Although the Fed indeed cut the interest rates by 25 basis points as expected, its Chair, Jerome Powell, warned that there might not be any reductions in 2025 and said the central bank is not permitted to buy BTC, despite Trump’s promises. As it typically happens, the altcoins are hit harder than BTC, but some have bled out more heavily than others. Such is the case with the larger meme coin. Dogecoin traded above $0.41 on Tuesday, but the market-wide correction pushed it south to $0.34 yesterday. After a minor bounce-off to $0.365, the asset slumped hard today as well, dumping to a 5-week low of $0.31. Thus, the OG meme coin shed over 25% of its value in about 36 hours. Many crypto analysts believe the asset’s correction is not over. Jake Wujastyk told his nearly 300,000 followers that DOGE could flash crash below $0.27. Another popular X account for crypto analysis, Rose Premium Signals, shared a chart showing that Dogecoin’s decline could culminate with a nosedive to the key support area at $0.22 before the asset resumes its bull run that started after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential elections in early November. #Dogecoin ( $DOGE /USDT) is undergoing a corrective phase, potentially testing the key support at $0.22076.

Cardano ( ADA ), a popular layer-1 coin, retreated to $0.90, much lower than the year-to-date high of $1.326. Peter Brandt, a legendary trader who has written widely on technical analysis, warned that the coin may continue falling in the near term. He pointed to Cardano’s head and shoulders chart pattern that has formed on the daily and four-hour chart. A H&S pattern is made up of two shoulders, which are at $1.153, and a head at $1.327.

37850454,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313436,1734633941,Mantle Network Advances Technical Roadmap As the First ZK Validity Rollup With Succinct’s SP1,"December 19, 2024 – Singapore, Singapore Succinct alliance establishes Mantle Network as highest TVL (total value locked) ZK (zero-knowledge) validity rollup. Mantle Network – an Ethereum layer-two known for its modular design and being the first adopter of EigenLayer’s EigenDA – today announced its architectural transition to a ZK validity rollup through an industry-first alliance with Succinct . Combining its modular architecture, data availability solutions through EigenDA and now ZKP (zero-knowledge proofs) via SP1, Mantle Network embarks on creating the liquidity chain for institutional-grade settlement and value transfer in the crypto ecosystem. Since Mantle Network’s mainnet launch on July 7, 2023, the burgeoning on-chain ecosystem has grown to become a top five layer-two by TVL with $2.2 billion and counting. The network has processed 175 million on-chain transactions, seen 1.4 million smart contracts deployed, connected to 10 million unique wallet addresses and maintained 4.9 million monthly active wallet addresses since its inception. Mantle Network continues to drive capital efficiency in the on-chain economy with the integration of ZK validity rollup technology, providing crucial next-generation technical infrastructure to support and amplify secure growth of high-value asset settlements. Backed by one of the largest community-owned treasuries globally with $4.3 billion in asset reserves, Mantle Network’s technical roadmap directly supports its vision of accelerating seamless, secure and efficient movement of institutional capital across traditional and decentralized markets. Accelerating institutional-grade asset settlements through ZK validity innovation With the testnet launch in Q1 2025 with intention towards mainnet upgrade, Mantle Network is set to evolve from an optimistic rollup model to a ZK validity rollup through Succinct’s SP1. This architectural change drastically reduces chain finality from seven days to one hour – enabling fast institutional-grade asset settlements that support and address capital efficiency opportunities throughout TradFi (traditional finance) and the blockchain industry. The transformative efficiency gains of ZK validity proofs have garnered significant market traction. Already powering applications with a cumulative $4.4 billion capital across leading ZK layer-two ecosystems, Mantle Network maintains a bullish belief in the advancement of ZK technology to further the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Performance benefits can allow Mantle’s flagship assets – such as mETH, cmETH and FBTC – with an aggregate $3.9 billion TVL, to proliferate across the wider DeFi (decentralized finance) domain. This enables better swap market spreads, lower slippage, deeper money markets, improved interest rates and broader asset availability. Market intermediaries can rapidly rebalance inventories between Mantle Network – layer-two – and Ethereum – layer-one – and users can quickly move permissionlessly to access a unique set of onward routes and integrations. Key technical benefits The strategic integration of Succinct’s SP1 offers a suite of advanced features catered to developers and users including the following. Fast finality – Boasting a 168x improvement in bridging capabilities, transactions achieve finality in one hour, enabling quick withdrawals and seamless operations to redefine user experience. EVM equivalence – Succinct’s SP1 full EVM bytecode compatibility ensures developers can leverage existing Ethereum tooling and smart contracts without compromise. Cost efficiency – Prover fees integrated into transaction costs eliminate additional financial burdens for rollup teams with minimal cost impact to users – as low as fractions of one cent per transaction. Enabling a multi-chain future – The advancement reaffirms Mantle Network’s alignment with Ethereum’s security ethos while laying the groundwork for cross-rollup interoperability at scale through ZK proofs. Driving the future of ZK rollups OP Succinct combines the power of Succinct’s SP1 zkVM with the modularity of the OP Stack, bridging the gap between user-friendly optimistic rollups and complex ZK technology. The innovation promotes interoperability, flexibility and standardization that addresses Ethereum’s existing challenges. By adopting ZK validity proofs, Mantle Network transactions are cryptographically verified to be correctly sequenced and settled. This higher tier of security allows everyone to more easily and safely explore frontier areas that enhance the Ethereum experience – such as supporting more advanced application logic, enabling cross-chain actions, improving latency and adopting multi-sequencer architectures. Joshua Cheong, product lead at Mantle, said, “In my previous banking career, I witnessed traditional banking infrastructure and legacy banking business models struggle to keep up with the emergence of FinTech disruptors built with cloud services that boast cost advantages. “The introduction of programmable blockchains, along with stablecoins, heralds the next natural step in disruption of financial services – being even more operationally efficient and resilient. “The integration of Succinct’s SP1 marks a defining chapter in Mantle Network’s strategic blockchain journey to support banking for the next generation. “By uniting [ZKPs] with the proven versatility of the OP Stack, we’re not just evolving as a layer-two solution – we’re setting a new benchmark for institutional-grade Ethereum scalability that enables highly efficient and unparalleled security for high-value transactions at the cost of a few cents with 24/7 settlements.” Uma Roy, CEO and co-founder at Succinct, added, “Succinct’s SP1 empowers any developer to make ZK applications by just writing Rust, accelerating the adoption of ZK and verifiable computation. “With OP Succinct, we can propel any OP Stack rollup into the future by providing fast finality with no downsides. “By merging SP1’s blazing fast performance with Mantle’s progressive vision, we’re enabling developers to reimagine DApps (decentralized applications) with unprecedented speed, efficiency and reliability. “Together, we’re building the foundation for Ethereum’s interconnected and scalable future.” A unified Ethereum ecosystem The synergy of fast finality, Ethereum-standard compatibility and cost efficiency promises a profound impact, reducing fragmentation and unlocking the potential for next-generation DApps. The transition enhances Mantle Network’s commitment to Ethereum’s decentralized security model as an ETH-aligned layer-two, enabling a more cohesive ecosystem with seamless asset and information flows. Mantle Network is now poised to be a future-ready layer-two chain as a native ZK rollup. As the Ethereum landscape evolves, Mantle Network’s adoption of Succinct’s SP1 positions it as a leader in scalability and innovation. Developers, users and ecosystem partners can look forward to a faster, more secure and interconnected Ethereum future. About Succinct Succinct brings ZKPs to any developer with SP1 – the world’s fastest zkVM. Succinct’s Decentralized Prover Network provides affordable and reliable proof generation infrastructure for rollups, bridges, coprocessors and other applications using ZKPs.

42389169,40905e44-7dfc-4439-ad67-0d59dd199738,1734633939,2025 Will Be the Year of Decentralization: 5 Predictions,"It took a while, but 2024 was the year bitcoin fulfilled a million end-of-year predictions to finally hit $100,000. Uncork the champagne if you like, but I believe bitcoin’s breach of this historic barrier is the harbinger of something even bigger, and that 2025 will be the long-awaited Year of Decentralization.    The reason has very little to do with bitcoin’s soaring valuation. Anyone who’s had even half an eye on the decentralized technology landscape for the last year will have witnessed an explosion in new use cases. Many are quirky, others are cool and a few promise to solve some of the biggest challenges facing humanity today. Together, they are sending decentralization’s utility into the stratosphere via measurable impact rather than mere speculation. More importantly, they provide a host of compelling reasons for people to adopt and onboard to decentralization in 2025.    Buckle up then, as we take a whistlestop tour around my top five predictions for the year ahead.  1. Bitcoin takes a shot at the moon.  It wouldn’t be December without bold predictions about bitcoin’s price. But instead of tossing out another $250K or $500K figure like everyone else, let’s explore a more radical possibility: bitcoin becoming the foundation of a global strategic reserve.  The fundamentals support this possibility. If a major world power (or an unexpected one) officially adopts bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves, the current price predictions could bUe obliterated. We’re not just talking $500,000; $1 million or even higher could become the new normal, driven by nations’ scrambling to secure the world’s rarest digital asset.  Even without geopolitical adoption, bitcoin’s scarcity alone makes it a unique asset. There will only ever be 21 million BTC in existence, a far smaller number than the 60 million dollar millionaires worldwide. With institutions and now potentially governments buying up huge reserves of bitcoin, it’ll soon be a tiny minority who can hope to own just one — that is, unless they were smart enough to invest early.  Add in the continued growth of bitcoin’s utility as a decentralized network and its role as an alternative to fiat instability, and we’re looking at exponential growth.  But here’s the wildcard: what happens when bitcoin’s price is no longer driven just by markets, but by nations hedging against each other in the race for digital dominance? That’s where things truly get edgy. With several countries already piloting bitcoin treasury programs, $500,000 might just become the starting point.  2. Depinners get rich, quickly.    Someone has to admit it: the crypto industry sometimes does a bad job of selling its vision to the world. Phrases like “financial self-sovereignty” mean little to the average person in the street — unless, of course, they’ve had their bank account shut down.    So how’s this for a sales pitch? Decentralization enables you to earn money for doing absolutely nothing. No, it’s not too good to be true, because that’s what Depinners are already doing. By harnessing and “farming” your computer resources, such as the processor on your phone, anyone can earn passive income by contributing to the new paradigm of decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN).    The DePIN revolution is a superb example of how decentralization transforms the concept of ownership and puts (earning) power into people’s hands. Equally important, it’s sparking incredible new use cases that are already solving problems from noise pollution to energy grid management to natural disaster alerts. Even though it’s still in its infancy, the almost infinite possibilities of DePIN applications mean that in 2025 early adopters could soon be earning up to 5% of the average person’s income — all without lifting a finger.    3. Memecoins get serious.    Here’s a prediction for what won’t happen in 2025: “serious” financial commentators still won’t accept that memecoins have any utility, or that they are anything other than an internet in-joke that went too far. And they’ll be increasingly, hilariously wrong.    In some respects, I can’t really blame them: on the face of it, most memecoins seem like a joke, especially the quintessential, ubiquitous DOGE. But ignore them at your peril: memecoins are growing up fast and they are evolving beyond their origins. These tokens’ value is driven less by speculation than by their ability to bring people together on projects ranging from the playful to the political.    In fact, memecoins have a great deal to teach us about the nature of community and participation in the decentralized world. In 2025, we’ll see brands wake up to memecoins’ extraordinary potential to reach new audiences, foster new communities and reimagine the relationship between businesses and consumers. To be sure, there’s money to be made in memecoins — but over the long-term, their value to forward-looking brands will be much more significant than their token price.   4. Time Magazine chooses an Android of the Year.    In 2025, I predict that Time Magazine's Person of the Year…won’t be a person at all. For the first time in its 98-year existence, the annual award will go to what I’m calling “Mrs Humanoid” — a composite character symbolizing the rise of AI and robotics, and the integration of both into human society.    This humanoid robot (or “gynoid,” as they’re sometimes referred to) will represent the incredible impact that these twin technologies are making across a range of sectors, from healthcare to education, demonstrating capabilities that blur the lines between human and machine labor. Time Magazine has chosen some controversial characters in the past (check out its 1938 “Person of the Year”), but I don’t think there’s anything remotely strange about choosing a robot. I’d even go a step further and say that it would be irresponsible to not put one on the front cover.    The rapidity of the rise of robots’ should be sparking global discussions on the ethics of AI, as well as how work, privacy and human identity are being redefined. Many of these changes are incredibly positive, some are morally gray or still obscure, and a few are potentially incredibly alarming. This conversation should therefore take place alongside climate change as one of the defining issues of our century. Putting Mrs. Humanoid on Time’s cover would be an important step towards focusing minds, especially regulators’ and legislators’, about how we develop new regulatory frameworks to address the challenges and seize opportunities presented by such advanced AI systems.    5. Traditional search loses ground to AI.  Will 2024 be the last year we “Googled” something we didn’t know? With the advent of Gen AI applications, there’s every reason to think so.    Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity represent the biggest change to search since the emergence of Google a quarter of a century ago. Harnessing the power of AI not only enables more accurate results, thanks to its ability to understand semantics, but also changes the dynamics of search.    These new applications pass the Turing Test with flying colors, enabling people to have meaningful conversations about everything from cooking to philosophy. As such, they represent a fundamental change in our emotional relationship with technology, and make “traditional” search — as exemplified by Google’s long, near-total monopoly— look positively prehistoric.    Just as the emergence of the internet sparked an “SEO arms race” among brands fighting for that all-important first results page of Google, in 2025 we’ll see businesses begin to figure out how to remain relevant in the age of AI-powered search.    One of the biggest changes we’ll see is the evolution of websites, which will increasingly cater to AI agents rather than humans. In 2025, we’ll see web domains take on a new significance, with the most successful brands being those that harness onchain domains to safeguard consumer data, integrate AI functionality and deliver revolutionary online experiences for their audiences.    Whether all, some, or none of these predictions come to pass, one thing is beyond doubt — as we cross into the latter half of the 2020s, decentralization is no longer the future; it’s about to become an inescapable, inextricable part of everybody’s present.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sandy Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/19/2025-will-be-the-year-of-decentralization-5-predictions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57bcb2b954a46f51794c2e05593638eed4ce1a7d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Recent cour t filings acquired by multiple media outlets, including TMZ , reveal that investors in Welch’s Memecoin, referred to as “$HAWK token,” have leveled accusations against the Tuah The Moon Foundation. This Cayman Islands-based organization, which raised funds through token sales, along with creator OverHere Ltd., executive Clinton So, and promoter Alex Larson Schultz, is alleged to have unlawfully promoted and sold crypto that purportedly lacked proper registration. Hawk Tuah’s 15 minutes of fame ends in court Haliey Welch, who shot to fame this year as the “Hawk Tuah” girl after a viral interview discussing sexual techniques, found herself at the center of a disastrous Solana meme coin launch earlier this month.

In addition to the issue, a network of interconnected wallets controlling 96% of the supply sparked additional controversy, intensifying backlash as it was revealed that some of these wallets were offloading their holdings. HAWK market decline: Source – CoinMarketCap Hawk currently boasts a market capitalization of just $7.7 million, reflecting a decline of 23.5% for the day. A community note on an X post by OverHere, which garnered over 3.5 million views, indicated that Welch might need to “talk tuah judge” following the controversy. Angry investors, angry creators, angry promoters On the day of the token’s launch, Haliey Welch, Doc Hollywood, and a spokesperson from OverHere addressed a crowd of angry investors and spectators regarding the launch. At the X Spaces event, the trio made an effort to justify the launch; however, as the clamor escalated, Welch opted to call it a night. Since that time, she has remained silent on social media. Plaintiffs accuse those behind the whirlwind crypto sale of exploiting Welch’s celebrity position to generate a “frenzy.” They assert they took advantage of first-time crypto investors who suffered significant losses as the token’s value collapsed. However, the plaintiffs make it clear that they are not accusing the crypto creators of fraud or irresponsible behavior. Rather, they are suing over the defendants’ claimed incompetence in connection to the Securities Act. Source: X The plaintiffs are seeking damages of more than $150,000, but they are also open to any other amount the court may deem appropriate. Despite the outcry, Welch took to an X post and stated that her “team hasn’t sold one token.” She added, “We tried to stop snipers as best we could through high fee’s in the start of launch on.” What happens next? The defendants will be given the opportunity to respond to the complaint and are likely to seek summary judgment in their favor. If the judge does not award summary judgment, the pretrial proceedings will begin. Plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial, and if granted, the jury will determine damages if the claim is successful.

37850691,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630476,1734633836,"UK court finds Craig Wright in contempt for violating order, sentences him to one year in prison","A UK court found Dr Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who falsely claimed to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, in contempt and sentenced him to one year in prison. This follows a lawsuit against him by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA). COPA has accused Wright of flouting the July 2024 court order that barred the computer scientist from commencing any other legal proceedings based on his claim of being the creator of Bitcoin. According to the reports , Wright issued a claim in October for over 900 billion pounds ($1 trillion) for the intellectual property rights of the Bitcoin Network. The presiding judge, Justice James Mellor, agreed with COPA’s arguments, noting that Wright’s recent action violated the Court order. Mellor was the judge who ruled that Wright was not Satoshi in March and granted the injunctions against him in July. His ruling states: “I have found, to the requisite criminal standard of proof, that Dr Wright committed each of the contempt alleged by COPA in their Grounds 1 to 5 inclusive. Indeed, in my judgment, there is no doubt whatever that each of these contempt has been proved.” Mellor noted that Wright’s allegation of passing off is a fundamental misunderstanding of the legal doctrine because it implies his ownership of the Bitcoin network. This claim of ownership directly violates the court injunction. The judge has now dismissed the $1 trillion case. Judge directs Wright to appeal if unsatisfied with a court injunction The Court ruling further represents another win for Bitcoin developers, who have been the major targets of Wright’s legal action. However, Wright, who attended the proceeding remotely, argued that the Court did not address some major issues and that he would appeal the finding. Interestingly, Wright’s appeal against the previous court judgment has already been dismissed in November. In response, the judge disagreed with Wright’s argument about his previous judgment, noting that none of Wright’s new arguments was convincing and that he would not reconsider his findings. He added that Wright could appeal the judgment to the Court of Appeal. The judge also rejected the allegation that he was biased against Wright, noting that he has never attended a COPA event, as claimed in an affidavit by Gavin Gregory Mehl. He noted that the allegation had no merit, and he could, therefore, preside over the case. COPA says Wright is not remorseful and asks for maximum punishment Meanwhile, the judge has now sentenced Wright to one-year imprisonment , suspended for two years. According to Mellor, this reflects the seriousness of the contempt charges and serves to punish and deter Wright, who is currently in an unknown location in Asia. While the sentence represents a major win for Bitcoin developers, it falls short of the COPA request for two years imprisonment, which the non-profit claims fit Wright’s new action and his lack of remorse. In the UK, the maximum penalty for contempt of Court is two years, and court filings show that COPA has structured its request to get this judgment. COPA court filing stated: “COPA proposes an order committing Dr Wright for an initial term of 18 months and a further term of six months in the event that he does not mitigate his contempt by promptly discontinuing the claims which breach the order.” Jonathan Hough KC, who represented the non-profit, also explained the rationale for asking for the maximum penalty, noting that Wright has repeatedly breached the court order and showed no remorse. He said: “Dr Wright’s original campaign of litigation caused serious distress and hardship to those he targeted and had chilling effects on cryptocurrency development. Dr Wright is now repeating his offence.” Hough added that the new claim would only cause more distress to Bitcoin developers, who must contend with potential litigation from Wright. However, Mellor noted that dismissing the $1 trillion lawsuit would eliminate that distress. The judge also ordered Wright to bear the legal costs for the COPA contempt application and pay 145,000 pounds to COPA within the next 14 days.

Hailed as the tokenized epitome of internet culture and speculative euphoria, holders of these tokens now wonder if there is much future in them. Over the past week, Pepe ($PEPE) has plummeted by 23%, Bonk (BONK) has lost 23% of its value, and Floki (FLOKI) has dropped 24%. Investors are fleeing these high-risk assets in favor of the more stable crypto progenitor, the $2 billion cap Bitcoin ($BTC) , which rose 1% over the last week and could even double next year . This week the Federal Reserve cut rates for the third time in a row after hiking them eleven times. In theory reducing borrowing costs tends to drive crypto prices up, since investors move to a more risk-positive outlook. However, at the same Fed meeting that announced the rate cut, Jerome Powell also put a dampener on claims that the incoming Trump Presidency could stockpile a Bitcoin strategic reserve through the central bank, saying that currently, federal laws forbid it from doing so, but a Congressional decision could still make it happen. While tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu once captured the imagination of millions with high-profile celebrity endorsements, newer entrants are struggling to recapture that 2021 zeitgeist. Pepe and Bonk, for instance, relied heavily on initial hype but failed to build sustainable ecosystems or developer engagement. Floki’s attempts to diversify through trading bot functionality has done little to propel it ahead of its stalwart rivals. Despite the grim outlook, meme coins are here to stay for a while. Being crypto’s most volatile sub-sector, they tend to crash harder and moon higher than other cryptocurrencies. As Bonk, Pepe and Floki spiral, Flockerz takes flight In spite of falling prices this festive season is ushering in a new age of high-utility meme coins that are still only in presale. This means savvy investors can buy in at potentially all-time-low (ATL) prices. One such offering is the new vote-to-earn (V2E) Flockerz ($FLOCK) , a presale which started in early Autumn and has raised over $7.3 million. Touting itself as “The People’s Meme Coin,” Flockerz offers crypto fans unrivaled community-building incentives and staking rewards. Holders of Flockerz (known as “ The $FLOCK ”) are members of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Flocktopia, where they can draft and vote on governance and improvement proposals. This structure ensures community consensus dictates the decisions rather than an opaque centralized authority, like with Bonk, Pepe, or Floki. Some 25% of the project’s 12 billion $FLOCK meme coin supply is for staking, with the protocol offering stakes yield of 924% on the tokens they stake over a two-year period.

This move marks a significant shift for the crypto exchange after enduring nearly two years of regulatory obstacles. The exchange, limited in its operations since June 2023, is now eyeing a full recovery. In a recent interview, the company’s interim CEO, Norman Reed, expressed confidence in reinstating fiat trading. He emphasized that it is no longer a matter of “if.” He made it clear that the question is now simply “when.” Binance’s Struggle with the SEC and the Fallout Binance.US first suspended USD services in mid-2023. This came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a class action lawsuit under Chairman Gary Gensler. The exchange was charged with failing to register as a clearinghouse and broker and engaging in wash trading. The lawsuit alleged that the trading platform was involved in mixing customer funds with the operations of its global parent company and fraud. This legal battle led to the exchange losing operating licenses in multiple states. Also, it prompted Binance to reach a hefty $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. As a result, Binance.US was forced to restrict its US market services. A New Chapter: Overcoming ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ Despite these challenges, Reed frames the struggle as part of a larger effort he calls “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”. He noted that it was an initiative by certain factions of the US government aimed at blocking crypto firms from accessing essential banking services. Recent discussions have raised concerns about regulatory agencies pushing crypto companies out of the financial system. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, has called for more transparency on these actions. Despite facing such challenges , Binance.US has remained operational, supporting 160 crypto assets. Also, it offers staking services for more than 20 digital assets. Reed highlighted that the platform’s continued operation despite regulatory pressure demonstrates its resilience. Binance US Plans to Bolster Compliance and Expanding Services Binance.US is focused on future growth by enhancing its compliance efforts. The company has hired many former law enforcement and regulatory experts. It has also set up strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures, including ID verification and selfie authentication. Binance.US is also planning to expand its custody services and wallet solutions. The company works with local and federal agencies on crypto investigations and offers blockchain training. This further shows its commitment to following rules and cooperating with regulators. This is critical for the US crypto industry, especially with Donald Trump’s reelection. Many are hopeful for changes in the rules for crypto, and Trump’s supportive appointments suggest a more favorable future for digital assets.

Hut8, one of the largest corporate miners, increased its Bitcoin (BTC) reserve to 10,096 coins, valued at over $1B. The corporation takes over the trend of building corporate treasures through debt acquisition, following recent bigger purchases from MARA Holdings and MicroStrategy. Hut8 purchased the additional BTC just weeks after the company’s CEO, Asher Genoot , asked about expanding the reserve. Hut8 is solidly within the top 5 corporate holders of BTC after the most recent purchase. | Source: Bitcoin Treasuries Hut8 grew its balance by another 990 BTC, acquired after a planned $100M purchase. With the latest addition to the treasury, Hut8 rose to the top 4 spot among corporate holders, surpassing the passive holdings of Tesla, Inc. Hut8 is also closing in on the Royal Government of Bhutan, which still holds 11,688K BTC strictly from mining operations. While Mara Holdings and MicroStrategy are leaders in recent BTC acquisitions, Hut8 leads the rest of the pack. Recent updates to treasuries also came from CleanSpark, Galaxy Digital, Semler Scientific, Canaan Mining, and others. Hut8 remains dedicated to carrying one of the biggest energy infrastructure sources for US-based mining, with around 20 EH/s in mining capacity, with the goal of expanding above 33.5 EH/s. The company has reached an agreement with Bitmain to upgrade to its latest generation of ASIC miners. Additionally, Hut8 controls 762 MW in available power as of September 2024. Corporate treasuries shift to higher BTC cost basis After the purchase, the Hut8 (HUT) share price did not recover from its recent loss. HUT trades around $24.99, still up from the $10 range in October. HUT is yet another mining stock to gain more than 100% after announcements of BTC purchases. The recent purchase was completed at $101,710 per BTC, as most corporate buyers are quickly expanding their cost basis. The latest move by Hut8 increases the overall BTC taken from the market by a list of up to 60 leading holders. Those holders accrued a total of 585,487 BTC as of December 16, with more purchases expected in the coming weeks. The HODL Top 60 List 👇 12/18/2024 $HUT became the 4th public company to HODL 10,000+ Bitcoin on the Balance Sheet pic.twitter.com/AGElSRDlOy — HODL15Capital 🇺🇸 (@HODL15Capital) December 19, 2024 The move by Hut8 and other smaller holders partially offsets the rumors that MicroStrategy may slow down its purchases, which usually happens almost every week. For all corporate treasuries, the cost basis of purchases was rising gradually. Those buyers were also among the whales that kept accumulating during the long months of sideways trading. Hut8 moved in as BTC briefly dipped under $100,000 before recovering above $104,000 once again. The building of strategic reserves with borrowed funds has been one of the main drivers of BTC expansion. In addition to the strategic reserve, Hut8 keeps some of the proceeds from shared mining and its own operations. The mining wallets of Hut8 contain more than 8K coins, with regular rewards from Foundry and the company’s own mining farm. Since Hut8 has mined at favorable market prices and with low-cost electricity, even with the latest purchases, the average cost basis per BTC is $24,485. The reserve will be part of the company’s strategy of boosting energy capacity and rebuilding its mining operation equipment. Hut8 has one of the lowest costs per BTC, compared to $58,219 for MicroStrategy, which had a much more aggressive purchasing schedule at market prices. Before the recent purchase, Hut8 had a cost basis of $16,088 per BTC on average, based on mining during favorable periods. While the reserves have been passive in the last few years, Hut8 plans to tap the BTC value through options trading, pledges, sales, or other appropriate strategies. Sean Glennan, CFO of Hut 8, stated the company was looking for favorable opportunities, where it could deploy some of its BTC reserves to finance investments, equipment expansion, and the improvement of operations. Hut8 also plans to expand beyond BTC mining, as its main focus is developing electricity infrastructure for both mining and traditional data centers. The mining corporation combines self-mining with hosting, managed services, as well as data centers for other purposes, again with access to reliable low-cost electricity.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37850646,https://blockworks.co/news/deutsche-bank-layer-2-zksync,1734632702,Deutsche Bank puts ZKsync in the zeitgeist,"Bull markets are the time of exciting mainnet launches, airdrops and announcements. After the world’s shortest testnet, Kraken brought forward yesterday the mainnet launch of its Ink L2 rollup — months ahead of schedule. Then, Sophon, a consumer-focused validium L2 on the Avail data availability layer, also launched its mainnet. But the announcement that’s getting ETH bulls excited today? Banking giant Deutsche Bank is planning an L2 deployment on ZKsync’s Elastic Chain stack, Bloomberg reported. “Institutions looking to build onchain are coming to ZKsync for the ability to build in Web3 without compromise. ZKsync offers institutions with a customizable architecture to build tailored solutions that enable privacy, scalability and interoperability with other private and public blockchains,” Alex Gluchowski, co-inventor of ZKsync, told Blockworks. Codenamed Project DAMA 2 , Deutsche Bank’s initiative was first announced in early November as part of the Singapore central bank’s Project Guardian . Project Guardian is a global consortium of 27 financial institutions and eight key policymaker groups, focused on nudging financial institutions towards experimentation with asset tokenization and blockchain ledgers . Deutsche’s L2 is a TradFi development, so all the trappings of a TradFi L2 is to be expected. That is to say, it’s a permissioned L2 network that needs to prioritize regulatory compliance over the kinds of financial degeneracy replete elsewhere on public blockchains. Regulators are increasingly coming around to recognizing the merits of blockchain technology, but even the most forward-thinking policymakers aren’t giving up their power in a pinch. Put simply, financial regulators are saying: Go forth and innovate with blockchains, but not to the point where it undermines our political bottom lines, please. As AdrianoFeria.eth put it : “The only pragmatic choices for institutions that require stringent oversight and interoperability are to either run their own private, permissioned layer-1 chains, or to harness Ethereum’s L2 ecosystems.” So Deutsche, like other centralized institutions that have launched L2s, has turned to the premier destination for that customizable solution: Ethereum. Ethereum’s pivot from sharding to a rollup-centric roadmap in 2020 was largely pitched as a technological bet on horizontal scaling rather than the vertical scaling route that Solana has taken. I.e., the global state can’t fit on one blockchain, we need to split it up. That modular freedom to launch a chain however you want is also what motivates many TradFi institutions to choose Ethereum. This strategy is, of course, not exclusive to Ethereum. Avalanche too, has pursued this aggressively with its subnet model . Avalanche’s traction, however, has been subpar relative to Ethereum rollup adoption, for the reason that it has been one step behind Ethereum in technology. “Firstly, Ethereum rollups came out before Avalanche’s subnets. And when subnets were ready, it carried a far higher upfront cost compared to launching an OP Stack rollup. All the while, costs of rollups were trending down with EIP-4844 and new data availability solutions like Celestia ,” Blockworks Research analyst Nikhil Chaturvedi explained. But that too is changing for Avalanche. Avalanche’s Etna upgrade this week is drastically cutting the costs of launching an Avalanche subnet (now rebranded to Avalanche L1s). Previously, P-Chain validators had to stake 2000 AVAX, whereas costs today would be more than 10x smaller. “The costs are now reduced to be cheaper or comparable to the cost of a rollup on Celestia,” Chaturvedi said.

This comes just after the country secured a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The deal forces El Salvador to scale back its Bitcoin policies, but the administration isn’t backing down on its commitment to the cryptocurrency. The Chivo wallet, the country’s official Bitcoin wallet, will either be sold or retired as part of the reforms tied to the IMF agreement. Stacy Herbert, Director of the National Bitcoin Office, confirmed the decision, saying, “Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere, and neither are we.” IMF wants change, but Bitcoin stays Now this loan is a big deal for El Salvador’s struggling economy, even if it comes with a few strings attached. Private businesses will now have the choice of whether to accept Bitcoin, and the government’s involvement in crypto-related activities will be tightly restricted. “The potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be significantly reduced,” the IMF said in its statement. “For the public sector, engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of Bitcoin will be confined. Taxes will only be paid in U.S. dollars and the government’s participation in the crypto e-wallet (Chivo) will be gradually unwound.” The deal is still pending approval from the IMF’s executive board. This is a stark departure from President Nayib Bukele’s bold approach. In 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Bukele’s gamble on Bitcoin, which included using public funds to buy the asset and promote it to the population, got him sharp criticism from the IMF and other financial institutions. But he isn’t backing down. He took a victory lap to celebrate Bitcoin’s price rally past $100,000 last month, saying, “I TOLD YOU SO.” At press time, Bitcoin was worth around $100,300, and El Salvador’s holdings are now worth more than $620 million.

37849720,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375301,1734632326,wBTC Delisting Stands: BiT Global’s Legal Challenge Fails,"A federal judge in California has denied BiT Global Digital Ltd.’s request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent crypto exchange Coinbase from delisting wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) from its platform. US District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín ruled Wednesday that BiT Global failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate “imminent irreparable harm” if the delisting proceeds. Coinbase Cleared to Delist wBTC The judge also criticized the speculative nature of BiT Global’s claims and noted the company’s delay in filing the complaint following Coinbase’s delisting announcement . The ruling was a setback for BiT Global, which manages wBTC – a token pegged to Bitcoin’s value that facilitates decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on blockchain networks like Ethereum. Coinbase, which has supported wBTC trading since 2020, argued that its decision to delist the token was driven by concerns over its ties to Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron cryptocurrency. Sun was charged with fraud and securities violations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023. In its legal filing , Coinbase stated that the association with Sun posed an “unacceptable risk,” a claim BiT Global did not address in its complaint or TRO request. BiT Global ‘Lost’ its Bid to Halt wBTC Delisting Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, welcomed the court’s decision, stating on X that BiT Global “lost” its bid to prevent the delisting. “BiT Global lost. Today they asked the Court to order us to stop delisting wBTC to protect our customers. Today the Court said no. We appreciate the Court’s consideration and the outstanding advocacy of Sonal Mehta and her team at WilmerHale.” The exchange was represented by Sonal N. Mehta and her team at WilmerHale, who argued that Coinbase’s actions were necessary to protect its customers. As such, the latest decision allows Coinbase to proceed with delisting wBTC, a token reportedly linked to more than $13 billion in Bitcoin value. Looking ahead, the crypto exchange has approximately 30 days to file a motion to dismiss the broader claims in BiT Global’s lawsuit, which include allegations of “attempted monopolization” under the Sherman Act.

37849452,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630544,1734631424,President Trump calls on Congress to abolish US debt ceiling,"President Donald Trump has called on Congress to abolish the U.S. debt ceiling entirely, describing it as a meaningless psychological tool that serves no practical purpose. In a recent interview , Trump made it clear he’s ready to “lead the charge” if lawmakers agree to eliminate the borrowing limit, which currently caps how much money the federal government can borrow to pay its bills. “The Democrats want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge,” Trump reportedly said. He dismissed the debt ceiling as an outdated concept, suggesting that even experts aren’t sure whether breaching it would result in catastrophe or prove inconsequential. “It doesn’t mean anything, except psychologically,” he said. The comments come amid rising tensions over a potential government shutdown, which could occur Saturday at midnight if lawmakers fail to pass a funding deal. Trump criticized the current negotiations, calling a bipartisan agreement to avoid a shutdown a “Democrat trap” and taking aim at House Speaker Mike Johnson for what he described as an unacceptable resolution. $36 trillion in national debt and counting The United States is facing an unprecedented national debt crisis, with total federal debt now exceeding $36 trillion as of December 2024. Publicly held debt makes up $29 trillion of that figure, or 99% of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). Projections show the debt-to-GDP ratio could pass 100% in 2025 and may hit 172% by 2054 if nothing changes. This year alone, interest payments on the debt have skyrocketed by 34%, reaching $882 billion—more than the federal government spends on defense, Medicaid, or children’s programs. Meanwhile, the annual federal deficit is stuck at $1.9 trillion, mirroring last year’s figure. Government spending continues to outpace revenue, thanks to a combination of tax cuts and high borrowing costs. With the federal funds rate at its highest level in decades, the cost of financing the debt has surged, raising alarm bells among economists about long-term sustainability. Trump’s stance on the debt ceiling comes against this backdrop of growing fiscal uncertainty. While Congress suspended the debt limit through January 2025 in a deal reached last year, the president argued the measure only delays inevitable fights over borrowing authority. He revealed he had discussed his concerns with Elon Musk before the billionaire took to X (formerly Twitter) to share similar views on government spending. “I told him if he agrees with me, he could put out a statement,” Trump said. He described Musk’s perspective as aligned with his own, particularly on cost concerns.

The chart shared by Steph has sparked speculation about the possibility of a substantial price move. This event also occurred following the digital asset’s 490% surge from around $0.5 in November to over $2.41. #XRP 12H Bollinger Bands squeezing tight again. Last time this happened, we saw a 490% explosion. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes pic.twitter.com/fZk4eBltSS — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 18, 2024 This surge also coincided with the news that Gary Gensler, the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would be leaving his position in January. However, Steph believes the asset’s Bollinger Bands played a crucial role in this performance. Will History Rhyme for XRP? Bollinger Bands are a widely used technical indicator to measure market volatility and identify overbought or oversold conditions. When the bands narrow, it indicates a period of low volatility, often preceding a significant price movement. Steph’s chart shows that the XRP’s surge from November began after a tightening of its Bollinger Bands. The bands are now close to this level again, and Steph noted, “History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes.” This suggests the asset could experience a similar surge, or even outperform the 490% increase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Renewed Interest in XRP This development comes amid a broader context of increasing institutional interest in XRP and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Ripple recently launched RLUSD , its stablecoin, causing a significant resurgence in attention, and experts believe adoption will rapidly increase. Market participants are also closely watching other factors and Bitcoin’s price performance, which often influence altcoin markets, including XRP. Any major movements in these areas could impact the unfolding of this technical setup. While technical patterns do not guarantee outcomes, historical precedents suggest that similar setups often lead to sharp increases. The digital asset is currently trading at $2.33, and a 420% surge from this level would send it to $12.1, pushing the asset into double-digit territory. XRP’s Bollinger Bands hit the tightest point in history a few months ago, and analysts showed how this could lead to a repeat of the 2017 rally. The current setup presents an intriguing opportunity for investors, and with the Bands tightening again, the sky seems to be the limit for XRP.

The latest purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin reserves to 10,096 BTC worth approximately $1 billion, placing Hut 8 among the top 10 institutional BTC holders. The Miami-based firm plans to use its Bitcoin reserves through a variety of strategies, including options, commitments, and puts. “Today, the market recognizes and values our strategic reserve, which effectively lowers our cost of capital and strengthens our financial position,” Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said in a statement. Genoot also noted that the company is open to purchasing more Bitcoin when market conditions are favorable. The acquisition comes after Hut 8 recently launched a $500 million intra-market equity issuance program, the proceeds of which are earmarked for BTC purchases and other investments.

Riot Platforms (RIOT) purchased 667 Bitcoin at an average price of $101,135 on Dec. 16, while MARA Holdings (MARA) has also been actively purchasing BTC to strengthen its finances. These strategies are proving effective as miners face shrinking profit margins following the recent Bitcoin halving. For example, MARA raised $1 billion in convertible debt last month, giving investors exposure to BTC equity instead of traditional interest income. Hut 8 sees its Bitcoin reserve as more than just a store of value. “We view our strategic reserve as a dynamic financial asset that can generate returns beyond a simple price appreciation,” CEO Genoot said. *This is not investment advice.

37849167,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313433,1734631188,Deus Wallet Introduces Duress Mode – The Revolutionary Solution for Cryptocurrency Security,"December 19, 2024 – London, United Kingdom As cryptocurrency adoption expands, so do the associated risks, including physical threats targeting crypto holders. Traditional wallets often lack safeguards to address real-world coercion scenarios. Addressing this challenge, Deus Wallet introduces a new feature – ‘d uress mode.’ This technology, integrated into Deus’s non-custodial framework, provides an added layer of security to help safeguard cryptocurrency assets and user safety in high-risk situations. The issue – C rypto security is more than digital While digital security has advanced with multi-signature wallets, biometric authentication and hardware devices, physical security remains overlooked. Criminals have adapted their tactics, targeting crypto holders. Considering real-life examples 2022, London – Criminals broke into a businessman’s home and extorted $1.1 million in Bitcoin at gunpoint. 2023, New York – A crypto trader was kidnapped and forced to transfer $400,000 while held captive. 2021, Bangkok – A prominent investor managing millions in crypto was ambushed by an international gang and coerced into transferring $2.7 million. In each case, victims lacked the tools to mitigate risks under pressure. Standard wallets provide no ‘last line of defense’ for these real-world threats. Deus Wallet – Next-level protection Deus Wallet tackles this vulnerability with its non-custodial structure and duress mode. This approach allows users to retain full control over their assets while incorporating an additional security measure designed to address specific risks. Non-custodial goal With Deus, private keys are stored exclusively by the user – not on any centralized server. This eliminates third-party risks such as hacking, insider theft or regulatory overreach. In an era where centralization poses increasing threats, non-custodial wallets offer unparalleled independence and security. Duress mode was developed with one goal – to protect users in life-threatening situations. The way it works Duress PIN configuration – Setting a secondary PIN during wallet setup. Under coercion – Entering the duress PIN instead of the regular one. Seamless Decoy – The wallet opens a fake account with minimal or no funds, while users’ actual assets remain hidden. This feature ensures that attackers see what appears to be the entire wallet balance, without ever suspecting the existence of hidden funds. Deus Wallet is part of a growing movement to rethink cryptocurrency security. As the crypto ecosystem matures, protecting users in both digital and physical spaces is becoming more important. The bigger picture Rising crypto adoption – As cryptocurrencies enter mainstream finance, the average user profile shifts from tech-savvy enthusiasts to general consumers, many of whom lack advanced security awareness. Criminal adaptability – Criminals exploit the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions, knowing that once assets are transferred, they’re nearly impossible to recover. The security gap – While solutions like hardware wallets protect against cyber threats, tools like duress mode address the issue of physical security. Deus Wallet is at the forefront of this shift, setting a new standard for protecting users and their assets. Key features of Deus Wallet Non-custodial architecture – Full control of private keys ensures users’ funds are always theirs. Duress mode – A revolutionary feature to safeguard assets under physical coercion. User-friendly design – Intuitive interface suitable for beginners and experts alike. Advanced encryption – Multi-layered security protects against cyberattacks. Customizable settings – Users can define access parameters and duress mode triggers according to their preferences. Cross-platform compatibility – Available on iOS and Android. In today’s world, digital and physical security go hand-in-hand. Deus Wallet provides a comprehensive solution, ensuring that users’ assets and personal safety are never compromised. About Deus Wallet Deus Wallet offers a comprehensive platform for storing and managing cryptocurrencies and NFTs (non-fungible tokens), featuring tools to track account activity and streamline asset management.

Powell said the Federal Reserve is not allowed to own Bitcoin and is not looking to change that. Fed Can’t Own Bitcoin Powell commented in response to a question on whether he saw any value in a Bitcoin strategic reserve. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve to stay ahead of the competition as other countries embrace crypto. Powell stated the Fed is not allowed to own Bitcoin and is not looking for a law change. “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” Powell’s comments adversely impacted the price of Bitcoin, which fell sharply. Experts have warned of the risks associated with volatile assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s value has skyrocketed following Trump’s election victory and the prospect of a crypto-friendly administration. Trump has repeatedly stated he will create a Bitcoin strategic reserve, a concept n rejected in Europe. However, the President-elect has provided no details on what the reserve would entail, only saying initial holdings could include seized Bitcoin, a stockpile of 200,000 tokens worth $21 billion at current prices. Bitcoin has doubled this year, creating history when it crossed the $100,000 mark. A Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Plans to create a strategic reserve are already underway, with Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introducing a bill proposing a reserve. The bill proposes the US Treasury buy 200,000 Bitcoin annually until its stockpile reaches 1 million. According to the bill, Fed bank deposits and gold holdings would fund the purchases. Analysts from Barclays believe funding a strategic reserve would require the approval of Congress and the issuance of new Treasury debt. The analysts also expected such a plan would face stiff opposition from the Federal Reserve. Fed Cautious On Rate Cuts As expected, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points. However, it also revised its outlook for rate cuts in 2025, indicating only two reductions instead of the four forecast in September. Powell stated the central bank would be looking for progress on inflation, adding that consumers are feeling the effects of high prices rather than high inflation. “We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation. We understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that, and it’s prices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that. So there’s tremendous pain in that burst of inflation that was very global. Now we have inflation itself is way down — but people are still feeling high prices — and that is really what people are feeling.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37849099,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27786,1734631021,North Korean Hackers Stole $1.6B in Crypto in 2024,"North Korean Hackers Stole $1.6B in Crypto in 2024 North Korean hackers escalated their cybercrime activities in 2024, stealing a staggering $1.6 billion in cryptocurrency, according to a Chainalysis report . This figure represents a dramatic increase from $660.5 million in 2023, emphasizing the role of cybercrime in funding Pyongyang’s government and military programs. A report has just come out showing that North Korean hackers are responsible for 61% of the $2.2 billion in cryptocurrency stolen from platforms around the world this year, to fund the regime’s weapons development and ballistic missile programs in an effort to circumvent international sanctions. Increased Sophistication and Frequency North Korea-linked cybercriminals executed 47 attacks in 2024, which is more than twice as many incidents recorded in 2023. These include the hack of decentralized finance systems and crypto exchanges through sophisticated means such as advanced malware and social engineering. One of the major tactics has been hackers impersonating remote IT workers. The U.S. Department of Justice recently indicted 14 North Korean nationals who assumed fake identities to get remote jobs, ultimately generating over $88 million through data theft and extortion schemes. The scale of these attacks is also increasing. In 2024, North Korean groups carried out more hacks of over $100 million than in any previous year. Smaller-scale incidents- less than $50 million-have also increased , suggesting a diversification in tactics. A Shift Following Closer Russia Ties Most of North Korea’s crypto thefts took place in the first half of 2024. Hacking activity slowed significantly after June, coinciding with growing ties between North Korea and Russia. Analysts say the regime may have shifted its cyber efforts following a meeting between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin that underscored increased cooperation between the two nations. The Chainalysis report suggests that one factor contributing to North Korea’s new direction could be its collaboration with Russia. The regime may be diverting resources to support Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine, or it may simply be pursuing other avenues of cybercrime. Global Concerns and Implications This includes continuing worry over North Korea’s rise in cybercrime activities meant to fund the state military programs. In particular, U.S. estimates account that up to one-third of the regime’s funding comes for missiles from illicit activities via online portals. Despite a mid-year slowing, 2024 appeared to solidify North Korea’s position globally at the top of crypto thievery.

37849066,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313381,1734630928,Deutsche Bank Working on Institutional Crypto Solution for Regulatory Hurdles: Report,"Germany-headquartered Deutsche Bank is reportedly developing a solution for the regulatory challenges that financial institutions face when using public blockchains. Bloomberg reports that the global investment bank is building a layer-2 blockchain for leading smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ) to address regulatory concerns of financial firms such as inadvertently dealing with criminals and sanctioned entities. The layer-2 chain is incorporated in the firm’s multi-chain asset servicing pilot, Project Dama 2, which is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Project Guardian initiative, a collaboration of 24 major financial institutions that explore asset tokenization. Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific industry applied innovation lead, Boon-Hiong Chan, says public blockchains such as Ethereum come with risks for regulated lenders such as not knowing who validates transactions, concerns over payment of transaction fees to sanctioned entities and threats of unforeseen hard fork. Chan says the layer-2 solution can help address these issues. He says the platform will allow banks to curate a “more bespoke list of validators” and potentially grant regulators super admin rights that will enable them to scrutinize fund movements. “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied. You are not dependent on the layer-1 for detailed transaction records anymore.” The bank launched a test version of Dama 2 in November and is hoping to launch a minimum viable product by next year.

Powell’s comments instantly impacted the market, with the price of BTC dropping considerably, dropping below $100,000 to a low of $99,047 before recovering and rising to its current level. BTC is currently down just over 2% and trading around the $101,200 mark. Speaking about the pullback, ChangeNOW CMO Pauline Shangett noted, ""Powell's comments sent shockwaves through the crypto market with over $700 million in liquidations in just 24 hours, reflecting the high volatility of the crypto space."" The market cap also slumped, dropping by 3.50% to $3.52 trillion. Almost all major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) are trading in the red. Bitcoin (BTC) Slumps After FOMC Meeting Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto market retreated after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced plans to slow down rate cuts in 2025, with the benchmark federal funding rates declining to a range of 4.25% and 4.50%. The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the federal funds rate. The decision matched expectations from analysts and market watchers. Despite this, the crypto markets registered a substantial decline following the decision. According to analysts, the market reaction was not because of the December rate cut, which was along expected lines, but the outlook for 2025. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted the bank has revised its 2025 outlook and dropped potential rate cuts from 4 to 2, suggesting a more hawkish outlook for the year, triggering a selloff in the crypto market. The Fed also raised its expectations for PCE inflation from 2.1% to 2.5% at the end of 2025, indicating that inflation could increase in 2025. The Fed's decision to reduce rate cuts and the potential spike in inflation could also adversely impact the current bull run as investors anticipate an unfavorable market. Following the announcement, BTC slumped below $100,000, dragging the market down. Federal Reserve Not Allowed To Own Bitcoin Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell rained on the crypto market’s parade after stating the central bank is not allowed to, or looking to hold Bitcoin. As a result, the price of BTC plummeted below $100,000, falling to a low of $99,047 before recovering to its current level. Powell stated, “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” Powell made the comments in response to a question on whether he saw any value in a federal Bitcoin reserve, an idea mooted by President-elect Donald Trump as a way for the US to stay ahead of the competition as other countries embrace digital assets. However, experts have warned of risks associated with volatile assets like BTC. BTC’s value has soared since Donald Trump’s election victory, with the President-elect promising to create a friendly regulatory environment for the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is down over 2% in the past 24 hours, as its price dropped following the FOMC meeting. BTC slumped to an intraday low of $99,047 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and move to its current level. The markets also saw liquidations reach a staggering $700 million following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterating the central bank cannot own Bitcoin. Powell also predicted it could take 1-2 years for inflation to reach the desired 2% target, triggering widespread selloffs. BTC was quite bullish last week despite starting it in the red. By Tuesday, it plummeted to a low of $94,313 before settling at $96,912 as bearish sentiment took hold.

37849011,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630533,1734630209,Investors only have themselves to blame; Jerome Powell steals the joy of Christmas,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell released his statement on Wednesday shortly after the Fed released its decision to cut interest rates. The chair highlighted the Fed will evaluate progress on inflation before making further cuts in 2025. Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised investors’ eyebrows in his statement after the Fed announced further interest rate reductions. The chair expressed that there was a lot of uncertainty that would require the Fed to move slower before making any more cuts. Powell expresses inflation is still a concern amid the rate-cut decision Jerome Powell indicated the Fed would apply a more cautious approach in 2025 before making further interest rate cuts. In the final policy decision in 2024, the Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point. The institution also signaled two more cuts in 2025 in its Summary of Economic Projections released on Wednesday. Read Chair Powell's full opening statement from the #FOMC press conference (PDF): https://t.co/jjyoItUGmt pic.twitter.com/4bHHy3t80Z — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) December 18, 2024 The decision to make further cuts was widely expected; however, investors were surprised by the “dot plot” indicated in the new policy. The plot suggested the Fed would only reduce its fund rate by half a percentage point in the coming year. In response to the announcement, markets recorded declines as investors reacted to the uncertainty. The S&P , for instance, fell by more than 3%, pulling from its all-time high, while the Dow Jones Average fell by 2.6%. The official expressed that he believed inflation would continue to be a challenge in the next administration. The central bankers’ prediction on inflation is reportedly ending higher than expected in this financial year and even higher in 2025. When the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower, It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down. – Jerome Powell The chair emphasized the economy was still recovering from the shocks that hit the globe in 2021 and 2022. He acknowledged the labor market was where it was required to be and the labor market pressures had subsided. Powell noted the labor market was still cooling and looser than before the pandemic. He, however, emphasized the cooling was not sufficient to cause alarm. In response, the Fed reduced its unemployment predictions from 4.4% to 4.2% for 2024 and from 4.4% to 4.3% for 2025. Powell expresses uncertainty on Trump’s proposed policy effects on inflation Powell also commented on Trump’s policies and the potential for new tariffs. The chair noted that some bankers had evaluated the uncertainty around how the incoming president’s policies would be implemented. He emphasized that they had also weighed how the policies would affect inflation before making their prediction. He stated the Fed would wait until the policies were implemented before making any further rate cut decision. Trump announced that he would impose tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada after he assumed office. Economists warned that increased import taxes would adversely affect the economy, as merchants would pass the increased costs on to consumers. The Fed, on the other hand, signaled increased concerns about how such tariffs would affect inflation in the new statement. Other economists suggested that Trump was unlikely to implement the trade tariffs and would only use them as a bargaining chip. Powell stated the Fed did not know much about the new policies and that it would be premature to make any conclusion. He expressed uncertainty about whether there would be retaliatory tariffs or how they would affect inflation. The Chair expressed his optimism, noting the outlook for the US economy was bright. However, he warned that it was necessary to stay on task. Investors only have themselves to blame Does the Fed know it’s Christmas at all? Does Jerome Powell even wish traders well? Wait. Did investors expect anything different from the Fed chair? The good news is that stocks are a little less expensive than they were Wednesday morning. However, the bad news is that trillions have been wiped off the market following the FOMC meeting. Many investors blame the Federal Reserve’s “hawkish cut” for the mayhem. This does not get any better. While officials did cut rates, their median projection for core inflation (the important stuff) shows they now expect inflation to persist above their target next year. It’s looking like next year will bring tighter Fed policy. It is getting to the time when many start turning to resolutions for the new year. Here is a suggestion for the people who set interest rates: publish your estimates of where you expect rates to settle in the medium run. Then, live by those decisions and do not count on Jerome Powell, the Fed, or Donald Trump to pull you out of the economic rut.

In a December 19 post on X, Ju criticized South Korea’s economic policies, highlighting the rising value of the Korean won and the diminishing appeal of domestic assets. CryptoQuant CEO @ki_young_ju warns of economic instability in South Korea, calls for financial policy reforms. pic.twitter.com/Ma88zAE4Sv — Coinwaft (@coinwaft) December 19, 2024 Ju stated, “Domestic assets, including the Korean won, are not attractive at all.” South Korea’s Economic Instability, Capital Flight, and the Crypto Sector’s Concerns The CryptoQuant boss pointed out that government efforts to stabilize the currency have largely failed, exacerbating economic instability. Ju noted that aligning the USDT value on Upbit with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rate is a warning sign, indicating diminished confidence in the Korean economy. This trend, coupled with the declining South Korean won (KRW), could signal capital flight, a phenomenon where investors move their assets abroad to avoid economic losses. The CEO expressed frustration with the government’s approach to retaining capital, emphasizing the need for fewer restrictions and more incentives to encourage investments. “The government should not forcefully hold on to capital that is fleeing overseas,” he remarked. Ju also shared his growing dissatisfaction as a domestic business operator, hinting at plans to relocate his company after seven years in South Korea. Just called my counter part in Korea, he says that the reports are FUD. The position is that the Korean authorities are clamping down on unregulated exchanges and exchanges that are not compliant. Further they are auditing the quality of the KYC. A banis not on the cards. — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) January 11, 2018 This capital flight could further destabilize the local financial system, making South Korea less appealing to international investors and impacting its global economic standing. Market Impact of South Korea’s Political Unrest Amid Regulatory Challenges and Taxation South Korea’s political turbulence has compounded its financial woes. The December 2024 impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol after a martial law declaration created volatility in the stock market.

The National Assembly’s decision to pause all crypto-related legislation has added to market uncertainty. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok’s reassurances about stabilizing the economy have done little to address investor concerns. Similarly, South Korea’s restrictive stance on cryptocurrency has long been a point of contention. Plans to implement a 20% tax on crypto gains from January 2025, which have been delayed multiple times due to opposition, continue to face resistance. Recent amendments propose raising the exemption threshold to annual gains of 50 million won ($35,919), but these measures may not be enough to retain investor confidence. Adding to the scrutiny, former Democratic Party congressman Kim Nam-guk faces legal charges for concealing significant crypto holdings, underscoring the nation’s rigid approach to crypto governance.

If approved, the Franklin Crypto Index ETF will list on the Cboe BZX exchange and use Coinbase Custody Trust Company LLC as its digital asset custodian.

Particularly, Bitcoin’s price action in the past 24 hours has been between $98,839.87 and $105,306, highlighting the potential corrections that could occur as the cryptocurrency continues to edge upwards. This fluctuation comes amid a broader bull market cycle that analysts like CryptoCon suggest is far from over. Bitcoin Crash Below $100,000 Not The End Crypto analyst CryptoCon has been a consistent voice in tracking Bitcoin’s movements using Fibonacci extensions during the current market cycle. Back in August, when Bitcoin was hovering around $60,000, CryptoCon projected a surge to $109,236 by December. This prediction was based on the 0.618 Fibonacci extension and eventually played out with remarkable accuracy. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Recovery Toward $2 As Million-Dollar Whale Transactions Explode On The Network Since first breaking above the $100,000 mark on December 5, this price point has proven to be a psychological barrier and there have been multiple retests since then. Despite this back and forth, Bitcoin enthusiasts remain strongly optimistic, and the Crypto Feat And Greed Index remains in Extreme Greed. As such, the correction in the past 24 hours is viewed by CryptoCon as a minor event in a larger narrative. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s rise to $109,000 marked just one step in its ongoing journey. The analyst emphasized that corrections, while inevitable, are becoming less significant in the context of the increasingly well-established bull market. “Corrections are an afterthought. That doesn’t mean they won’t come, it just means they’re not important,” CryptoCon said regarding corrections. The Next Target: $166,000 By February 2025 Looking ahead, CryptoCon has turned attention toward the 5.618 Fibonacci extension as the next key milestone in Bitcoin’s ongoing bull market. This projection aligns closely with a price target of approximately $162,000. According to the analyst, this ambitious target could materialize as soon as February 2025, given Bitcoin’s current rate of price growth. Related Reading: Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Fantom Breakout Above $1 Reveals What’s Next In The Parabolic Trend At present, Bitcoin is trading at $101,600. For the cryptocurrency to reach the $162,000 level, it would need to register another 60% increase from its current price point. CryptoCon does not see the February 2025 target as the conclusion of Bitcoin’s bull run. In fact, the prediction is accompanied by a detailed multi-year chart outlining Bitcoin’s consistent upward trajectory since November 2023. This chart highlights a pattern of steady 52% gains before encountering resistance at Fibonacci extension levels. The path to $162,000 is viewed as one of some price targets before notable corrections. Interestingly, the analysis also hints at an even loftier price target tied to the 6.618 Fibonacci extension level. If Bitcoin were to reach this extreme milestone, it would translate to a price of around $254,100. For now, Bitcoin appears ready for a steady continued growth above $100,000, with corrections in between.

37848328,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394852,1734629400,NiceHash Moves to Switzerland to Reinforce Its Role in Compliant Crypto Mining,"The post NiceHash Moves to Switzerland to Reinforce Its Role in Compliant Crypto Mining appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the cryptocurrency industry matures, regulatory compliance has become essential for companies aiming to thrive in the ever-evolving landscape. Leading cryptocurrency mining platform NiceHash has demonstrated its willingness to lead by example by relocating operations from the British Virgin Islands to Zug, Switzerland. This strategic move to Europe’s Crypto Valley will support NiceHash’s commitment to adhere to global standards, particularly as European regulations tighten. The transition began in November and is expected to conclude by mid-December, once the minutiae of shifting HQ has been finalized. In doing so, NiceHash joins a handful of other crypto companies that have pledged to set up shop in the EU, including several tier-1 exchanges. New Address, Same NiceHash The decision to make the move to Swiss territory feeds into NiceHash’s goal of positioning itself at the forefront of compliant crypto mining services. The transition not only aligns with Switzerland’s robust regulatory framework but ensures adherence to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Travel Rule, both of which are reshaping the cryptocurrency industry. Switzerland’s reputation as a hub for blockchain innovation and regulatory clarity makes it an ideal destination for crypto companies such as NiceHash. Zug, in particular, has become synonymous with the crypto industry, hosting a thriving ecosystem of blockchain startups, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies that foster innovation while ensuring compliance. Crypto Companies Comply With MiCA The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), set to come into full effect by December 2024, represents one of the most comprehensive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. Covering crypto issuance, trading, and service provision, MiCA aims to establish a unified approach to crypto governance across EU member states, promoting transparency and investor protection. The Travel Rule, a separate but equally impactful regulation, mandates that cryptocurrency service providers collect and share customer information during transactions above a certain threshold. Its goal is to combat money laundering and illicit financial activities, aligning crypto operations with global standards applied in traditional finance. While there have been some concerns raised in regards to the EU’s wide-ranging new regulatory framework, particularly in the context of stablecoin issuance, industry players have widely accepted the regulations as the price of progress. They’re designed to weed out less scrupulous players, driving crypto users into the arms of legitimate companies committed to upholding rigorous security and compliance standards. Simplifying Cryptocurrency Mining Founded in 2014, NiceHash has become synonymous with cryptocurrency mining, offering a marketplace that connects sellers of hashing power with buyers looking to mine cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional mining operations that require significant upfront investment in hardware and energy costs, NiceHash democratizes access by allowing individuals and businesses to lease computational power on demand. Sellers can monetize idle GPU or CPU resources, while buyers can choose from a variety of mining algorithms, optimizing profitability and efficiency. This two-way marketplace has made NiceHash a popular choice for seasoned miners with hashrate to spare and newcomers exploring the space. While already compliant with EU regulations, the move to Zug demonstrates its determination to maintain its status as Europe’s favorite crypto mining platform.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/nicehash-moves-to-switzerland-to-reinforce-its-role-in-compliant-crypto-mining/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

37848334,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630511,1734629024,North Korean hackers stole more crypto this year than ever before,"North Korea’s state-backed hackers shattered records in 2024, stealing $1.34 billion worth of crypto in just 47 attacks. That’s more than double the $660.5 million they swiped across 20 incidents in 2023, according to a new Chainalysis report . These digital thieves now account for 61% of all crypto stolen globally this year, cementing Pyongyang’s place as the top player in crypto crime. U.S. and international officials warn these stolen funds bankroll North Korea’s missile and weapons programs, sidestepping sanctions and endangering global security. The time between successful hacks has shortened dramatically, especially for high-value hits of $50 million or more. Pyongyang’s cyber operatives have shifted their game, focusing more on large-scale heists while maintaining a steady flow of smaller operations of around $10,000. Weaponizing crypto theft with insider infiltration The tactics these hackers employ are a masterclass in deception. Increasingly, North Korean IT workers are worming their way into legitimate companies, exploiting remote work opportunities to infiltrate networks. They pose as highly skilled professionals, using fake identities and shady intermediaries to land jobs. Once inside, they loot proprietary information and even steal directly from company accounts. The U.S. Department of Justice recently indicted 14 North Koreans who pulled off this exact scheme, stealing $88 million while masquerading as employees of U.S. firms. The broader picture is even darker. Pyongyang’s cybercriminals are targeting not just companies but the very infrastructure of the crypto world. In one of the year’s most audacious hacks, they hit the Japanese exchange DMM Bitcoin, stealing 4,502.9 Bitcoin—worth $305 million at the time. By exploiting weaknesses in the exchange’s infrastructure, they funneled the stolen assets through mixers and cross-chain bridges, making them nearly impossible to trace. The aftermath forced DMM Bitcoin to shut down, transferring its operations to another exchange under a major financial conglomerate. This kind of attack isn’t rare. North Korea’s hackers use advanced malware, phishing schemes, and social engineering to gain access to systems. They’ve literally perfected the art of moving stolen funds through complex laundering chains, often using CoinJoin mixing services and obscure online marketplaces to hide the money trail. A change in strategy after July The first half of 2024 saw Pyongyang’s hackers operating at full throttle, but their activity took a nosedive after a high-profile summit in late June. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un met in Pyongyang to sign a mutual defense pact. The report says that shortly after that, there was a sharp drop in the value stolen by North Korean hackers—down by 53.73% in the second half of the year compared to the first. Meanwhile, non-North Korean hacks saw a slight uptick. Analysts are cautious about drawing a direct link between the summit and the slowdown in attacks, but you have to admit, the timing is hard to ignore. Russia released millions of dollars in frozen North Korean assets around the same period, potentially providing Pyongyang with alternative funding sources. On the other hand, North Korea deployed troops to Ukraine and reportedly sought advanced military technology from Moscow, so its resources may have been redirected toward the conflict.

37848118,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375349,1734628954,This Trader Made Over $6 Million by Selling Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holdings: Details,"TL;DR A whale turned a $3,800 investment in SHIB into over $6 million, with remaining holdings valued at $52 million. Another trader previously saw a 628x ROI from a $2,500 SHIB purchase, potentially gaining $1.58 million. The Multi-Million Trade The meme coin sector is full of tokens that have experienced colossal price increases in the past few years, thus giving savvy traders the chance to make substantial profits. Among the notable examples is Shiba Inu (SHIB), which erased multiple zeroes from its valuation in the last years. Lookonchain recently revealed the story of one whale who purchased more than 15 trillion tokens in the summer of 2020. The individual spent a mere $3,800 to acquire the stash. Not long ago, the trader sold 250 billion SHIB for over $6 million. They still have 2.15 trillion tokens left, which, calculated by current rates, equals approximately $52 million. Earlier this year, CryptoPotato reported the case of another trader who got lucky with SHIB. The person in question spent approximately $2,500 to purchase almost 50 billion tokens in 2021. After 30 months of staking, they withdrew 40.5 billion assets and deposited them into Coinbase. The individual could have made a profit of around $1.58 million (at the time) should they have d ecided to sell the stash, representing a gain of 628x. Other Examples Shiba Inu is not the only meme coin that helped some traders make impressive profits. One person purchased 170.2 billion PEPE coins at the end of October 2023 and sold them for almost $2 million in USDC earlier this year. The return on investment (ROI) is a whopping 886%, while the total profit is $1.77 million. In addition, a trader who bought 416.8 million Cat in a Dogs World (MEW) tokens in July for $2.42 million recently sold them for 16,270 SOL ($3.94 million), securing a $1.52 million profit. Another individual spent only $158 worth of SOL to purchase 12.4 million CHILLGUY tokens. As of the moment of this writing, the stash equals approximately $2.5 million. Dealing with meme coins can result in significant profits but also carries the risk of major losses. These assets often rely on trends and generally lack utility or intrinsic value, making their prices highly susceptible to sharp declines in a short time. Those considering investing in meme coins should follow basic guidelines to minimize risks. This includes investing only what they can afford to lose and thoroughly researching the project beforehand.

Hut 8 Surpasses $1 Billion in Bitcoin Reserves. The acquisition was announced on December 19 , with the company revealing an average purchase price of $101,710 per Bitcoin. BREAKING: Hut 8 just made a bold move, purchasing 990 Bitcoin for $100M at an average price of $101,710/BTC. With this addition, their strategic Bitcoin reserve now exceeds 10,000 BTC, valued at over $1 billion as of today! The institutions are here. #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/NPjFlzmplm — Bit Is Cash (@BitisCash) December 19, 2024 Hut 8’s CEO, Asher Genoot, underscored the importance of the company’s growing Bitcoin reserves in achieving its financial goals. He stated, “As we scale operations and extend our cost advantage in Bitcoin production, we anticipate that the flywheel effect will enable us to grow our holdings organically at a significant discount to market prices.” On December 4, Hut 8 launched a $500 million at-the-market (ATM) program and a $250 million stock repurchase initiative to further strengthen its position. Proceeds from the ATM program will be used to expand digital infrastructure, acquire Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, and support operational needs. The company’s latest acquisition aligns with its dual strategy of mining and purchasing Bitcoin to optimize its digital asset portfolio. Hut 8’s total holdings now stand at 10,096 BTC, with a realized average cost of $24,484 per Bitcoin. These funds will also support the company’s planned upgrades to its mining fleet, further enhancing operational efficiency in BTC acquisition. Institutional Interest Fuels Crypto Adoption Hut 8’s investment reflects a broader trend of rising crypto adoption among institutions. Additionally, pro-crypto policies in the United States and other regions encourage companies to include Bitcoin in their reserves. Despite its success, Hut 8 has faced legal hurdles. Earlier this month, the company filed a motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit from shareholders. The lawsuit stems from a January report by J Capital Research, accusing Hut 8 of overstating profitability related to its acquisition of U.S. Bitcoin Corp. Hut 8 called the allegations part of a short-selling strategy, claiming, “The case arose from a campaign to sink Hut 8’s stock for its own gain.” Despite these challenges, the company remains committed to defending its reputation and delivering value to shareholders. With Bitcoin reserves now exceeding $1 billion, Hut 8 remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency sector. Hut 8 has also invested in upgrading its mining operations by purchasing 31,145 BITMAIN Antminer S21+ ASIC machines, scheduled for delivery in Q1 2025. This upgrade is expected to boost its self-mining hash rate by 3.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) while enhancing energy efficiency across its 111 MW of self-mining capacity.

Over the last 24 hours, many coins have taken a major hit. According to analyst Miles Deutscher, the changes in the market have impacted the short-term trajectory, but they do not alter the overall bullish outlook for the long term. Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance is rising, but the market may be seeing the formation of a lower high, signaling a possible dip for Bitcoin before altcoins begin to rally. Historically, after a correction in Bitcoin, altcoins tend to follow and experience significant growth. This could mean a potential altcoin rally towards the end of January, as market patterns tend to align with these cycles. Many new retail investors panic during market dips, with some expressing fear about holding coins like XRP or DOGE. For those who think the bull market is over, the analyst said that it’s important to consider that most bear markets don’t start with a 15-20% correction. Historically, dips like this offer great buying opportunities and can be the best time to position yourself for gains in the future. Historical Pattern Shows Big Potential Lark Davis, a crypto analyst, believes the altcoin market is gearing up for a big rally. On December 18, the total market cap of altcoins (excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) is around $1.05 trillion, close to the high from November 2021. The last time the market hit a similar level was in February 2021, when it broke through and surged over 200%. Davis thinks that once the market cap surpasses $1.13 trillion, we could see one of the biggest altcoin seasons ever. He also points out several factors driving this potential growth, such as Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs, Trump taking office soon, global rate cuts, and more money flowing into the market. With these conditions in place, Davis warns that anyone who isn’t involved now could miss a chance to make significant gains during the upcoming altcoin rally.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-market-crash-is-this-your-last-chance-to-buy-xrp-ada-before-trump-takes-charge/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

When the SEC launched its crusade against cryptocurrency, it didn’t expect to face resistance from the federal judiciary itself. The federal judges are challenging the SEC’s aggressive interpretation of old securities laws, which may eventually lead to the Supreme Court getting involved. As we prepare for Paul Atkins to take over from @GaryGensler , a new piece by @JWVerret warns that if the @SECGov doesn't drop the @Ripple case altogether, it's courting judicial suicide https://t.co/RcPPV3EQQr — CryptoLaw (@CryptoLawUS) December 19, 2024 The dispute began with the SEC’s 2020 lawsuit against Ripple Labs, claiming the XRP token was an unregistered security. However, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges were not securities transactions, a decision the SEC is appealing. Judge Jed Rakoff’s Interpretation Could Have Serious Consequences Judge Jed Rakoff took a broader view in the SEC’s case against Terraform Labs, suggesting that crypto tokens could be considered securities no matter how they are sold. This difference in judicial opinions has created legal uncertainty, which may lead to the Supreme Court stepping in. Notably, Judge Rakoff’s interpretation could have serious consequences for the crypto industry. His view of the Howey test suggests that even trades of Luna tokens by people unrelated to Terraform could be considered securities. Lack Of Boundaries Raises Concerns If this reasoning is followed further, even Bitcoin could be considered a security because its developers maintain the network. This could result in a broad expansion of SEC control, affecting everything from precious metals to airline rewards programs. This lack of clear boundaries raises concerns among legal experts and market participants. The SEC’s appeal of the Ripple case could lead to problems, which could usher the Supreme Court to step in. The case could be used to limit the SEC’s power, stopping it from making decisions without clear approval from Congress. SEC’s Approach Could Backfire Coinbase is also battling the SEC, with the court questioning the SEC’s refusal to set clear rules for crypto trading, which could lead to Supreme Court involvement. By using the Howey test too broadly against legitimate crypto companies like Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap without clear rules, the SEC risks limiting this important legal tool through Supreme Court intervention. The SEC’s aggressive approach to cryptocurrency could backfire and harm its own authority. By continuing its appeal in the Ripple case and not providing clear rules, the SEC may prompt the Supreme Court to limit its powers.

The government has granted licenses to four new exchanges under its streamlined regulatory regime. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced on Wednesday that HKbitEX , Accumulus, DFX Labs, and EX.IO have joined the ranks of licensed platforms in the country. This builds on the momentum pioneers OSL, HashKey, and HKVAX set earlier. Hong Kong’s Crypto Push: Fast-Track Licensing Hong Kong launched a licensing framework for virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) in June 2023 to stay ahead in the global crypto race. This allowed licensed exchanges to offer retail trading, signaling the city’s ambition to attract crypto firms and investors. Recently, the SFC introduced a “swift licensing process” to speed up approvals while upholding strict regulatory standards. This involves close collaboration with VATP management, ensuring clear communication of expectations. By working directly with applicants, the SFC helps address issues early, streamlining the approval process. Eric Yip, the SFC’s Executive Director of Intermediaries, emphasized this hands-on approach as key to maintaining compliance and efficiency. Hong Kong Rolled Out A Two-Phase Path to Regulatory Compliance To obtain a license under Hong Kong’s crypto regulatory framework, exchanges must undergo a rigorous two-phase evaluation process. The first phase focuses on foundational aspects of the exchange’s operations. It involves detailed on-site inspections where the regulator examines the platform’s internal policies, procedures, systems, and controls. These include how the exchange manages risks, safeguards client assets, and adheres to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) regulations. A key requirement during this stage is independent validation. A certified public accountant must review and certify the adequacy of the platform’s systems and controls. This ensures transparency and adds a layer of external scrutiny to the process. The second phase is a detailed review led by the SFC, requiring the platform to work closely with external assessors and the regulator. Restrictions on the platform’s operations are lifted only after completing this phase. Hong Kong’s Consultative Panel on the Horizon Hong Kong plans to strengthen its support for the crypto industry by enhancing regulatory collaboration. Joseph Chan, the acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, recently announced the launch of a consultative panel. This panel is scheduled to begin operations early next year. This panel will create a platform for ongoing dialogue between the SFC and licensed crypto trading platforms. This initiative ensures that regulations remain adaptable to the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. This step underscores Hong Kong’s ambition to maintain its position as a global leader in the cryptocurrency space.

As Ethereum continues to evolve, ARB is not just a speculative investment but a practical one too, this being due to the existence of the more profound proof of stake features, that many people would want to take advantage of. Mantle: A DeFi Powerhouse Mantle prices are also rising; up 62% in the last month to $1.26, another altcoin that has caught investors’ eye. Analysts say mantle is one of the most underrated ecosystems in decentralized finance (DeFi). The robust fundamentals and an innovative approach make it their favourite ingredients to see it as one of the top layer 2 tokens to watch out for 2024. I've never seen a DeFi ecosystem as good as Mantle's.

On top of this, Mantle’s underlying technology and community support lend further confidence of its imminent performance. Kaspa (KAS) Poised for 10x Growth: A Hidden Gem in the Altcoin Market At the time of writing, Kaspa is trading in the region of $0.1635, up about 17.46% over the last 30 days. While it’s far less known than some of its counterparts, analysts believe Kaspa will soar, and can even see a tenfold increase in price as soon as it begins to rally. $KAS when it starts running is gonna do a straight 10X Kaspa is the one to watch! pic.twitter.com/r6KFDGiZZa — Bruiser (@bruiserscalls) December 12, 2024 This is reason enough for Kaspa to be included in any of your investor portfolios. Its growing community and distinctive technology make it likely that it will soon play a bigger part in the altcoin world. Algorand (ALGO) Eyes $1: A Stable Yet High-Growth Option for Blockchain Innovators ALGO at $0.42, analysts believe the coin’s price will hit $1 soon. Algorand is one of the more mature cryptocurrencies in the market with stable growth potential. It has a focus on scalability and transaction speed making it a great option for developers that want to develop decentralized applications. Algorand is appealing for investors looking for a balanced risk reward and more investors also to invest as it is very innovative within the blockchain space. Sei (SEI) Set for Breakout: A Strategic Buy as Price Consolidates Near Key Support Levels Another altcoin worth considering is Sei, now trading around $0.60. Sei’s price likely just completed a wave pattern with relevant support level pivots between $0.54 and $0.39, analysts say. Sei’s journey along these price levels provides an opportunity for investors who can recognize entry points along potential dips. $SEI : The price is likely working on a wave-(B).

Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity With the sidling of what a lot of the market thinks will be an explosive altcoin season, selecting undervalued coins like RXS can be essential to optimising investment returns. RXS has performed well in its presale and is anchored in real-world assets making it the prime choice for those who wish to convert a minimum investment into an exorbitant sum of money. While coins such as ARB, Mantle, Kaspa, Algorand, and Sei also provide a strong case to invest in, it may be that RXS is best positioned to lead the pack of the upcoming market cycle. If you’re strategic about allocating your portfolio and pay special attention to RXS, chances are you will be in a great spot to take advantage of those coming opportunities in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency.

The market cap of all meme coins tracked by CoinGecko was down by 12% to $113 billion on Dec. 13. While most meme coins plunged, the sell-off was more pronounced among smaller tokens. Brett ( BRETT ), the biggest meme coin in the Base Blockchain, fell by 11.2% on Thursday and by 23% in the last seven days. Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ), a Solana meme coin that went viral recently, has plunged by 40% in the last seven days. Similarly, Popcat ( POPCAT ), Turbo, and Mog Coin were among the worst-performing cryptocurrencies. The market cap of all Solana meme coins dropped by 15% to $15.5 billion. Meme coins have crashed because of the ongoing performance of Bitcoin. After soaring to a record high of $108,200, Bitcoin fell below $100,000, as we predicted earlier this week. Bitcoin has dropped because of profit-taking and the jitters surrounding the hawkish Federal Reserve. In its last meeting of the year, the bank warned that it will deliver just two cuts in 2024 as it expressed concerns about inflation. You might also like: 2 reasons why Bitcoin and other crypto just crashed Meme coins crashed after Bitcoin fell Meme coins always drop when Bitcoin slips. Their retreat is usually more severe because most of them are held by retail investors riding the bullish wave. This is unlike Bitcoin, which has huge institutional investors like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, and Tesla. Bitcoin ETFs also have over $115 billion in assets. Historically, institutional investors have a longer investment horizon than retail traders. A good example of this selling is in on-chain metrics. According to Nansen, the number of smart money investors in Peanut the Squirrel has dropped to just 35 from last month’s high of almost 100. Peanut the Squirrel smart money movements | Source: Nansen The same trend is happening in Brett, where the number of smart money holders and their balances have dropped in the past few weeks. Brett has about 40 smart money holders, while their balances have fallen to their lowest level in months. Brett token smart money investors | Source: Nansen Will meme coins rebound There is a likelihood that Bitcoins and these meme coins will bounce back for three reasons. First, Bitcoin is still in an uptrend, with this retreat being a breather. Technicals suggest that Bitcoin price will peak at around $122,000 in this bullish cycle. It is not uncommon for Bitcoin to retreat after hitting a key resistance. For example, it went through a prolonged consolidation when it rose to an all-time high in March. Second, historically Bitcoin – and altcoins – do well during the first quarter of the year. Data by CoinGlass shows that the average Bitcoin return in the first quarter is 56%. This makes it the second-best quarter after the fourth quarter, meaning that there are odds that they will bounce back in Q1. Bitcoin performance by quarter: Source: CoinGlass Third, financial assets often overreact when there is a major event and then moderate as traders adjust to the new normal. A good example of this was in March 2020, when stocks and crypto plunged after COVID was declared an emergency. They then bounced back and reached an all-time high.

37847708,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630492,1734627788,Michael Saylor interview with Tom Bilyeu on Impact Theory – Why Bitcoin at $13 million is inevitable,"Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, remains as ambitious as ever. This is despite the fact that he has forfeited his voting rights. During a recent interview on Tom Bilyeu’s Impact Theory, he reaffirmed his assertion from the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville that Bitcoin would ultimately be valued at $13 million. Around the time Michael made this prediction, the asset was trading for $65,000. Now Bitcoin is trading at $104,000, and he is still grounded on that prediction. Saylor told the host, Tom Bilyeu, that his $13 million Bitcoin price target was calculated using the “Bitcoin24” model. Saylor’s main assumption is that Bitcoin will experience a 20% annual growth rate over 21 years. He explained that Bitcoin’s trend for several years has been to increase by 60% annually and have an average rate of return of 29% over the next 21 Years. In addition, Saylor explained that 95% of the world remains in the dark about Bitcoin’s potential. Therefore, he said that with education and adoption by high-net-worth individuals, Bitcoin would definitely reach its target. The MicroStrategy Chief said, “And the thing driving it from $100,000 to $13 million over the next 21 years is the adoption of it as a capital asset by people that have the wealth.” Microstrategy’s humongous purchases confirm Saylor’s convictions In the interview, Saylor said that in six weeks, they had raised $15 billion. This explains why Microstrategy has been buying Bitcoin in huge quantities. If Michael Saylor believes that Bitcoin is going to rise much higher then that shows why they have been buying Bitcoin at $100,000. In fact, between December 9 and December 15, MicroStrategy acquired 15,350 Bitcoins for an estimated $1.5 billion at an average price of $100,386 per BTC. As a result of this most recent acquisition, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings, which are valued at over $45 billion, have increased to 439,000 BTC. The acquisition was funded by the sale of 3,884,712 Class A shares. In totality, MicroStrategy has invested $27.1 billion in Bitcoin to date, with an average purchase price of $61,725 per coin. In addition, Michael Saylor touched on the new administration saying that it is a supportive one. He reminded people that Trump said that no one should sell their Bitcoin. Moreover, MicroStrategy’s shares have increased by 490% year-to-date, surpassing Bitcoin’s growth of approximately 150%. Saylor’s take on Bitcoin as a strategic reserve America and El Salvador have been on the edge of adopting BTC as one of their nations” financial reserves. Saylor mentioned that this could happen during the Donald Trump administration. Recently, legislation was introduced in the Texas House of Representatives to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This reserve is expected to potentially function as a proving ground for the U.S. Treasury. Giovanni Capriglione, a Republican state representative, declared that the proposed legislation would allow the state to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve by collecting taxes, fees, and donations in bitcoin, which would be held for a minimum of five years. Still, Saylor explained that in the next four years under Trump’s administration, Bitcoin is going to go up because of the “crypto renaissance.” When asked about D.O.G.E, he said, “Elon Musk is the number one sponsor of Bitcoin in the magnificent seven.” He explained that Tesla has Bitcoin on the balance sheet of the seven biggest companies. He mentioned that Vivek is also pro-Bitcoin. Saylor said, “What’s going on right now is the emergence of Bitcoin as the digital capital network for the world.” To that end, Saylor said that the US is the leading nation in digital assets, and it would be a great opportunity for it to win against the BRICS.

Bitcoin-friendly nation El Salvador will sunset or sell its Chivo crypto wallet as it scales back Bitcoin ( BTC ) activity as part of terms to secure a $1.4 billion International Monetary Fund loan . Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s national Bitcoin office, said the decision was part of its agreement with the IMF. Notably, Chivo’s fate will not impact BTC laws in the country, and Bitcoin will remain available as legal tender under the IMF deal per Reuters. El Salvador introduced Chivo in August 2021, around the same time it legalized Bitcoin nationally. Chivo served as the sovereign crypto wallet to propel President Bukele’s ambitious BTC agenda. Citizens received BTC rewards for signing up with Chivo at the time, but the crypto wallet suffered several setbacks. Hackers attacked Chivo on at least two occasions, exposing sensitive user data and leaking the wallet’s code in April 2024. You might also like: Bukele on Bitcoin: ‘It gave us branding, investment, and tourism’ El Salvador’s Bitcoin bet Despite Chivo’s likely shutdown, El Salvador remains a pro-BTC powerhouse. Under President Bukele, the country became the first jurisdiction to adopt BTC as legal tender and deploy state funds for Bitcoin purchases. Since September 2021, when it legalized BTC, President Bukele has overseen a $270 million investment into the trillion-dollar asset. El Salvador held over $632 million in BTC at press time, with $362 million in unrealized profits from its Bitcoin bet. BTC’s rise above $100,000 triggered growth in El Salvador’s bond markets, a landmark moment in crypto history. It was the first time BTC price patterns impacted sovereign-issued debt.

Deutsche Bank—Germany’s largest bank—is now leaning on Ethereum’s blockchain to tackle regulatory challenges, a bold step towards bridging traditional finance with decentralized solutions. Meanwhile, Render (RNDR) has caught everyone’s attention, with a big chunk of holders sitting on profits and actively swaying the token’s price action. But perhaps the most exciting headline? Qubetics ($TICS) raising a whopping $7.2 million in its presale, showing it’s not just another token but a serious contender for explosive gains. While Ethereum and Render are tackling specific challenges in finance and creative industries, Qubetics is out to simplify how crypto fits into our daily lives. Let’s dive into why these projects are shaping up as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Everyday Crypto Use Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s a game-changer for how people interact with digital assets. Managing crypto has been, let’s face it, pretty complicated. But with Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet , everything gets easier. Here’s a scenario: imagine a freelance photographer landing a gig with an international client. Typically, waiting for cross-border payments is like watching paint dry. But with Qubetics, payments are instant. The wallet’s smart contract conversion mechanism even converts crypto into fiat at checkout, making the process as seamless as getting paid through PayPal. The standout feature? Its integration with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and desktop systems. Whether you’re buying coffee or settling invoices, Qubetics brings crypto payments to the mainstream. Plus, with built-in protection against the crypto market’s wild swings, transactions stay stable and secure. Right now, Qubetics is in Presale Phase 13, with tokens priced at just $0.0342. Over 10,800 holders have already jumped in, and 359 million $TICS tokens have been sold. The project has raised over $7.2 million, and the next presale phase comes with a 10% price hike, making this the perfect time to invest. With post-presale prices projected to hit $0.25 and a potential 900% ROI, Qubetics has secured its spot as one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Ethereum (ETH): Driving Financial Innovation with Deutsche Bank Ethereum has always been the backbone of decentralized applications, and now, it’s taking on traditional banking. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest financial institution, recently adopted Ethereum’s blockchain to navigate complex regulatory frameworks. This marks a significant milestone in blockchain’s integration with legacy systems. Why does this matter? It proves Ethereum isn’t just about DeFi or NFTs anymore—it’s a solution for global-scale problems. Deutsche Bank’s move validates Ethereum’s robustness and its potential to modernize how big banks operate. Ethereum’s recent upgrades, like the shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), have made it faster and more energy-efficient, cementing its appeal to enterprises. And with gas fees becoming more predictable thanks to Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, Ethereum is more accessible than ever. These developments keep Ethereum in the spotlight as one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Whether you’re in it for its potential to transform industries or its long-term value, ETH is still a solid pick. Render (RNDR): Empowering Digital Creators and Influencing Price Action Render Network has carved out its space by offering decentralized GPU rendering solutions, a lifesaver for digital artists and content creators. But what’s making waves right now? Nearly 60% of RNDR holders are in profit, and this group is actively shaping the token’s price dynamics. Let’s say you’re a game developer working on a new project. Instead of investing in costly hardware, you can tap into Render’s decentralized network to access GPU power. That’s the beauty of Render—it democratizes access to resources that were once out of reach for many creators. On top of that, RNDR’s recent partnerships with major tech companies are setting the stage for a broader adoption. Analysts are even speculating that RNDR could surge to $50-$80, especially if it continues to dominate the rendering space. For anyone looking to diversify their portfolio, Render is one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, offering a unique blend of utility and growth potential. Which Crypto Should You Bet On? The crypto market is always evolving, and 2024 is shaping up to be another breakout year. Qubetics ($TICS) offers groundbreaking solutions to make crypto more user-friendly, with a presale price that screams opportunity. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continues to prove its value as a financial infrastructure powerhouse, with backing from institutions like Deutsche Bank. Lastly, Render (RNDR) is empowering creators and holding its ground as a profitable investment. Based on the latest research, we recommend considering Qubetics ($TICS), Ethereum (ETH), and Render (RNDR) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Each project stands out in its own way, whether it’s simplifying payments, modernizing finance, or empowering creatives.

Crypto influencers, including ClayBro on YouTube, have speculated that the token’s value could double upon its initial listing.

37847492,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26750,1734627600,Debate Rekindled Over Bitcoin’s 21 Million Supply Cap,"The question of whether Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is truly immutable has resurfaced after BlackRock released a three-minute explainer video on Dec. 17. The video included a disclaimer suggesting there’s no guarantee the cap won’t be altered. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is a cornerstone of its value as a store of wealth, and any change could fundamentally impact its perception among investors. In the video, BlackRock highlighted Bitcoin’s 21 million cap, noting it as a “hard-coded rule” that controls supply, purchasing power, and prevents excessive currency creation. However, the disclaimer stated: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor reposted the video, sparking criticism. Joel Valenzuela, Dashpay’s marketing director, commented, “When the supply cap increase happens, it will have ‘always been part of the plan.’ And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say Bitcoin wasn’t hijacked.” Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis added, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Is Bitcoin’s Supply Cap Changeable? Bitcoin developer Super Testnet, known for BitVM, explained that altering Bitcoin’s supply cap would depend on how one defines “Bitcoin.” In theory, the cap could change if a majority of the community—node operators, developers, miners, and investors—reached consensus on a hard fork. Such a change would involve a proposal to gauge consensus, followed by implementing changes in Bitcoin Core. If most node operators and miners adopted the new fork, it would create a “new” Bitcoin network with an uncapped supply. However, Super Testnet argued that this new chain wouldn’t truly be Bitcoin. “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” they said. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” In essence, an uncapped version wouldn’t be Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FORKS,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/debate-rekindled-over-bitcoins-21-million-supply-cap/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

With an active community, token burns, and increasing use cases in DeFi and NFTs, SHIB can grow exponentially. Improved scarcity and practical applications could propel Shiba Inu's value upward as the crypto sector develops and this memecoin might generate long-term gains for investors. 3 Reasons Shiba Inu Could Skyrocket in 2025 Shiba Inu draws attention due to its unique strategies and community-driven growth which make it a possible wealth maker. Here are the top reasons why SHIB might still be a millionaire-maker in the next few years: 1. Massive Burn Rate Increases Shiba Inu scarcity is fueled mainly by a burning mechanism. Within 24 hours, Shiba Inu's burn rate soared 1,987%, wiping over twenty million tokens from circulation. This push was led by the SHIB army, with the largest single burn transaction wiping out more than 11 million SHIB. Although weekly burns are lower than before, the cumulative efforts of the community have already locked over 410 trillion tokens, reducing the supply and increasing the potential for future price growth. 2. Growing Utility in DeFi and NFTs Shiba Inu isn’t just a meme coin—it’s carving a niche in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With its Shibarium layer-2 blockchain, Shiba Inu is gaining real-world use cases, fueling utility, and encouraging adoption. The more activity Shibarium attracts, the more Shiba Inu tokens get burned through gas fees, supporting long-term price growth. 3. Regulatory Clarity and Market Optimism The U.S. crypto market is seeing renewed optimism with clearer regulations expected to drive confidence. Analysts suggest this could benefit meme coins like Shiba Inu, giving them an edge in a maturing market. If Shiba Inu can capitalize on this momentum, hitting new price milestones like $0.0001 could push its market cap into the top 10, making the dream of millionaire investors a reality.

37849565,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321275,1734627437,How XRP Price Crash Was Foretold by Funding Rate But ETF-led Institutional Adoption Will Melt Faces,"The XRP price took one of the biggest tumbles among top altcoins yesterday, falling to as low as $2.16. However, it has recovered somewhat, trading at $2.34, down 13.65% in the past 24 hours. Talk of crypto beginning to decouple from stocks has proved premature but sentiment is still strongly bullish for Ripple’s XRP token. Crypto succumbed to selling pressure yesterday after chair Jerome Powell indicated that the Fed was minded to slow down on rate cuts and would need to see more progress on inflation. Still, stocks are in the green at the time of writing, so there’s a fair chance crypto will make up more lost ground. The drawdown came as a rude awakening for high-flying stocks, especially the Magnificant Seven tech stocks, with Tesla, for instance, down 10% yesterday. An attempt to make a concerted recovery from what is a mild correction by crypto standards began to falter at the beginning of the US session, with bitcoin holding on above $100k. Funding rates in BTC and XRP in decline since December 8th Those who have been watching the BTC and XRP funding rates in the perpetual futures market could be forgiven for saying I told you so. As can be seen in the Glassnode chart below, funding rates for both XRP and bitcoin have been falling since Sunday, December 8. Although still in positive territory, a declining funding rate means weakening near-term confidence in long positions. Traders going long who didn’t heed the warning by taking countervailing measures to hedge their positions, fell victim to what, in hindsight, we can see as inevitable liquidations. Liquidations across crypto were in the region of $804 million, according to Coinglass data. Most of the damage was in BTC and ETH, but XRP, erstwhile third-placed crypto by market cap (it has now slipped back below Tether into fourth place), suffered liquidations of $40 million. As we would expect, most of the $40 million in liquidations were longs. According to Coinalyze there were $27 million longs vs $9.2 million shorts. XRP price predictions – $3, $7, $10, $100 in 2025? Despite the Fed-induced correction, most market watchers expect the XRP price to bounce back and haven’t given up on end-of-year predictions approaching $3. Bulls are encouraged not just by the prospect of a pro-crypto administration in 2025, but also by the adoption progress of Ripple, the issuer of XRP. This week’s launch of RLUSD , the Ripple stablecoin that runs on the same XRP Ledger blockchain as XRP and uses the liquidity token as a bridging currency, was a positive development. Expectations around the stablecoin before and after its approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) on December 10, helped push the XRP price up to $2.71 earlier this month. The stablecoin market is growing, but trust, compliance, and utility are critical. Enter Ripple USD: https://t.co/Nu2yqsAYpj Ripple President @MonicaLongSF explains why Ripple built $RLUSD to set a new benchmark for stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/Rfz0SXQiMx — Ripple (@Ripple) December 18, 2024 However, Antonio Di Giacomo at XS.com is an exception to the generally positive pricing outlook seen by most analysts. He’s wary of calling a swift recovery for bitcoin, and although he sees the next price target for XRP at $3, that is unlikely to happen until next year. In his view, the latest Fed backdrop is decidedly negative for the crypto complex as a whole. “The decline’s impact wasn’t limited to Bitcoin; the broader cryptocurrency market was dragged down by the poor performance. Major altcoins such as Ethereum and Binance Coin also recorded significant losses, while analysts warn of a potentially prolonged period of volatility. “This phenomenon has also raised doubts about the sector’s short-term recovery capabilities, especially given the macroeconomic backdrop.” He adds: “Although bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable recovery capability in the past, experts suggest that current conditions could hinder a swift rebound. Opinions remain divided: some see this downturn as a buying opportunity, while others warn of further potential declines.” XRP price $5 to $7 range in first half of 2025 Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BinPay, arguably with skin in the game, remains strongly bullish: “XRP could reach a price range of $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025.” Meanwhile, Bitget Research’s Ryan Lee posits a wide range of price options, insisting that both adoption and regulatory developments are wild cards that could be particularly impactful on XRP’s price direction. “Looking ahead to 2025, XRP’s price projections range broadly, with an average forecast between $1.8 and $8.4, and some optimistic scenarios suggesting peaks above $10,” said Lee. On the perhaps more outlandish side, predictions going into multiples of $100 for the XRP price have been reported.

37849045,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52580,1734627399,Shiba Inu Lead Dev Addresses Complaints About SHIB Price,"The Shifu token, a new meme coin, has sparked some controversy and curiosity within the Shiba Inu community, particularly regarding its connection to Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and its choice of launch platform. The meme coin recently completed its presale but has not yet launched on Shibarium. The Shifu meme coin comes from a collaboration between Shiba Inu and the blockchain platform Imaginary Ones. It was announced in early December that 30% of the supply will be airdropped to holders of SHIB, BUBBLE, LEASH, and the IO NFT. However, the delayed launch of Shifu on Shibarium has raised questions about its integration with Shiba Inu’s broader ecosystem, especially given the apparent excitement shown by Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, and other prominent figures in the ecosystem like Kaal Dhairya and Lucie. Questions About Shifu’s Role in the Ecosystem A community member raised concerns on X, questioning why Shifu wasn’t launching on Shibarium yet, despite endorsements from Kusama, Dhairya, and Lucie. The user also wondered if the profits generated from Shifu would contribute to Shiba Inu’s token burn initiatives or benefit the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The community member noted that this inquiry was a genuine request for clarification, not an attempt to spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). In response, Kusama addressed these concerns, explaining that Shifu is “literally a token by a legit project” that plans to airdrop the majority of its supply to holders of Shiba Inu’s SHIB, LEASH, and BONE. Kusama emphasized that the token could be integrated with Shibarium in the future, along with other collaborative efforts. His reply highlighted that the community’s skepticism might be rooted in misunderstandings about the project’s intentions and the team’s commitment to the success of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Shiba Inu developer further noted that despite any initial confusion or frustration, the team was offering “FREE tokens” to those involved, stating that their effort was to benefit the community. Kusama’s response suggests that while Shifu’s release and strategy may not have been clear to all community members, the team was confident in the project’s long-term potential and purpose. Kusama Addresses Complaints About SHIB Price The Shiba Inu lead developer also addressed complaints about the SHIB price. He wrote, “ And for those saying token go down you have no clue how hard we’ve worked for the success of EVERYTHING Shib. But it’s fine, you will soon get it. Until then, enjoy FREE tokens. ” It is literally a token by a legit project that wants to airdrop the majority of the supply to Shib Leash AND Bone. The token can then be ported to Shibarium and much more as we work with them. Why compliants sers? And for those saying token go down you have no clue how hard… — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) December 18, 2024 The original poster responded courteously, acknowledging Kusama’s explanation and expressing support for the Shiba Inu team. He reiterated that the inquiry was not a complaint but a genuine question. The user also suggested that the Shiba Inu community might have responded more positively if Shifu had launched directly on Shibarium. However, reports suggest that the meme coin will launch on Shibarium and the Ethereum blockchain, and there have been no conflicting reports at press time.

Both crypto and stock markets reacted sharply to the Federal Reserve’s revised 2025 outlook, which hinted at fewer rate cuts and higher inflation expectations. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell below $100,000, and liquidations surged to approximately $850 million within just 24 hours, reflecting heightened investor concerns. Amid this growing uncertainty, investors are increasingly turning to altcoins as a way to diversify their portfolios and tap into potential growth. With 2025 on the horizon, Finbold analyzed market trends and consulted ChatGPT-4o to spotlight two altcoins with significant growth potential. ChatGPT identifies 2 altcoins for 2025 portfolio When queried, the AI model highlighted XRP and Hedera ( HBAR ) as standout assets, offering promising opportunities for building a diversified and resilient portfolio in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. Hedera (HBAR) ChatGPT projected HBAR as a key player in the digital asset space, citing its partnerships and ecosystem expansions. One notable development is its integration with Chainlink’s ( LINK ) decentralized oracles, which brings Chainlink’s data feeds and Proof of Reserve mechanisms to Hedera. This collaboration enhances the infrastructure for decentralized finance ( DeFi ) applications by providing developers with tamper-proof market data. ChatGPT observed that this integration reduces risks like data manipulation and strengthens liquidity in DeFi markets. ChatGPT outlook on HBAR. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold The AI also pointed to Hedera’s partnership with RedSwan CRE, a commercial real estate tokenization platform, as a critical driver of HBAR’s adoption. By enabling access to tokenized real estate, this collaboration is expected to drive HBAR’s adoption and utility among investors. The tool also emphasized the growing optimism surrounding cryptocurrency ETFs . Analysts suggest Hedera could secure ETF approval, particularly with the potential appointment of pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. Hedera’s classification outside the realm of securities positions it as a strong contender for regulatory approval. Hedera (HBAR) one-day price chart. Source: Finbold At press time, HBAR is trading at $0.29, reflecting a one-day loss of 1.4% but a notable one-month gain of 110%. XRP The artificial intelligence model pointed to Ripple Labs ’ recent developments as critical for XRP’s potential growth. The approval of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, expands its ecosystem and utility, making it an attractive choice for both institutional and retail investors. Regulatory optimism also boosts XRP’s outlook. The potential replacement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler with Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto figure, could lead to the dismissal of the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, removing a major regulatory hurdle.

37847186,https://crypto.news/?p=14320809,1734627082,Solana price forms a rare pattern: will it go beast mode soon?,"Solana price has moved into a technical bear market as the crypto sell-off intensifies after the hawkish Federal Reserve decision. Solana ( SOL ), the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency, dropped to the psychologically important support at $200. Technicals point to a Solana price comeback The daily chart shows that SOL price has formed a few bullish chart patterns, pointing to a rebound in the next few days. First, the coin is forming a falling wedge chart pattern, which is made up of two falling and converging trendlines. In most periods, this pattern leads to a strong bullish breakout when the two lines near their confluence level. Second, Solana price has formed a break and retest pattern by moving to the support at $203. A break and retest is a situation where an asset rises above a key resistance and then retests it. It is a popular sign of a continuation. In this case, $203 was a notable level since it was near the highest level in March this year. It was also along the inverse head and shoulders pattern. Third, Solana remains above the 100-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages and the major support and resistance level of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the SOL coin will bounce back and enter beast mode soon. If this happens, the initial point to watch will be at $263, its highest swing last month. A break above that level will point to more gains to $300 .

The network has become a big threat to Ethereum ( ETH ) by attracting developers and users. According to TokenTerminal , Solana had over 5.1 million users in the last 24 hours, much higher than Ethereum’s 441,000 and Tron’s 2.4 million. Solana has also generated substantial fees this year. It has made over $700 million in fees this year as its ecosystem has boomed. Solana’s fees are much lower than Ethereum’s $2.42 billion because it is known for having much lower fees. Additionally, Solana has become a dominant player in the meme coin industry, where its ecosystem tokens have accumulated a market cap of over $20 billion. It also has a big share in the Decentralized Public Infrastructure industry through platforms like Helium ( HNT ) and Hivemapper. Most importantly, there are rising hopes that the next Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Solana ETF. Gary Gensler’s SEC rejected such an ETF because it viewed SOL as a security. Paul Atkins may decide to approve mainstream coins.

42388882,1fd837e9-ff61-4f3a-8f76-17acfedeedaa,1734626994,Bitcoin in Bhutan: Charting Its Own Course of Economic Development,"As nations explore the implications of digital currencies, Bitcoin is becoming part of national strategies. El Salvador made headlines as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, while the United States is considering a national Bitcoin reserve. Even China, despite its cautious stance on cryptocurrency, has embraced blockchain technology to support its digital yuan. Amid these changes, Bhutan stands out — not by following global trends, but by charting its own path.  Nestled in the Himalayas between China and India, Bhutan has long defied conventional economic models. Instead of prioritizing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the country measures success using Gross National Happiness (GNH), focusing on the well-being of its citizens. Under the leadership of King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, Bhutan is now integrating blockchain and Bitcoin into its vision for sustainable development. Projects like the creation of a ""Mindfulness City"" in Gelephu highlight Bhutan's approach to merging technology, culture, and sustainability.  I have been fortunate to visit Bhutan twice in recent years, and from the moment I first arrived, I felt an unshakable connection to the country. During my visit to Bhutan’s tech park in Thimphu, I engaged in several conversations about the “Mindfulness City” initiative and learned about bitcoin mining in Bhutan. While the country has been discreet about its Bitcoin mining operations, its growing interest in the field is undeniable. Bhutan is not only preserving its rich traditions but also boldly embracing emerging technologies as tools to advance its unique development philosophy.  Bitcoin Mining: A Quiet Revolution in the Himalayas  Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), Bhutan’s investment arm, and Green Digital Limited (GDL) began Bitcoin mining when prices were around $5,000. Today, Bhutan’s Bitcoin reserves exceed $1 billion, making it one of the largest sovereign holders of digital assets, according to Bitwise Europe. As of 2023, these holdings represent approximately 34.48% of the country's $2.9 billion GDP, according to World Bank data. This reflects Bhutan’s strategic use of cryptocurrency as an economic asset.  Bhutan is expanding its mining infrastructure through a phased development pipeline with Bitdeer Technologies Group. The first phase, with a capacity of 100 megawatts, is already operational. A second phase aims to add 500 megawatts by mid-2025. The project is powered by Bhutan's abundant hydropower resources, ensuring mining is both sustainable and efficient. The $500 million fund established in May 2023 with Bitdeer underscores Bhutan’s focus on attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and strengthening its position in the global Bitcoin mining landscape.  The construction of a 100-megawatt crypto-mining data center in Gedu was Bhutan’s first large-scale Bitcoin mining venture. It uses the country's hydroelectric power to mine bitcoin in an environmentally responsible way. The facility currently houses 30,000 mining machines, which likely produce three to five bitcoins daily, generating daily revenue of $317,400 to $529,000 at today’s prices. This strategic approach allows Bhutan to generate steady income from bitcoin mining while mitigating market volatility. The project also creates local jobs, contributing to the country’s broader economic transformation.  Mindfulness City: A Blueprint for the Future  The ""Mindfulness City"" in Gelephu is less a traditional city and more a transformative development project aimed at fulfilling Bhutan’s long-term vision. In his National Day speech on December 17, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, highlighted the project's goal to create opportunities for Bhutanese youth, encouraging them to remain in the country rather than seek opportunities abroad. ""Balancing economic growth with the preservation of Bhutan’s natural beauty, culture, and values is crucial,"" the King stated.  Covering over 2,500 km², Mindfulness City is designed to integrate sustainable development with modern technologies, including blockchain and artificial intelligence. Gelephu’s location, at the crossroads of South Asia and Southeast Asia, makes it a strategic hub for economic activity. As a Special Administrative Region (SAR), the city aims to attract both domestic and international investment with a business-friendly environment.  The project will focus on seven key sectors: agritech, finance, education, green energy, health, high-tech, and spirituality. By diversifying its economy, Bhutan seeks to combine technological progress with its cultural values. A recent development within this framework is the application by Matrixport, a global crypto financial services company, for a Financial Services Permission License to operate in Mindfulness City. Matrixport is the first company to apply under the city’s new regulatory framework for financial services and virtual assets. This move highlights Bhutan's interest in building a regulated environment for digital assets and blockchain, reinforcing its strategy to attract global players while maintaining its commitment to sustainable and culturally mindful development.  Happiness as an Economic Paradigm  Bhutan’s focus on happiness challenges traditional economic models. The GNH framework, introduced in the 1970s, measures national success through health, education, community vitality, and environmental stewardship. This holistic approach complements blockchain's potential to create fairer, more transparent systems.  Blockchain technology can support Bhutan’s GNH goals by enhancing accountability in public projects and ensuring the fair distribution of resources. For example, Bhutan repurposed its “Education City” into a Bitcoin mining hub, illustrating how technology can meet local needs while contributing to global innovation.  Bhutan’s experience demonstrates how small nations can leverage their strengths to lead in emerging technologies. With a population of just 700,000, Bhutan can quickly implement policies and adapt to changes. The country’s use of hydropower for Bitcoin mining sets a global example of environmentally responsible practices in the cryptocurrency industry. This approach reduces mining’s carbon footprint while aligning with Bhutan’s commitment to environmental preservation.  As Bhutan advances its development strategy, the King’s vision offers a clear path forward, blending tradition with modernity. The ""Mindfulness City"" represents Bhutan’s goal to create a thriving society where technology serves the nation’s people and its unique cultural values.  For the global community, Bhutan’s adoption of blockchain and Bitcoin presents an alternative view of success — one that prioritizes well-being over profit. In a world of rapid technological change, Bhutan shows how technology can promote sustainable growth while preserving cultural identity. This innovative approach proves that even small nations can lead by example, demonstrating how technology can benefit humanity rather than divide it.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Paola Origel ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/19/bitcoin-in-bhutan-charting-its-own-course-of-economic-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f2ad79e5541816de1705b290004fef3d66dab10-4068x2288.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37849564,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321283,1734626969,The Digital Chamber Urges SEC To ‘Reset’ Relations With Crypto Sector Ahead Of 2025,"The Digital Chamber is urging the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to “reset” its relationship with the digital asset ahead of Donald Trump’s presidency following years of controversial crypto regulation under chair Gary Gensler, a December 18 statement from the crypto advocacy group shows. The Digital Chamber Pushes For SEC Reset According to The Digital Chamber’s Wednesday update , the crypto sector “has the opportunity to reset its historically troubled relationship with the global digital asset industry” as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the Oval Office. The @SECGov has the opportunity to reset its historically troubled relationship with the #DigitalAsset industry. This week, members of TDC's Token Alliance Leadership Committee presented our 2025 SEC Digital Asset Policy Priorities to SEC staff. More: https://t.co/r0qg7lfjmm — The Digital Chamber (@DigitalChamber) December 18, 2024 In its latest statement, the pro-blockchain collective argues that Trump’s predilection for crypto–friendly policies may “launch an era of transparency, cooperation, and well-reasoned regulation to bring much-needed clarity to digital asset market participants.” “We need to foster a culture of mutual trust – where the digital asset industry can have confidence in the SEC’s intentions, and the SEC can recognize that most digital asset participants are striving to operate responsibly,” the statement continues. The Digital Chamber notes that members of its Token Alliance Leadership Committee met with current SEC commissioners Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce to present their 2025 SEC Digital Asset Policy Priorities, including how the incoming administration can most effectively address crypto concerns in Trump’s first 90 days in office. Th cryptocurrency group seemingly further slammed current members of the regulatory commission and its controversial staff accounting bulletin known as SAB121, saying it’s time “to clear the decks of outdated and confusing former director and staff level speeches, letters and other informal and non-binding ‘guidance’ that make it nearly impossible for current market participants to understand how to comply with the SEC’s rules and regulations.” Gary Gensler’s Regulation-By-Enforcement Approach To Crypto News of The Digital Chamber’s latest update comes amid growing anticipation of a crypto-friendly regulatory framework under Trump. The former reality television, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, previously vowed to fire Gensler for his stringent approach to digital asset regulation in the United States. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Gensler, who has since announced his resignation, is expected to be replaced with crypto-friendly former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins – though it remains to be seen just how the federal regulator will evolve in the years ahead.

Both smart money investors and retailers are among the early buyers, which has pushed SOLX’s presale total past the $1 million mark in less than a week. Solaxy presents a cutting-edge idea - using the roll-up architecture to tackle the growing network congestion on Solana and offer improved throughput and scalability ahead of the upcoming meme coin mania. The ambitious project has impressed prominent crypto influencers, with many calling it the next 10x crypto. Coinbase Sounds Alarm On Solana’s Network Congestion The leading US-based crypto exchange Coinbase has raised serious issues regarding the Solana ecosystem. Prominent NFT trader Bangerz noticed that the exchange showed a 45-minute wait time for Solana transactions. In response to her complaints on X, Coinase Support responded that the delay could be due to wallet maintenance or blockchain issues. We understand your Solana transactions are experiencing delays, which can be due to wallet maintenance or blockchain issues.Our team is aware and working on a fix, but we don't have an estimated resolution time. (1/2)^GS — Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) November 28, 2024 Coinbase in-app customer service agents have also privately communicated that Solana is slow, a stark difference from the chain’s public marketing. my usdc sol deposit has been pending for 3 days“SOL is also slow on its own” https://t.co/lzChKMNleZ pic.twitter.com/IOm4I8IZga — saori (@saori_xbt) November 28, 2024 This isn’t a one-off issue. Back in March and April of this year, Solana’s blockchain was seeing extremely high congestion, with a failure rate of 50%-80% and 20s-40s Average Ping Time, crypto analyst Dagnum P.I. revealed . While Solana fixed the issue back then, Research Partner at 1KX Wei Dai believes that the blockchain’s tech could see extreme congestion in the coming meme coin supercycle, resulting in a mass exodus of apps and users from the ecosystem. In this regard, Solaxy’s Layer-2 rollup architecture could prove to be a game-changer in the coming months. Solaxy - The First-Ever Solana L2 Rollup Solaxy’s rollup architecture promises an excellent user experience for investors and app developers alike. Much like its Ethereum counterparts, this L2 chain will batch Solana L1 transactions into bundles, process them off-chain and publish them back onto Layer-1 for finality. The approach significantly increases the network throughput, reduces the burden on the Solana Layer-1 and could potentially deliver extremely fast and cheap transactions on both chains. Meanwhile, app developers can benefit from Solaxy’s modular architecture, create tailored apps and deliver peak performances. This new chain could particularly play a key role in making sure that Solana remains the hotbed for meme coin and NFT activity in the 2025 risk-assets supercycle. Read Solaxy’s whitepaper for more on its next-gen features. Is SOLX The Next 10x Crypto? Solaxy’s native cryptocurrency, SOLX, promises excellent scalability and cheap transactions while also benefitting from Ethereum’s liquidity and security, thanks to its multi-chain nature. It also means that the new token could see heavy investments from both SOL and ETH holders alike, raising its long-term ceiling. As such, SOLX has appealed to retailers and smart money investors alike. For instance, savvy investors are impressed with its community-centric tokenomics, considering there is no separate allocation for the developer team or any private sale, which significantly reduces the risk of a rug-pull. Similarly, Solaxy’s native staking platform has appealed to retail investors, considering it is currently offering a reward rate of just under 1200% per annum. 25% of the total SOLX supply has been set aside for staking and community rewards. A transparent roadmap, multiple security audits and popular X and Telegram accounts all indicate a strong possibility of explosive returns for SOLX. It is, therefore, no surprise that prominent crypto influencers are already calling Solaxy the next 10x crypto. Interested buyers can visit the SOLX presale at solaxy.io and buy the token with just a few clicks, either through a bank card or by swapping crypto.

37847397,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630480,1734626626,Russia says almost all trade with India and China is now in national currencies,"Russia has confirmed it’s still ditching the dollar for good in its trade with two of its biggest partners, China and India. President Vlad Putin says over 90% of its trade with China is now settled in national currencies—primarily rubles and yuan—while more than 50% of trade with India also bypasses the dollar entirely. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the West responded with sanctions that targeted nearly every aspect of its economy, including blocking access to global payment systems like SWIFT. Faced with a financial lockdown, Moscow began pushing aggressively for trade in local currencies, turning to allies like China and India to create alternative economic pathways. Rubles, yuan, and the death of dollar Russia’s trade with China has skyrocketed over the past two years, with both countries leaning into what they call a “strategic partnership.” By 2023, bilateral trade between the two nations hit a record-breaking $240 billion, and economists predict the figure will climb even higher by the end of 2024. What’s different now is that most of this trade—over 90%—is handled in rubles and yuan. The numbers don’t lie. The share of yuan in Russian exports to China jumped from a laughable 0.5% in 2021 to a shocking 16% by 2022. Imports tell the same story, with yuan use rising from just 4% in 2021 to 23% a year later. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar’s dominance is fading fast. Back in 2021, nearly half (46.8%) of Russia-China trade was conducted in dollars. By the end of 2023, that figure had plummeted as the yuan replaced it as the go-to currency. Even Russian banks are piling on the yuan. By December 2023, Russian banks held $68.7 billion worth of yuan, overtaking dollar reserves, which had dropped to $64.7 billion. India plays along, but it’s slower When it comes to India, the transition is slower. Over 50% of trade between the two nations is now conducted in local currencies, showing that the appetite for dollar alternatives isn’t just a Russia-China phenomenon. India, which buys a lot of Russian oil and defense equipment, has been exploring similar currency arrangements as part of its trade deals. This is part of a larger “de-dollarization” strategy that President Putin has been pushing for years. Speaking at a recent summit of BRICS nations, he said, “The dollar has discredited itself. It has become a tool for Western political agendas.” While Trump has a perceived friendship with Putin, there has been some tension lately between them, thanks to the former’s aggressive threats at BRICS nations. He told them to expect 100% tariffs if they do follow through with dethroning the dollar. This was even after Putin himself said he was reconsidering as a favor to his friend. Still, Putin has said that he is willing to have a chat with Trump post-inauguration. In his words, “ I don’t know when we’ll meet because he doesn’t say anything about it. I haven’t spoken to him at all for more than four years. I’m ready for it, of course, at any time. And I’ll be ready to meet if he wants. ” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/russia-trade-india-china-national-currencies/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37847397.jpeg

This announcement comes just a day after the country signed a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), forcing the government to scale back its BTC policies. Country’s National Office Director Claims Bitcoin Purchases Will Accelerate Stacy Herbert, Director of the National Bitcoin Office, stated that Bitcoin will remain the official currency in El Salvador and that the government will continue to purchase BTC for its strategic reserves. She hinted that BTC purchases will accelerate despite the wallet changes.

In 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as its official currency, a move backed by President Nayib Bukele. But the IMF has long opposed Bukele’s pro-crypto stance and warned that such policies could make financial aid more difficult. Despite the criticism, Bukele celebrated Bitcoin’s recent rally, particularly following Donald Trump’s election victory in early November.

37847534,https://invezz.com/?p=2396273,1734626000,"Crypto hacking losses hit $2.2 billion in 2024, a new report says","The cryptocurrency world, while experiencing a surge in mainstream adoption and market value, is also grappling with a stark reality: a significant increase in losses due to hacking. A new report from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis reveals that funds stolen from crypto platforms jumped to a staggering $2.2 billion in 2024, a 21% increase from the previous year. This alarming rise underscores the persistent vulnerabilities within the digital asset space and the sophisticated tactics employed by cybercriminals. Crypto hacks exceed $1 billion for fourth straight year This year marks the fourth consecutive year in which losses from crypto hacks have surpassed the $1 billion mark, solidifying a troubling trend in the industry. The number of hacking incidents also rose to 303 in 2024, up from 282 in 2023. In total, hackers stole $1.8 billion in 2023. The increase in the volume and frequency of these heists indicates the need for improved security protocols and robust countermeasures. Bitcoin’s rise and the dark side of growth The jump in crypto hacking comes as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) experienced a remarkable surge, climbing 140% this year to exceed $100,000, attracting greater institutional participation and even support from US President-elect Donald Trump. As Eric Jardine, Chainalysis’ cybercrimes research lead, notes, “As the digital asset market booms, it is typical to see the illicit use of crypto grow in tandem.” This correlation presents a major hurdle for the industry, highlighting the challenge of safeguarding digital assets amidst rapid expansion. Jardine further suggests that “Countering the proliferation of these crimes — especially fraud — will undoubtedly be a key challenge for the industry in the new year.” Private key compromises The Chainalysis report indicates that compromises to private keys, which control access to users’ assets, accounted for the majority of stolen crypto this year. Most of these attacks targeted centralized platforms, highlighting the risks associated with these types of exchanges. Some of the most notable incidents included the theft of over $305 million from Japan’s crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin in May, and the loss of $235 million from India’s WazirX in July. These heists underscore the significant vulnerabilities present within the current infrastructure. North Korea’s growing role in crypto hacking The report also highlights the troubling trend of cryptocurrency hacking linked to North Korea, which more than doubled from the previous year to a record high of $1.3 billion in 2024. This represents a significant portion of the total losses, highlighting the geopolitical implications of these cybercrimes. The United Nations has stated that cryptocurrency allows North Korea to circumvent international sanctions. While North Korea routinely denies any involvement in cyber hacking or crypto heists, the data indicates a clear link between the country and illicit crypto activities.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

37846669,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375371,1734625941,Here’s How Shibarium Has Impacted the Shiba Inu Ecosystem,"TL;DR Shibarium has burned $1.5M worth of SHIB and enabled low-cost transactions, boosting ecosystem development. Despite the protocol’s advancement, SHIB dropped 25% in two weeks amid an overall decline in the meme coin sector. Shibarium’s Help Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution officially saw the light of day in August last year. While its ultimate goal is to foster the development of the entire SHIB ecosystem, LUCIE (a prominent member of the meme coin’s team ) recently shed more details on the matter. They claimed that Shibarium has already “made a big impact” for Shiba Inu by destroying tokens worth over $1.5 million, thus “directly reducing the circulating supply and adding scarcity.” The protocol embraced the burning mechanism this summer. LUCIE added that the L2 blockchain solution has enabled low-cost transactions, “allowing trades for pennies” and making the meme coin more accessible and practical for everyday use. Lastly, they claimed that Shibarium has built the foundation for future utilities, such as staking and governance systems, which could further strengthen the ecosystem. “Most importantly, Shibarium has solidified $ SHIB’s reputation as one of the strongest assets in crypto. The recognition SHIB has received, even from Forbes, wasn’t achieved by social media hype , but through the efforts of a dedicated development team that built Shibarium and delivered real progress for the ecosystem,” her statement reads. SHIB Price Outlook Shibarium has indeed witnessed serious progress during its relatively short existence. Data shows the network has processed over 675 million transactions, while wallet addresses recently crossed the 2 million milestone. The further advancement of the protocol is touted as one of the major factors that could fuel a Shiba Inu rally. However, the self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer has performed quite poorly in the past two weeks, plummeting by 25%. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Its downtrend coincides with the overall correction of the cryptocurrency market and a bloodbath that has spread across the meme coin niche. Popular assets that have charted double-digit losses in the last 24 hours include Pepe (PEPE), Bonk Inu (BONK), Floki Inu (FLOKI), Popcat (POPCAT), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and many more.

37849563,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321149,1734625903,WIF Price Nosedives 16.5% – Is Dogwifhat Heading Straight to Zero?,"The price of Dogfwifhat dropped by 16.5% in the past 24 hours and accumulates a 25% decline in the past 7 days as the tailwind provided by its recent listing on Coinbase appears to be fading. Aside from the overall positive sentiment that Donald Trump’s victory prompted among market participants, WIF saw its price skyrocket from $1.92 to as much as $4.83 per coin on 13 November after the crypto exchange announced that it would make the meme coin available to users within its platform. However, the price has been progressively declining since that peak as it has shed nearly 45% of its value. This performance is consistent with the overall behavior of meme coins recently, although WIF shows the second sharpest decline in the past 7 days among the top 10 meme coins according to data from CoinMarketCap. Other well-established names in the meme space like Dogecoin (DOGE) , Bonk (BONK), and PEPE, have also seen double-digit drops of 11.5%, 20.4%, and 20.6% respectively during this same period. Although the price is dropping, the number of WIF holders appears to be increasing, meaning that there’s still interest out there for the meme coin, especially now that its price has declined. According to data from CoinCarp , the number of WIF holders has increased from nearly 189,000 to over 207,000 addresses. Deposits for $WIF are now open on https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS ! Trading on the WIF/USDT pair will begin on December 11 at 6 a.m. EST. @dogwifcoin is literally just a dog wif a hat. Read more: https://t.co/DSouXgFuAs pic.twitter.com/pJ795gb3Mh — Binance.US (@BinanceUS) December 10, 2024 Despite the turmoil, the project shared positive news recently as Binance.US started to receive WIF deposits on December 11. This goes to show the platform’s support for Dogwifhat and its growing community of followers. WIF Still Hasn’t Touch Key Support Areas Despite its short-term weakness, WIF has still delivered remarkable gains of nearly 1,400% so far this year. This shows the support of a growing fan base that believes in the project’s ethos and simplicity. From a technical standpoint, the price is currently touching a critical trendline support. How this resolves in the near future may provide further indication of where the price of WIF could be headed in the short term. A break below this area would leave the $1.86 horizontal support as the sole barrier that could prevent a full-blown collapse of the meme coin to the low-to-mid $1 range. However, a rebound off the trend line would indicate that there is still demand for the asset and that buyers are taking advantage of this lower price to either open new long positions or expand their current exposure to WIF. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching oversold levels at the moment after coming out of overbought territory back in mid-November. This latest decline is not necessarily unexpected for WIF considering the significant gains that the token has experienced in 2024. The overall macroeconomic landscape is favorable to the token’s performance still, which means that any short-term weakness at this point can be interpreted as a normal pullback rather than a full-blown change in the prevailing upward trend. This Solana Layer-Two Project Still Has Significant Upside to Offer The positive performance of WIF this year is not a rarity among Solana-based tokens as this blockchain has already demonstrated its ability to overshadow Ethereum amid its efficient functioning and low cost. However, as the network continues to grow and attract a higher number of developers and Web 3 entrepreneurs, it may experience some congestion along the way. To solve that potential obstacle to success, a new project called Solaxy has emerged as a suitable solution to guarantee that the Solana blockchain can continue to scale up reliably. The native token of this layer-two protocol, $SOLX, is currently available in presale and it has already raised $2.9 million from investors across the globe who believe that this kind of protocol can attract significant interest from the Solana community. The rise of meme coins and other similar Solana-based tokens will at some point put the network’s capacity to execute and settle transactions rapidly and cheaply to the test. Solaxy comes to serve as an ally to Solana’s continued success through off-chain processing and transaction bundling mechanisms. The presale of $SOLX ends in less than 36 hours and you still have the chance to buy the first tokens that will ever be available for this innovative L2 at an entry price of $0.00157. To buy your first $SOLX, you simply have to visit the project’s website , and connect your wallet (i.e. Best Wallet) or you can also use a bank card. Crypto holders can convert their ETH, USDT, or BNB tokens to $SOLX to take advantage of this presale.

Solana fluctuates Over the past six months, Solana has surged by 62.92%. In contrast, the last month saw a decline of 8.33%, showing some volatility. This past week, there’s been a modest gain of 1.81%. The current price ranges between $205.85 and $239.87, nearing key support and resistance levels. The nearest support level is $187.60. If the price falls below this, it might drop to the second support at $153.58, a decrease of about 25%. On the upside, the nearest resistance is at $255.64. Breaking above this could send the price to $289.66, roughly 21% higher than now. Technical indicators are mixed. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $216.40 and $219.50. The RSI is at 47.04, indicating neutral conditions. The MACD is -1.256, and the Stochastic is 31.02, hinting at slight bearish momentum. Based on this data, Solana may experience mild downward pressure but could find support and potentially rebound. XRP continues to surge Over the past month, XRP has experienced a significant surge, with its price increasing by 134.53%. Currently trading in the range of $2.03 to $2.73, the cryptocurrency has maintained upward momentum. In the last week alone, the price has risen by 4.22%, reflecting growing interest and investment. The coin’s impressive performance extends over the past six months, boasting a remarkable 406.22% increase. Technical indicators show that the simple moving averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $2.52 and $2.47 respectively, suggesting potential stability. The Relative Strength Index stands at 38.90, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 24.40, which may indicate that XRP is approaching oversold territory. Looking ahead, XRP faces a nearest resistance level at $3.02. If it breaks through, the next target could be $3.73. Achieving the first resistance would mean an increase of approximately 10% from the current upper price range. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $1.61, and falling to this point would represent a decrease of about 20% from the current lower price range. Traders are watching these levels closely to gauge XRP’s next move. Conclusion Though SOL and XRP highlight bullish trends, XYZVerse aims to surpass them by 2025 with its unique sports memecoin.

37846468,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105735,1734625458,Experts Weigh in on XRP Need to Hold Above $2 for Bull Run to Continue,"Experts weigh in on XRP price action, highlighting the importance of holding support around $2 for a continued bull run. XRP has not been spared from the significant bearish pressure that swept through the crypto market last night. The token, which was trading at $2.58, plummeted by 15% to $2.18 during the downturn.This development has sparked fresh commentary from analysts about XRP's next move. Casi Trade, a prominent analyst, provided a detailed update on XRP’s precarious position. According to her analysis, XRP has broken through key support levels and is now holding just above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. This has led to a reevaluation of wave counts and a broader look at the market structure.Key Scenarios for XRP TrajectoryCasi outlined two potential scenarios for XRP’s current movement. The first is an ABC correction (Wave 2 of a new trend), in which XRP could find support near the trendline, in line with the current market structure. Alternatively, XRP might extend its bearish movement and break below the trendline. XRP chart by Casi Trades However, both scenarios hinge on XRP’s ability to hold key support levels, particularly the $1.90–$2.00 range, which aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. Casi noted that, in either case, XRP is unlikely to break below this zone, offering some hope for the bulls.Essentially, if XRP fails to hold above the $2 range, it could test even lower levels. However, a rebound from the current trendline could set the stage for a potential recovery.At press time, XRP is recovering from yesterday’s sharp price decline, now trading at $2.37. Nonetheless, it still shows a 6.21% decline over the past 24 hours.XRP ""Springboard"" to New ATH from $2Meanwhile, other market watchers have expressed a similar sentiment regarding XRP's price movement around the crucial $2 level.In a tweet , market commentator Chad Steingraber suggested that a ""double tap"" at $2 would serve as a ""springboard"" for XRP to reach new all-time highs. He believes the token is on an upward trajectory, and nothing can hold it back.XRP Outlook Remains Promising if Bulls Defend $2Meanwhile, XRP critic IncomeSharks also weighed in on the coin's potential price movement. He noted that if XRP bulls can defend the supertrend level around $2 and establish a bullish consolidation pattern, it would present a compelling reason to buy XRP again.However, the analyst criticized the initial large daily candles, calling them FOMO-driven moves that often fail to attract sustained buying pressure. He concluded that if the green line holds, it would be a more rational entry point for potential buyers.

It showed that, like in most recent quarters, the Jensen Huang -led venture saw meteoric growth and expansion. However, the markets were not satisfied. Nvidia stock has been on a pretty lengthy and strong rally for two years now — and after such impressive capital appreciation, it becomes increasingly hard to impress investors , who cannot be blamed for locking in their profits. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, NVDA stock has seen prices increase by 163.07% to $130.28 at press time. NVDA stock price YTD chart. Source: Finbold In tandem with these events, as the United States presidential elections were concluded in early November, the cryptocurrency market entered a bull run. While leading digital assets saw huge gains, altcoins and, in particular, meme coins , are the biggest winners of this surge thus far. The disparity between the returns of even the strongest equities and humorous cryptocurrencies can be quite staggering. Case in point — over the last 30 days, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) has outperformed Nvidia’s yearly returns — and the gains aren’t even particularly close. Let’s take a closer look at how a bit of blue humor blew away the linchpin of the artificial intelligence revolution. Fartcoin’s 275% monthly returns blow away Nvidia’s 163% YTD gains FARTCOIN was actually conceived by Truth Terminal , an artificial intelligence model. Inspired by the AI’s output, enterprising developers created the meme coin — soon enough, people began to send donations to Truth Terminal’s wallet, making it the largest holder of Fartcoin . With each transaction, a ‘gas fee’ is paid — and the sound of flatulence follows suit soon after. Apparently, that was enough to send FARTCOIN prices skyrocketing from $0.2959 to $1.11 — a 275.12% surge in just thirty days that has taken its market cap above the $1 billion mark. Fartcoin price monthly chart. Source: CoinMarketCap This rally isn’t showing signs of weakness, either — in fact, trading volume has increased by 125.46% in the last 24 hours, while the total market capitalization of FARTCOIN has grown by 29.10% in the same timeframe.

Despite having declined by 56% since Tuesday’s all-time high of $0.06845, PENGU remains up by an impressive 159% from its launch price, making it one of the best meme coins to buy at the moment. The coin has already attracted numerous exchange listings since its launch on Raydium this week, with centralized exchanges Binance, OKX, Bitget, MEXC, Bybit and KuCoin now supporting the token, among others. And with the token’s momentum likely to result in future exchange listings, PENGU could continue to enjoy substantial rallies as it enters the New Year. Pudgy Penguins Airdrop PENGU Bounces From Recent Bottom – Time to Buy? First launched in 2021 as a series of 8,888 penguin-themed NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, Pudgy Penguins has grown itself a sizeable community over the past three years. It announced PENGU , its very own native token, at the start of this month, with the coin having its official launch and community airdrop on Tuesday. Pudgy Ecosystem: Holders of Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, Rogs, & SBTs will be able to claim tomorrow starting at 8am EST. Holders will have 88 days to claim, and all unclaimed supply will be functionally locked/burned forever after the 88th day. PLEASE do not rush to claim &… — Luca Netz (@LucaNetz) December 16, 2024 To qualify for the drop, investors needed to own a Pudgy Penguins NFT or one of several other non-fungible tokens. PENGU’s price has dropped considerably since the airdrop began, with data suggesting that around 80% of claimants have sold . And according to DEXTools , it remains down within the past hour, past six hours and past 24 hours, with volumes spiking during the past hour’s selloff. Source: DEXTools Given the size of Pudgy Penguins’ community – it has 450,000 followers on X – it’s unlikely to stay down for too long, with interest in the token remaining high. It’s also likely to continue seeing more exchange listings in the coming weeks, which will continue to provide boosts for its price. There’s strong speculation that Coinbase will soon announce its own PENGU listing, with a cryptic tweet from the exchange suggesting that support isn’t far away . Coinbase only listed the PEPE meme coin two months ago after each reached $8b mc. To change their policy and list $PENGU from the start would be huge. I also had my normy friend that owns no crypto call me last night asking me how to buy it. There will be signs https://t.co/tzbzhqxaKu — Kokino (@InTheMed) December 15, 2024 As such, now may be a very good time to buy PENGU, given how strongly it has dipped. It’s likely to recover concertedly as the wider market gathers steam over the holidays, with the coin still boasting 473,000 holders despite its recent dump. Pudgy Penguins could therefore hit $0.040 in the next week or so, before ending the year at roughly $0.055. Alternative High-Return Meme Coins Because Pudgy Penguins has already gone through its initial listing, some traders may feel as though they’ve missed the boat. However, there are several even newer tokens that look like they could also explode once they go live, with one of the most promising being new ERC-20 meme coin Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) . It opened its presale only several weeks ago, but has already gone on to raise a massive $31.6 million, making it one of the biggest token offerings of 2024. $30M raised. Memes run the internet. Wepe runs the memes. pic.twitter.com/scMZmwEfKv — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 18, 2024 Wall Street Pepe has done so well because it’s much more than another meme token, with the project also about to launch a platform that will provide traders with analysis and market insights. Holders of the WEPE token will gain exclusive access to buying signals and insider trading strategies, while there will also be the chance to compete in community-based trading competitions. The winners of these competitions will earn rewards in WEPE, while the token will also be open to staking, making it a potentially very profitable coin. Investors can join its sale by going to its official website , where it’s currently available at $0.000365. This price will rise in just under a day, so buyers should act quickly, because all the available signs suggest that WEPE could be a big one.

37846268,https://crypto.news/?p=14320382,1734625069,Exclusive: Unraveling the Lainchain scam — A phishing scheme circulating at Paris networking events,"Would you suspect a scam at a professional event? Lainchain’s phishing fraud thrived in Paris until AMLBot stepped in. How did they unravel the complex deception? Table of Contents A crypto trap in Paris Understanding phishing scams and their variations How the scam works Technical investigation findings Fake identities and social engineering Telegram and social media analysis Data breaches and dark web activity Protecting yourself in the crypto space A crypto trap in Paris On the evening of Dec. 3, a freelancer meetup took place at Café Oz in Paris, drawing individuals from various industries to network and exchange ideas. Among the attendees was Scott Horlacher, a software engineer and developer. The evening took an unusual turn with the arrival of two individuals. One was sharply dressed, presenting himself as a lawyer handling the business side of things, while the other, a younger and rugged-looking individual, introduced himself as Leo, a developer. Together, they claimed to represent a new crypto exchange platform called Lainchain. Horlacher’s discussion with them began innocuously enough. “We were conversing in French,” Scott explained, noting that the developer, who gave the name Leo described Lainchain as a Python Flask app. However, the answers to Scott’s technical questions raised red flags. “I was questioning him about the settlement layer, like, how are transactions processed and settled on your exchange or platform?” The Lainchain founder retorted, “you just connect your MetaMask , and you send it directly.” At that point, Horlacher’s suspicions grew. When Horlacher visited Lainchain.com, the problem became evident. “I scrolled over to the sign-up section, and this is then basically when I realized that, oh man, this guy is a scam,” he said. “The sign-up page has a wallet seed generator directly in it. Clearly, the exchange is managing your private keys, and at any point, it’s a security risk. The person is either really stupid for developing the platform, or they’re a scammer. And I think it’s more likely they are a scammer.” After confronting the pair about the issue, their confidence unraveled. They left the event shortly after, leaving Horlacher and others to piece together the scam, warning others in attendance. Determined to get to the bottom of this suspicious encounter, crypto.news partnered with AMLBot, a compliance and blockchain forensics firm. What followed was an in-depth inquiry that exposed Lainchain for what it truly was—a carefully orchestrated phishing scam. This article unpacks the findings of that investigation and examines how the scam worked, what warning signs to watch for, and, most importantly, how you can protect yourself from falling prey to similar schemes in the future. Understanding phishing scams and their variations Before diving deeper into Lainchain’s issue, it’s important to understand the types of phishing scams that exist and how they target victims, particularly in the financial and crypto sectors. Phishing scams use deception to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like passwords, seed phrases, or wallet credentials. Unlike direct hacking, phishing relies on social engineering, making victims unwitting participants in their own exploitation. According to Statista, in 2023, 27.32% of global cyberattacks were financial phishing attacks, down from 36.3% in 2022 and 41.8% in 2021. Share of financial phishing attacks worldwide from 2016 to 2023 | Source: Statista Moreover, in 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center reported over 69,000 complaints related to financial fraud involving crypto. Estimated losses exceeded $5.6 billion, affecting assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Tether ( USDT ). Phishing scams often take these forms: Email phishing: Generic emails impersonate trusted entities, such as exchanges, prompting users to click malicious links or share login details. Spear phishing: Highly targeted scams personalize messages based on specific victims, often impersonating team members or partners to establish trust. Clone phishing: Fake websites or apps, such as Lainchain, mimic legitimate ones, tricking users into entering their credentials or connecting wallets. Social media phishing: Scammers on platforms like Telegram or Twitter pose as influencers, support staff, or project representatives, enticing victims with fake giveaways or investment offers. Malware-based phishing: Malicious apps or links infect devices, capturing sensitive data such as seed phrases, private keys, and credentials. Phishing in crypto is particularly dangerous because of the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions—once funds are transferred, they cannot be recovered. Understanding these tactics is essential to avoiding them. Recognizing the warning signs and employing basic security practices, such as two-factor authentication and verifying sources, are crucial steps to protect your digital assets. How the scam works According to investigators from AMLBot, Lainchain presented itself as a legitimate crypto exchange but was riddled with fundamental flaws that exposed its true nature. The platform’s interface was far from professional, featuring a rudimentary design that belied its bold claims. lainchain.com landing page, Dec. 19, 2024. The deception began with a seemingly routine request for users to connect their MetaMask wallets to access the platform’s services. Wallet integration is a common feature in blockchain-based applications, but Lainchain manipulated this process. Instead of a standard authorization prompt, users were asked to input their seed phrases — a practice no legitimate platform would ever endorse, leading to suspicions it was operating as a phishing scam. The lainchain.com sign-up page, where users are asked for their seed phrase, Dec. 19, 2024. Investigators highlighted that this tactic effectively handed over control of users’ wallets to the scammers. With access to private keys, the perpetrators could freely transfer funds without detection or interference. Beyond direct theft, Lainchain employed psychological strategies to deepen its exploitation. Victims were lured with promises of extraordinary returns and encouraged to deposit more funds to “unlock maximum potential.” When users tried to withdraw, they encountered fabricated obstacles like demands for “transaction fees” or “verification charges,” which served only to siphon more money from them. The investigation also revealed that Lainchain collected personal data during registration, including email addresses and linked wallet details. This information was likely monetized further, sold on dark web marketplaces, and used for phishing campaigns or other forms of identity theft. Technical investigation findings Investigators from AMLBot employed Open Source Intelligence techniques to unravel Lainchain’s deceptive operations. A critical breakthrough came from analyzing the domain registration details of lainchain.com. The domain, registered through HOSTINGER — a low-cost registrar often exploited by scammers — was set up with privacy settings to obscure the owner’s identity. This deliberate anonymity is a hallmark of cybercriminal operations. Registered on January 30, 2023, and updated on October 30, 2024, the domain’s timeline indicated a prolonged window for defrauding victims. Further investigation showed that the website was hosted on servers in Helsinki, Finland, under Hetzner Online GmbH, a hosting provider with a reputation for privacy-focused and affordable services. While legitimate, such services frequently attract bad actors looking for cover. Investigators also found that Lainchain wasn’t an isolated scam but part of a network of fraudulent platforms like Rawkchain and Staxeblock, all built on nearly identical codebases. Embedded comments in Lainchain’s HTML source explicitly referenced Rawkchain, confirming the sites were clones. This tactic enabled scammers to rebrand and relaunch after exposure, continuing to deceive users. SSL certificate analysis further linked Lainchain to a suspicious domain, finalsolutions.com.pk, hinting at a broader network for phishing or laundering stolen funds. Moreover, reverse IP lookups and DNS analysis revealed shared servers with other dubious platforms, exposing its reliance on cheap hosting and minimal effort. Investigators concluded Lainchain exemplified a scalable, low-cost, high-reward scam model, exploiting anonymity and technical shortcuts to prey on users. Fake identities and social engineering One of the most alarming aspects of the Lainchain scam was its calculated use of stolen identities and fabricated social proof to build trust and lure victims. According to investigators, Lainchain’s website prominently displayed images of supposed team members, executives, and founders, complete with impressive titles and professional biographies. However, investigators revealed that many of these images were stolen from public blockchain events and social media profiles. The scammers repurposed photos of unsuspecting individuals, falsely presenting them as Lainchain’s leadership team. In one striking example, the image of a well-known Russian politician was used to fabricate an executive’s identity. Other photos traced back to unrelated professionals were paired with fake credentials to further the illusion of credibility. The deception extended beyond the website. On platforms like Trustpilot, Lainchain showcased numerous glowing reviews, praising its user-friendly interface, robust security, and profitability. However, further analysis revealed these reviews were fake, originating from newly created or suspicious accounts. Many of these profiles had histories of reviewing other fraudulent platforms, such as Rawkchain and Staxeblock This combination of stolen identities, fabricated online presence, and glowing but false testimonials created a sophisticated facade, baiting victims into trusting the platform, leaving them vulnerable to financial loss and further exploitation. Telegram and social media analysis Telegram’s privacy and user-friendly features have made it a favored platform for crypto communities — and for scams like Lainchain. Investigators found that Telegram was central to the operation, serving as a hub for promoting the fraudulent platform and connecting with victims. Scammers operated a private support group where accounts like Arin_lainchain and DanbenSpencer posed as helpful administrators. They shared promotional content and directed users to fake support representatives. A misstep revealed another key account, Lucifer3971, which investigators linked to black-market activities, including trading stolen data. While other accounts were abandoned, Lucifer3971 remained active, providing critical leads. Within the group, scammers also created the illusion of legitimacy using fake accounts to simulate activity. These accounts asked questions, shared glowing reviews, and discussed fake withdrawals, making the group appear trustworthy. Moderators welcomed new members with scripted messages and posted fabricated success stories to lure victims further. The scheme extended beyond Telegram. On Facebook, scammers infiltrated crypto and freelance groups with fake profiles to promote Lainchain. On Twitter, they used bots and fabricated testimonials to amplify their messaging, creating an illusion of credibility and trust. Data breaches and dark web activity The Lainchain scam extended its exploitation beyond stealing funds, targeting victims’ personal data to generate additional profit. Investigators uncovered that sensitive information was funneled into large-scale data leaks and sold on dark web marketplaces. One major repository linked to this network was naz.api, a database notorious for hosting stolen user data from phishing schemes, malware attacks, and browser exploits. A search of naz.api revealed numerous compromised records tied to Lainchain, including email addresses, phone numbers, passwords, and other private details. The investigation also identified stealer logs connected to Lainchain. These logs, widely traded on the dark web, provided detailed snapshots of victims’ browser sessions, including saved credentials, autofill data, and screenshots of login portals. Even more concerning, these logs weren’t isolated—they included data from Lainchain’s predecessor scams, Rawkchainand Staxeblock, feeding into a growing network of stolen information. Protecting yourself in the crypto space The Lainchain scam highlights the growing threat of fake platforms designed to mimic legitimate operations, targeting those unfamiliar with crypto systems. While scams like this are exposed, countless others operate undetected, stealing millions from unsuspecting users. Staying safe starts with understanding how these scams work. Fraudsters often request seed phrases or trick users into connecting their wallets to malicious platforms. Slava Demchuk, CEO of AMLBot, explained the risks: “By connecting your wallet to an untrusted platform, you may unknowingly grant permissions for malicious smart contracts to access and drain your funds. Before approving any transaction, always review the details carefully. If the platform seems untrustworthy or lacks a proven track record, it’s best to walk away.” Another common tactic involves fake wallet applications embedded with malware to steal sensitive information. Demchuk stressed to exercise caution when downloading apps: “Only download applications from reputable sources and verify their credibility by checking user reviews. Keeping your antivirus software up to date adds another layer of protection.” He also advised a skeptical approach when evaluating platforms: “Look for red flags like anonymous or unverifiable teams, missing credentials, or inconsistencies in their claims. If anything feels off, pause and do further research. It’s always better to err on the side of caution than risk compromising your assets.” Reporting scams is equally important. Collaboration among users, developers, and regulators is essential to safeguarding the crypto ecosystem. Staying informed and proactive not only protects individual assets but also strengthens the broader crypto community against these threats.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/exclusive-unraveling-the-lainchain-scam-a-phishing-scheme-circulating-at-paris-networking-events/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37846268.jpeg

A potential breakout could occur in the coming weeks, which might send the altcoin to $1.5. However, Intel Markets (INTL) , with its unique AI technology, has been the center of attraction. Accompanying the surge of interest, the INTL coin has increased by more than 700%, something ADA has not achieved in years. Meanwhile, DonAlt forecasts the Ripple (XRP) price might surge to $5.2 soon. Cardano forms bullish pennant Cardano has been trading in a narrow range this month but a very special pattern suggests a reversal could occur in the next few weeks. The Cardano coin has formed a bullish pennant chart pattern, which is a long vertical line and a symmetrical triangle. This pattern is almost at the convergence point. The Cardano crypto could break out anytime from now. If this happens, the Cardano price could go up to $1.5. However, a break below the support at $1.00, on the other hand, would negate the bullish outlook. Meanwhile, other factors may propel the price of Cardano to a new level in the short term. For example, increased crypto adoption spurred by Bitcoin’s massive surge above $107k could push ADA above resistance levels. VipRoseTr forecasts the value of the ADA token could surge to $2.0387 in the coming weeks. In the meantime, ADA’s price is consolidating between $0.921 and $1.17 on the weekly timeframe, per CoinMarketCap. Ripple could double if it crosses major resistance According to DonAlt, a top analyst in the crypto space, the value of Ripple might pump by 2x in the coming months. However, it must break out of its current range top at $2.60. Such a move could push XRP to a peak of $5.2. Ripplelordz predicts the price of XRP may rally to $4.8 in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the altcoin price has increased on the weekly chart. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the value of the Ripple token has increased by 13.3% in the past week. It has also risen by 136.6% on the monthly level and 309.6% on the yearly timeframe. In other news, Ripple has announced its plans to launch its stablecoin, RLUSD, on Tuesday.

37846045,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395280,1734624650,Ark Invest Offloads $3.9 Million In Coinbase Shares Amid Fed’s Hawkish Remarks,"The post Ark Invest Offloads $3.9 Million In Coinbase Shares Amid Fed’s Hawkish Remarks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the latest development, Ark Invest sold 13,780 Coinbase shares, worth $3.9 million, from its Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) on Wednesday, after Coinbase’s price dropped 10% following the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance. One Of The Largest Coinbase Stock Sales This is one of Ark Invest’s largest Coinbase stock sales since it sold $2.8 million worth on September 23. Ark’s strategy generally aims to prevent any single stock from making up more than 10% of an ETF’s portfolio to ensure diversification, which means they may continue adjusting their holdings based on Coinbase’s performance. As of December 18, Coinbase is the second-largest holding in Ark Invest’s ARKF ETF, making up 9.9% of the fund, just behind Spotify. ARKF’s Coinbase shares are worth about $110 million, and the fund has gained 54% this year. Recently, the Fed announced a 25 bps rate cut yesterday in line with market expectations. However, Chair Jerome Powell’s subsequent speech introduced a hawkish tone, cutting the outlook for 2025 rate reductions from four to just two. This unexpected shift unnerved the markets, despite steady signs of sticky inflation in recent months. Coinbase’s stock traded for $279.86 at market close on Wednesday, down 10.2% for the day. Bitcoin and the broader market also reacted to Powell’s hawkish stance. Bitcoin fell around 9% from above $108,000 before Powell’s remarks to below $100,000 at one point before recovering. It is currently trading at $100,470, down over 3% in the past 24 hours. Markets Reacts To Fed’s Hawkish Remarks The market reacted to Jerome Powell’s statement that the Fed can’t own bitcoin without Congress approval, seeing it as a hurdle to Trump’s bitcoin plan. However, Trump’s plan, along with Sen. Cynthia Lummis’s proposed bill, aims to have the U.S. Treasury buy one million bitcoins over five years, not the Fed. Despite bearish market sentiment, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw strong inflows, adding $275.3 million on Wednesday and extending their positive streak to 15 days, totaling over $6.7 billion. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs also saw inflows, adding $2.5 million and extending their streak to 18 days with nearly $2.5 billion in total. Looking ahead, heightened volatility is expected as markets price in elevated expectations for Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency. Nevertheless, despite short-term turbulence, the long-term outlook remains bullish.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ark-invest-offloads-3-9-million-in-coinbase-shares-amid-feds-hawkish-remarks/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Stacey Herbert, director of the Bitcoin Office in El Salvador, posted on Thursday that the government-issued Chivo wallet — launched in 2021 in a bid to spread bitcoin adoption across the country — will be ""sold off or wound down"" as part of the deal. Other bitcoin wallets operated by private companies will ""continue serving El Salvador,"" Herbert said.  The IMF stated on Wednesday that, under the agreement, El Salvador will also make bitcoin acceptance by the private sector voluntary, and that taxes will only be paid in U.S. dollars (not bitcoin). ""For the public sector, engagement in bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of bitcoin will be confined,"" the document also said, without going into further detail.  Herbert, however, wrote in her post that El Salvador will continue to add bitcoin to its reserves — possibly, even, at an ""accelerated pace."" The Central American nation is currently buying one bitcoin per day; at press time, it held 5,968.77 bitcoin, worth almost $596 million. Herbert said that many of El Salvador's bitcoin-related projects, including the development of bitcoin capital markets and the offering of bitcoin educational programs, will continue to occur. The cryptocurrency's legal tender status will likewise not be impacted.  The IMF has had misgivings about El Salvador's bitcoin initiatives ever since President Nayib Bukele made bitcoin legal tender in the country in September 2021, giving it the same status as the U.S. dollar, the nation’s official currency. In 2022, the agency warned that El Salvador was incurring ""large risks associated with using Bitcoin as legal tender, especially given the high volatility of its price.""  ""The potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund policies,"" the IMF stated on Wednesday.  Salvadorans were offered $30 in bitcoin to sign up on Chivo, but national adoption never really took off. By mid-2022, more than 60% of recipients had yet to make a transaction, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. A survey from the Central American University found in January that 88% of surveyed Salvadorans hadn't used bitcoin in 2023.  The IMF itself will only provide $1.4 billion as part of the deal with El Salvador. Funds from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and regional development banks are expected to bring the total amount to $3.5 billion as part of the same program.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/12/19/el-salvador-to-shut-or-sell-chivo-crypto-wallet-as-part-of-3-5-b-imf-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e45359923799a19c2d522da1ea88ebace7e1d7a2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After Donald Trump was elected president, XRP experienced a major rally and approached the $3 level. However, even though XRP fell back to $2.3 levels with the declines experienced afterwards, a cryptocurrency analyst listed seven important events to follow for XRP. At this point, the analyst nicknamed Velo maxi, who advised not to sell XRPs until the seven major events he listed occur, stated that these events could have a significant impact on the value and market position of XRP. 1-RLUSD Launch: First addressing the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, the analyst stated that he believes the launch will positively impact the XRP price. 2-Trump's Inauguration: Donald Trump, who won the US Presidential elections, will be sworn in as the US President on January 20, 2025. The analyst argued that if Trump introduces pro-crypto policies, these will positively affect the XRP price. 3-Gary Gensler's Departure from the SEC: SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, known for his anti-cryptocurrency approach, will step down next month and be replaced by Paul Atkins. Although the SEC-XRP case clarified the legal status of XRP, the market believes that the threat to XRP will not be completely eliminated until Gensler resigns. At this point, the analyst believes that a change in leadership at the SEC will benefit the entire crypto industry, including XRP. 4-Possible Solution to the Ripple-SEC Case: The analyst noted that the next SEC chairman could help resolve the XRP lawsuit, adding that if the case is concluded, the XRP price could reach new highs. 5-Start of Altcoin Season: The analyst stated that the start of the anticipated altcoin season will lead to a major growth in the XRP price. Bitcoin’s dominance currently stands at 58%. If this rate drops below 50%, it will signal the start of an altcoin season. 6-Ripple’s Major Bank Partnership: The analyst noted that Ripple is likely to announce a major partnership with a major bank. If this happens, the XRP price will be positively affected. 7- Potential XRP ETF Approval: Noting that there are already XRP ETF applications and that they could receive approval with the new SEC chairman before the end of 2025, the analyst said that a potential approval could increase the XRP price by attracting more institutional investors. The analyst finally advised XRP holders to “Be smart, not stupid,” advising them to wait for these key events to occur before deciding whether to sell their XRP. *This is not investment advice.

With the sentiment shift, the market capital is also rotating to Stacks (STX) and the viral utility coin DTX Exchange (DTX). Many investors are adding the innovative hybrid exchange DTX Exchange because of its future potential and the price trajectory that could follow Dogecoin’s gains. The inflow in Stacks (STX) has reduced a bit because of the temporary reversal, but it could pick up as the influx in utility coins increases. Dogecoin (DOGE) Fails To Hold The $0.40 Support Level Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin, boasting a market cap of $56.52 billion; it has also been the no.1 meme coin since its inception. DOGE performed remarkably in the previous bull leg; however, it is going through a correction in the current market reversal. The Dogecoin touched a high of $0.48 on 8th December and since has decreased 21%, breaking below the $0.40 crucial support. Dogecoin is still trading above the mid-term moving average, and analysts believe this average could cause a bottom reversal soon. Whale Alert reported that a massive withdrawal of 4.99 billion DOGE was recently made to an unknown destination. At the time, this staggering amount of Dogecoin was valued at $2 billion. The sheer size of the transaction surprised many commentators, with some speculating that it could be an internal transfer by Binance. sBTC Now Live on Stacks (STX) Mainnet Bitcoin L2 Labs has launched sBTC on the Stacks (STX) mainnet, bringing programmable Bitcoin capabilities to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This new resource, backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio, aims to strengthen the chain’s DeFi ecosystem and create new yield opportunities. Although the launch was slightly delayed from the original September timeline, it follows the Nakamoto upgrade, which brought faster transaction speeds and 100% Bitcoin finality to the Stacks (STX) network. This upgrade, which was rolled out in October, provided the technical foundation for sBTC’s successful release. In this initial phase, users can mint sBTC by depositing Bitcoin on Stacks (STX), with deposit-only functionality available. DTX Exchange Attracts Investors With 16,200% Upside Potential The DTX Exchange (DTX) has gained recognition as the most innovative platform in the trading sector, offering an all-in-one solution for traders with sensational features like 1,000x leverage. It is also the only platform that provides access to over 100,000 digital assets across different markets – stocks, cryptocurrency, forex, and bonds. Access to new-age investing instruments like Real World Assets (RWA) has also gained significant popularity on this platform. The platform is renowned for its high speed and unmatchable API, supported by advanced trading tools like AI risk management and distributed liquidity pools. The proprietary VulcanX blockchain has broken industry records, achieving a speed of 100,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS), ensuring smooth and ultra-speed transactions for the users. The platform prioritizes its community and security with decentralized technology, aiming for a user base of close to 400 million in 2025. DTX Exchange’s commitment to disrupting the trading exchange industry and multi-fold growth projection has attracted investments of over $10.3 million in the sixth batch of the presale. With strong fundamental growth and rapid developments in the ecosystem, the DTX Exchange is preparing for explosive growth in 2025. Experts believe that DTX can surge 16,200% from its current price of $0.12.

37845770,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664951,1734624001,"Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts","As 2025 draws near, market experts are talking a lot about how much Ethereum and Solana are competing with each other. Both cryptocurrencies have grown by leaps and bounds in 2024, nevertheless, perspectives vary on which will finally prevail in the altcoin industry in the forthcoming year. Related Reading: XRP Will Create Millionaires, Analyst Declares In Wealth Projection The Swift Ascendancy Of Solana Solana’s outstanding numbers have attracted interest. It outperformed Ethereum in several important benchmarks in December, including application income and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume: Solana brought in about $141 million in application income; Ethereum earned $93.56 million. Moreover, Solana’s decentralized exchange volume attained an impressive $67.43 billion, in contrast to Ethereum’s $52.37 billion. This development has prompted several experts to forecast that Solana may surpass Ethereum as the preeminent cryptocurrency by 2025. Analysts credit Solana’s success to its rapid transaction speeds and minimal costs, rendering it especially attractive for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The forthcoming Firedancer upgrade is anticipated to improve Solana’s network performance, potentially reinforcing its status as a pioneer in the DeFi sector. Will Ethereum Outpace Solana? Though Solana’s stats are excellent, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan notes the fast development of Ethereum’s ecosystem and projects that will allow it to surpass Solana by 2025. He emphasizes how Layer-2 solutions such as Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum help Ethereum’s scalability, thereby bridging the gap between institutional trust and daily access. People’s mental model of Ethereum is out of date. The common consensus is Solana is cheap/easy/fun and Ethereum is slow/unwieldy/expensive. But look at what’s happening in the AI agent space. Some of the most exciting “fun” projects, like Clanker and Virtuals, are playing out… — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) December 18, 2024 Hougan points to Ethereum’s increasing competitiveness with Solana’s user-friendly appeal, therefore negating its antiquated reputation for being slow and costly. He also mentions the success of initiatives like Clanker and Virtuals on the Ethereum Base network, proving their capacity to encourage creativity while preserving a strong infrastructure. The Institutional Attraction Of Ethereum Conversely, Ethereum has remained active. It recently attracted over $850 million in institutional capital inflows to exchange-traded funds (ETFs), demonstrating its sustained attractiveness to investors. The anticipation of Ethereum’s Petra upgrade enhances the enthusiasm, promising substantial enhancements in speed and overall performance. Additionally projected to grow is Ethereum’s price. Depending on the increase of ETF sponsorships and institutional interest, some analysts estimate it might value $6,000 to $7,000 by 2025. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report A Competitive Environment Both cryptocurrencies exhibit special strengths and shortcomings as we get toward 2025.

To read full editions, subscribe . Let’s look ahead and forget about bitcoin (briefly) sliding under $100k, shall we? For Amberdata’s Greg Magadini, any altcoin szn is currently set to give retail a potentially profitable run. Though, clearly, this is crypto, and everyone should maintain caution. Anyway, he pointed out that altcoins offer regular investors a “more even playing field” than the stock market does. “If you think about a company that goes public, typically there are VCs that are early stage investors, there’s a Series A, B, C, so on, so forth. Then there’s an IPO, and then retail buys at the very, very tail end. In crypto, it’s actually the opposite. Its retail is in Discords — small teams essentially talk to their Discord communities to launch a token, and often retail is the first one to be in the market, so they essentially have an information advantage,” Magadini explained. “And so that’s what makes this market very interesting: as a small player, you can invest and be at the forefront of value creation. But obviously the volatility can be crazy, and there’s a lot more scams. There’s no regulation along the way. Basically, you are kind of on your own.” Magadini said that bitcoin — though volatile — is the lowest volatility asset for crypto right now, and also has the benefit of being the biggest market in which most people, and institutions, with crypto exposure are in. This opens the door for a potential altcoin rotation to have a “higher beta performance,” where bitcoin can go 2x, and altcoins go 10x, Magadini said. The good news for retail this cycle is that, despite seeing institutional action in bitcoin and ether, Magadini said he thinks institutions are still “locked out” until we see an altcoin become a major pair.

37846354,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52569,1734623757,"Christmas Rally Incoming: Cardano (ADA), Fantom (FTM), and DTX Exchange Lead Watchlists for 2025","Cardano (ADA) and Fantom (FTM) have been long known for their gigantic financial backup in the crypto market among bullish investors. However, as an emerging deFi project, DTX Exchange (DTX) has disrupted the volatile crypto market with its cutting-edge layer1 protocol and over 300% presale breakout after the project bagged over $10.38 million before launch. Cardano (ADA) Predicted to Explode Before 2025? Cardano has experienced notable volatility recently. Over the past six months, its price has surged by 189.82%, indicating significant growth. In the last month alone, ADA climbed 56.78%, showcasing strong upward momentum. However, the past week saw a slight downturn, with the price dipping by 7.11%. Currently, ADA is trading between $0.94 and $1.22. The nearest resistance level stands at $1.35, a point where selling pressure might increase. If the price breaks through this level, the next resistance is at $1.636. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.78, providing a potential floor if prices decline. A second support level sits at $0.50, which could be crucial in preventing further losses. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $1.08 and $1.09, respectively, suggesting a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 62.08, approaching overbought territory. The Stochastic oscillator reads 84.68, which may indicate the asset is overbought and could face a price correction. Analysts Eye $3 Target For Fantom (FTM) Post Breakout Fantom (FTM) has been a focal point for crypto discussions containing its recent breakout, which pushed Fantom (FTM) to new trading highs. Ever since Fantom (FTM) has pushed upwards, market analysts have now put forward a new target price of $3.00 for the token. Taking into account the current price dynamics and market trends, the price target outperforms by more than 100% from the current levels. There is a lot of speculation surrounding this target price. It’s backed up with large trading volumes and some liquidity injections being seen in a number of exchanges. An example of this would be that trading volume for Fantom (FTM) spiked up over 150% over the last day, showing increased market activity and excitement for the token. The surge happened not just from a number increase but is one of the top gainers in the cryptocurrency market today. These numbers show that Fantom (FTM) is going through aggressive buying behavior and has positive sentiment, driving the market to increase by as much as 15% in one day. This uptrend has also been seen in the reflected Fantom (FTM)’s market cap, which has increased by 5.50% from approximately $3.83 billion.

This figure is almost double IAU’s AUM, and it took IBIT less than a year to achieve the milestone. Earlier this month, CryptoPotato reported that IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $50 billion in AUM, crushing the milestone 5x faster than any fund ever launched. The previous holder for this record, BlackRock’s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA), took 1,329 days to reach $50 billion in AUM, while IBIT achieved the feat in 228 days. It is worth mentioning that these feats have been driven by bitcoin’s (BTC) rising price. The cryptocurrency hit $100,000 for the first time on December 5 and has rallied as high as $108,200 since then. Crushing Milestones and Exponential Growth Besides doubling IAU’s 20-year AUM and crushing the $50 billion milestone faster than any other fund, IBIT has recorded other remarkable achievements since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit its listing on January 11. The BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF reached $10 billion AUM within seven weeks of launch, a feat attributed to 150 out of the 3,400 ETFs trading globally. IBIT joined the top ten United States ETFs with the longest inflow streaks after seeing inflows non-stop for 71 days post-launch. Additionally, IBIT surpassed the AUM of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) within 96 of trading, becoming the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with 288,671 BTC; the fund’s holdings have now ballooned to 549,920 BTC, cementing its position as the largest Bitcoin ETF trading volume, AUM, and market cap.

While the market was experiencing a decline, the Solana (SOL)-based memecoin Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) attracted attention with its rise. Fartcoin surpassed the $1 billion market cap on Dec. 18, up 113% in the last 30 days, despite much of the altcoin market experiencing double-digit declines on the day. The Fartcoin rally did not last long. Shortly after its market value exceeded $ 1 billion, Fartcoin retreated. However, Fartcoin rose again afterward and exceeded the $ 1 mark. Fartcoin, which has been in business for about 2 months, was launched on October 24. Although Fartcoin has experienced significant volatility in its market value, it continues to attract attention with its rise. As comments on Fartcoin’s rise grow, Unlimited Funds co-founder Bob Elliott said in an X post, “If Fartcoin is experiencing a parabolic rally, perhaps monetary policy is far from being too restrictive.” Bone Fide Wealth president Douglas Bentforth also referred to Powell's Bitcoin statements in an X post, saying, “The Fed can't own Bitcoin, but they haven't said anything about Fartcoin.” Having increased by 18% in the last 24 hours, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) continues to be traded at $1.04 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

Will the MOVE Price Reach $1?,"The post Is This the Next Big Thing in Crypto Space? What is Movement Network? Will the MOVE Price Reach $1? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Movement price is on the rise, gaining over 15% upswing in the past few hours after maintaining a consolidated trend since the start of the day. Interestingly, it is happening in the times when the wider crypto markets are facing massive sell-offs, with the Bitcoin price plunging below $100K while the Ethereum price heading towards $3500. With over 110% rise in the trading volume, the MOVE price appears to be poised to mark a new ATH above $1.45 shortly. What is Movement? Why is the MOVE price on the rise? Movement (MOVE) is the native token of Movement Network built on Ethereum and offers faster and more secure transactions using the Move programming language. The leveraging layer-2 solutions are expected to get more enhanced scalability, aiming to improve the interoperability with advanced features. Soon after the Movement Foundation launched the mainnet network accompanied by the governance token, MOVE, the price spiked high, marking the highs at $0.8. Moreover, the price maintained a healthy upswing and surged beyond $1 in the next few hours towards the ATH at $1.45, which attracted massive bearish pullback. Now that the MOVE price has triggered a strong recovery, will it rise back above $1 today? The short-term price action of MOVE suggests the token may experience a small pullback as it failed to sustain above the neckline of the recovery curve. Besides, the hourly MACD suggests a drop in the buying volume and with a potential bearish crossover, the price is expected to drop slightly below the curve but sustain above $0.716. The DMI, which is heading towards the bearish crossover, validates the claim. On the other hand, the RSI & OBV remain incremental, which suggests the price still remains within a bullish range. Therefore, these minor dips can be considered a good buying opportunity as the Movement price is poised to trigger a rebound and head towards a new ATH, probably close to $1.6 in the coming days.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-this-the-next-big-thing-in-crypto-space-what-is-movement-network-will-the-move-price-reach-1/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Analysts think the bullish momentum will continue into 2025. All three cryptos received notable adoption from the onset. Three altcoins, ONDO, SOL, and SUI, have surged in the 2024 bull cycle. ONDO, for instance, has gained nearly 1,000% in 2024, considering the initial rally phase in the year’s first quarter and the recent surge in the last quarter of 2024. SOL and SUI exhibited similar trends. However, SOL gained over 1,500%, while SUI’s rally reflected a 1,364% yearly gain. Despite their massive gains, many analysts expect these cryptocurrencies to grow more in the coming months. Users predict ONDO, SOL, and SUI to remain bullish and be among the top cryptocurrencies of the upcoming altcoin season.

This marks a sharp increase from the $660.5 million stolen in 2023 and underscores the critical role cybercrime plays in funding Pyongyang’s government operations. There was $2.2 billion stolen from crypto platforms in 2024, and North Korea accounted for 61% of it, according to Chainalysis. North Korean hackers stole more from crypto platforms than ever before: $1.34 billion, which represents 61% of the total amount stolen for the year. pic.twitter.com/tVBsOKW8U7 — Chainalysis (@chainalysis) December 19, 2024 The country’s cybercrime network conducted 47 separate attacks this year, double the incidents attributed to them last year. These exploits target crypto platforms and decentralized finance systems to siphon funds that experts believe are directed toward North Korea’s weapons development and ballistic missile programs.

Their operations have also expanded to include infiltrating cryptocurrency firms under the guise of remote workers. In one notable case, 14 North Korean nationals were indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice for using false identities to secure remote IT jobs, generating over $88 million through data theft and extortion. The scale and frequency of these attacks are increasing. North Korean groups carried out more large-scale hacks exceeding $100 million in 2024 than in previous years, demonstrating a growing capability for massive thefts. Smaller-scale hacks have also risen, with attacks under $50 million occurring more frequently. The international community has long raised concerns about North Korea’s reliance on cybercrime to bypass sanctions. U.S. officials estimate that up to a third of the regime’s missile program funding comes from illicit online activities.

Hacking activity slowed significantly after June, coinciding with closer ties between North Korea and Russia. Analysts suggest the regime may have shifted its cyber strategies following a meeting between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, which signaled increased cooperation between the two countries. “It is therefore possible that,” the report read, “in addition to redirecting military resources toward the conflict in Ukraine, the DPRK — which has dramatically increased its cooperation with Russia in recent years — may have altered its cybercriminal activity as well.” The slowdown did little to mitigate the year’s overall impact.

Table of Contents Rollblock: GambleFi giant’s presale chalks up $7.3 million in liquidity XRP: Feel good story of the year just gets better. Or does it? Solana: ETH killer loses ground to XRP Conclusion XRP and Solana are embroiled in a dominance battle, with XRP currently holding the upper hand but with many asking if XRP is sustainable. Solana, conversely, has lost ground, but analysts say it’s a temporary blip before Solana rights itself. Either way, it makes for a volatile ride, and experienced traders know that while two big dogs fight it out, there’s a smaller, undervalued token just waiting to be discovered for its moonshot crypto potential. Rollblock is the new entrant dragging away the big bone, and investors are clamoring to get in on the Rollblock presale . Rollblock: GambleFi giant’s presale chalks up $7.3 million in liquidity The crypto market is as unpredictable as ever, with big swings keeping traders on edge. But seasoned investors know the real moonshot potential often lies not in chasing volatility but in presales. Presales are where fortunes are made, offering tokens at their earliest stages before they hit the open market. One such opportunity making waves is Rollblock, a GambleFi project seamlessly DeFi with the booming online gambling industry. Rollblock’s ace up its sleeve is that it not only gives investors the opportunity at a moonshot presale where price action can return astronomical heights but also a profit share. Rollblock is taking advantage of the $500 billion online gambling sector and is offering investors a monthly dividend as a reward for enhancing the platform’s liquidity. This explains why Rollblock’s presale has already gained over $7.3 million in liquidity –making it the moonshot crypto of the year.

Remember when XRP was the third-largest token next to Bitcoin and Ethereum? That was… today! In an act reminiscent of its 2018 heyday, XRP pulled a moonshot crypto move, and now it is in its rightful place as a top-3 token. Is XRP’s growth sustainable? On the pro side, many say the SEC’s humiliation in the courts has set XRP free to be what it always could be. The anti-side states this is nothing but a feeding frenzy, and FOMO is driving the price and an inevitable crash will come. Solana: ETH killer loses ground to XRP Solana is branded as the Ethereum killer and grabbed headlines a month ago when it flipped BNB to take the number 4 spot behind BTC, ETH, and Tether. It was Solana’s turn to be a moonshot crypto, and things were looking great. A new ATH was chalked up in November. And just like that, Solana’s fortunes changed. BNB flipped back, XRP leapfrogged it, and Solana was back at position number 6. Solana’s advocates say this is just profit-taking and point out that Solana is still on track to be the Ethereum killer as Solana’s growth far outstrips that of ETH, and XRP is but a temporary blip Conclusion XRP and Solana show just how volatile crypto can be. While there is a ton of profit to be made, traders and investors need to keep their finger on the market’s pulse and time buy and sell calls perfectly. Not many have that appetite. Rollblock offers the best path for short-term gains and long-term price realizations for a smoother investment journey without the stomach-churning drops.

Seems that the downtrend triggered large whale sell-offs, commonly referred to as whales, in the hope to profit from previous gains. Today even Cardano saw a massive whale selloff. A recent Shiba Inu whale sell-off has sparked concerns in the market. This whale, who initially invested $3,800 in SHIB back in 2020, recently liquidated 250 billion SHIB valued at $6.05 million, adding to their total profit of $109 million. Despite the sell-off, the whale still holds 2.15 trillion SHIB worth $52.18 million. A whale sold 250B $SHIB ($6.05M) for profit in the past hour! The whale spent $3.8K to buy 15.28T $SHIB ($1.22B at the peak) as early as August 6, 2020. This whale currently holds 2.15T $SHIB ($52.18M), with a total profit of $109M on $SHIB . https://t.co/BWxcnWuwFR pic.twitter.com/aQZFPyhYSv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 19, 2024 Traders Left Wondering: Why Now? The timing has traders asking: why sell now, and will they sell more? In the downtrend, this move could be a sign of a potential shift in whale behavior, often a key market driver. Large-scale liquidations can increase further price drops and impact retail investors, especially when they occur near crucial support levels. SHIB’s price has slipped below the significant 50 EMA ( Exponential Moving Average ) support, currently trading at $0.00002408. If it fails to hold support levels at $0.00002283 and $0.00002045, a sharper correction could follow. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Solana Meme Coin Fartcoin Sees Explosive Growth Amid Crypto Market Decline , Current Market Scenario The market is also under the grip of “Fear” as the Fear and Greed Index sits at 69 with today’s bloodbath.

But if SHIB continues to show strength , it might emerge even stronger. However, the SHIB community is rooting for its recovery by 2025 once the market sees a fresh circulation of money. Despite Sell-off SHIB is Poised to Rise Despite short-term challenges, Shiba Inu retains a strong community and speculative appeal, especially with its role in DeFi and meme culture. Analysts project a potential rally, with SHIB possibly hitting $0.00009 by 2025 due to major developments and bullish sentiments. Technical indicators, like the Bollinger Bands , suggest SHIB’s price might fall further in the short term. At the same time, the lower band indicates the token nosedive to $0.0000238, expected to go as low as $0.0000228 in search of a local bottom. However, despite the selloff an early trader made a whopping profit of $109 million which shows that traders are going long for SHIB. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This follows a grant from Gate.io’s $50 million Meme fund. Pixelverse , a leading game publisher with over 1 million monthly active players, announced its partnership with leading BASE memecoins to redefine the Web 3 gaming ecosystem and memecoin communities. Announced earlier this week, the partnership aims to revolutionize on-chain engagement and expand memecoins utility via the Web 3 gaming sector. To kick off the partnership, Pixelverse announced the upcoming launch of its gaming title, MemeBattle, a tactical deck builder game created in collaboration with the top memecoins from the Base ecosystem, including Brett, Toshi, Keyboard Cat, Dog in Me, Mr Miggles, Mochi, Ski Mask Dog, Mochi and more. According to Kori Leon, co-founder of Pixelverse, BASE blockchain offered the most promising option for the company to launch games due to several factors, including scalability, speed and cost efficiency. Speaking on the partnership, Leon said: ""Base offers a trusted, scalable platform with low fees and seamless wallet integration, making it the ideal choice for founders in Web3 gaming. We were excited to work with BRET and other leading memecoins as we’re embracing their rise as digital cultural icons and transformation into interactive experiences that engage communities in new ways through Web3 gaming,"" Memecoins Join The Web 3 Gaming Multiverse Launched in 2023, Pixelverse became one of the fastest-growing gaming platforms on Telegram, achieving viral success with over 75 million registered users and 5 million daily active players, making it one of Telegram’s top mini-games. The latest move shows the evolution of the platform, bringing in new gamified memecoins to players. The launch of MemeBattle aims to bring the memecoin characters into a tactical battlefield, pitting the memecoin communities in a fun, humorous and engaging game. MemeBattle will leverage Base’s scalable infrastructure, low fees, and vibrant memecoin ecosystem to onboard users into Web3 gaming, driving engagement and adoption on-chain. It will bring familiar memecoins from the Base ecosystem, such as Brett, along with existing partners like Pudgy Penguins, MEW and Turbo, to life as playable characters, giving users the chance to build unique squads, strategize in battles, and climb leaderboards to earn rewards. On its addition to MemeBattle, one of the spokespersons from Brett shared: “Brett is coming to Pixelverse as a playable character, making him an integral part of web3 gaming. This will make memecoins like Brett more engaging and accessible. By leveraging Brett’s renowned IP, we aim to onboard more users onchain.” Growing Innovation Across Web 3 Gaming Pixelverse growth has been a testament to the consistent development and investment placed into the project. It is backed by some of the leading Web 3 investors in gaming including Delphi Ventures, Mechanism Capital, and Merit Circle, and bolstered by tier-1 exchange listings like Bybit. In addition, the gaming platform also secured grant funding from Gate.io’s $50 million Meme Fund, set up to empower meme creators and drive community-focused projects with real-world applications. As one of the first recipients, Pixelverse will use this support to elevate memecoins on Base by transforming tokens into gamified ecosystems through Web3 gaming. The transition from a clicker game into a gamified platform for memecoins is expected to transform and redefine Web 3 gaming engagement.

In fact, since late November, the altcoin hasn’t traded above $245. However, an AI’s Solana price prediction shows that it might be time to hop on before it goes parabolic in the first quarter of 2025. Elsewhere, investors are eyeing new altcoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO) as they aim for 10,000% gains in the upcoming bull rally. Solana Price To Set New ATH In Q1 It has been Solana’s year in 2024. Everything that could have gone the altcoin’s way did, and then some. On the price charts, SOL price has doubled its price since the year started. While the March rally pushed the token, it was in November when it found its stride, hitting a new all-time high of $263.5 on November 23. It has then slowed down, but analysts believe that this is merely a consolidation phase and that it will spike in the new year. One analyst noted that after trading in a descending wedge pattern since late November, SOL price is finally breaking out, which always ushers in a rise above the previous high, which in this case, was its ATH of $263.5. (Image courtesy of CryptoGodJohn on X ). However, for Solana, the good year extends beyond the gains on the price charts. This year, the network has become the new king of new tokens, with the most successful projects this year launching on Solana. Solana memecoins have especially been a hit. From BONK and WIF to POPCAT and PNUT, they have set the pace for the rest of the industry. The latest is Pudgy Penguins, which has shot up in a few days to a $1.54 billion market cap, gaining 600% in just the past week alone. Pudgy Penguins pushed Solana activity to 67 million transactions in a single day, its highest since it launched over four years ago. Investors Eye Yeti Ouro For 10,000% Gains Investors on the hunt for the next project with the potential for 10,000% gains are buying up Yeti Ouro, the new Ethereum-based memecoin project that merges the excitement of meme culture with the adrenaline of play-to-earn gaming. Yeti Ouro raised $1.2 million in the first stage of its presale, with thousands of investors snapping up the tokens for $0,012. In the second stage, these tokens have already gone up to $0.017, but investors are still purchasing them, raising over $64,000 for the project in just a few days. Yeti Ouro has launched a meme contest with a prize pool of $2000 for 1st place, $1000 for second place and $500 for third place. To participate, create engaging Yeti-themed memes, and share on X. Make sure to tag @yetiouro and use hashtag #YetiMeme. To learn more head over to the official Yeti Ouro X channel . Yeti Ouro revolves around play-to-earn gaming with its immersive, engaging and innovative new game Yeti Go. On Yeti Go, playing a thrilling racing game is not just fun but also rewarding. Players who win their races are rewarded with YETIO tokens, which they can sell on, stake, or purchase in-game items and weapons with. YETIO’s supply is capped at one billion tokens, with 50% available to investors in the presale while 5% goes to the token-burning mechanism.

37845208,https://finbold.com/?p=221003,1734622787,$7 billion wiped from XRP in a day,"Though most discussed in the context of the staggering post-election rally, XRP’s most recent trend has been one of stagnation , and the latest even turned into a substantial price drop. Specifically, even though the token is up a staggering 115.99% in the last 30 days, it is 3.42% in the red in the last 7 days and 5.53% in the last 24 hours to XRP price today of $2.35. XRP 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Such a downturn likewise ensured that the cryptocurrency saw its market capitalization collapse by approximately $7 billion from $142.13 billion on the evening of December 18 to $135.5 billion at press time on December 19. XRP 7-day market capitalization price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap What’s behind XRP’s $7 billion plunge? Though such a plunge might be concerning for cryptocurrency traders, given the stagnant performance prevalent since early December, it is noteworthy that the bloodbath has little to do with XRP itself. Indeed, on the evening of December 18, there was a far-reaching downturn that ensured the Wednesday stock market session wiped $1.5 trillion, that the wider cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by a total of $300 billion, and that even gold – traditionally a safe-haven asset – collapsed more than 1%. Such a calamity was triggered by the Fed’s announcement that, despite reducing interest rates by the expected 25 basis points (BPS), inflation is expected to be higher in 2025 at 2.5% instead of the previously forecasted 2.1%, and that there will be fewer cuts in the coming 12 months. What’s next for XRP? Still, as evidenced by XRP’s own performance – and the performance of multiple other assets – it remains unclear if the sharp collapse will have a lasting impact. At its lowest, the token market capitalization fell to about $125 billion – some $17 billion from where it stood on the eve of Chair Jerome Powell’s speech. Furthermore, whale activity recorded by December 17 highlights that the token’s current struggles are more likely to constitute an accumulation phase than a prelude to a deeper plunge. On the flip side, the fact that XRP began its fall hours before the FOMC press conference started – from December 18 highs at $147 and last seven days’ highs at $155 billion – indicates persistent uncertainty about the token’s next move.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

On-Chain Data Shows $141B Support with 1.45M BTC Accumulated,"On-chain data reveals 1.45 million BTC accumulated at $97.5K, highlighting $141 billion in support as Bitcoin faces potential retracement below $100K. Bitcoin's recent price action showcased significant volatility, with the leading crypto briefly surpassing $108,000 on December 17. However, the crypto market faced a rapid reversal following the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which injected uncertainty into the financial sector.After reaching its record high, Bitcoin retraced to $105,000 and later dipped below $99,000. Despite this pullback, the asset rebounded above $102,000, though it remains 2% lower than its daily opening price.Bitcoin Sitting on $141B SupportAmid this recovery, an analysis shared by IntoTheBlock provides insights into potential support zones based on historical buying activity. Data from the blockchain analytics platform highlights a critical support zone for Bitcoin below the $100,000 mark, where a demand zone has been formed. The platform notes that approximately 1.45 million BTC were accumulated at an average price of $97,500. This accumulation, worth $141.37 billion, suggests robust demand below the six-figure threshold, potentially offering price stability if selling pressure intensifies.On the resistance side, minor selling activity is noted just above the current trading levels. The platform identifies the closest resistance range between $102,351 and $102,458. The relative weakness of these resistance zones points to an opportunity for upward momentum if buying activity strengthens.https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1869708409479872565 Address Activity Reflects Market ConsolidationBitcoin's network activity offers further insights into the market's current phase. According to IntoTheBlock data , 364,870 new addresses were created over the past week, reflecting continued interest in the asset. Further, the 7-day new address metric declined by 10.14%, signaling a slowdown in new participant entry.Meanwhile, active wallets remain stable, with 899,370 addresses transacting, showing a slight 0.23% decline over the same period. Interestingly, the number of zero-balance addresses increased by 14.55% in the past week, reaching 401,690. Bitcoin Address Activity / IntoTheBlock Dynamics Amid Federal Reserve PolicyElsewhere, an analysis by Santiment highlighted the macroeconomic context of Bitcoin's price fluctuations. The intelligence platform recalled how the Federal Reserve’s 25-basis-point interest rate cut, coupled with cautious comments by Chairman Jerome Powell, tempered market expectations, particularly Bitcoin. However, Santiment noted a slightly reduced correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 during the past month. This trend is particularly significant in bullish periods, and considering that Bitcoin has stayed over $100,000, it could position itself for recovery once market volatility subsides.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/19/can-bitcoin-retrace-below-100k-on-chain-data-shows-141b-support-with-1-45m-btc-accumulated/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=can-bitcoin-retrace-below-100k-on-chain-data-shows-141b-support-with-1-45m-btc-accumulated,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37846466,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105663,1734622308,Market Pundit Shares Best XRP Investment Strategy as XRP Collapse,"A market pundit shares his preferred XRP investment strategy amid the ongoing market bloodbath that triggered a 9% XRP collapse. Notably, the crypto market took a hit following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 0.25%. Despite expectations for a bullish outcome, the announcement triggered a ""sell-the-news"" event, causing widespread liquidations. XRP bore the brunt of the market downturn, plunging by 9.91% yesterday to a low of $2.23, as it erased the gains from the RLUSD launch. So far, the altcoin has recovered slightly, trading at the $2.34 level. However, it remains in a very delicate position.Fed Policy and Market ReactionsFor context, the Federal Reserve 's latest rate cut reduced interest rates to 4.5%, aiming to bolster economic growth. Nonetheless, this decision led to significant volatility across financial markets. The U.S. stock market lost $1.5 trillion in value, while over $310 million in crypto liquidations were recorded within 24 hours. XRP did not escape this bloodbath. However, Amid the downturn, market pundit Oscar Ramos shared suggested that the dip presents an opportunity for accumulation. In a video commentary , Ramos noted the impact of the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments, particularly his stance against the central bank owning Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Chair confirmed that the bank is not allowed to own Bitcoin and they are not looking for a rule change on that. Powell's remarks dampened market sentiment, raising concerns over the Federal Reserve's future relationship with crypto.Investment Strategy Amid XRP Price SlumpThis contributed to the crypto market collapse. The ensuing decline in XRP's price followed a period of heightened volatility. After peaking at $2.72, the token retraced to $2.23, marking a 17% drop within a day. Despite the sell-off, Ramos highlighted that such corrections are typical in volatile markets and often create opportunities. He compared the current dip to the previous XRP downturn on Dec. 10, where the token recovered after a similar drop following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's 60 Minutes interview . XRP 1h Chart Oscar Ramos XRP 1h Chart | Oscar Ramos The market pundit revealed that he personally doubled down on XRP during the recent price drop, citing his long-term bullish stance on the asset. However, he failed to provide any price projections. He reassured XRP holders to remain patient and focus on dollar-cost averaging rather than reacting emotionally to market fluctuations. Nonetheless, he noted that he understands the position of those who instead choose to sell and take profits.Ramos spotlighted the recent launch of RLUSD as a bullish factor. He shared a clip of Monica Long, Ripple's president, discussing the potential of Ripple's newly launched stablecoin, RLUSD . She emphasized the growing demand for regulatory-compliant stablecoins, projecting the market to reach $3 trillion by 2028. Some believe Ripple's focus on stablecoins, and diversification could play a critical role in driving XRP's long-term value.Broader Crypto Market CollapseMeanwhile, in addition to XRP, the broader crypto market also faced steep losses. Bitcoin dropped from $108,000 to $100,000, marking a 7% decline. Ethereum saw major liquidations, with Binance recording the largest single liquidation worth $4.7 million in ETH perpetual futures. Ramos pointed out that fear and uncertainty dominated the market following the Federal Reserve's announcement. However, he encouraged investors to remain calm and focused on their long-term strategies.

Next up is Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to Martinez, long-term holders of Bitcoin are reducing their positions, a phenomenon that coincided with a market top during the last two BTC cycles. “Long-term Bitcoin holders often sell near market tops. Interestingly, in 2017 and 2021, their biggest sell-offs occurred right before the final leg up. Could we be on the verge of a similar pattern? Is this the start of a market top?” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading at $104,919 at time of writing. Next up is Ethereum ( ETH ). The crypto trader and analyst says that Ethereum could be on the cusp of a massive rally. “In the past two bull cycles, Ethereum went parabolic when long-term holders shifted into greed mode.

37845053,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627019,1734622200,Lightchain AI Price Surge– Predictions Indicate a 300% Growth in 2024,"The cryptocurrency market is evolving at lightning speed, and Lightchain AI Presale ($LCAI) is quickly becoming a standout opportunity for investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. As blockchain technology converges with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI is delivering groundbreaking innovations with the potential to reshape the industry. With the presale now open, this is the perfect chance to get in early on what analysts predict could see a staggering 300% growth by 2024, making $LCAI a top contender among altcoins. This article dives into the key factors driving this bullish outlook, explores the core technologies fueling Lightchain AI’s adoption, and discusses its prospects in an increasingly competitive crypto space. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): An Overview At its core, Lightchain AI merges the capabilities of blockchain and artificial intelligence to create a decentralized ecosystem designed for efficiency, scalability, and real-world application. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus solely on financial transactions, $LCAI integrates AI-driven innovations that go beyond transactional value to address pressing industry challenges. Also, Lightchain AI is powered by a hybrid consensus mechanism, combining the strengths of both Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). This combination ensures speed, security, and decentralization while minimizing energy consumption – a crucial concern in today’s world. Key Features of Lightchain AI Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A revolutionary consensus mechanism that incentivizes AI computations, ensuring that blockchain validation contributes to real-world advancements rather than mere energy consumption. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): This AI-powered virtual machine supports intelligent smart contracts, enabling real-time analytics, predictive modeling, and machine learning directly on the blockchain. Scalable and Sustainable Design: Lightchain AI employs parallel processing and adaptive resource allocation to overcome traditional blockchain bottlenecks, ensuring scalability without compromising security. Versatile Applications: From healthcare to supply chain optimization, $LCAI’s technology has broad applicability, making it a favored choice for industries seeking AI-powered blockchain solutions. Why Predictions Indicate a 300% Growth in 2024 Several factors contribute to the optimistic forecast for Lightchain AI’s price surge in 2024: 1. Growing Adoption Across Industries The unique combination of blockchain and AI positions Lightchain AI as a transformative solution for industries such as: Healthcare: AI-powered diagnostics and patient data management. Supply Chain: Improved transparency and predictive logistics. Finance: Smarter DeFi applications and risk analysis. As more enterprises adopt $LCAI for its advanced capabilities, demand for the token is expected to rise exponentially. 2. Increasing Interest in AI-Powered Solutions 2023 saw significant advancements in AI, and this momentum is expected to carry into 2024. With AI becoming a cornerstone of technological progress, Lightchain AI stands out as one of the few projects that effectively integrate AI into blockchain technology. 3. Exclusive Presale Momentum The ongoing presale of Lightchain AI tokens has generated substantial interest, with early investors positioning themselves to benefit from its growth potential. This strategic rollout not only boosts liquidity but also strengthens confidence in the project’s roadmap. 4. Market Sentiment and Technical Indicators Crypto analysts have highlighted bullish trends for $LCAI, citing: Positive Price Action: A steady upward trajectory since its launch. Low Market Cap: Offering significant room for growth compared to established players. Strong Community Backing: A committed base of investors and developers driving adoption. 5. Collaboration Opportunities Speculation around partnerships with industry leaders has further fueled optimism. Such collaborations could amplify Lightchain AI’s visibility and utility, attracting new investors and enhancing its value proposition. Lightchain AI vs Competitors To understand why $LCAI is poised for exceptional growth, it’s essential to compare it with some of its competitors: 1. Ethereum (ETH) While Ethereum remains the king of smart contracts, its scalability issues and high transaction fees make it less competitive against Lightchain AI’s advanced solutions like PoI and AIVM. 2. Solana (SOL) Solana’s high-speed network is impressive, but it lacks the AI-driven functionality that makes Lightchain AI a more versatile option for industry-specific applications. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE) Although DOGE enjoys a strong community, its limited utility as a transactional token pales in comparison to $LCAI’s broad real-world applications. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart? 1. Real-World Use Cases Unlike meme coins or speculative tokens, Lightchain AI focuses on solving actual problems. Its adoption in industries such as logistics, healthcare, and finance underscores its potential as a practical solution. 2. Sustainability With its energy-efficient PoI mechanism, Lightchain AI addresses the environmental concerns associated with traditional blockchain networks. 3. Democratizing AI Development By integrating AI capabilities into a decentralized platform, Lightchain AI empowers developers and organizations to access advanced tools without relying on centralized entities. 4. Community-Driven Growth Lightchain AI’s decentralized governance model ensures that the community has a voice in its development, fostering trust and transparency. Challenges to Watch While the outlook for Lightchain AI is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Market Volatility: As with any cryptocurrency, $LCAI’s price is subject to market fluctuations. Competition: Emerging blockchain projects may introduce similar features, intensifying competition. Adoption Barriers: Educating industries about the benefits of blockchain and AI integration may take time. However, Lightchain AI’s proactive approach to addressing these challenges through innovation and community engagement positions it well for sustained growth. Investor Insights: Is $LCAI a Good Bet? Short-Term Gains Early adopters of Lightchain AI stand to benefit from the token’s presale and projected price increase. With predictions of 300% growth, $LCAI presents a lucrative opportunity for short-term investors. Long-Term Value The token’s real-world utility and industry adoption suggest significant long-term potential. Investors seeking sustainable growth should consider $LCAI as a cornerstone of their portfolio.

Though there is no solid evidence to back this news, social media especially X(previously Twitter) is heated with discussions of these rumors. According to the speculations,UAE holds between 300k to 400k Bitcoin. With Bitcoin at $100k this bag values between $3b- $4b. Why do these rumors feel more than just talk? Connecting the Dots The UAE’s crypto developments over the past year seem to support these claims. In October 2024, the country launched its own AE stablecoin , pegged to the Dirham. They designed it to boost digital transactions and solidify the UAE’s place in the digital economy. In another major move, the Federal Tax Authority announced VAT exemptions for cryptocurrency transactions, retroactively applying them from 2018. This tax-friendly approach aims to attract investors and promote blockchain innovation. Then there’s the landmark decision by a Dubai court in August 2024, which ruled that salaries can be paid in cryptocurrency. These changes show the UAE isn’t just experimenting with crypto—it’s laying down a solid foundation for a future heavily integrated with blockchain and digital currencies. According to Vivek Sen , journalist at Bitcoin magazine, the founder and ex-CEO of Binance CZ has hinted about UAE holding BTC in reserve. Source : X.com Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset The idea of nations holding Bitcoin as a reserve isn’t new. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis even proposed that the U.S. should accumulate 1 million Bitcoins within the next four years. As Bitcoin’s reputation grows as a “digital gold,” countries looking to diversify their reserves might start taking this idea seriously. For the UAE, it could make sense. Bitcoin prices recently surged past $93,000 in November 2024, partly driven by rumors of Middle Eastern sovereign buying. With major players like Standard Chartered offering crypto custody services and Binance establishing a strong presence in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the UAE is positioned to benefit from this trend. What to Expect Whether the rumors are true or not, UAE’s actions towards crypto and blockchain tells clearly that they are preparing for the digital leadership. The policies, legal reforms and the strategic partnerships, all these indicate that they have a long vision for the crypto sector. If the Bitcoin reserve speculation turns out to be true, it could mark a historical shift in how countries approach digital assets. On one side the US government is pushing to make America the hub for crypto while the UAE is already on the path. This looks like a crypto race, who will win, time will tell.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-the-uae-secretly-stockpiling-bitcoin-reserves/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The MicroStrategy chairman has often stated that Bitcoin, like New York property, will appreciate indefinitely, allowing companies to continue issuing debt to finance further BTC purchases. MicroStrategy plans to buy $42 billion worth of BTC before 2028, and Saylor has said he never plans to sell .

37845052,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630464,1734622128,Our problem is not markets that are too volatile – It’s traders that are too sensitive,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell shook financial markets this week, delivering a reality check that left traders scrambling. On Wednesday, Powell laid out a cautious approach to interest-rate cuts for 2025. Stocks nosedived 3%, bonds crumbled, and 10-year Treasury yields soared to their highest in seven months. The selloff was brutal—the worst post-meeting market reaction since the pandemic. Investors, drunk on years of rate cuts and easy money, didn’t take the news well. Powell’s message was simple: the Fed is tapping the brakes. After three consecutive rate cuts, officials now project just two more reductions in the next 12 months. For traders betting on a steady flow of policy easing to prop up asset prices, this was devastating. The risk-on rally that defined the past two years? It’s done. Powell’s “neutral” stance rattles markets Powell’s caution wasn’t entirely unexpected. Economic data has been painting a mixed picture: inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, while the U.S. economy has proven surprisingly resilient. Traders had already started pricing in higher yields, pushing the 10-year Treasury rate up by 75 basis points since September. But even seasoned market participants were caught off guard by how close the Fed appears to the end of its cutting cycle. Markets adjusted quickly—and violently. The swaps market now expects fewer than two quarter-point cuts in 2025. Some traders, like those in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) options market, are even betting on the Fed reversing course and hiking rates again next year. And then there’s the wildcard: President-elect Donald Trump. With just weeks before he re-enters the White House, Trump has promised aggressive economic policies. Higher tariffs and tax cuts are on the table, moves that economists warn could stoke inflation. Powell’s caution makes sense in this context, but it doesn’t make it any easier for traders already on edge. Global markets feel the heat The euro, pound, and Swiss franc each dropped over 1%, while the offshore Chinese yuan hit its lowest point since 2023. Emerging markets didn’t escape the carnage. The Indian rupee plunged past 85 per dollar, setting a new record low. The yield on India’s 10-year bond climbed to 6.78%, and the NSE Nifty 50 index fell 0.6%. A combination of weak regional currencies, capital outflows, and a ballooning trade deficit added pressure on the rupee. Meanwhile, riskier corners of Wall Street, which had thrived on rate cuts and optimism about Trump’s growth policies, were hammered. Goldman Sachs’ index of most-shorted stocks dropped nearly 5%, its worst day since February. A basket tracking profitless tech firms slid 6.4%, the sharpest fall in two years. Tesla shares tanked 8.3%, while Bitcoin, hovering near $108,000, tumbled 5%. A hawkish pivot with lasting effects The Fed’s decision to cut rates on Wednesday—a quarter-point reduction bringing the range to 4.25%-4.5%—should have been a relief. But the forward guidance overshadowed the cut. Powell’s dot plot, a tool showing policymakers’ rate expectations, forecasts just two rate cuts in 2025, down from four predicted in September. Investors, already wary of stubborn inflation and solid economic growth, feared the Fed might halt cuts entirely — or even tighten again. Stocks reacted accordingly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 1,100 points, marking a 10-day losing streak not seen since 1974. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 3% and 3.6%, respectively.

Source: Syndica Solana’s DApp Economy: DeFi Leads, Meme Coins Explode Decentralized finance (DeFi) remains the backbone of Solana’s DApp revenue, accounting for 83.7% of total earnings. Wallets contribute 9.6%, while the remaining 6.5% comes from infrastructure, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) , and gaming applications. Meme coin DApps have emerged as a dominant force on Solana, generating a total of $509 million in revenue in 2024. In November alone, this category earned $183 million, a 300-fold increase from January, when meme coin applications generated in a mere $600,000. Solana DApps revenue by category, YTD. Source: Syndica Pump.fun, a meme coin launchpad, became the first Solana DApp to surpass $100 million in monthly revenue, raking in $106 million. This success, however, was not without controversy. Pump.fun faced intense criticism in late November due to inappropriate content shared by users through its livestreaming feature, including alleged threats and acts of violence . This led the platform to indefinitely suspend livestreaming and promise to introduce stricter moderation to prevent similar incidents in the future. The impact was immediate: Pump.fun’s weekly revenue plummeted 66% following the suspension. Raydium and Jupiter Drive Solana’s DeFi Growth Beyond Pump.fun, other key players driving Solana’s DApp revenue included Raydium, a decentralized exchange (DEX) , Photon, a token discovery platform, and Jupiter, a Solana-based DeFi platform Raydium played a crucial role in driving spot DEX revenues to record highs. In November, Raydium earned $32 million, capturing 86% of total spot DEX revenue. Monthly revenue from Solana-based DEXs (Jan-Nov 2024). Source: Syndica Jupiter, a Solana-based DeFi platform, also achieved record revenue in November, reaching $17 million. This was largely driven by its perpetuals (Perps) trading feature. Kamino Finance, another Solana-based DeFi protocol, hit a new all-time high in revenue, reaching $2.9 million. Lending remains its primary revenue source, contributing approximately 80% of its total earnings. Even infrastructure providers like Helio are experiencing significant growth. Helio’s revenue surged to a new all-time high of $316,000 in November, representing a 7x increase since the beginning of the year. Telegram bots have also carved out a significant niche, generating $300 million in revenue this year. These bots provide users with a convenient way to access and trade cryptocurrencies directly within the Telegram messaging app. Their popularity has grown alongside DEX volume, with Telegram bot DEX volume share stabilizing at 4-5% in recent months. DePIN Protocols on Solana Gain Traction The report also highlighted the emergence of decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) as a growing sector. Solana-based DePIN protocols like Render, Nosana, Helium, and Hivemapper leverage blockchain technology to provide real-world services, such as decentralized computing and data storage. These protocols have recently seen strong demand, leading to notable revenue growth. The total revenue of Solana-based DePIN protocols reached $669,000 in November, a significant jump from the approximately $150,000 generated in January.

37844647,https://crypto.news/?p=14320782,1734621594,2 reasons why Bitcoin and other crypto just crashed,"It was a sea of red in the crypto industry as Bitcoin price dropped below $100,000 briefly and the crypto fear and greed index moved from the extreme greed zone of 88 to 69. So, why did crypto crash this week? Bitcoin ( BTC ), he largest cryptocurrency, was trading at $102,300 on Dec. 19, while Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped to $3,600. Some of the top laggards were coins like Cosmis, Floki, THORChain, Curve DAO Token, and Fantom. Crypto crashed because of the Fed decision The most important reason why the crypto crash happened is the Federal Reserve decision . The bank decided to cut interest rates by 0.25% as was widely expected. That cut brought the cumulative cuts this year to 1%. However, the Fed signaled that it would only implement two additional cuts in 2025, citing its focus on controlling inflation. Officials expect inflation to remain persistently high, reaching the 2% target only in 2026 or 2027. The hawkish tone from the Fed led to declines in cryptocurrencies and other risk assets. U.S. equity markets plunged, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 indices falling over 2%. U.S. Treasury yields surged to multi-month highs, with the 10-year yield rising to 4.557% and the 30-year yield climbing to 4.7%. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index soared to a two-year high. You might also like: Bitcoin price may see a harsh reversal after Fed decision Mean reversion and distribution Crypto is also down because of profit-taking, panic, mean reversion, and the Wyckoff Method distribution. Historically, crypto investors take profits when Bitcoin and other tokens rally too much. This profit-taking can be explained in terms of mean reversion and the Wyckoff Method. Mean reversion is a situation where an asset in an uptrend falls so that it can move close to its historical averages. For example, as shown below, Solana remains about 20% above the 200-day moving average. As such, it may drop to get closer to that level. Solana price chart | Source: crypto.news The Wyckoff Method identifies key phases in an asset’s lifecycle: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. The recent crypto surge was part of the markup phase, while the ongoing decline could signify either a distribution phase or the start of markdown. You might also like: Here’s how the crypto market reacted to the Fed’s 0.25% cut Will crypto prices bounce back? Cryptocurrency prices often mirror Bitcoin’s movements. As previously noted, Bitcoin’s cup-and-handle pattern indicates the potential for a rally to $122,000 in the near term. If this happens, it could trigger a recovery across altcoins as investors capitalize on the dip. However, the immediate aftermath of a dip may lead to a “dead cat bounce,” where an asset experiencing a significant decline temporarily recovers before resuming its downtrend.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | CRV | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/2-reasons-why-bitcoin-and-other-crypto-just-crashed/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37844647.jpeg

PEPE’s resurgence-capturing trader attention Pepe Coin has recently captured significant trader attention amid market fluctuations. Launched in April 2023, PEPE is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, with a total supply of 420.69 trillion tokens. In October 2023, the PEPE team executed a token burn of 6.9 trillion tokens, approximately valued at $5.5 million, to reduce the circulating supply and bolster investor confidence. This action led to a 31% price surge, indicating positive market reception. PEPE’s roadmap is structured into three phases: Meme, focusing on initial launch and community building; Vibe and HODL, emphasizing partnerships and exchange listings; and Meme Mastery, aiming for broader adoption and market presence. Despite its humorous origins, PEPE has achieved a market capitalization exceeding $8 billion, ranking it among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market size. However, potential investors should exercise caution, as PEPE lacks intrinsic value or formal utility, aligning with its meme coin nature.

In a recent video on X, he admitted to being the hacker, and denied his father’s or any spy agency’s involvement. He stated that he had worked to return the stolen bitcoin and would continue to do so. Lichtenstein also expressed regret for his actions and for involving his wife, Heather Morgan, who pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy charges. Morgan was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Lichtenstein plans to work in cybersecurity after his release. Most of the stolen bitcoin has been recovered, according to his lawyer. Lichtenstein Denies Father’s Involvement In a five-minute video posted on X, Lichtenstein revealed that he was the hacker and he acted alone while denying the speculations in a Netflix documentary that his father or any agency might be involved in the act. “My dad is no hacker, he doesn’t even know how to use Instagram,” stated Lichtenstein, who was sentenced to five years in prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering, including the time he was detained after the arrest while the case was pending. I have something to say #FreeRazzlekhan pic.twitter.com/9HIvOxcbgr — Ilya Lichtenstein (@unrealdutch) December 19, 2024 Sincere Apologies To Bitfinex Lichenstein also offered sincere apologies to Bitfinex for ‘all the stress that he caused them,’ which he said in the video, recorded from prison during a remote visit with his wife. Lichtenstein admitted in the video that he knew his actions were wrong but did them anyway, expressing regret and self-hatred. He also gave an update on working to return the stolen funds to Bitfinex. Lichtenstein stated that he has been working for the past three years to return all the stolen assets as part of his plea agreement and will continue doing so. A restitution hearing is scheduled for February to decide whether the recovered funds will go to Bitfinex or its affected customers. Bitfinex hacker’s wife, Heather Morgan, aka “Razzlekhan,” pleaded guilty as well. Charges were of money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Prosecutors said Morgan learned about Bitfinex hack years later and that Lichtenstein asked her to help launder these Bitcoins. Lichtenstein stated in the video that his wife, Heather Morgan, is also a victim of his poor decisions. Last month, Morgan was sentenced to 18 months in prison for her supporting role in Lichtenstein’s crimes. Best known for her goofy rap videos, Morgan recently began selling custom videos for $125 a pop on Cameo, a sort of non-pornographic version of Onlyfans. Her prison sentence could begin as soon as next month. Many Myths To Be Debunked? The Netflix documentary on the case said that a large portion of the stolen money was still unaccounted for. However, Lichtenstein disagreed with the claim, stating that all money had been accounted for. “It’s nice to begin to have the public record surrounding our case set straight,” Morgan noted, referring to the video her husband released. “You would think that would have happened after our sentencing memos got filed, but that really hasn’t been the case. There are so many myths that I look forward to debunking when we tell the real story.” Lichtenstein revealed that after he serves his time, he plans to pursue a career fighting cybercrime. Previously, he expressed remorse for “wasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.” He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison. Notably, the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack was worth $70 million at the time and around $12 billion today. The Netflix documentary leaves viewers with the impression that a substantial portion of the stolen funds remain missing, but according to Lichtenstein’s lawyer, this is not the case. Lichtenstein’s lawyer, Samson Enzer, confirmed that with Lichtenstein’s assistance, nearly all the stolen assets from the 2016 Bitfinex hack have been recovered. About 114,601 BTC (96% of the total stolen) and 29 other valuable assets were recovered.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitfinex-hacker-breaks-silence-the-real-story-behind-the-120000-bitcoin-hack/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37846102,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321182,1734620704,Chainalysis Estimates $2.2B Stolen From Crypto Platforms in 2024,"Crypto hacking remains a huge challenge, with the total value of stolen funds surging to $2.2 billion in 2024, a 21.07% year-over-year increase, reports blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The number of hacking incidents also grew, rising from 282 in 2023 to 303 in 2024. Chainalysis highlights while the year started with alarming intensity—$1.58 billion was stolen by July, an 84.4% increase compared to the same period in 2023—the upward trajectory slowed in the latter half of the year, suggesting a shift in dynamics. The first preview chapter for our 2025 Crypto Crime Report is for stolen funds. We look at crypto hacking trends in 2024, the DPRK’s activities, and more: https://t.co/1cu8druW84 — Chainalysis (@chainalysis) December 19, 2024 Shift in Hacking Targets Historically, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have been the primary targets due to their rapid development cycles and a focus on market growth over security. While DeFi still accounted for the largest share of stolen assets in Q1 2024, centralized services became the top targets in Q2 and Q3, reports Chainalysis. Notable centralized platform hacks included DMM Bitcoin ($305 million in May) and WazirX ($234.9 million in July). This shift highlights the critical need for improved security measures, particularly around private keys, which emerged as the most exploited vulnerability in 2024. Private key compromises were responsible for 43.8% of stolen crypto. Laundering Techniques Evolve Chainalysis highlights that after compromising private keys, hackers often launder stolen funds through various mechanisms to obscure transaction trails. In 2024, private key hackers predominantly used bridges and mixing services to hide their activities. Those hackers employing other attack vectors leaned more on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The ongoing evolution of laundering techniques makes it difficult to trace and recover stolen funds, further complicating enforcement efforts, reports the analytics firm. Chainalysis Acquires Security Firm Hexagate On Wednesday, Chainalysis said it had acquired Hexagate, a Web3 security company specializing in detecting and mitigating real-time threats on blockchain networks. Hexagate claims it has saved over $1 billion in customer funds by allowing organizations to respond swiftly to potential threats. Clients including Coinbase and Consensys, rely on Hexagate to safeguard their on-chain operations.

37844140,https://coinpaprika.com/news/spicy-projects-5-soil,1734620572,Spicy Projects #5: Soil Protocol,"Welcome back to our Spicy Projects series, where we highlight the hottest and most innovative Web3 projects. Today, we’re talking about SOIL Protocol, a platform that connects real businesses with blockchain. SOIL helps businesses grow and gives investors a simple way to earn stable returns. What Are Real-World Assets (RWAs)? To understand what makes SOIL so spicy, first, we need to talk about Real-World Assets (RWAs). RWAs are things that have real value, like houses, art, or loans. By putting these assets on the blockchain, they become easier to share, trade, and use in new ways. This idea isn’t just a trend. Big companies like BlackRock are already supporting RWAs, showing their potential to transform finance. SOIL takes this concept and brings it to life in a practical way by offering stable returns to investors while funding real businesses. What is SOIL? Launched in 2023, SOIL Protocol stands out as a new approach to Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It brings real-world assets into the crypto space, creating stable investment opportunities. SOIL allows investors to fund businesses using stablecoins like USDC . The platform is designed to generate real value by supporting businesses and delivering returns backed by actual cash flows. Unlike many other DeFi platforms that focus on speculation, SOIL is built on trust and real impact. To keep investments secure, SOIL uses a Guarantee Fund, which reduces risk and provides additional safety for investors in a volatile market. Soil's latest product - Liquid Stake product is offering a stable 7% yield on your staked assets with a short cooldown period for added flexibility. But that's not all—users can boost their earnings even further with $SOIL, the native token that enhances yield potential. Backed by Real-World Assets, this product delivers security and transparency, while providing a USDC-based yield. Plus, with continuous AI-driven portfolio rebalancing - it brings RWA stability to the crypto portfolio. Helping Small & Medium Businesses At its core, SOIL is about solving real-world problems. Many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) struggle to access financing through traditional banks due to complex processes and strict requirements. This creates a funding gap that stops them from growing. SOIL bridges this gap by providing a new way for SMEs to get the funds they need. Investors lend stablecoins through SOIL, and these funds are used to finance real businesses. This not only helps SMEs thrive but also gives investors a reliable way to earn returns. What Makes SOIL Stand Out? SOIL Protocol combines the best of blockchain technology and real-world value. Here’s what makes it unique: Connecting Real-World Assets: SOIL integrates RWAs into blockchain, bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto. Reliable Investments: The focus on real businesses means investors earn returns backed by actual economic activity. Extra Security: With the Guarantee Fund, SOIL adds a layer of protection, making it safer for investors. Partnership with Securitize SOIL’s partnership with Securitize, a leader in tokenizing real-world assets, adds even more credibility. Through this collaboration, SOIL connects to global financial giants like BlackRock and Hamilton Lane by adding BlackRock’s tokenized BUIDL Fund and the Hamilton lane Senior Credit Opportunities Fund into SOIL asset management strategies. This partnership shows the confidence and trust SOIL is building in both the crypto and traditional financial markets. A Clear Vision for the Future SOIL Protocol is reshaping how blockchain works with real businesses . By combining RWAs with blockchain technology, it opens new opportunities for investors and provides businesses with the liquidity they need to grow. The protocol’s focus on delivering value and security makes it a standout project in the DeFi space.

37844608,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-slashing-proposal-validators,1734620400,Solana staking may become riskier as Anza proposes slashing,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . A couple months after rumors started trickling out, the Solana developer shop Anza — which was spun out of Solana Labs earlier this year — put out a pair of proposals to consider implementing slashing in the network. Solana has notably never enabled slashing, which is a popular method to keep validators honest in proof-of-stake blockchains. By putting slashing live, Solana would have a way to punish validators who slow down the network — but it would also introduce a vector of risk for SOL stakers. Solana validators run software and propose and vote on blocks containing Solana transactions. Every 400 millisecond slot, a validator becomes the leader who proposes a block for all the other validators to vote on and verify. If the block looks good, it’s confirmed. If there are problems, a slot can be skipped and revisited later so that Solana can still run fast. Currently, there is no way to punish leaders who mess up proposing blocks, or validators who vote late or incorrectly, slowing down Solana’s consensus. For now, the proposed slashing program would only slash validators for so-called duplicate blocks, where the same block is created twice. Anza is yet to decide what the slashing economics would look like at a granular level, but the SIMD author recommended burning, or functionally destroying, the slashed stake. Anza’s Ashwin Sekar also proposed a parabolic slashing curve where if 5% of a validator’s stake commits a violation, 1% of their stake is burned, while if 33% of the stake commits a violation, 100% is slashed. Ethereum’s slashing curve is linear, Sekar explained on a validator discussion call. Sekar also said the slashing proposal is still in its early stages, and such an update would be rolled out in late summer 2025 at the earliest. Anza’s proposal seemed to be met with general early approval from Solana’s technical community. “I can think of many scenarios in Solana where slashing is critical,” Temporal researcher Ben Coverston said on X. “Slashing is necessary to make malicious behavior -EV.” We don’t know how slashing might look on Solana, but on Ethereum, slashing incidents tend to be quite rare. Less than 0.04% of active Ethereum validators have ever been slashed, according to Ethereum research shop Consensys. Simply put, most validators tend to do what they’re supposed to do nearly all of the time in blockchain settings with slashing enabled. Still, turning slashing on would add a risk vector for Solana stakers, who would see their rewards suddenly dip if their delegated validator had their stake suddenly burned. This risk extends to restaking protocols as well, as some have warned of “slashing cascade” risks for Ethereum restaking outfit EigenLayer. “[I] hope [you’re] staking with validators you actually trust,” Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana’s largest validator Helius, said on X.

The SUI and AVAX coins have had great runs this year, but their traders are moving to FXGuys (FXG) , hoping to flip $100 to $10,000. The new crypto project has a trader funding program that benefits both investors and traders. Its potential to pump 100x in price and deliver a 150% presale ROI makes it a good crypto to buy. Interested investors can buy FXG tokens here. New deal for SUI, but doubts about whether it’s still a good deal Sui was one of the top performers in the crypto market in the past year, ranking third after Mantra and Pepe. The performance was down to the layer-1 chain’s focus on development and utilities, which has apparently paid off on the SUI price charts. The latest development is SUI’s partnership with the Chinese solar giant Ant Group. The Chinese Fortune 500 company has approached the Sui ecosystem to list its assets as tokenized digital products on the exchange. The real-world asset sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the crypto market, and Sui’s involvement will yield profits in the long run. However, the SUI token is fresh out of a surge, so its short-term potential is still in consolidation, as SUI has been trading around $4.78 for some days now. This is probably why investors believe FX Guys could be their best bet for 100x gains, as there’s a growing momentum around the project’s pull. FXGuys: New crypto taking on top altcoins The aim of any top or new crypto project is to remain relevant for as long as possible. With DeFi coins, they even have to work extra to stand out, as the features often overlap. Although still a new crypto project, the FX Guys project stands out and seeks to contend with the established top altcoins through proprietary trading. FXGuys’ PropFi feature is a first in the Defi sector, and traders are already anticipating the trader funding program where the best traders are provided with capital, and the profits are shared with investors. In the same vein, the FXGuys project will reward traders for their activities on the platform through the Trade2Earn feature. Traders will get complimentary FXG tokens for each completed trading session, and it doesn’t matter whether they lose or gain. Also, FXGuys’ FXG tokens are not only governance tokens. They serve as currency for purchasing items like trading perks on the ecosystem and paying gas fees on transactions. Trading perks include charts and other analytical tools that would help simplify the decision-making process while trading. So, as users receive their FXG tokens, they can decide to spend them, stake them, or stash them in anticipation of a surge.

That has led to Avalanche’s latest funding round , one that yielded $250 million. For context, that’s the second-largest funding round in the crypto market since 2022’s downturn. AVAX will be putting all those funds into expanding the blockchain to accommodate validators on a subscription basis. Instead of validators paying an upfront 2,000 AVAX, the subscription model will see them pay 1.33 AVAX every month. The Avalanche token is still consolidating, though, as its weekly charts show a net 4.7% loss. AVAX is worth $49.65 , with some improvement in the past day. While the uptrend is a good sign, FXGuys offers more with its PropFi feature, which has attracted over $3 million worth of investment in its FXG presale. Interested investors can buy FXG tokens here. FXG: A promising alternative as top altcoins consolidate Sui’s partnership with Ant Group and Avalanche’s blockchain upgrades promise that the top altcoins will be in consolidation phases. The new crypto project, FXGuys , is offering appealing features like the PropFi trading system and Trade2Earn incentives which is on track for a 100x surge that could flip $100 to $10,000. The FXG token’s presale is priced attractively at $0.04 in Stage 2, with a potential 150% ROI when the token launches on major exchanges at $0.10.

37844765,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105749,1734619984,Bitcoin at Its Limit? Why This Bloomberg Expert Says This Might Be as Good as It Gets,"A Bloomberg commodities expert believes the 2024 bullish market momentum is just ""as good as it gets"" for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Even as Bitcoin continues its show of strength, extending its price record above $100,000, crypto market participants continue to call for higher prices, suggesting that 2025 might be an even bigger year for the asset and the broader crypto market. However, amid this market euphoria, one prominent analyst has offered a note of caution. Could this be the limit for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market?Gold Strength Offers Warning This might be as good as it gets for risk assets, including Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone. McGlone expressed this view in an X post on Thursday, December 19, citing Bloomberg Intelligence's macroeconomic annual performance dashboard. Per the dashboard, Bitcoin has been the strongest performer in 2024, with over 136% year-to-date (YTD) gains. At the bottom are U.S. Treasury bonds with a 4.3% YTD decline. Bloomberg Intelligence While this table seemingly highlights Bitcoin's strong 2024 showing, McGlone contends that there is a warning for risk assets hidden within.As the analyst highlighted, gold is just behind Bitcoin on the table, with a 27.8% YTD performance, more than the 26.1% YTD performance of the S&P 500, with which the leading crypto asset is strongly correlated. McGlone warns that this gold strength, despite the AI boom, may suggest that risk assets may soon be facing headwinds.This is because investors typically flee to gold in search of a safe haven in times of uncertainty. One such headwind that may be looming for risk assets is persistent inflation.Quantitative Tightening Not Over Just YetFollowing the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, December 18, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the central bank's tussle with inflation was not over. In the most recent projections, the central bank sees inflation at 2.5% in 2025, up 0.4% from an initial 2.1% projection in September 2024. As such, the Fed plans to keep interest rates higher for longer, which could maintain the squeeze on much-needed liquidity for risk assets like Bitcoin.Specifically, the Fed now plans to make only two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025 instead of the initial projection of four.The new Fed posture unsurprisingly led to a sell-off across equities and the crypto markets, with Bitcoin dropping as much as 7% from over the $106,500 price point to about $98,800. Still, some analysts remain positive.Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has contended that the crypto market now has internal momentum that is likely to have a greater impact than the Fed. According to Hougan, the positives for crypto include the pro-crypto tide in Washington with the incoming Donald Trump administration, institutional adoption, Bitcoin purchases by corporations and governments, and technological breakthroughs.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/19/bitcoin-at-its-limit-why-this-bloomberg-expert-says-this-might-be-as-good-as-it-gets/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-at-its-limit-why-this-bloomberg-expert-says-this-might-be-as-good-as-it-gets,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37843992,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630427,1734619925,Vladimir Putin admits Russian inflation is an ‘alarming signal’ – Is BRICS collapsing?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged inflation as a major challenge for Russia during his annual “Direct Line” Q&A session on Thursday, describing the economy as “overheating.” Speaking to Russian citizens, Putin outlined the government’s efforts to address rising prices. “ There are some issues here, namely inflation, a certain overheating of the economy, and the government and the central bank are already tasked with bringing the tempo down, ” Putin said, according to a Reuters translation . Russia’s consumer price index reached 8.9% in November compared to the same period last year, up from 8.5% in October. Food prices, particularly for milk and dairy products, were key drivers of the increase. Inflationary pressures have been compounded by a weakened ruble , which has elevated the cost of imports, and soaring military expenditures, straining labor and production resources. Russia’s economy under Putin has been interesting since he invaded Ukraine in 2022. Rising prices and wage growth “ Of course, inflation is such an alarming signal ,” Putin remarked, as reported by Interfax. He noted that wages have grown by 9% in real terms, slightly outpacing inflation, while disposable incomes have also risen. The comments came as Russia’s central bank was widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 200 basis points to 23% on Friday, marking the highest level in a decade. Putin partially attributed rising prices to international sanctions, stating that external restrictions have increased logistical costs. However, he also criticized domestic monetary policies, implying that alternative strategies could have been employed to curb inflation. “ There are also subjective factors, and there are our shortcomings, ” he said, emphasizing the need for timely decisions to stabilize prices. BRICS Pay and currency challenges Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions over global currency dynamics have intensified since Donald Trump won the US presidential elections in November. At this year’s BRICS summit in Russia, Putin introduced BRICS Pay, a payment system designed to bypass the dollar-centric global financial system. However, US President-elect Donald Trump warned of severe consequences for nations seeking to sideline the dollar. Trump threatened 100% tariffs on BRICS countries that attempt to replace the dollar in trade, stating, “ They should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy. “ Although the US dollar’s dominance has declined over the years, it remains the world’s reserve currency. Given the challenges of de-dollarization and the potential for US retaliatory measures, including freezing dollar holdings, BRICS efforts to move away from the dollar are expected to be gradual and limited. Is BRICS collapsing? BRICS, originally an economic concept, has evolved into a bloc with political undertones. The group, initially comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, expanded last year to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE. However, this expansion has not been universally welcomed. India’s central bank governor, Shaktikanta Das, clarified on December 6 that the country is not pursuing de-dollarization or working toward a BRICS common currency. Das’ statement followed Trump’s sharp criticism of BRICS’ ambitions to undermine the dollar’s supremacy. Argentina’s President Javier Milei, known for his anarcho-capitalist stance, withdrew from BRICS shortly after taking office in December 2023. He cited ideological differences, refusing to “ally with communists.” Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s engagement with BRICS remains ambiguous. Ahead of the October summit in Kazan, Russia, the Saudi government refrained from affirming its membership status. While Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan attended the summit and expressed a commitment to strengthening ties with BRICS, he stopped short of pledging full membership. Saudi Arabia’s unclear stance prompted Russia’s foreign ministry to retract an earlier statement referring to it as a BRICS member. Criticism of the bloc’s recent expansion has also emerged from within. Jim O’Neill, the economist who coined the term “BRICS,” has questioned its direction. Speaking at an event in London in November, O’Neill dismissed the group’s evolution into a political entity and described its expansion as a move driven more by symbolism than substance.

The latest estimates reveal the company’s capitalization has reached $38.9 billion, while the annual trading volume surged to $2.7 trillion — a 200% increase compared to the previous year. These figures encompass all exchange markets (spot and futures), showcasing the company’s rapid growth and the increasing trust of its users. For context, WhiteBIT’s trading volume surpassed major players like Kraken, whose annual trading volume stood at $628 billion. Remarkably, WhiteBIT’s trading volume exceeds the GDP of countries like Italy or Canada and approaches the GDP of France, valued at $3 trillion. According to WhiteBIT Founder and CEO Volodymyr Nosov, this milestone reflects the exchange’s innovative strategies and strategic focus: “Reaching $2.7 trillion is the result of our dedicated teamwork and the trust of our clients. We remain committed to developing cutting-edge technologies tailored to the needs of both retail and institutional traders.” Top 2 in Traffic In the fall of 2024, WhiteBIT secured its position as the second-most visited crypto exchange, with 33 million visits to the platform. This achievement places it just behind Binance and underscores the growing demand for WhiteBIT’s services. Key Drivers of Growth One of the primary contributors to WhiteBIT’s record trading volume has been the onboarding of institutional clients . The exchange introduced a market maker program tailored to the requirements of large-scale traders. With low fees and rebates as high as -0.01%, the program provided attractive conditions for high-frequency trading, drawing professional traders to the platform. Institutional loans also became a cornerstone for building trust within the professional community, enabling large-scale transactions. The platform’s advanced technical infrastructure played a significant role as well. Features like colocation to reduce latency, sub-accounts for strategy diversification, and a robust API established WhiteBIT as a reliable partner for institutional clients. The introduction of a new affiliate program also contributed significantly by engaging large communities of retail traders, driving user acquisition, and boosting trading activity, which ultimately supported WhiteBIT’s exceptional performance. Currently, the exchange serves over 1,300 institutional clients. Expanding Global Reach Today, over 30 million people worldwide use services and products from the WhiteBIT Group holding. These include the centralized exchange WhiteBIT, the crypto payment solution Whitepay, the decentralized exchange WhiteSwap, the NFT marketplace white.market, and the gaming platform Pocket Rocket. Additionally, WhiteBIT Group encompasses Whitechain, its proprietary blockchain, and WhiteBIT Coin (WBT), which has experienced an impressive 349.39% growth over the year. With 600+ trading pairs and more than 300 digital assets, WhiteBIT continues to strengthen its competitive edge in the global market. In a recent interview , CEO Volodymyr Nosov confirmed WhiteBIT’s plans to enter the US market. Commitment to Security WhiteBIT stands out as one of the most secure cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Ranked among top 5 in security by CER.live, it is the first crypto exchange to achieve the highest-level Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS) certification. The platform also holds a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) certification, safeguarding customer payment information, and has been recognized by Hacken for excellence in cybersecurity. WhiteBIT remains committed to continuous growth, solidifying its position in the international market, and expanding its impact on the global crypto ecosystem.

37843718,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395245,1734619654,Cardano Price Prediction Today: ADA Bears Push for $0.64 After 14% Price Drop,"The post Cardano Price Prediction Today: ADA Bears Push for $0.64 After 14% Price Drop appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano’s ADA is currently down by more than five percent and is trading below the crucial $1 mark. Down by more than 14 percent in the last seven days, ADA chart shows a minor correction but nothing major has changed. The main question remains whether the market is already in the fourth wave of a larger correction or if it’s still in an extended third wave. Key support levels will be critical in determining the next price movement. Key Support Levels to Watch The most critical level to monitor is the 64-cent mark. This is the main support level that needs to hold for a bullish scenario to remain intact. If ADA breaks and sustains below 64 cents, it would signal a more bearish outlook. However, for now, ADA remains above this level, which is positive for the bullish case. If ADA experiences a further decline, there is additional support around 76 cents. This level corresponds with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, which is a typical target for a fourth wave correction. As long as ADA holds above these support levels, there is still potential for upward movement. Smaller Time Frame Correction and Potential for Reversal On a smaller time frame, ADA has been moving within a corrective price channel since the high formed in early December. While there have been some rebounds, these have been in a three-wave structure, which doesn’t mean a strong confirmation of a trend reversal yet. This three-wave move suggests that the current rally may not be the start of a larger upward trend, but more of a short-term correction. The next key support levels on the smaller time frame are 93 cents and 83 cents. If ADA drops below 83 cents, it would confirm that the larger fourth wave correction is unfolding. Below that, further support can be found at 76 cents and 64 cents. Bullish Potential and Next Targets If the price holds above 64 cents and the corrective structure resolves, ADA could still experience an upward move. There is potential for the price to reach $1.42, $1.72, or even $2.36 in the next wave. However, this is contingent on the market holding key support levels and seeing a reversal in price action.",NEGATIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardano-price-prediction-today-ada-bears-push-for-0-64-after-14-price-drop/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors are checking out the potential for massive gains with the next big cryptocurrency that could skyrocket like Cardano and Solana. Table of Contents DTX Exchange seen as a presale star with great growth potential Lucid: The price of Cardano may reach the top 3 spot Solana looks ready for breakout as price rises Can DTX Exchange soar like ADA and SOL? The crypto market is a race to grab onto opportunities before everyone else does. Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) made early buyers considerably more money as they became some of the best cryptos. With this sector back on the rise, another opportunity is showing up: DTX Exchange (DTX) , which can also show considerable growth. This phase six presale star has already skyrocketed by 500% while raising over $10.2b. Some experts even think DTX could see a 1,000% surge in 2025 as it may revolutionize online trading. DTX Exchange seen as a presale star with great growth potential Cardano and Solana made headlines when they launched, enhancing the blockchain space. DTX Exchange looks to follow this path. It will close the divide between CEX and DEX by launching a hybrid trading platform with the best features of both. On it, people will trade over 120k asset classes, like bonds and crypto coins, at up to 1000x leverage. This platform is scheduled to launch in Q1 2025, causing hype in the crypto market. However, there have been plenty of products that DTX Exchange has launched so far: VulcanX Blockchain: The testnet for this blockchain was recently launched and saw a TPS of around 100k. Phoenix Wallet: A new wallet traders can use to secure assets like crypto coins, stocks, and forex. CoinMarketCap Listing: The DTX token was recently listed on CoinMarketCap. The DTX token will be the backbone of this platform. Those who hold it will get governance voting rights and a percentage of the trading fee revenue. DTX now costs only $0.12 in phase six of its presale, a 500% rise from its starting price. However, this altcoin price will rise to $0.20 after a top-tier CEX like Uniswap lists it soon. This could make DTX one of the top altcoins for big returns. Lucid: The price of Cardano may reach the top 3 spot Cardano is among the top 10 altcoins right now. Recently, crypto analyst Lucid made a bullish Cardano price prediction. According to his X post, this token will crush its next resistance level and skyrocket into the top 3 spots where it belongs. The Cardano price movement has jumped over 50% in the past 30 days. In that period, its value moved between around $0.70 and over $1, as per CoinMarketCap. Plus, its market cap grew from $25b to $38b. TradingView shows that the Cardano coin also trades above its 10-day EMA ($1.09) and 20-day EMA ($1.06). However, the high Cardano market cap suggests that it needs a lot of new money for its price to rise. On the other hand, tokens like DTX will not have this issue. Solana looks ready for breakout as price rises Solana is another altcoin with green price charts. CoinMarketCap data shows that the price of Solana increased nearly 5% in the past week alone. During that time, it fluctuated between around $210 and over $220. Market expert CrypNuevo also excited traders with his statement for Solana. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin is preparing for a potential breakout. As for his Solana price prediction, he foresees a surge past $280. Although the Solana crypto may see big price gains soon, traders have noticed that the DTX Exchange has some advantages. For example, the Solana blockchain saw a TPS of 65k, while the DTX one hit 100k. This could make it a better option for traders. Can DTX Exchange soar like ADA and SOL? While Cardano and Solana are riding a bullish wave, experts are also bullish for DTX Exchange. This crypto coin will have ties to the growing $133t bonds market and a smaller market cap than them. Therefore, DTX will need less money for its price to rise while possibly being more stable in the long run. Because of this, experts predict a potential 1,000% growth for this altcoin in 2025.

37844764,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105843,1734618809,Here’s the Bitcoin Price That Could Trigger MicroStrategy’s Liquidation,"CryptoQuant founder reveals the Bitcoin price that could trigger a liquidation event for MicroStrategy in an attempt to dismiss concerns. Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, remains one of Bitcoin's most prominent institutional investors. The company has consistently increased its Bitcoin holdings, despite the potential risks tied to such aggressive accumulation. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Liquidation PriceWhile the firm has seen massive gains, some critics like Peter Schiff have expressed concerns over these financial risks. Ki Young Ju, the founder of CryptoQuant, recently highlighted the Bitcoin market conditions that could trigger MicroStrategy's liquidation. https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1868906157584400813In an effort to emphasize how unlikely this scenario is, he stated that MicroStrategy's financial collapse would only occur in extremely catastrophic scenarios, such as an asteroid hitting Earth. At the time of his disclosure, MicroStrategy's BTC holdings were worth $46 billion. The company's outstanding debt stood at $7 billion, which places its liquidation price for Bitcoin at $16,500. This means Bitcoin would need to plunge to $16,500 for the company to risk losing its massive holdings. Notably, the last time Bitcoin saw this price level was in November 2022, in the aftermath of the FTX implosion.According to Ju, Bitcoin's historical price data reassures MicroStrategy of the safety of its position. For over 15 years, BTC's price has never fallen below the realized cost basis of long-term Bitcoin whales. Can BTC Drop Below the Old Whales' Realized Price?At press time, Bitcoin has maintained the $100,000 mark, currently trading for $102,268 despite yesterday's market bloodbath . Meanwhile, the cost basis for long-term whales currently stands at $30,000, much higher than MicroStrategy's liquidation price of $16,500.For context, ""long-term whales"" refer to Bitcoin holders with addresses containing over 1,000 BTC for more than 155 days. These addresses exclude wallets linked to exchanges or miners. Historical data reveals that Bitcoin has consistently traded above the realized price of these whales. Bitcoin came close to falling below this crucial realized price metric in November 2022, during the collapse of the FTX empire . At the time, Bitcoin's price sank to $16,600, perilously close to the $15,407 realized price of long-term whales. Despite the steep drop, market bulls managed to stabilize prices and prevent a further decline. This recovery showed the strength of Bitcoin's support levels, particularly when it nears the realized price of long-term holders. Since then, Bitcoin has remained well above the realized price metric, bolstering confidence in the resilience of its price floor.

The listing arrived with increased volatility, as traders complained of technical problems. Binance was one of the first major exchanges to list the new Pudgy Penguin token, PENGU. However, users reported errors that turned into costly trading losses. Binance listed PENGU on December 16, at 14:00 UTC, but social media users noticed that for the first 30 minutes of trading, the token was displaying a $350M market capitalization. The real valuation of PENGU was actually $3.5B, which led to early traders reporting significant personal losses. After the initial mistake, Binance worked with Coinmarketcap to display the correct data. At that time, DexScreener displayed the correct trading data. In the initial trading period, PENGU quickly discovered its equilibrium price range. The token started at $0.0032, later rising by a factor of 10 to $0.032. PENGU has not seen any price pressure in either direction, instead relying on price discovery through its available trading pairs. PENGU is still heavily traded through Raydium, rivaling its Binance activity. Other centralized exchanges listed the asset immediately, but they remain illiquid and only carry a small share of trading activity. In the past day, PENGU achieved $2.16B in trading volumes, with a turnover of 111.2% of the available supply, signaling a relatively high demand for scarce tokens. The token has more than 70% of its supply unlocked at this stage, with various groups of airdrop recipients. Holding PENGU is incentivized for governance, special perks, and access within the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. For short-term holders, PENGU may also be a speculative bid, as some airdrops have achieved significant gains soon after launching. PENGU smart contract was leaked early The Binance listing information for PENGU also contained the token’s smart contract. In a later version, Binance deleted the actual token address, waiting for the team announcement and wider listings. For a brief period, Binance displayed the token’s smart contract, potentially allowing bots to snipe the token. Later, the token contract was widely available on its Solana profile page. The information was important for early traders, as PENGU started trading alongside multiple spoofed tokens with similar names or tickers. Early trading for PENGU was also extremely risky, especially for those placing decentralized orders. The early data information led to unrealistic valuations, and some orders were filled at the wrong price through illiquid pools. During early trading, PENGU orders were filled at a price as high as $0.70, wiping out the portfolio of early traders. High volatility is not unusual for newly launched tokens. However, the high profile and expectations for PENGU exacerbated the problem, leading to traders being wiped out within seconds. Binance has reportedly decided on an additional airdrop of 135M PENGU to all affected traders to compensate for their early trading losses. However, the airdrop will not compensate those who logged losses through DEX swaps. Pudgy Penguins collection crashes after airdrop The PENGU token airdrop served as an accelerating factor for the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection. Airdrop seekers traded the NFT, lifting the price floor to over $100K. Pudgy Penguins contains only 8,888 items and is still the third most valuable NFT collection. However, the price floor crashed within hours of the airdrop announcement. The collection’s floor price crashed from a peak near 35 ETH down to 15 ETH. During the period of hype, some sellers liquidated their holdings at peak valuation. Others logged losses, as they bought too close to the top. Pudgy Penguins reached its all-time high in 2024, far surpassing its performance from the previous NFT boom. However, once the token is launched, the collection will have to find new sources of interest. The brand remains strong, but the performance of PENGU will be closely watched for signs of success or failure. The Pudgy Penguins brand managed to survive the NFT bear market by looking beyond crypto. The NFT tech was used for real-world products, making Pudgy Penguins one of the few projects with mass adoption and physical sales.

Bearish Pattern Yet to Be Confirmed Rekt Capital noted that the potential downtrend is not yet set in stone. “There are still a few days until the end of the week to ‘fully confirm’ the downtrend, and ‘lots can change’ in the meantime,” they stated. “Technically, this is still a dip until Weekly levels are confirmed as lost,” they added. Between 2 and 3 am UTC on Dec. 19, Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 for the first time since Dec. 13, reaching a low of $99,047, according to CoinMarketCap. This dip occurred amid a broader crypto sell-off following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s announcement of a 25 basis point rate cut and hints at fewer rate cuts in 2025 than initially anticipated. Not Everyone Is Concerned Some traders downplayed the dip. “This pullback is pretty normal for Bitcoin. We’ve had 8 of them since October,” Bitcoin Archive commented on X. “If you’re selling your Bitcoin in reaction to what the Fed said today, you have no idea what you own,” added crypto commentator James Lavish. Volatility Is Part of Price Discovery Bitcoin reached $100,000 for the first time on Dec. 5, driven by ETF demand, the upcoming April halving, and Donald Trump’s election victory. Rekt Capital reminded traders that volatility is natural in this phase. “Technically, it is Week 7 in Price Discovery, which historically meant that BTC corrections occur around this time,” they said. While some see such dips as “flash crashes,” Rekt suggested the correction could extend into next week, adding, “We know that Week 7 and Week 8 in Price Discovery have historically been corrective weeks.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-reclaims-100k-amid-mixed-market-sentiment/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37843190,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664971,1734618614,Bitcoin Data Reveals No Significant Panic Selling In The Market – Shakeout Or Trend Shift?,"Bitcoin faced a sharp retrace yesterday, dropping 8% from its all-time high of $108,300 after the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point rate cut alongside a revised policy signaling fewer cuts in 2025. Despite the drop, Bitcoin managed to hold above $98,000, a critical liquidity level that analysts are closely monitoring. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details This recent price action raises a pivotal question: is this the start of a more significant correction or merely a shakeout to fuel the next leg of Bitcoin’s rally? CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler provided key insights, noting that no substantial panic selling is evident in the market—a signal that investor confidence remains intact for now. Bitcoin’s resilience at current levels suggests the market is recalibrating following the Fed’s latest moves. As traders and investors digest these developments, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can recover momentum and push back toward its previous highs or if deeper retracements are on the horizon. With market sentiment hanging in the balance, the coming days will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s next direction. Bitcoin Remains Strong Despite the recent dip and a noticeable shift in market sentiment, Bitcoin remains resilient above key liquidity levels, maintaining its long-term bullish structure. The price drop, sparked by broader market reactions to the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement, has raised concerns, but Bitcoin’s ability to hold critical support underscores its underlying strength. Top CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler recently shared data on X, shedding light on the market’s current dynamics. According to Adler, no significant panic selling is evident, even after Bitcoin’s sharp decline. He highlighted a chart tracking the BTC short-term holder profit-loss to exchanges, revealing that this metric is currently at a higher level than seen during early December selling events. This indicates that the recent sell-off may have been less driven by fear and more of a strategic shakeout. This shakeout could serve to generate liquidity and provide the necessary momentum for Bitcoin’s ongoing rally. However, he also cautions that this could mark the beginning of a broader correction that might take time to fully develop. Related Reading: Solana Bull Flag Signals A Breakout To $300 – Analyst Shares Key Levels The coming weeks will be pivotal for Bitcoin. As the market stabilizes, traders and investors are watching whether Bitcoin can reclaim higher levels or if further downside consolidation is on the cards. Price Action: Technical Levels To Hold Bitcoin is currently trading at $101,800, following a successful test of local demand at $98,695 earlier today. The price structure remains intact, with Bitcoin forming a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows, signaling sustained bullish momentum. Despite the recent volatility, the market sentiment continues to lean optimistic as BTC holds above critical support levels. For Bitcoin to maintain its upward trajectory, a decisive push above $103,600 is essential. This level served as a significant pivot last week, marking a key zone for both buyers and sellers. Breaking through this resistance would likely signal renewed momentum, setting the stage for further gains as Bitcoin eyes new highs. However, failure to break above $103,600 could lead to a shift in sentiment. If BTC also loses the $100,000 psychological level, it would likely confirm the start of a broader correction. Such a scenario could drive the price toward lower support zones as the market recalibrates. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap?

37843187,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375358,1734618561,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Risks Facing Extended Retracement If it Loses This Level,"Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, briefly exceeding the $108K threshold in an impulsive rally. However, another Federal Reserve rate cut and some cautious comments unexpectedly resulted in a rejection, increasing the likelihood of an extended retracement. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin recently achieved a new all-time high of just over $108K following a powerful rally, breaking through the significant psychological resistance at $100K with remarkable momentum. However, the bullish momentum has since faded, and the price is exhibiting sideways movement. A recent Federal Reserve rate cut unexpectedly triggered a market shakeout, resulting in a notable pullback from the $108K level. This rejection, coupled with a bearish divergence on the RSI indicator, suggests the likelihood of a corrective retracement phase. The ascending channel’s middle boundary, around the $100K mark, is expected to serve as a critical support zone. Buyers may capitalize on this level to re-enter the market, potentially driving the asset back toward the $108K resistance region. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, BTC has displayed signs of weakening bullish momentum and increased volatility upon reaching the $108K resistance. The price has entered a phase of sideways consolidation, hinting at potential profit-taking and distribution by market participants. Currently, Bitcoin is trading within an ascending wedge pattern, often indicative of a short-term bearish reversal. A brief correction or distribution phase near the $108K level appears likely in the near term. While the broader uptrend remains intact, traders should exercise caution and avoid succumbing to FOMO. If a deeper correction unfolds, the asset could find support within the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels, providing a foundation for the next potential leg up in Bitcoin’s ongoing rally. On-chain Analysis By Shayan Long-term holders represent a critical segment of market participants, and monitoring their behavior can provide valuable insights into future market trends. The Binary Coin Days Destroyed metric is a key tool for analyzing their activity. This metric assigns a value of 1 when the Supply-Adjusted Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) exceeds its average and 0 otherwise. The accompanying chart illustrates the 30-day SMA of the Binary CDD metric alongside Bitcoin’s price. Spikes in this metric often signal potential selling pressure from long-term holders, as historically, significant price declines have followed such surges. Currently, the Binary CDD metric has seen a substantial spike, coinciding with Bitcoin’s recent achievement of a new all-time high at $108K. This surge suggests that long-term holders may view this price level as an opportune moment to distribute their assets, thereby reducing their market exposure. If this selling pressure intensifies, it could contribute to further volatility and a potential price correction.

Here Are Them,"Hong Kong has approved licenses for four more cryptocurrency exchanges as part of its efforts to streamline the licensing process and solidify its position as a global crypto hub. Hong Kong Crypto Exchange Accelerates Licensing, Approves Four New Platforms The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced on Wednesday that it has granted licenses to HKbitEX, Accumulus, DFX Labs and EX.IO under an “expedited licensing process.” These approvals come after the exchanges addressed regulatory feedback from on-site audits. The SFC has previously licensed three other platforms: OSL, HashKey, and HKVAX. Paving the Way for Crypto Expansion The latest approvals underscore Hong Kong’s commitment to promoting a crypto-friendly environment. In June 2023, the territory launched a comprehensive licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs), enabling licensed exchanges to offer retail trading services. Eric Yip, SFC’s Enforcement Director of Intermediaries, highlighted the regulator’s proactive approach to speeding up the licensing process. “We have been in close contact with senior management and final controllers of VATPs to ensure regulatory standards are met, which has expedited the process,” Yip said in a statement. New Licensing Requirements In a separate circular issued on Wednesday, the SFC detailed enhanced licensing procedures. Applicants must undergo: On-site inspection of activities. Comprehensive assessments of platform policies, systems and controls, which must be approved by a financial advisor. The SFC will oversee this second stage assessment through tripartite engagements involving the regulator, the applicant platform and external assessors. Once platforms meet these requirements, restrictions on their scope of work will be lifted. Future Developments Acting Secretary of Financial Services and Treasury Joseph Chan announced plans for an advisory panel to provide guidance to licensed crypto trading platforms. This panel is expected to be operational in early 2025 and further develop the regulatory framework. *This is not investment advice.

37842985,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375360,1734618113,Cardano Price Analysis: What Is Next for ADA After 7% Daily Drop to Below $1?,"Cardano recently initiated a strong upward rally, reclaiming its yearly high of $0.8 and advancing to the critical $1.3 resistance zone. However, the market is expected to enter a consolidation phase, with price fluctuations between the $0.8 and $1.3 range. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Weekly Chart Cardano has recently experienced a surge in buying pressure, rallying from the critical $0.3 support zone. This bullish momentum enabled ADA to reclaim its prior yearly high of $0.8 and reach the significant $1.3 resistance level. However, the $1.3 threshold remains a decisive barrier, with sellers exerting considerable influence, leading to a recent rejection. In the mid-term, ADA will likely undergo a retracement phase, potentially returning to the broken $0.8 level before resuming its upward trajectory. A successful rebound from this support could set the stage for a renewed rally, targeting the crucial $2 resistance zone and signaling the continuation of a long-term bullish trend. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, Cardano’s bullish momentum has waned after encountering resistance at the $1.3 level, highlighting significant selling activity. This led to heightened volatility and sideways consolidation around this critical zone. During this consolidation phase, a bearish reversal pattern for the head and shoulders formed, with the price now teetering near the pattern’s neckline. A confirmed breakout below this neckline could trigger a short-term correction, with the asset potentially retracing to the 0.5 ($0.82)–0.618 ($0.7) Fibonacci levels. This corrective move could allow buyers to re-enter the market, potentially fueling the next rally aimed at reclaiming the $1.3 resistance and setting the stage for further upward momentum.

Afterward, submit the entry, and MetaMask will notify you when the card is available in your region. The MetaMask team first announced the launch of the MetaMask Card pilot program earlier this year, following a partnership with Baanx (Crypto Life). At the time, the company made the payment card available to selected users in the United Kingdom and Europe. MetaMask Card Support The pilot program has been extended to other jurisdictions, including Switzerland, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. The U.S. is the latest addition, with the card currently available in all states except New York and Vermont. Since the card is currently in pilot, it supports only a few cryptocurrencies within the Linea Network. This includes USDC (USDC), Tether (USDT), and Wrapped ETH (WETH). However, USDT and WETH are not supported in the U.S. MetaMask might add more crypto assets on other networks before the card launches for public use. Meanwhile, users can also integrate the card with two mobile payment services, Google and Apple Pay, which allow contactless purchases on mobile apps. The timeline for the public launch of the MetaMask Card remains uncertain.

37844090,https://invezz.com/?p=2395998,1734618013,"MetaMask launches crypto debit card in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico","MetaMask introduced the MetaMask Card in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, a huge step forward for cryptocurrency followers in Latin America. This unique debit card enables users to easily spend their digital assets in real-time anywhere Mastercard is accepted, signalling a significant shift in the accessibility of blockchain technology for ordinary expenditures. The MetaMask Card works with the Linea network, allowing users to convert their cryptocurrencies, such as USDC, USDT, and WETH, into fiat currency on the fly at millions of businesses worldwide. This technology, developed in collaboration with Mastercard and Baanx, has the potential to open up new paths for cryptocurrency usage in places where traditional banking institutions may be less resilient. Bridging the gap between crypto and traditional retail “With the MetaMask Card, any merchant who accepts MasterCard can now accept cryptocurrencies, whether they are aware of it or not. The card takes advantage of Mastercard’s global commercial network, MetaMask’s security features and Linea’s efficiency,” the business explained in an official joint statement . The ease of using cryptocurrency for ordinary purchases is expected to greatly improve the user experience. Users will be able to buy gifts or other things without the lengthy processes typically connected with crypto transactions. The announcement emphasizes a long-standing issue for cryptocurrency users: finding merchants ready to accept digital currencies has frequently seemed like a treasure hunt, with real-world purchases rarely proving simple. However, with the advent of the MetaMask Card, consumers can now avoid the time-consuming steps of finding crypto-friendly businesses or obtaining authorization to spend their assets. A new paradigm for crypto spending Traditional cryptocurrency debit cards often require users to preload money onto the card via a third party before using it. In contrast, the MetaMask Card gives consumers full control over their assets. “With the MetaMask Card, you have complete control over your keys, card, and cryptocurrencies. There are no credit checks or banks involved—only your wallet, your assets, and your choices,” stated the release. This user-centric strategy tackles various concerns about cryptocurrency spending. I t enables consumers not just to better manage their cash, but also to use their digital assets without encountering excessive red tape. Furthermore, the practical ramifications of this innovation could have a transformative impact on mainstream cryptocurrency acceptance, particularly in emerging nations where fintech solutions are fast evolving. Increased access to more regions Excitingly, MetaMask has announced plans to expand pilot access for the MetaMask Card to new regions soon. This move will not only increase the card’s availability but will also benefit the whole crypto ecosystem in Latin America and maybe beyond. As the world embraces cryptocurrencies, initiatives such as the MetaMask Card mark a huge step toward seamlessly incorporating digital currencies into regular transactions. By utilizing globally known payment networks like Mastercard, MetaMask is not only removing hurdles for crypto consumers but also paving the path for a future in which cryptocurrency is as simple to spend as traditional currency. In conclusion, the introduction of the MetaMask Card in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico ushers in a new era of financial accessibility. As the services develop and more users have access to the card, the landscape of how we view and utilize cryptocurrencies may change dramatically, transforming once-distant digital assets into tangible tools for everyday life. With increasing acceptance and inventive solutions, the potential for cryptocurrencies in the mainstream market appears more bright than ever.

37842882,https://blockworks.co/news/tracking-trumps-crypto-footprint,1734617951,Tracking Trump’s crypto footprint,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . It’s probably safe to say that Donald Trump isn’t really signing transactions on Polygon and Ethereum himself. Still, those handling the crypto projects he’s linked to are doing their best to have Trump live up to his moniker: The First Onchain President. I’ve spent the morning compiling onchain data for Trump-linked crypto projects — his NFT collections (trading cards) and upcoming DeFi platform World Liberty Financial. The goal: Calculate the cumulative value of Trump’s onchain footprint. It was a quick analysis, but the data shows that Trump has so far raked in almost $84 million in crypto revenue in two years. Trump’s four NFT collections on Polygon have generated $7.7 million in crypto (WETH and POL fka MATIC). That revenue was derived from a mixture of primary sales and royalties on secondary sales. The first set of Trump NFTs went on sale two years ago almost to the day, in December 2022. (Note: The NFT collections have also brought in additional offchain revenue, as the project accepts fiat via credit card payments. Credit cards aren’t exactly onchain yet, so those sales have been left out of the totals above, although they could range in the millions.) NFT revenue and memecoin taxes are valued at current prices There’s also a suite of unofficial Trump memecoins that regularly pay a transfer tax to Trump wallets. Ultra small cap coins with names like “DT Inu” and “Take America Back” have gifted about $240,500 to Trump to date. The coins’ token contracts automatically forward small sums of USDC or ETH to Trump’s wallets every time they’re transferred, including when they’re traded on DEXs. This has resulted in sudden, short-lived bursts of additional crypto revenue for Trump’s onchain footprint. As for how much has been cashed out — whoever is handling Trump’s crypto has so far seemingly liquidated $3 million ETH on Coinbase. Trump’s address deposited 1,325.16 ETH to the exchange across November and December 2023, a sum that would’ve been worth $4.9 million if held until today. And then there’s the World Liberty Financial token sale. Which, until Tron founder Justin Sun aped in $30 million, appeared to run out of steam at just over $20 million. As of this morning, the WLFI offering has brought in over $75 million for the platform, with 80% ($61 million) of it coming in after Trump’s win in November, even if Sun was responsible for about half of that. It goes deeper: World Liberty’s wallet has also accumulated amounts of DeFi tokens AAVE, LINK, ENA and ONDO in the past week or so, altogether worth $5.2 million at current prices. The working theory is that World Liberty Financial is holding them as it is set to integrate with those protocols moving forward, especially in light of Ethena Labs’ newly-announced strategic partnership, as well as World Liberty’s Aave temp check for teaming up, made in October. Between all this and Trump’s spiritual purchase of a burger with bitcoin in the leadup to the election, it’s obvious that the President-elect is indeed deeper in crypto than any other Commander-in-Chief, and perhaps even any US politician. Still, it’s not without intrigue: World Liberty Financial just offloaded around $11 million in Coinbase’s wrapped bitcoin token cbBTC, while simultaneously picking up an equivalent amount of wBTC, as shown on the chart above by the purple and red shaded areas. Coinbase was recently locked in a brief legal battle with wBTC’s custodian, BiT Global, after the firm sued over the delisting of WBTC in light of Justin Sun’s reported affiliation. On Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that Coinbase could delist WBTC without worry. Whatever World Liberty Financial’s reason for switching wrapped bitcoin tokens, it all tracks.

Key Findings: Bitcoin (BTC) Surges to All-Time High, Derivatives Markets Show Cautious Optimism Despite a record-breaking spot price for BTC, the derivatives market reflects a more measured approach compared to previous highs this quarter. This suggests a potential reset in leverage after last week’s de-levering activity, leading to normalized funding rates, slower futures yield growth, and reduced preference for call options. Interestingly, futures exposure remains heavily concentrated in December’s end-of-year BTC contracts, with limited growth observed during the recent spot rally. Additionally, perpetual swap markets have seen funding rates return to neutral levels after a period of excessive leverage. Ethereum (ETH) Options Market Hints at Bullish Sentiment In contrast to the cautious derivatives activity surrounding BTC, the options market for ETH paints a different picture.

FARTCOIN, MONKY, and others gain market traction","Binance recently launched Binance Alpha, a new token listing mechanism designed to address the growing demand for early-stage crypto projects. The new platform is currently at the center of controversies after wrongfully announcing a batch of tokens that led to massive losses for investors. The platform made headlines this week when it mistakenly posted a list of “alpha watchlist tokens” in a Telegram channel, triggering a rapid surge in the price of certain tokens. Among the listed projects were Wise Monkey (MONKY), Happy Cat (HAPPY), Rifampicin (RIF), Zircuit (ZRC), and ai16zeliza (ELIZA), all of which were touted as having “strong fundamentals” and “active communities.” Binance quickly clarified that the information was erroneous. A spokesperson explained that unauthorized individuals had exploited a link shared by Binance’s Chinese language X account, setting up a fraudulent Telegram channel under the name “Binance Web3 Wallet Community” and publishing misleading information. Leaked Binance Alpha information: Source: Telegram The exchange emphasized that no official announcements regarding Binance Alpha tokens are made outside of the Binance Wallet app, warning users against taking such posts as gospel. What is Binance Alpha? Binance Alpha is deemed as the solution to the increasing skepticism around token listings on crypto exchanges. The analog is unlike Binance’s traditional listing process, which typically involves rigorous vetting. The platform allows users to directly participate in the price discovery of tokens through a “crowdfunding” model. Each cycle features a selection of tokens that users can vote on and trade, with the platform filtering and promoting the most promising projects based on trading volume and market interest. This open approach aims to boost Binance’s liquidity and create a new avenue for investors to participate in emerging projects at an early stage. Confusion and missteps fuel ‘pump and dump’ claims The first batch release misinformation sent the market into a frenzy, and some of the tokens mentioned soared before quickly plummeting after the exchange’s clarification of the matter. MONKY, saw a massive 38% spike in price before swiftly dropping by 22% after Binance’s official announcement. At press time, the token is changing hands at $0.00001658, after a price correction that almost saw it go back to its 24-hour high. MONKY market price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap At the time of the fake announcement, one unfortunate trader lost $102,000 within 12 minutes. The trader in question had purchased 1.42 million ELIZA tokens at $0.1376, only to sell them at a steep loss of over 50% after the price plummeted when the news was debunked. Binance Alpha’s influence on tokens Despite the earlier confusion, Binance Alpha has continued to push forward with the introduction of new token projects to the market. The platform recently announced the third batch of projects to be featured, including FROG, AICell, CGPT, and MONKY on BNB Chain, TERMINUS on Ethereum, and CLANKER and LUNAI on the Base network. Binance Alpha had earlier revealed its second batch of featured projects, including CKP on BNB Chain, GEAR, SD, and SYRUP on Ethereum, as well as memecoin FARTCOIN on the Solana network. FARTCOIN is the most popular coin in the batch, recently topping $1 billion in market cap, despite the current market bloodbath, per Coinmarketcap data . At the time of writing, the token, trading at $1.08, is up by more than 20% over the last day, which could have been fueled by Binance Alpha’s listing announcement. Moreover, market analysts have observed that FARTCOIN’s price action aligns with a clear five-wave impulse pattern. FARTCOIN price: Source: TradingView Recent movements suggest that the token has completed Wave 3, reaching the critical 1.618 Fibonacci extension level near $0.84. However, the token’s relative strength index (RSI) indicates overbought conditions, hinting at a potential Wave 4 correction on the horizon.

37842733,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375348,1734617561,"Exodus Crypto Wallet Debuts on Wall Street, Shares Skyrocket 36%","Exodus Movement Inc., the financial technology company behind the Exodus self-custodial crypto wallet, has officially entered Wall Street. It joins a select group of crypto-centric companies making their mark on major U.S. bourses, trading under the ticker “EXOD” on NYSE American, a sister platform of the New York Stock Exchange. Taking Wall Street by Storm The firm’s first full day on the market was eventful, with its stock surging 36.33% to close at $53.50 while registering an impressive intra-day high of $67.00, per data from Yahoo Finance. Interestingly, the performance dwarfed those of many other crypto-related equities, with the likes of Coinbase and Bit Digital shaving 10% and 12% off their share price, respectively, in the last 24 hours. Similarly, Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings dipped 12.15%, with its stock closing the day at $21.61. Despite the remarkable debut, Exodus’ journey to Wall Street was not without obstacles. It previously traded on over-the-counter markets before seeking approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to up-list to mainstream trading platforms. After initial delays from the regulator amid claims it was still reviewing the company’s registration, it finally got approval in December 2024 to list on NYSE American, which specializes in small and mid-cap assets. Some in the community view the company’s listing ratification as a sign of shifting regulatory sentiment following President-elect Donald Trump’s resounding victory in the November polls and the impending departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has been repeatedly accused of stifling the crypto industry through his “ regulation by enforcement ” approach. Pioneering Crypto Wallet Solutions Founded in 2015, Exodus has been at the forefront of non-custodial wallet development. It supports a wide array of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In August, the firm reported net losses of $10 million in its first quarterly filing since applying for a listing, a far cry from the $2 million profit made in the same quarter in 2023. However, at the time, CFO James Gernetzke stressed that it boasted a $121 million runway that included Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holdings. Despite the loss, year-over-year revenue went up 80% to $22.3 million as the crypto company expanded its services to more than 50 networks and added staking support for Ethereum and Solana.

The firm said the interactive tool will give users customizable insights into decentralized applications (dApps), token activity, and other blockchain trends. Blockaid’s new State of the Chain dashboard. High Demand for Investigation and Compliance Services There are already a number of firms such as Chainalysis and Elliptic that provide data on hacks in the digital assets space. In a press release shared with Cryptonews, Blockaid said that State of the Chain offers a comprehensive review of blockchain activity, from transaction volumes and popular infrastructure to funds stolen and the most prevalent security threats. It can also shed light on emerging risks such as malicious tokens and scams, which continue to pose significant challenges in the Web3 space. “Blockaid processes more transactions than almost any other Web3 infrastructure,” claims Ido Ben Natan, CEO and co-founder of Blockaid. “The data shows that Web3 is growing, and threat actors aren’t stopping. Fortunately, investments by wallets and chains in security prevented 71 million attacks that would have otherwise resulted in greater losses,” said Natan. Key Highlights from the Blockaid Dashboard Blockaid claims its platform prevented 71 million attacks in 2024, saving users from significant financial losses. Despite security efforts, cryptocurrency scams and fraud resulted in over a billion in user losses. According to the firm 59.3% of new tokens launched in 2024 were identified as malicious.Rug pull scams accounted for 27% of all malicious tokens, highlighting their continued threat to users and investors. In July Blockaid identified a sophisticated domain registry attack compromising multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, redirecting users to malicious websites. The incident sparked discussion on the vulnerabilities of DeFi applications that rely on Web2 infrastructure.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

Which Countries Have Demand? Here Are the Details,"The price of Bitcoin mining machines in Shenzhen, China has increased sharply, rising by 30% compared to last year, driven by the recent rise in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin Mining Machine Prices Soar in Shenzhen Amid Bitcoin Surge Mining equipment manufacturers and distributors in Shenzhen report increasing demand, with buyers coming mainly from Russia, the United States, Canada and other international markets. Russia Leads Demand with Low Electricity Costs Russia has emerged as a major buyer of mining machines thanks to its low electricity costs, which have significantly increased mining profitability, making the country an attractive location for large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. “The profitability of mining in Russia due to cheap electricity is driving bulk purchases of machinery,” said a Shenzhen-based distributor. Global Demand for Mining Equipment The recent surge in Bitcoin prices has revived interest in cryptocurrency mining and increased demand for high-performance mining hardware. Buyers from North America and Europe are also contributing to this increase, and miners are trying to take advantage of favorable market conditions. In Shenzhen, one of the world’s largest hubs for cryptocurrency mining hardware, this increased interest has tightened supply chains, pushing prices even higher. The rising cost of mining equipment signals renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency market, with miners preparing to expand their operations.

US plans to resume USD services in early 2025, anticipating changes in U.S. crypto regulations. The exchange halted fiat operations in 2023 due to regulatory pressure and SEC claims. Interim CEO Norman Reed noted on Wednesday that the current SEC administration has caused significant harm to American consumers and the crypto industry, including Binance.US. SEC’s Regulatory Assault In June 2023, the SEC accused the subsidiary of violating securities laws. It alleged the company offered unregistered investment products and engaged in anti-fraud practices. The platform has operated under restricted banking access since June 2023, when SEC civil claims triggered a suspension of dollar deposits and withdrawals. He noted that a key part of this regulatory assault was a concerted initiative by the outgoing administration to unjustly deny cryptocurrency and fintech businesses access to banking services. Reed argues that the SEC’s resistance to innovation has hindered the U.S. financial system’s potential and blocked most Americans from accessing the benefits of blockchain technology. Going Ahead With Optimism Despite ongoing legal battles with the SEC, he is optimistic, emphasizing that the SEC has failed to provide evidence of any wrongdoing after 17 months of compliance. Looking forward, with Paul Atkin’s nomination as the next SEC Chair, he foresees a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. As USD services prepare for a return, Binance.US plans to launch new features in the coming months and expand its product lineup. “While I can’t provide a definitive launch date yet, let me be clear: It is not a matter of if, but when,” interim CEO Norman Reed said in the statement. “We are closer than ever to restoring USD services and our plan is to achieve this important milestone in early 2025,” he added. He underscored that the platform offers unique features, including 0% fee Bitcoin trading on BTC/USDC, which no other major U.S. crypto platform provides. It also supports 160 cryptocurrencies and staking for over 20 assets, offering more options than any other major on-chain staking platform in the U.S. He strongly believes that 2025 will be a breakout year for Binance.US, with the teams working hard at building a comeback story for the ages.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/binance-us-to-resume-usd-services-in-early-2025-anticipating-favorable-regulations/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The round saw contributions from prominent angel investors affiliated with GitHub, Polygon, Veracode, and Monotype, the firm said in a press release shared with Cryptonews.com. The funds will be used to develop ‘The World’s Resource Blockchain ,’ a system designed to connect global resources, empowering AI agents to autonomously execute payments and perform tasks across multiple platforms. AI Agents Face Challenges in Performing Real-World Actions AI agents have gained attention in recent years, with major corporations like Google introducing AI initiatives such as Project Mariner. However, most AI agents today face significant limitations in performing real-world actions due to access barriers like API keys, OAuth credentials, and KYC requirements that require human intervention. Skynet’s decentralized approach aims to eliminate these barriers. “Businesses today are designing for human users, but the next big wave is designing for AI agents,” Vishnu Korde, Founder and CEO of Skynet shared with Cryptonews . “Skynet’s resource blockchain enables agents to access services, execute payments and engage with apps that would generally require human intervention.” Skynet’s solution addresses a major challenge in the emerging Agent Economy. The company’s Smart Access Points allow AI agents to interact with global services, such as Booking.com, AWS, StackAI, Shopify, and more, autonomously and transparently. This capability removes the need for manual intervention, enabling seamless connections and reducing operational friction for AI-driven tasks. The Skynet interface provides AI agents with access to resources, transaction capabilities, and integration with decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple virtual machines (VMs). Unlike existing systems that require multiple wallets, gas tokens, or blockchain bridges, Skynet’s approach facilitates direct and efficient cross-chain interactions. Skynet’s Infrastructure is Built on Orbit Chain Skynet’s infrastructure is built on Arbitrum’s Orbit chain, offering advanced payment and tracking mechanisms. This allows AI agents to complete real-life tasks, including booking flights, managing accommodation, and handling financial portfolios. Such capabilities position Skynet as a key player in the development of the Agent Economy. Korde predicted that there would be at least as many AI agents by 2030 as there are humans on the planet. “We expect these AI agents to become new consumers, acting as proxies on behalf of humans—a challenge no organization is currently prepared to address.” Likewise, Ravikant Agrawal, Director of Growth at Polygon Labs, claimed that the AI ‘bull market’ is just beginning, and its growth will outlast any crypto market cycle.” “Skynet is purpose-built to enable AI agents to perform real-world actions, a necessity that will only grow as the agent economy accelerates over the next decade.” The post Skynet Secures $1.2M to Advance Decentralized AI Agent Payments Worldwide appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MATIC | SPONSORED,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/skynet-secures-1-2m-to-advance-decentralized-ai-agent-payments-worldwide/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37842724.jpeg

Ethereum ( ETH ) slipped to $3,540, marking a 10% drop from its peak earlier this week. This retreat coincided with the sell-off of other coins like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ). Despite the price drop, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. Notably, Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds have seen steady inflows, now totaling over $2.46 billion. These inflows have increased for 18 consecutive days, reflecting growing interest from investors. Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction as investors anticipate the SEC may soon allow staking within these funds. Currently, the absence of staking options has likely deterred some institutional investors from fully embracing these ETFs Funds by companies like Grayscale, Blackrock, Fidelity, Bitwise, and VanEck are the biggest holders of Ethereum. Meanwhile, the number of staked ETH coins has continued rising. There are now over 54.7 million ETH tokens , are now staked, supported by a growing base of more than 206,000 unique stakers.

Yet, as investors are hunting for the next crypto moonshot in 2025, 1FUEL’s presale has quietly become the ultimate play. 1FUEL presale’s first stage sold out at lightning speed, rewarding early adopters with a 20% price boost and raising over $600k. Could this emerging gem be the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now? Let’s find out. Can XRP hit $18? The post-election rally’s crypto king Ripple’s XRP has shot up 115% in just a month and 310% over the past year. It’s now firmly positioned as the third-largest crypto, with a massive $140 billion market cap, comfortably seated behind only BTC and ETH. This surge comes on the back of Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse announcing the launch of RLUSD, a new stablecoin set to debut on Dec. 17 on major exchanges like Uphold and Bitstamp. Regulatory approval from New York authorities signals Ripple’s intent to disrupt the $203.5 billion stablecoin market. RLUSD aims to boost XRP’s utility, especially in cross-border transactions, enhancing its appeal. Yet, XRP still trades 20% below its all-time high of $3.40 from January 2018. While speculation swirls about XRP hitting $18, the upcoming bull market and RLUSD’s adoption could determine if Ripple’s vision becomes a reality. 1FUEL: The best cryptocurrency wallet revolutionizing digital asset management In a sea of DeFi projects, 1FUEL emerges as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2025. While XRP dominates cross-border payments with strong institutional ties, 1FUEL carves its path by tackling secure, anonymous digital asset management. Designed as a next-gen cryptocurrency wallet , 1FUEL simplifies cross-chain transactions, solving a pain point for multi-chain users. With one-click functionality and cold storage, it sets a new standard for privacy and convenience. Built-in privacy mixers make it the ultimate solution for everyday investors seeking anonymity amid regulatory scrutiny. 1FUEL integrates P2P trading and offers crypto staking rewards up to 30% APR, making it a passive income powerhouse. Virtual and physical debit cards bridge the crypto-fiat gap, attracting mainstream adoption and challenging traditional banks. Value drivers like network effects and an ongoing presale offering unmatched growth potential make 1FUEL stand out. With analysts predicting a 100x surge post-launch, early investors are already seeing 20% returns from Stage 1 of the presale, where over $600k has been raised. Stage 2 offers a 20% bonus, and over 30% of tokens have already found their proud owners. 1FUEL’s blend of privacy, usability, and rewards makes it the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2025. The bottom line XRP’s rally is undeniably impressive, but its path to $18 hinges on stablecoin adoption and market cycles. In contrast, 1FUEL’s presale success and innovative features make it a key project in the DeFi space. And, with crypto adoption at its peak, the market timing couldn’t be any better. With a 20% bonus available now, and early-stage backers already reaping 20% returns, this is your chance to catch a rising star.

37842723,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321068,1734616820,BitDCA Secures $2M to Launch Bitcoin Savings App ‘Littlebit’,"BitDCA , a fintech innovator based in the Czech Republic, has raised $2 million in pre-seed funding to launch a Bitcoin savings app called ‘Littlebit.’ Founded in 2019, BitDCA aims to simplify long-term Bitcoin investment by introducing a user-friendly dollar cost averaging (DCA) solution, the company said in a press release shared with Cryptonews.com. The Littlebit app allows users to automatically save a percentage of their everyday spending into Bitcoin, making savings modern, accessible, and potentially lucrative. BitDCA’s Littlebit Aims to Address Major Financial Gap With 27% of U.S. adults reportedly lacking any form of savings, as per Bankrate , BitDCA’s initiative addresses a critical financial gap. High expenses, debt burdens, and the absence of convenient saving methods are key barriers for many individuals. BitDCA’s Littlebit app seeks to change this dynamic by embedding micro-savings into routine purchases. Users link their existing debit or credit cards to the app, set a savings percentage, and the system takes care of the rest—automatically converting a portion of each transaction into Bitcoin. Unlike other services like Revolut, which require dedicated accounts or specific payment cards, Littlebit’s key differentiator is its ability to operate with existing payment cards. This allows users to save without the need for a new financial account or card, offering unmatched convenience. Once users select their preferred savings percentage, Littlebit automatically converts the specified amount from each card transaction into Bitcoin, turning everyday purchases into effortless investments. DCA is a well-regarded investment strategy that spreads investment risk over time. This approach allows users to avoid the impact of market volatility by making smaller, regular investments rather than large, one-time purchases. In the context of Bitcoin, DCA has shown promising results. For instance, a user who spent EUR 630 monthly on card purchases and allocated 5% to Bitcoin savings would have accumulated EUR 2,646 over seven years. Historical Bitcoin price trends reveal that this investment would have appreciated by approximately 704%, reaching a value of EUR 21,576. “Given its uniqueness and accessibility, Littlebit has the potential to appeal to a massive user base globally, opening the way to sustainable saving and potentially enormous profits in the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency space,” commented BitDCA CEO and founder Jan Zaruba. Expansion into the Czech Republic and Poland by 2025 The company’s operational plan includes market entry in the Czech Republic and Poland by Q1 2025, followed by expansion into the UK. Compliance with regulatory and legislative requirements in these markets is already underway, positioning BitDCA for further global growth. It is worth noting that the BDCA Token plays a vital role in BitDCA’s ecosystem, offering users the chance to earn rewards and actively participate as stakeholders. Over 800 tokenholders have already supported the project’s development, signaling strong community backing. “We have been fans of Bitcoin since 2014, and are now building key infrastructure for Bitcoin with the BitDCA project,” Zaruba added.

37842327,https://coinpaper.com/6642/deutsche-bank-develops-ethereum-based-blockchain-for-compliance,1734616800,Deutsche Bank Develops Ethereum-Based Blockchain for Compliance,"The cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors continue to evolve as major players announce strategic developments aimed at addressing scalability, regulatory compliance, and user experience. From Deutsche Bank’s push to integrate blockchain technology with regulatory safeguards through its Project Dama 2 initiative to Lens’ $31 million funding round for scaling its SocialFi-focused layer-2 blockchain, these moves show the industry's efforts to balance innovation with practical adoption challenges. Deutsche Bank Develops Layer-2 Blockchain with ZKsync for Compliance and Efficiency Deutsche Bank , Germany's largest financial institution, is reportedly developing its own layer-2 (L2) blockchain solution on Ethereum. Utilizing ZKsync technology, the initiative aims to address the intricate compliance challenges of integrating public blockchains into regulated financial operations. This marks a significant step in the bank's adoption of blockchain technology, setting a precedent for other financial institutions. Deutsche Bank's L2 blockchain, known as Project Dama 2, is part of a broader initiative under Singapore's Monetary Authority (MAS) called Project Guardian. This collaborative program brings together 24 financial institutions to explore the tokenization of assets on blockchain networks. According to a report by Bloomberg , Project Dama 2 is designed to enhance transaction efficiency while embedding regulatory safeguards into its infrastructure. Unlike traditional public blockchain applications, Project Dama 2 aims to integrate blockchain transparency with strict compliance mechanisms. This innovative approach is expected to reduce risks such as exposure to sanctioned entities while ensuring that financial regulations are adhered to. The platform will feature trusted validators and grant regulators special oversight capabilities, ensuring a secure and compliant ecosystem. The bank plans to release a minimum viable product (MVP) for its L2 blockchain in 2025, but regulatory approval remains a critical milestone for the project's success. Deutsche Bank’s foray into blockchain technology could have far-reaching implications for the financial sector. By addressing compliance concerns through advanced regulatory tools, such as ”super admin rights,” the bank is setting a precedent for how blockchain can coexist with traditional financial systems. This move could pave the way for greater adoption of decentralized networks by financial institutions. The integration of features like transaction monitoring and auditing aligns blockchain's transparency with the stringent requirements of regulated finance. If successful, Deutsche Bank's approach may inspire other banks and financial institutions to adopt blockchain solutions for asset servicing and cross-border transactions. Moreover, this initiative could reshape perceptions around blockchain technology, highlighting its potential to enhance efficiency without compromising regulatory oversight. The project sheds some light on the evolving role of financial institutions in the blockchain space, positioning Deutsche Bank as a leader in the convergence of traditional banking and decentralized technology. Layer-2 blockchains are designed to operate on top of layer-1 networks like Ethereum, offering enhanced speed, lower transaction costs, and improved scalability. These qualities are essential for financial institutions looking to adopt blockchain technology at scale. By leveraging ZKsync, Deutsche Bank's L2 blockchain can ensure high-performance transactions while maintaining Ethereum's security and decentralization. The use of zero-knowledge proofs adds an extra layer of privacy and efficiency, enabling the platform to handle sensitive financial data without compromising on security. Additionally, the platform’s regulatory features, such as “super admin rights,” provide a controlled environment where regulators can monitor and audit transactions when necessary. These tools ensure that the L2 blockchain adheres to compliance requirements, addressing a significant barrier to blockchain adoption in regulated industries. Partnership with Crypto.com Deutsche Bank's blockchain ambitions are not limited to Project Dama 2. On Dec. 10, the bank partnered with leading cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com to provide corporate banking services across the Asia-Pacific region. This partnership spans countries including Singapore, Australia, and Hong Kong, and includes fiat-to-crypto exchange services and cross-border trading support for crypto companies. This collaboration is part of Deutsche Bank’s broader strategy to integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency services into its core offerings. The bank has also hinted at expanding its partnerships to the United Kingdom and other European countries, signaling its commitment to becoming a key player in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Despite its innovative vision, Deutsche Bank faces several challenges in bringing Project Dama 2 to fruition. Regulatory approval will be a critical factor in determining the project’s success. Financial regulators will need to assess the platform's compliance mechanisms and its ability to operate securely within existing legal frameworks. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain technology into traditional banking operations presents technical and operational hurdles. Ensuring seamless interoperability between decentralized and centralized systems will require robust infrastructure and significant investment. A New Era for Blockchain in Finance Deutsche Bank's initiative marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of blockchain and traditional finance. By addressing compliance challenges through innovative solutions like ZKsync-powered Layer-2 technology, the bank is setting the stage for a new era of financial services. As the project moves toward its anticipated 2025 launch, it will be closely watched by regulators, financial institutions, and blockchain enthusiasts alike. Success could position Deutsche Bank as a trailblazer in blockchain innovation, encouraging wider adoption of decentralized networks across the financial sector. Lens Secures $31M to Revolutionize SocialFi with Layer-2 Blockchain on Ethereum In related news, Lens, a layer-2 blockchain platform developed by Avara, has raised $31 million in a funding round led by Lightspeed Faction. The funds will be allocated to scaling the network's infrastructure in preparation for its mainnet launch, scheduled for early 2025. This milestone positions Lens as a key player in the emerging SocialFi space, aiming to redefine the way decentralized applications engage users. Lens is designed specifically for SocialFi use cases, providing developers with a suite of customizable plug-and-play features. According to its Version 3 developer preview, the platform offers tools like accounts, usernames, social graphs, feeds, and groups, along with monetization capabilities. These features are designed to seamlessly integrate into any application built on the Lens blockchain, making it a versatile and developer-friendly platform. Stani Kulechov, the founder of Lens and CEO of Avara, emphasized the platform's mission to make blockchain technology more accessible for mainstream adoption. “Existing L2s are still too costly for mainstream adoption. To bring Web3 SocialFi to the mainstream, we’re building the fastest, cheapest, and safest L2,” said Kulechov. Lens aims to deliver the user experience (UX) of Web2 applications while leveraging the unique benefits of blockchain technology, such as data ownership, control, and portability. “For participants, Lens will offer the best UX and multiple monetization opportunities to build their own financial rails,” Kulechov added. Built with ZKsync technology, Lens leverages the data availability protocol Avail to ensure fast and cost-efficient transactions without compromising on security. Its infrastructure is further bolstered by partnerships with prominent blockchain projects and companies, including: Alchemy: Providing developer tools and APIs for efficient application building. Chainlink: Integrating decentralized oracle solutions for secure off-chain data. The Graph: Offering indexing and querying services for decentralized applications. MetaMask: Ensuring seamless wallet integration for users. Uniswap: Facilitating decentralized trading and liquidity solutions. USDC: Enabling stablecoin functionality for financial transactions. These collaborations aim to create a robust ecosystem where developers and users can interact seamlessly, fostering innovation within the SocialFi space. The $31 million funding round attracted a diverse group of investors, including Circle, Consensys, Foresight Ventures, Wintermute Ventures, and angel investors like Rune Christensen, Anurag Arjun, Anton Bukov, Spencer Noon, and Illia Polosukhin. Lens was launched in May 2022 by Kulechov, who is also the founder of Aave, the renowned DeFi protocol. In November 2023, Aave Companies rebranded as Avara and launched a $250,000 grant program to incentivize developers building on Lens. Around the same time, Avara acquired the company behind the Family crypto mobile wallet, further consolidating its position as a leader in blockchain innovation. Lens and AaveDAO’s Partnership with Trump-Backed WLFI In an interesting twist, AaveDAO recently approved a proposal from World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a Donald Trump-backed platform, to launch an instance of Aave on Ethereum . The partnership agreement includes a share of 20% of the fees generated and 7% of WLFI’s governance tokens. While Lens is not directly involved in this development, it shows the expanding influence of Avara and its ecosystem in both blockchain technology and global finance. Lens’s unique focus on SocialFi and its ability to integrate plug-and-play features into decentralized applications mark it as a potential game-changer. By offering tools for developers, monetization opportunities, and user-centric data control, Lens aims to make blockchain technology accessible to mainstream users. With its innovative approach, strategic partnerships, and strong backing from industry leaders, Lens is set to redefine the SocialFi landscape. As the mainnet launch approaches, the project will likely draw significant attention from developers, users, and investors eager to explore the future of decentralized social and financial applications.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6642/deutsche-bank-develops-ethereum-based-blockchain-for-compliance,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

These promotions , which typically occur over a span of years, were made discreetly and without fanfare, raising questions about their timing and purpose. According to John Reed Stark, a crypto-skeptic and former SEC official, Gensler’s actions are an attempt to leave a lasting imprint on the SEC before the new chair, Paul Atkins, takes over. As the White House prepares to appoint a new leadership team, including a crypto czar, these five senior officers will likely remain in place, potentially causing conflicts when the new chair attempts to reverse Gensler’s crypto-focused policies. Of the five promotions, four of the officers have been highly successful in the SEC’s crypto enforcement efforts. These individuals have been pivotal in cracking down on cryptocurrency firms, and their success has earned them recognition as top crypto-enforcement lawyers. However, Stark argues that Gensler’s maneuver places these accomplished professionals in a difficult position as they may find themselves at odds with the incoming SEC leadership under Paul Atkins, who is expected to pursue a different direction, particularly in terms of crypto regulation. Conclusion: While some see Gensler’s actions as a last-ditch effort to solidify his legacy, others view it as a selfish and politically motivated maneuver that undermines the SEC’s future direction. The timing of these promotions, just before President Trump’s term ends, has also sparked debate, with Trump having made promises to overhaul the SEC’s approach to crypto. This situation also highlights cases like Ripple’s. Many believe that under Atkins, the case could be dismissed or have a more favorable outcome. However, it remains to be seen what Gensler will do during his final days and how his actions might affect the Ripple case, especially with the January 15 hearing approaching.",NEUTRAL,XRP,ALTCOIN | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-genslers-last-minute-promotions-raise-questions-about-ripple-case-outcome/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

But while XRP is also down by 3% in a week, the altcoin remains up by a very impressive 115% in the past month, as well as by 285% in the past year. Much of this growth has come from whales, with Santiment data revealing that large traders have been stockpiling XRP in recent weeks .

This has led some analysts and traders – including Ali Martinez – to predict that the alt is heading towards $4 during the current cycle. This would represent a 68% increase from its current price, and a 700% surge from where it was on the eve of the US election. Needless to say, this election has completely changed the game for XRP, with the arrival of the pro-crypto Trump leading to a changing of leadership at the SEC .

Donald Trump had a meeting with Ripple. #XRP WILL MELT FACES pic.twitter.com/qp6CMbRTdY — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) November 15, 2024 Trump’s win could spell the end of the SEC’s appeal in its case with Ripple, while meetings between the President-elect and Brad Garlinghouse may bring substantial growth for the cryptocurrency firm. Looking at its chart today, it looks ready to bounce back from the selloff of the past 24 hours. Source: TradingView Its RSI (purple) has bounced back from 30, while its 30-period average (orange) is about to climb back over the 200-period (blue). As such, XRP could hit $2.50 by the end of the week, and $2.80 by the end of the year. Alternative Alts for Market-Beating Gains As strong as XRP is right now, there’s always an outside chance that it may have peaked already during the current cycle. If so, traders may prefer to move to smaller cap alts, which are nearer to the beginnings of their lifecycles, and therefore more exposed to big growth spurts. This especially applies to presale coins, which can often generate enough momentum during their sales to rally hard once they list for the first time. One very new coin that looks like it’s already attracting lots of momentum is Solaxy (SOLX) , which launched its presale only a week ago. Despite launching only last week, it has already raised $2.8 million, which is massive for such a new project. The reason why Solaxy is already creating such a buzz is that it’s gearing up to launch Solana’s first layer-two network. Its main draw is that it will help Solana users avoid failed transactions, outages and congestion, which have plagued the layer-one network during periods of peak traffic . As the native token of Solaxy’s L2 network, SOLX will serve as payment for transactions fees, giving it big utility. It will have a max supply of 138.046 billion SOLX, with 25% of this going to its sale and rewards for early supporters. Interested investors can join its sale by going to its official website , where SOLX currently sells at $0.00157. This price will rise multiple times during the sale, so investors should act sooner rather later. This will help them to lock in the biggest possible gains, with SOLX having the fundamentals to rocket once it launches.

A ruling earlier today rejected Justin Sun-backed BiT Global’s claims and permitted Coinbase to remove Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ) from the exchange’s listings. Coinbase’s removal of the token was due to Sun’s association with BiT Global and Tron’s ecosystem since the former had no direct control over wBTC’s custody. You might also like: Justin Sun allegedly asked CoinDesk owners to remove banana article: report CoinDesk reported that according to Robert Liu, the additional participation of Sun would help improve wBTC prospects owing to Tron’s global market leadership.

Its high turnover rate and its integration with stablecoin ecosystems have forever plagued Tron but are the very things supporters point to as signs of its strength.

Whether you like him or not doesn’t change that. A quick look at his resume tells you this is a guy with a level of intelligence only few have ever attained. Now as head of the Federal Reserve, he oversees the world’s most powerful central bank, a machine designed to keep the financial system in line. Then here comes Bitcoin, the decentralized, no-rules wild card of global finance. It’s absolutely no surprise that Powell is skeptical. But the reasons for his hate go deeper than surface-level complaints about volatility or hype. The Fed boss sees Bitcoin as a threat, not just to stability but to the entire financial order he’s tasked with maintaining. During his infamous press conference yesterday, Powell doubled down on where he stands. “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change.” But it’s not even what he said. It’s how he said it. The comment was in response to a question that has to do with President Donald Trump’s proposed Bitcoin strategic reserve, and Powell almost looked insulted at it before he opened his mouth. As expected. Predicting his rate cut patterns might be hard, but it’s pretty easy to see that Mr. Powell will never like Bitcoin, even if he secretly respects it. And guess what? That’s completely fine. We’re not here to change his mind. Bitcoin’s bad image: Incels, degens, and chaos traders Bitcoin’s reputation doesn’t help its case either. While Wall Street giants and institutional investors Powell respect have started to embrace it, the crypto is still deeply tied to its roots in online subcultures. Terms like “incels” and “degens” get thrown around in Bitcoin communities, referring to high-risk traders who often treat the market like a casino than a strategic investment space. These are people hyping coins with memes, driving up prices with no basis in fundamentals, and cashing out before the crash. This speculative madness fuels Bitcoin’s extreme price swings. For someone known to be a calculated overthinker, Powell doesn’t have to look far to see the chaos here. Literally, just after his comments yesterday, the top crypto shed 5% of its value in mere hours, dragged down in part by the US stock market. Right there, that’s the problem. The toxic reputation extends beyond trading behavior. Online Bitcoin communities often come across as hostile and shockingly sexually inappropriate, alienating women and high-level thinkers like Powell. And if we’re being honest, Trump being pro-Bitcoin could also be seen as a red flag. Trump, Bitcoin, and the war over a strategic reserve Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, an idea as bold as it is controversial, if not a bit ludicrous. Under the plan, the Treasury would purchase 200,000 Bitcoins annually, building a reserve of one million tokens. The funding would come from Federal Reserve deposits and gold holdings. So Trump would literally need a go-ahead from Powell to launch this thing. Analysts at Barclays believe the plan would face “stiff resistance” from the Fed. And as we’ve reported before, Powell has rare bipartisan support so strong that he’d easily defeat Trump in a face-off. He kind of already is. The way we see it, this guy is the most powerful person in the world. A single action of his will affect every single life in the world right now. Now to Powell, the idea of a Bitcoin reserve funded by the Treasury is an affront to the very principles of central banking. Why would he risk the global economy and his legacy just to appease the Oval? Powell doesn’t even need to argue against the bill, the numbers speak for themselves. A single comment from him can shave hundreds of billions off Bitcoin’s market cap overnight. Imagine what would happen if the Fed actually tried to hold it. Keep in mind that America is the largest economy on earth. If it goes down, everyone’s gonna go down. Powell’s resistance isn’t just about practicality. It’s also philosophical. The Federal Reserve exists to stabilize the economy, not to gamble on assets that spike and crash with tweets or Reddit posts. Powell’s approach is rooted in decades of financial experience too. Before leading the Fed, he worked at The Carlyle Group, a private equity powerhouse. He’s seen firsthand the dangers of unregulated markets, and Bitcoin checks all the wrong boxes. Powell’s long history of skepticism Powell’s career is a case study in risk aversion. As Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, he dealt with the intricacies of financial regulation and policy-making. His role during the 2008 financial crisis shaped his perspective on stability and oversight. His leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic required aggressive monetary interventions to stabilize markets. Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against fiat currency collapses may hold to an extent, but to Mr. Fed, it’s just a nuisance — a volatile asset that could disrupt the delicate balance he works to maintain. However, it’s not unknown that Powell tends not to like being told what to do, especially when it’s coming from the man who publicly harassed and criticized him time and time again. He just might be itching for a fight. Yesterday, he said he doesn’t see them cutting rates for the most part of next year, which means they’ll be high. Trump hates that. He’ll talk. He’ll verbally attack Powell a lot. And that’ll only make him hate Bitcoin and everything else the president supports even more. Sure, Trump could sit down and have a chat with Powell, maybe even win him over. But he’s Trump, so it’s safe to assume that he likely won’t be doing that. When it comes to the 2025 Fed, Mr. President is the wrong hype man for Bitcoin.

Between the flood of data, volatile market swings, and the constant fear of missing out (FOMO), it is easy to feel overwhelmed. Staying focused on the right strategies and tools can often mean the difference between success and missed opportunities. While many tools are available, not all meet the diverse needs of a trader like myself—from social media monitoring to tracking whales’ behavior. Yet, the good news is that whispers of new features and strategies from emerging platforms, such as Wisdomise , which I happened to be a user of since two months ago, hint at tools that could further simplify my decision-making and boost trading confidence. I thought about sharing my recent experience with these emerging intelligent tools with you. Wisdomise has this cool product called Coin Radar that has recently gained attention among traders and influencers for its ability to provide real-time insights, helping users navigate complex market conditions more effectively. There are growing discussions within the crypto community about potential upgrades to the platform as well as some news about the future of the platform being exclusive to the company’s token ($WSDM) holders only (while I’ve heard they are planning for some token-burning mechanisms as of next year as well). While the implications of these updates remain speculative, some analysts suggest they could influence the token's future value and exclusivity of the underlying platform. Let's explore four key tips to help you stay ahead and win in the crypto market in 2025 - all reflecting on my first-hand experience with Wisdomise’s products over the last few weeks. Analyzing Social Media and News: Stay Ahead of the Curve When it comes to fundamental analysis, news and social media can make or break a token, with trends often taking off on platforms like X before appearing anywhere else. A message from a major influencer, a new partnership announcement, or a regulatory update can cause prices to soar—or plummet—within hours, if not minutes. This makes monitoring social media and news channels crucial for spotting opportunities early. Take Elon Musk's tweets about Dogecoin as an example: traders who caught the tweet early and acted quickly saw significant gains. If you are not actively tracking crypto X or monitoring major headlines, you risk falling behind. However, manually scanning through all this data on social media is nearly impossible (and we talk about millions of messages daily) and can distract you from executing your overall strategy. That is why AI tools are becoming essential for consolidating and analyzing this data in a timely manner. Among the available tools, let’s consider Social Radar, one of the Coin Radar’s core features. It analyzes millions of posts across platforms like Reddit, X, and Telegram in real-time, offering actionable insights and timely signals about each moving coin. With its multi-source integration, the Social tab compiles insights from various social platforms, offering a centralized view of market sentiments. The Markets tab focuses on identifying current trading opportunities and market trends, while the Technical Ideas tab aggregates trading insights from sources like TradingView, helping traders access relevant data to support their trading decisions way faster than traditional ways. Using Indicators: Leverage Data for Smarter Decisions Technical analysis remains a cornerstone for traders looking to predict price movements. In the crypto market, indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are among the key metrics traders use to predict price movements. They provide valuable insights into market conditions, but they come with their own set of shortcomings. RSI helps identify overbought or oversold conditions, yet it can be misleading during strong trends, where prices continue rising or falling despite extreme levels. MACD tracks momentum and signals buy/sell opportunities, but it often needs to catch up to price action, making it less useful in fast-moving markets. For traders, the challenge is understanding the inner dynamics of these indicators and knowing when to trust them. Relying too heavily on one can lead to false signals, while trying to incorporate multiple indicators can be overwhelming and confusing. Again reflecting on my experience with Wisdomise’s products, their Technical Radar is presumably using AI to simplify technical analysis , offering dynamic visualizations and real-time insights - in new ways, even for active traders like myself. As markets become increasingly volatile, such tools are becoming indispensable for navigating complex price movements. Technical Radar offers dynamic heatmap visualizations and multi-timeframe monitoring for RSI, making it easy to spot overbought/oversold conditions and patterns. For MACD, it tracks trend strength, momentum, and signal line crossovers and detects divergences. After getting used to their way of presenting technical indicators, it is not easy to switch to the old-school use of these indicators anymore. Following Smart Money: Track Major Players With Confidence Large players—whether whales, institutions, or major funds—are the invisible force behind many market movements in crypto (if not all financial markets). Their substantial trades can trigger sharp price shifts and influence the overall sentiment. For example, a whale accumulating Bitcoin can signal a bullish momentum, while a sudden sell-off might trigger widespread fear. By tracking whales’ trades, you can gain an advantage in spotting trends before they become mainstream. However, it is also important to note that whales can sometimes manipulate the market, and by the time most traders react, it may be too late. While monitoring whale movements offers valuable insights, it is not always a surefire way to profit. Identifying the right whales and pinpointing promising tokens requires time, effort, and precision. In my opinion, in 2025, platforms offering accurate and timely whale tracking tools will become increasingly popular. Interestingly, Wisdomise has thought about this angle as well with its Whale Radar, which enables traders to monitor significant transactions, detect accumulation or sell-off trends, and act quickly based on where “smart money” is flowing. Real-time visibility into major players’ movements can provide the sort of competitive edge traders need to identify trends early before they hit mainstream attention in order to capture supernormal yields.. 4.Bonus Hint: Whispers of Upcoming Upgrades and Features As traders look for reliable tools to navigate, some major platforms are generating buzz with rumors of new upgrades to their offerings. Referring to my personal experience with Wisdomise products, whispers among analysts and influencers point to significant news on the horizon, including a burning mechanism (hence, deflationary economy) for their $WSDM token, which could reduce the total supply and drive up value through scarcity. Adding to this some degree of exclusivity they are seemingly planning to impose in favor of their token holders brings $WSDM to my hot watchlist for 2025. They seem to have a new which, to my best of knowledge without testing or using any, involves AI automation covering multiple blockchains (sources have said TON, SOL and ETH thus far), which potentially can revolutionize DeFi trading. If done well these AI-driven automations, alongside accurate, real-time insights, will help traders of all levels stay ahead of the market and capture real profits through 2025. These potential upgrades could reshape the platform’s role within the crypto community, further solidifying its value to traders. While details remain speculative, analysts are keeping a close eye on developments that can impact the price and utility of $WSDM. All in all if these rumors materialize in reality, they may set a new standard for AI-powered crypto trading in the year ahead. Winning in the 2025 crypto market will require more than intuition; it demands access to cutting-edge tools and strategies. As tools evolve and new technologies emerge, traders who leverage these advancements in their favor will be best positioned to thrive in the next chapter of crypto’s bull market. Stay tuned until we’re back with new insights and more tips that turn you into a pro trader over time. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Explosive Growth in Solana DApp Revenue According to Syndica, a research platform focused on blockchain analytics, Solana-based DApps collectively earned $365 million in November. Among these, the memecoin launchpad Pump.fun stole the spotlight by becoming the first Solana DApp to generate over $100 million in monthly revenue. Specifically, Pump.fun raked in a staggering $106 million in November, further cementing Solana’s position as a hub for thriving decentralized applications. Memecoin-related DApps have proven to be the largest revenue generators within Solana’s DApp ecosystem, with a remarkable $509 million earned this year. These applications alone have experienced an explosive 300-fold growth in 2024, with November alone contributing a hefty $183 million to their total. Pump.fun Faces Backlash Despite the financial success, Pump.fun’s rise wasn’t without controversy . On November 25, the platform was embroiled in criticism after disturbing reports emerged of users engaging in or threatening violent acts during livestreams. In response, Pump.fun paused its livestreaming feature indefinitely, pledging to introduce better moderation systems to prevent such incidents in the future. This move, however, led to a sharp decline in the platform’s weekly revenue, which fell by 66% in the final week of November. The weekly earnings dropped from $33.8 million to just $11.3 million after the livestream feature was halted. Despite the revenue drop, Solana’s ecosystem continued to shine with other top-performing DApps such as the token discovery platform Photon and the decentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium, which also contributed heavily to the overall revenue surge. The data indicates that Solana’s DApp sector has been largely fueled by DeFi and memecoin applications, with DeFi alone accounting for 83.7% of the total revenue generated in 2024. Interestingly, memecoin DApps have outpaced traditional DeFi applications in terms of revenue growth. Alongside these, other sectors such as Telegram bots and Spot DEXs have also contributed significantly. With the surge in DApp revenue, Solana has demonstrated not only its ability to attract top-tier projects but also its potential to capitalize on emerging trends, including the memecoin boom.

37841521,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395209,1734615016,Over $700M Liquidated—Is a Larger Pullback Incoming for the BTC Price Rally or Is This a Buy the Dip Opportunity?,"The post Over $700M Liquidated—Is a Larger Pullback Incoming for the BTC Price Rally or Is This a Buy the Dip Opportunity? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets started the day’s trade having a major bearish influence after the latest interest rate cuts. The Bitcoin price plunged below $100K when the Fed Chair commented negatively on asking his opinion about the national Bitcoin reserve. However, the token has led a strong recovery as it rises above $102K in a short while suggesting the traders may have utilised yet another ‘buy at the dip’ opportunity. But what led to the downfall? The liquidations play a major role in impacting the prices of cryptos, mainly Bitcoin. Ever since the token started to rise above $100K, the longs started accumulating heavily above $105K and extended to $107K. However, these were expected to close, which triggered a massive pullback. As per the data from Coinglass, the markets have witnessed over $782 million in liquidation in the past 24 hours, which may have slashed the prices hard. However, Bitcoin liquidity is still sitting above $102K, which may appear scary but eventually flashes a bullish signal in the long term. Here the accumulation of longs at levels just above $102K suggests the price is about to experience a notable pullback after surpassing these levels. This could be the reason why the BTC price is facing a major hindrance in surpassing these levels. On the other hand, a huge pressure is being mounted here, which may compel the price to accumulate around this range. With this, there is the possibility of a short squeeze that may push the prices higher, probably above $110K. On the other hand, the BTC dominance has displayed a major comeback by heading back to 60%. In the times when the dominance was expected to drop below 50%, the latest reversal above 58% suggests a major reversal could be fast approaching. The levels have triggered a rebound and considering the previous price actions, the levels are believed to reach the upper resistance. This suggests the price is in the middle of the prevailing bull run and hence the next bullish wave could push the price towards new highs. However, as it happened earlier, a rejection may follow, triggering a fresh bearish wave across the markets, probably in the second half of 2025.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/over-700m-liquidated-is-a-larger-pullback-incoming-for-the-btc-price-rally-or-is-this-a-buy-the-dip-opportunity/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37844762,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105758,1734614849,Dogecoin to Surge to $30 as DOGE Repeats Same Price Action of 2021: Top Analyst,"While Dogecoin has recently been caught in a massive bearish onslaught, analysts are issuing bold statements about a potential rebound. Yesterday, Dogecoin’s price dipped to $0.34 after trading in the $0.40 range earlier. While the meme coin has yet to recover from this drop, some market watchers are already predicting a rebound to as high as $30.Among those voicing this ambitious forecast is Trader Tardigrade on X. According to him, Dogecoin’s next pump is on the way. The foundation of this perspective comes from Dogecoin’s historical chart, especially when analyzed from a weekly timeframe.Dogecoin Historical PatternsIn this Dogecoin price news , chart highlights that Doge exhibited a double bottom during the bear cycle of 2019 and 2020. Following these occurrences, a descending channel pattern surfaced, from which a major breakout materialized.His chart shows that Dogecoin similarly registered two bottoms in the 2022 and 2023 bear markets, followed by a descending channel formation that led to another breakout. Dogecoin chart by Trader Tardigrade Another key point from the chart was the cooling off after Dogecoin’s initial speculative rally in the first quarter of 2021. While DOGE traded with two zeros in Q4 of 2020, it erased one zero in its run into the new year.Specifically, the meme coin soared from around $0.002452 in November 2020 to $0.08495 by February, representing a massive growth of 3,366%.However, Dogecoin later entered a consolidation phase, during which it traded around $0.05 for a few weeks before breaking out again. Specifically, by April 2021, the trend shifted, and Dogecoin dramatically surged by 677% from $0.05529 to above $0.43 in the same month.Dogecoin Following This PatternAnalyst Tardigrade believes Dogecoin is perfectly mirroring this pattern with its ongoing price action. Tardigrade expects a turnaround to unfold soon for Dogecoin. He anticipates that Dogecoin will similarly establish giant green candles in the coming weeks, as seen in historical patterns.In the scenario where Dogecoin fully mirrors the 2020/2021 period, Tardigrade expects Dogecoin to rally as high as $30. From the current price of $0.3633, reaching $30 would represent a massive return of 8,158% for those holding Dogecoin today during this dip.It’s worth noting that at a $30 price, Dogecoin would have a market cap of over $4 trillion, which is a highly speculative scenario. Despite this, other market watchers have argued for a similar price point for Dogecoin in this cycle.Meanwhile, conservative estimates for Dogecoin this season include a $3 price and an $8 target.",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/19/dogecoin-to-surge-to-30-as-doge-repeats-same-price-action-of-2021-top-analyst/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dogecoin-to-surge-to-30-as-doge-repeats-same-price-action-of-2021-top-analyst,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

What does this mean? Blockchain isn’t the future—it’s the present and those who delay adopting it risk being left behind. This shift is clear in popular crypto coins like Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and BlockDAG. The Toncoin (TON) price prediction hints at a rise to $100 by 2030, driven by its advanced blockchain infrastructure. The Shiba Inu upgrade introduced liquid staking on ShibaSwap, offering flexibility for traders, creators, and liquidity providers in the DeFi space. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) remains the trio's most significant. Its newly launched Whitepaper and Litepaper showcase its ability to transform the NFT space with unmatched speed, affordability, and scalability. The network’s presale has raised over $169 million in a matter of months, with the $600 million targeted milestone arriving sooner than expected! Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction: Could $100 Be Possible? The Toncoin (TON) price prediction for 2025-2030 is lighting up discussions as analysts map out its growth potential. With a blockchain capable of handling high transaction volumes, TON is primed for real-world use. Toncoin’s price prediction suggests TON could reach $100 by 2030, powered by technical advancements, growing adoption, and broader market trends. Of course, crypto’s volatility means nothing is guaranteed, and factors like regulations or macroeconomic shifts could just as easily bring the coin’s price crashing down. Still, for those keeping a close watch, TON’s price prediction and utility make its future look promising. Shiba Inu Upgrade Brings Liquid Staking to ShibaSwap The Shiba Inu upgrade is leveling up ShibaSwap with a game-changing addition: liquid staking. This new feature allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards without permanently locking their assets. Users can stake their TREAT tokens, and receive “veTREAT” tokens in return—liquid assets that can be traded or used across DeFi platforms. For creators, traders, and liquidity providers, this upgrade adds flexibility and new opportunities to maximize participation and earnings. With over 2.42 million BONE staked since its Shibarium debut, ShibaSwap’s evolution continues to make SHIB one of the most popular crypto coins in decentralized finance offerings. BlockDAG Envisions an Affordable & Scalable NFT Infrastructure The hottest crypto since Bitcoin—BlockDAG—has stormed back into conversations once again. With over $169 million in presale revenue, 17.4 billion coins sold, and a staggering 2240% price surge since Batch 1, BDAG’s growth is hard to ignore. The network’s newly launched Whitepaper and Litepaper have become the key focal points in the market. These documents paint BlockDAG’s crystal-clear vision for redefining NFTs—fast, affordable, and built to scale. Traditional blockchains have long weighed creators and collectors down with sky-high fees and slow transactions, stifling growth and creativity. BlockDAG flips the script entirely. Its architecture allows NFTs to be minted and traded seamlessly at a fraction of the cost, without sacrificing speed. Artists keep more of their earnings, while collectors enjoy low-cost, reliable transactions—ultimately paving the way for a thriving, expansive community. BlockDAG’s full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility is another game-changer. Supporting NFT standards like ERC-721 (non-fungible coins) and ERC-20 (fungible coins), developers can migrate Ethereum-based NFT projects to BlockDAG with ease—no rewriting code or reworking systems. Brands and communities can showcase collections effortlessly while building stronger, more engaged audiences. But what does this have to do with BlockDAG’s $600 million crypto presale target? Essentially, the NFT focus will only draw in more creators, developers, and collectors—driving exponential community growth. And when community demand surges, BlockDAG’s value skyrockets. With $169 million already in the bank, the $600 million milestone feels inevitable. In a Nutshell — Popular Crypto Coins What’s the takeaway from the Toncoin price prediction, the Shiba Inu upgrade, and BlockDAG’s NFT infrastructure? Blockchain’s growth is unstoppable, and these popular crypto coins prove it. Toncoin’s solid infrastructure aims for $100 by 2030, while Shiba Inu’s liquid staking upgrade cements its place in DeFi. However, BlockDAG raises the stakes even more. This Layer 1’s newly launched Whitepaper and Litepaper present a clear vision for NFTs—faster transactions, lower costs, and real scalability. This winning formula is now pushing the network’s $169 million presale toward the $600 million target. Long story short: For developers, artists, or holders, now is the moment to jump inyo BlockDAG’s presale—before this “hottest coin since Bitcoin” potentially climbs to Bitcoin’s level or perhaps even beyond!

37841190,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-altcoin-season-at-the-door-analysts-evaluated-the-possibility-of-alt-bull/,1734614287,Is Altcoin Season at the Door? Analysts Evaluated the Possibility of Alt Bull,"Bitcoin’s historic surge past $100,000 has solidified its position in “uncharted waters,” but the altcoin market is in disarray, with some tokens struggling to keep up while others promise a boom. Bitcoin has become the clear leader of the 2024 crypto bull market, with an impressive 150% year-to-date performance. In contrast, most altcoins have lagged behind, including the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum is up just 69% this year and has yet to reclaim its 2021 all-time high. However, altcoins like XRP and Solana have outperformed most of the market, emerging as potential leaders in what analysts are calling the next “alt season.” Historically, an altcoin season begins when Bitcoin’s dominance of the total crypto market cap decreases, typically below 40%. Currently, Bitcoin accounts for 54% of the $3.86 trillion crypto market cap, suggesting that the market has yet to fully transition into an altcoin rally. Related News: Why Is Bitcoin Price Falling? There is Sudden Pullback According to Mena Theodoru, co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, Ethereum will play a key role in signaling the change. “Historically, when momentum shifts from Bitcoin to ETH, it signals broader market confidence in altcoins or the start of an altseason,” Theodoru said. Ethereum’s surge above $4,000 for the first time since March has reignited investor optimism, with over $2 billion inflows into ETH-based exchange-traded funds this month alone. Bitstamp USA CEO Bobby Zagotta echoed this sentiment, predicting an imminent altcoin season. “We’re on the cusp of that,” he said. “Altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin in certain areas, and that could rival the bull market we’ve seen in 2021.” *This is not investment advice.

37841478,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630355,1734614140,OpenAI brings ChatGPT to your phones – Not just smartphones,"OpenAI is increasing its competitiveness by reaching new heights that others have not yet achieved. This time, ChatGPT has been implemented on landlines. As of Wednesday afternoon, the AI-powered assistant of OpenAI began to respond via landline. ChatGPT can now respond to inquiries submitted via telephone and execute assignments such as translating a sentence into a different language . The experience is nearly identical to Advanced Voice Mode, OpenAI’s real-time conversational feature for ChatGPT, except for multimodality. 1-800-ChatGPT pic.twitter.com/2eLPgR8Bpp — OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 18, 2024 According to reports, the AI behemoth is providing U.S. users with 15 minutes of complimentary calling, after which the call will end. The company says standard carrier fees may apply. In addition, the company announced that Canadians can also use ChatGPT on their telephones. OpenAI introduces ChatGPT on WhatsApp ChatGPT is available on WhatsApp for individuals who prefer to text the AI assistant. The company also made it a basic back-and-forth exchange, given that WhatsApp does not offer customization options in the official ChatGPT app. You can now talk to ChatGPT by calling 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478) in the U.S. or by sending a WhatsApp message to the same number—available everywhere ChatGPT is. pic.twitter.com/R0XOPut7Qw — OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 18, 2024 In addition, the company has announced that it is currently developing additional functions for the WhatsApp integration, including web search and image analysis. OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said, “Our mission at OpenAI is to make artificial general intelligence beneficial to all of humanity, and part of that is making it as accessible as possible to as many people as we can.” Additional developments in ChatGPT One of OpenAI’s successful projects is the expansion of ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode feature, which was done last month. It allows users to talk to the AI chatbot right from their browser. Advanced voice mode enables users to engage in natural, real-time conversations with ChatGPT by leveraging the inherent audio capabilities of OpenAI’s GPT-4o. The chatbot is capable of comprehending and responding to non-verbal cues, such as the pace of speech. The chatbot is also capable of engaging in emotional responses. OpenAI disclosed the GPT-4o mini, a diminutive model that is supposed to be cheaper. The GPT-4o mini broadened the scope of applications that could be developed with AI by reducing the cost of intelligence. According to OpenAI, the GPT-4o mini currently outperforms the GPT-41 in chat preferences and scores 82% in MMLU. Also, last week, the company announced during a live stream that advanced voice mode, its conversational feature for ChatGPT, was undergoing vision enhancements. Users who have subscribed to ChatGPT Plus, Team, or Pro can aim their phones at objects and have ChatGPT respond in near real-time using the ChatGPT app. Moreover, advanced voice mode with vision is capable of understanding the contents of a device’s screen through screen sharing. For instance, it can provide guidance on a mathematical problem or clarify a variety of settings menu options. OpenAI maintains its lead in the generative AI field According to Cloudflare 2024, ChatGPT played a more prominent role in the generative AI space and the overall ranking, nearly reaching the Top 50. The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked global interest in generative AI, which subsequently evolved into a global phenomenon in 2023. Still, ChatGPT remains the most popular service in its category, which encompasses chatbots, coding bots, and other services, as of 2024. Comparison of AI tools. Source: Cloudflare In comparison to 2023, the evaluations of other generative AI services were more consistent this year. However, the company has been caught up in several legal cases recently. In the Northern District of California, three plaintiff groups filed a complaint against OpenAI. The complaints allege copyright infringement, vicarious copyright infringement, DMCA violations, and torts related to the entity’s GPT models and ChatGPT service. These cases are now made up of Tremblay v. OpenAI, Silverman v. OpenAI, and Chabon v. OpenAI. Analysts are still unsure of how the company will look in the future. AI firms tend to spend a lot of funds on development. One thing that has been apparent this year is that AI entities are desperate to convert their popularity into consistent revenue.

As these giants grapple with scalability and network challenges, analysts are turning their attention to emerging projects like Lightchain AI (LCAI) . Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, LCAI stands out as a blockchain gem poised to achieve 7,402% ROI by the end of 2025, fueled by its innovative features and real-world applications. Ethereum and Solana Giants with Slowing Growth Ethereum and Solana have both achieved tremendous success, each carving out dominant roles in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. However, these projects now face barriers to further exponential growth. Ethereum’s Scalability Concerns The network still struggles with high gas fees and transaction delays, limiting its appeal to cost-sensitive users and developers. Solana’s Reliability Issues While Solana offers low costs and fast speeds, repeated network outages have created uncertainty, slowing down its ecosystem expansion. These challenges are shifting investor focus to newer projects like Lightchain AI, which combine innovation with untapped potential. Features That Make Lightchain AI Stand Out Lightchain AI has been praised for its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Intelligence (PoI), but it also offers several underappreciated features that make it a formidable contender in the blockchain space. Decentralized AI Training FrameworksLightchain AI enables nodes to participate in collaborative AI model training while preserving data privacy. Using technologies like federated learning, developers can train AI systems without centralized control, creating equitable and secure AI advancements. Dynamic Resource AllocationThe network’s architecture dynamically allocates computational resources based on task complexity, ensuring that both lightweight and resource-intensive tasks are processed efficiently. This scalability sets it apart from traditional blockchains. On-Chain AI Data MarketplacesLightchain AI is developing a decentralized marketplace where businesses can securely trade AI datasets and models. This feature introduces a new revenue stream for enterprises while expanding blockchain’s role in AI innovation. Regulatory PreparednessDesigned with global compliance in mind, Lightchain AI incorporates transparent governance and privacy-preserving mechanisms, making it suitable for enterprise adoption in regulated industries like healthcare and finance. Why Analysts Predict 7,402% ROI for Lightchain AI Analysts believe Lightchain AI has the potential to achieve 7,402% ROI due to its focus on solving real-world challenges, rather than merely competing for crypto speculation. Here’s why. Expanding Market Reach With a presale price of $0.003, Lightchain AI offers one of the lowest entry points for a project targeting both blockchain and AI markets, which are expected to grow exponentially by 2025. Enterprise Integration Partnerships with industries like logistics and banking are already in the pipeline, ensuring steady adoption and increased token demand. Early-Stage Advantage As a project still in its infancy, Lightchain AI provides a rare opportunity to enter before its value multiplies during its testnet and mainnet launches in 2025. The Role of Governance in Lightchain AI’s Ecosystem Not like a lot of blockchain plans, Lightchain AI focuses on group-led rule. Token owners get a clear voice in forming the platform’s path, from tech change͏s to system ties. This way makes sure that the network grows in line with user and maker wants. Also, the site uses square voting, a way that stops big owners from taking over choices. This part makes rule-making fairer and builds more trust between users. Also, Lightchain AI’s own token, LCAI , gives many uses in the system, like staking and voting to get advanced tools like AIVM and PoI. As the project gets more attention, need for LCAI tokens is likely to grow increasing its ROI chance. How Lightchain AI Can Surpass Ethereum and Solana Lightchain AI stands out by addressing key limitations in Ethereum and Solana, providing significant advantages. By optimizing resource allocation, it reduces transaction fees while delivering better performance, making it a cost-effective solution. Advanced cryptographic techniques, including homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs, enhance privacy and security, creating a platform that is more robust than its predecessors. Additionally, Lightchain AI prioritizes interoperability through cross-chain integrations, enabling seamless functionality with Ethereum and Solana. This approach broadens its user base while ensuring compatibility across platforms. What the Future Holds for Lightchain AI Investors Lightchain AI’s roadmap is designed to drive continuous growth and innovation. Key milestones include. 2024 Prototype development and community engagement, laying the foundation for its ecosystem. 2025 Testnet and mainnet launches, marking the transition to full functionality. Beyond 2025 Expansion into new industries through enterprise partnerships and open-source collaboration. Long-Term Vision Lightchain AI aims to become the go-to platform for decentralized AI and blockchain integration, powering innovative solutions in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. With its combination of innovation, scalability, and real-world utility, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to lead the next wave of blockchain advancements. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Analysts are eyeing $3.8 and $5 key levels as XRP’s target before the end of Q1 2025. However, while XRP's accumulation pattern hints at substantial growth, an emerging contender, Rexas Finance (RXS), might outperform XRP with its real-world asset tokenization model and explosive growth potential as it shows potential to rally 11,233% in the next 4 months. XRP's Accumulation and Breakthrough Potential The present accumulation phase of XRP reflects the trend before its explosive November rise. With a $7.9 billion trading volume over 24 hours, the market activity around XRP is vigorous and suggests a significant breakout. Analysts are intently tracking key levels at $3.2 and $3.5 as price targets for XRP. Strategic alliances and increasing use cases in cross-border payments drive even more hope around XRP. Though XRP presents a promising future, the crypto scene has plenty of possibilities, so Rexas Finance is becoming a powerful substitute investment choice. Why Might Rexas Finance Outperform XRP? Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out with its original idea of real-world asset tokenization. The platform enables tokenizing assets representative of the real world, such as gold, real estate, and art, which makes it possible for a physical asset to be integrated with blockchain technology. With this creative strategy, RXS has an excellent runway for expansion since it targets a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Originally priced at $0.030 in stage 1, RXS has risen 400% to its current price of $0.15 during its ongoing presale. Thus far, the presale has raised $28,767,708 by selling 350,949,106 tokens. In early 2025, with only one presale stage remaining, RXS will launch at $0.2 on three out of the top ten tier-1 exchanges. A strong competitor in the crypto market, RXS might soar by an astonishing 11,233% to reach $17, according to analysts. Important Characteristics Supporting the Expansion of Rexas Finance Rexas Token Builder lets anyone tokenize assets without writing code, simplifying asset tokenizing. The launchpad of the platform facilitates people's fundraising for their tokenized initiatives. Rexas Finance supports ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, addressing a broad spectrum of use cases and investor requirements. Rexas Finance's community-oriented approach avoids venture capital funding using a Certik audit, which guarantees security and transparency and empowers individual investors. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko Listings: Being listed on these sites increases awareness and gives investors real-time tracking and consistent data regarding RXS. With over 540,877 submissions thus far, Rexas Finance's ongoing $1 million giveaway has attracted much interest. Each of the twenty lucky winners will get $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each, improving the platform's popularity and promoting community involvement. Completing activities and distributing the giveaway on the Rexas Finance website will help investors increase their chances. RXS vs. XRP: Growth Projections Although XRP is expected to reach a possible price objective of $5 by Q1 2025, the trajectory of RXS's growth is much more fascinating. With a presale price of $0.15 as of writing and an expected post-launch increase to $17, RXS presents an unmatched return on investment. The platform's emphasis on actual asset tokenization gives it a competitive advantage that draws both conventional and bitcoin investors. Why Now is the Time to Invest in RXS With the Rexas Finance presale nearing its last stage, there is a small opportunity to get RXS tokens for $0.15. The presale will close soon, and RXS will launch at $0.2 afterward, a quick 35% rise before launch. The platform is a fascinating investment because of its strong foundations, creative elements, social potential, and mechanics. Though XRP's market action and accumulation pattern encourage development, ignoring Rexas Finance's growing potential is impossible. With its innovative real-world asset tokenizing mechanism, community-centric approach, and explosive presale performance, RXS is set to surpass numerous well-known cryptocurrencies, including XRP, in 2025. Before it's too late, investors searching for the next great crypto prospect should consider joining the RXS presale.

37842338,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/toncoin-ton-lightchain-ai-likely-to-outpace-solana-and-xrp-say-bloomberg-analysts,1734613573,"Toncoin (TON), Lightchain AI Likely to Outpace Solana and XRP, Say Bloomberg Analysts","The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity, and Bloomberg analysts are weighing in on the next big players set to dominate the space While Solana (SOL) and XRP have been mainstays for crypto investors, a surprising shift in sentiment has placed Toncoin (TON) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) in the spotlight. With Lightchain AI still in its presale phase at just $0.003, analysts believe its innovative approach and untapped potential make it a standout for 2025. Toncoin’s Rise as Telegram’s Blockchain Backbone Toncoin has go͏t a lot of notice as the main support of Telegram’s Open Network (TON). Made to provide quick, safe, and big blockchain solutions TON fits well into Telegram’s system giving it a ready base of more than 700 million users active. Main reasons for Toncoin’s chance to lead are its part in online payments, functions in apps, and NFT help within Telegram. These uses place Toncoin as a tough rival to well-known layer-1 blockchains like Solana! But, though Toncoin’s use is speeding up the rise; its growth path might not keep pace with the fast chance of new projects like Lightchain AI. Solana and XRP Holding Their Ground but Facing Competition Both Solana and XRP have established themselves as leaders in the blockchain space. Solana remains a favorite for DeFi and NFTs due to its fast transaction speeds and low costs, while XRP continues to dominate in the cross-border payments sector, with widespread institutional adoption. However, both projects face challenges: Solana’s Scalability Issues: Despite its success, network reliability concerns and competition from newer blockchains threaten its dominance. XRP’s Gradual Growth: While XRP’s legal clarity has bolstered confidence, its focus on institutional finance means slower adoption compared to retail-driven projects. These limitations create room for innovative projects like Lightchain AI to capture investor attention. And, with the looming challenge of Ethereum 2.0, which aims to address scalability and transaction costs, established projects like Solana and XRP may need to further innovate to stay ahead. Lightchain AI The Emerging Star in Blockchain Innovation Lightchain AI is redefining the blockchain landscape by integrating artificial intelligence into its core. Unlike Solana and XRP, which cater to specific niches, Lightchain AI positions itself as a versatile platform capable of addressing real-world challenges across industries. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart? AI-Powered Blockchain ApplicationsAt the center of Lightchain AI is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a platform for building decentralized applications that leverage AI for tasks like machine learning, predictive analytics, and automation. Proof of Intelligence (PoI)Lightchain AI’s unique consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, making the network both efficient and resourceful. This approach ensures that blockchain energy is used meaningfully while advancing AI innovation. Deflationary TokenomicsWith a deflationary model that reduces supply over time, Lightchain AI ensures long-term value appreciation for early investors. Ambitious RoadmapLightchain AI’s roadmap includes a testnet launch by Q1 2025, followed by a mainnet launch in March 2025. Plans for enterprise partnerships and cross-chain integration further boost its appeal. Why Bloomberg Analysts Favor Toncoin and Lightchain AI Analysts suggest that while Solana and XRP remain strong contenders in the crypto space, Toncoin and Lightchain AI are better positioned for significant growth thanks to their innovative strategies and untapped markets. Toncoin benefits from leveraging Telegram's vast user base, giving it a unique edge in adoption and utility, particularly for decentralized payments and NFTs. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI stands out with its focus on integrating AI and blockchain technology. Combined with its early-stage pricing, this positions it as a high-potential investment. Analysts predict that Lightchain AI could deliver 1,000x returns by 2025, far surpassing the likely growth rates of Solana and XRP. Lightchain AI Presale Phase A Millioner-Maker Opportunity With Lightchain AI's presale still ongoing and its low price point, investors have a rare opportunity to get in early with the potential for massive returns. As Bloomberg analysts suggest, investing in emerging projects like Toncoin and Lightchain AI brings higher risk but also offers potentially bigger rewards compared to established players. With innovative technologies driving their growth, these projects could be set to outpace current crypto leaders like Solana and XRP. Plus, with Lightchain AI's AI-powered blockchain technology and ambitious roadmap, the potential for mass adoption and integration into everyday life gives it a unique edge in the competitive crypto market. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

37842718,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321114,1734613505,Coinbase Dismisses Justin Sun-Linked BiT Global Lawsuit Over wBTC Delisting,"Coinbase , the prominent cryptocurrency exchange, has successfully fended off an attempt by Hong Kong-based BiT Global Digital Limited (BiT) to block the delisting of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) from its platform. BiT Global lost. Today they asked the Court to order us to stop from delisting wBTC to protect our customers. Today the Court said no. We appreciate the Court’s consideration and the outstanding advocacy of Sonal Mehta and her team at @WilmerHale . — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 18, 2024 BiT, a firm allegedly linked to crypto entrepreneur and Tron founder Justin Sun , sought emergency legal relief to prevent the delisting. It claimed that it would cause irreparable harm to its business and the broader crypto ecosystem. However, the U.S. District Court ruled against BiT, siding with Coinbase’s argument that the delisting was a necessary step to protect its customers and uphold the integrity of its platform. At the heart of the dispute was Coinbase’s assertion that Justin Sun’s involvement with BiT and its joint venture with BitGo raised significant concerns for them about the custodianship and reliability of wBTC. Coinbase cited Sun’s controversial reputation, marked by allegations of fraud , market manipulation, and ongoing investigations by U.S. authorities, as a critical factor influencing their decision. Coinbase’s Vs. Bit Global: Are Justin Sun’s Allegations True? Coinbase’s filing against BiT’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction detailed its rationale for delisting wBTC. Source: CTFAssets The exchange emphasized that its decision was based on its robust internal review process, which evaluates digital assets for legal compliance, technical soundness, security, and overall risk. According to Coinbase, the review that led to wBTC’s delisting was initiated after BitGo announced a joint venture with BiT and Justin Sun. Sun’s involvement, a figure associated with multiple allegations of financial misconduct, including fraud and market manipulation, raised red flags for them about the custodianship of wBTC. Coinbase further argued that BiT’s evasiveness regarding the joint venture’s ownership structure and Sun’s role exacerbated concerns. The exchange stressed that, as a private company, it retains the right to determine which assets it lists or delists, particularly when the imperative to protect users from undue risks drives such decisions. Coinbase also highlighted its history of delisting assets that fail to meet its rigorous standards, pointing out that wBTC accounted for less than 1% of its trading volume, with most transactions involving the asset occurring on other platforms. This, they argued, minimized any potential harm to the public caused by the delisting. The court’s ruling affirmed Coinbase’s stance, noting that BiT had delayed seeking emergency relief, which undermined its claims of urgency. Moreover, the court dismissed BiT’s assertions of irreparable harm, pointing out that monetary losses could be addressed through damages if warranted. The decision also rebuffed BiT’s allegations under California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL), affirming Coinbase’s right to protect its platform from assets linked to questionable actors. Justin Sun’s Reputation As A Focal Point Justin Sun’s involvement was an underlying factor in the case. Coinbase’s filing elaborated on Sun’s controversial history and ongoing legal troubles, which recently gained more attention with the CoinDesk scandal . The exchange argued that BiT’s association with Sun, rather than its decision to delist wBTC, was the primary driver of any reputational harm the firm might have suffered. This framing resonated with the court, which found that BiT’s injuries were largely self-inflicted. However, critics of Coinbase’s decision have pointed to the absence of proof of reserves for its own tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC, as a potential weakness in the exchange’s arguments. While wBTC has traditionally been viewed as a trusted wrapped asset with 1:1 Bitcoin backing, the rise of cbBTC which has rapidly gained market share since its launch. Some industry observers have suggested that Coinbase’s move could be motivated by competitive interests rather than purely risk-based concerns.

However, Thursday has dawned brightly for the crypto market and a bounce is under way. $XRP, $SUI, and $APT are among the altcoins that are bouncing the highest. $XRP returns inside triangle formation Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $XRP shows that the bulls managed to hold the price above the ascending trendline, and keep it within the triangle that is forming. Wednesday’s market madness did pull the price down below the trendline at one point, but bulls quickly bought it back up again, as attested to by the candle wick that was left behind. The 0.618 Fibonacci was probably the strongest support, as can be seen by several dips down to this level since early December. The price could be in the process of flipping the current resistance into support right now. If the bulls are successful, the top of the triangle would likely be the next port of call. $SUI bounces from bull market trendline Source: TradingView $SUI has bounced nicely from the ascending trendline it has been following since late October. Among most of its competitors, $SUI is the one that is rising the most, and falling the least. The next targets are at the 0.618 ($4.61), and then the 0.786 at $4.76. Another all-time high is only just beyond this. $5.00 could soon be reached. $APT bulls needs to break out of the sideways choppiness Source: TradingView $APT doesn’t have the great uptrends of the previous two altcoins, but it has bounced well so far on Thursday. Up 4.6% on the day so far, the price has touched the 0.382 Fibonacci, and is consolidating ready for a possible further move to the upside. Targets are in the chart above. If $APT is able to get up to the 0.786 Fibonacci, this is likely to coincide with a descending trendline, which bulls will need to break in order for $APT to break up out of this sideways choppiness. This is the minimum that can be expected from the bulls given that the all-time high is still a long way from here. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Notorious for their advanced skills in malware deployment, social engineering, and crypto asset theft, these hackers often channel stolen funds into state-sponsored projects, including weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, bypassing global sanctions. In 2023, they stole around $660.5 million through 20 incidents, but this amount surged to $1.34 billion across 47 cases in 2024, marking a 102.88% increase in stolen value. North Korea Sets Crypto Theft Record in 2024 According to the latest report by Chainalysis shared with CryptoPotato , the frequency of North Korea’s cryptocurrency attacks continues to grow, even as the total number of incidents across all scales has declined year-over-year. Particularly in 2024, there was a noticeable uptick in large-scale attacks involving $50-$100 million and amounts exceeding $100 million. This suggests that North Korea is becoming more efficient in orchestrating high-value breaches, a notable change from the past two years when their attacks predominantly generated less than $50 million per incident. North Korean IT workers have increasingly infiltrated crypto and Web3 companies, compromising their systems and integrity. Using advanced tactics like false identities, third-party hiring intermediaries, and exploiting remote work opportunities, they gain access to sensitive networks. In one notable case, the US Department of Justice indicted 14 North Korean nationals who posed as remote IT employees for US companies, stealing proprietary information and extorting employers, resulting in $88 million in illicit earnings. Hacking Dominance Dips in Late 2024 While North Korea’s exploits dominate this year’s hacking statistics, the global landscape highlights the continued threat of crypto theft. Total stolen funds reached $2.2 billion in 2024, marking the fifth year in the past decade where over $1 billion was stolen. This means that North Korea accounts for 61% of the total stolen crypto for the year and 20% of all incidents. Interestingly, while hacking activity surged in the first half of 2024, with $1.58 billion stolen by July – over 84% higher than the same period in 2023 – it slowed significantly in the latter half. Data reveals a 53.73% drop in stolen funds after July 1, 2024. This decline may be tied to shifting priorities as North Korea strengthens ties with Russia and possibly redirects resources to the Ukraine conflict. However, December events or holiday attacks could still change the overall picture, the blockchain data platform warned.

37840668,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664894,1734613220,Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? Top Exec Discusses The Market Crash,"The broader crypto market experienced a pronounced downturn following yesterday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, held on December 18. After the US Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut as anticipated, it also signaled fewer cuts in 2025 than previously expected. In response, the Bitcoin price fell by more than 5%, dropping below the $100,000 mark before showing slight signs of recovery. Altcoins saw across-the-board double-digit percentage declines. The Federal Reserve’s decision—while meeting expectations for a 25-basis-point reduction—came with a notable shift in the projected rate trajectory for next year. Rather than the previously communicated four cuts, the central bank now anticipates only two, signaling a more cautious stance. This recalibration of future monetary policy sent ripples through the entire risk asset spectrum, prompting the S&P 500 to decline 3% and the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index to drop 4.4%. Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? Within the crypto sector, the immediate aftermath was pronounced. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, addressed the market conditions this morning via X, writing: “The big catalyst today was the Fed announcement The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points as expected, but lowered expectations for next year from 4 cuts to 2 cuts. Higher rates are bad for risk assets, and the Fed’s announcement caused a sharp pullback in all risk assets.” Related Reading: Bitwise Exec Reveals His Personal Top 3 Crypto Predictions For 2025 According to Hougan, Bitcoin’s price action reflected heightened sensitivity to shifting monetary conditions. He noted that Bitcoin price drop was exaggerated by leveraged positions being liquidated. “$600 million of leveraged long positions were blown out in today’s market, exacerbating the pullback.” Despite the steep correction, Hougan argued that the broader outlook remains constructive: “Crypto now has internal momentum, and nothing about today’s announcement interrupts the mega-trends: The pro-crypto reversal in Washington policy, rising institutional adoption and ETF flows, Bitcoin purchases by governments and corporations, and major tech breakthroughs in the programmable blockchain space.” He pointed to technical indicators as a supporting factor for his thesis: “My favorite momentum gauge is still positive: Bitcoin’s 10-day exponential moving average ($102k) is still above its 20-day exponential moving average ($99k).” Related Reading: Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Coins To Watch This Week Hougan concluded his thread by maintaining that the shift in Fed expectations would not derail the longer-term bull run, stating: “Crypto’s in a multi-year bull market. 50bps of projected rate cuts won’t change that.” Other market observers offered similar interpretations of the Fed’s communication strategy. Warren Pies, Founder of 3Fourteen Research, commented via X: “By upping inflation forecast, lowering UE rate, and keeping cuts in place, the Fed has actually opened the path to more than 2 cuts in 2025 as data ‘surprises’ to the dovish side.” Renowned macro analysts echoed this sentiment. Crypto analyst and podcaster Fejau (@fejau_inc) described the central bank’s approach as a strategy designed to guide market expectations: “Fed forced itself into cutting this week so is using a hawkish 2025 FFR dot plot forecast to talk down long bond yields despite cutting today […] Welcome to macro psyop warfare. Smoke and mirrors baby.” He characterized the dot plots as a tool for psychological influence rather than a strict roadmap: “It’s important to view the dot plots not as a future forecast of events, but as a psychological tool […] The Fed has bought themselves time to allow further data to come out before they actually make a move […] Can almost guarantee you 2025 will not occur as is forecasted in their dots.” Andreas Steno Larsen, CIO of Steno Global Macro Fund and CEO at Steno Research, offered a similar assessment: “By hawking up all forecasts a lot, the Fed lowers the bar materially for cuts next year. It is a wise move, if you want to cut further, but do not want to precommit.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $101,766.

But with the rise of competitors, Solana (SOL), a blockchain-based technological giant, foresees tough competition ahead. For $500, Rexas Finance, Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Pepe Coin are top picks. Rexas Finance revolutionized asset tokenization, while Cardano prioritizes sustainability and scalability. Pepe Coin's unanticipated meme-driven market influence and XRP's legal clarity and substantial cross-border payment utility make this quartet a fascinating blend of utility and market appeal. These tokens could alter the crypto market and outperform Solana in performance and acceptance as investors seek the next great opportunity. Rexas Finance (RXS) Through its innovative real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance (RXS) is making waves in blockchain. This platform is changing asset management, ownership, and trading by digitizing illiquid assets, including real estate, fine art, and commodities. Rexas Finance's user-friendly architecture makes token generation and maintenance easy for non-technical users. Because of its accessibility, institutional and retail investors use the platform, promoting wider adoption. Rexas Finance built an early adopter group with a $28.5 million presale instead of venture money. During the presale, its token price rose from $0.03 to $0.15, proving its disruptive potential and attracting investors as a serious alternative to Solana. Rexas Finance's future potential boosts its investment appeal. Analysts expect the RXS coin to rise 16,566% from $0.20 at the exchange launch to $1.50 by 2025, with a long-term aim of $25. Market speculation and the platform's real use cases promote its stratospheric ascent, which brings transparency, efficiency, and democratization to asset ownership. Rexas Finance offers an ongoing $1 million giveaway to reward 20 lucky participants with $50,000 RXS tokens. The token's recent listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko enhanced its visibility, attracting potential investors. Rexas Finance got certified and verified, making it one of the investors’ top choices. With their total investment of just $500, the RXS investors face off against Solana to become the next market leader in the blockchain space. Ripple (XRP) Many believe that XRP will rise tremendously if there is legal clarity. XRP's target aim of reaching out to Solana requires a 500-dollar investment. XRP may reach $7–10 in the first quarter of 2025, giving investors a bonanza. Beyond legal clarity, Ripple's revolutionary cross-border payments approach makes XRP a game-changer in the global financial ecosystem. The debut of its stablecoin, RLUSD, is expected to boost usefulness and adoption, especially in remittance and DeFi. XRP's 376.5% rise to $2.43 shows its durability and potential to create huge returns despite the difficulty. If Ripple can restore investor confidence and momentum through legal victories and strategic developments, XRP might challenge Solana and attract high-growth investors in 2025. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Pepe Coin has become a leading memecoin player in the crypto market. The coin's price reached an all-time high of $0.00002801 on December 9, 2024, boosting its market worth to $11.8 billion. This made it the third-largest memecoin, behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu. Pepe Coin's 1,800% gain since January shows its capacity to attract investors and stay relevant in a competitive industry. After its breakout year, this frog-themed coin was listed on Binance.US, Coinbase, and Robinhood, demonstrating its expanding acceptability in mainstream financial platforms. Pepe Coin leverages its strong community and memecoin appeal to stand out despite a price drop. Pepe Coin is a high-risk, high-reward option to Solana in 2025 due to its established growth trajectory, accessibility across multiple platforms, and ability to drive significant market participation. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is a blockchain that plays the long game and is winning, so pay attention to it. Based on rigorous, peer-reviewed research, Cardano has always placed quality over speed. This strategy is paying off with its new Hydra scaling solution update, which doubles transaction-handling capacity. Cardano is competing with Solana in scalability and efficiency by enabling huge throughput. Its ecosystem, which supports DeFi systems and active NFT marketplaces, is quietly growing beyond its technological advancements. Its sustainability keeps it appealing to developers and investors seeking long-term stability. The market has noticed that ADA's price has been rising gradually, indicating greater confidence in the network. As more projects use Cardano's infrastructure, analysts expect this trend to continue throughout 2025. Cardano's ambition to bring financial services to neglected and underbanked areas is encouraging. For investors wanting a blockchain with a real-world effect, technical stability, and continuous growth potential, Cardano might challenge Solana. Conclusion For high-growth alternatives to Solana in 2025, investing $500 in Rexas Finance , Cardano, XRP, and Pepe Coin is appealing. Each token's strengths are Rexas Finance's RWA tokenization, Cardano's sustainability-driven scalability, XRP's cross-border payment solutions, and Pepe Coin's memecoin supremacy. Solana is a technology leader, but these four currencies offer diverse breakthroughs and financial potential for different crypto market sectors. These tokens combine inventiveness, real-world utility, and growth possibilities, such as Rexas Finance democratizing asset ownership, Cardano growing its ecosystem, XRP recovering momentum post-legal clarity, and Pepe Coin flourishing on community appeal. As crypto dynamics change, they could challenge Solana's position and be a good pick for a diversified investment portfolio.

37840506,https://crypto.news/?p=14320684,1734612839,Ki Young Ju: South Korea’s economic crisis could drive crypto businesses overseas,"CryptoQuant CEO warns of economic instability and calls for reform in South Korea’s financial policies. In a Dec. 19 post on X , Ki Young Ju, the CEO and founder of CryptoQuant , expressed grave concerns about the status of the Korean economy — critiquing the nation’s economic policies, pointing out, in particular, the rising value of the Korean Won and the unattractiveness of domestic assets. “Domestic assets, including the Korean Won, are not attractive at all,” Ju said, highlighting the ineffectiveness of government initiatives to keep the currency stable. Ju pointed out that the government’s efforts to keep the currency stable have mostly failed given the state of the economy. He emphasized that the issue is made worse by the rapidly rising currency rate, which is causing economic instability. Ju also pointed out that the USDT value on Upbit, a major South Korean exchange, had already caught up to the IMF rate which can be a bad sign for the South Korean economy especially in terms of cryptocurrencies. You might also like: South Korea’s Upbit and Bithumb lists MOVE on Dec. 9 One important metric for assessing a currency’s value in relation to others using international financial standards is the IMF rate. The KRW is declining against the dollar at an alarming rate when the value of USDT, a stablecoin based on the US dollar, equals the IMF rate on local markets like Upbit. Since investors can use USDT or other stable assets as a hedge against the volatility of the national currency, this alignment between the USDT and the IMF rate may be a sign of a lack of confidence in the Korean economy. This can be interpreted by South Korea as a warning indication of capital flight, a phenomenon in which companies and investors relocate their assets abroad in order to shield them from devaluation or inflation. Because fewer people would be willing to hold the KRW, the tendency might further destabilize the local financial system and undermine the national economy. Furthermore, this might have an effect on international investments and commerce, decreasing South Korea’s appeal to international investors. Ju’s comments demonstrate the mounting apprehension regarding the government’s response to the crisis and its capacity to stop the flow of capital out of the country. You might also like: Long-time stakeholder in Upbit’s parent seeks exit just day after South Korea lifts martial law: report CryptoQuant’s CEO also expressed disapproval of the way the government was addressing the matter, saying that instead of making capital stay in the nation, it ought to foster an atmosphere that would entice it to come back. Ju called for fewer restrictions and more incentives for investors to remain in Korea, saying, “the government should not forcefully hold on to capital that is fleeing overseas.” Ju, who has operated his company in Korea for seven years, expressed increasing dissatisfaction with the South Korean government. He concluded, “I have endured this for 7 years while doing business as a domestic corporation, but now I am thinking that I should leave Korea. It is so frustrating.” His remarks, which urge for reform to stop the capital flight, reveal a deeper worry for Korea’s economic future. South Korea witnessed severe political unrest in December 2024 as a result of President Yoon Suk Yeol’s later-retracted imposition of martial law. The National Assembly impeached him as a result, and a trial before the Constitutional Court was held to determine whether he should stay in office. You might also like: South Korea halts ‘all work’ on crypto regulations amidst martial law aftermath Financial institutions in South Korea have been greatly impacted by the current political unrest. The stock market has been volatile and the South Korean won has lost value, mostly as a result of international investors selling their local shares. For example, the KOSPI index, the benchmark stock index of South Korea that tracks the performance of businesses listed on the Korea Stock Exchange, fell 2.5% from Dec. 3, the day martial law was declared, and since then it has shown bearish momentum and now trading at 2,435.93 as of Dec. 19. Source: Google Finance Also, one of the largest firms in South Korea and a pioneer in technology worldwide, Samsung Electronics, had a 9.3% drop in its stock price, and currently trading at 53.100 KRW. The South Korean won also continued to decline, hitting its lowest level in 15 months at 1,448.9 versus the US dollar. In order to mitigate the risks connected with the current political and economic environment, companies and individuals are considering relocating their assets overseas as a result of the growing concerns about economic stability. It is unclear how the government’s measures will affect South Korea’s financial institutions going forward and whether additional companies, like CryptoQuant, will be compelled to relocate to secure their survival in a more stable environment while the country experiences political and economic upheaval.

37844761,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105725,1734612801,Expert Questions Whether Shiba Inu Reaching $0.01 Can Happen or If It’s Just a Dream—Here’s the Answer,"Popular crypto YouTuber CryptoJack questions Shiba Inu’s potential to hit one of its ambitious price targets, asking whether the prediction will ever happen or remain a dream. Several market watchers have been closely observing Shiba Inu (SHIB), with some setting audacious targets for the asset, including a potential surge to $0.01. Particularly, experts at Changelly forecast that Shiba Inu will hit the $0.01 milestone by October 2040, approximately 16 years from now. Users Doubt the $0.01 Forecast for Shiba InuThe $0.01 prediction, popularly referred to as the one-cent dream, has gained momentum within the Shiba Inu community. Many investors fantasize about how they plan to retire early if SHIB eventually reaches $0.01. However, some users have questioned Shiba Inu’s potential to hit the $0.01 target. Famous crypto YouTuber CryptoJack raised this concern in a recent X post , asking whether Shiba Inu can realistically reach the $0.01 price target. Reaching the $0.01 requires Shiba Inu to rally by 41,290% from the current price of $0.00002416. At $0.01, Shiba Inu’s market cap will soar to a whopping $5.84 trillion, surpassing Bitcoin’s valuation of $2.01 trillion. This reflects a surge of 41,290% from Shiba Inu’s current market cap of $14.12 billion, demanding a substantial amount of capital influx.Can Shiba Inu Soar to $0.01? Given the hefty growth necessary to achieve the $0.01 price target, many users have dismissed the possibility of Shiba Inu ever reaching it in its lifetime. Some suggest that due to the token’s hefty supply, it will forever remain a dream. For context, Shiba Inu began trading in August 2020, boasting an initial extensive supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. So far, 410 trillion SHIB tokens, representing 41.74% of the total supply, have been incinerated. Despite this, Shiba Inu still has a total supply of 589,257,176,554,960 (589.25 trillion), with 584.11 trillion tokens currently in circulation, according to Shibburn data . Only Way Shiba Inu Can Hit $0.01Consequently, some community members suggest that burning a huge chunk of the supply might be the only way SHIB can reach the $0.01 target. As a result, they propose that the ecosystem team actively buy back SHIB from the market and burn them. This would permanently remove the tokens from the supply, potentially raising the value of the remaining tokens in the long term to targets like $0.01. The team’s existing efforts to drastically reduce SHIB’s supply through Shibarium-powered burns seem insufficient. So far, Shibarium-powered burns have successfully removed about 57 billion SHIB from the supply, representing about 0.01% of the total burns Shiba Inu has recorded since its inception. Should the team actively buy back SHIB from the market and send them to the official dead wallet, it would drastically reduce the circulating supply, helping Shiba Inu attain the $0.01 target at a lower valuation instead of the aforementioned $5.89 trillion market cap. Expert Calls for Calm Amid Heavy Selling Pressure on SHIB Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is facing intense selling pressure in the ongoing market downturn, with many investors converting their SHIB tokens to more stable assets like USDT. Earlier today, an early Shiba Inu investor sold 400 billion SHIB on Gemini, netting a profit of $9.59 million. In the meantime, popular community analyst Shib Spain has urged investors to remain calm and not sell their SHIB holdings in the ongoing market crash. The expert emphasized that Shiba Inu is currently trading above a key support level at $0.000023, demonstrating the asset’s resilience in the broader market crash. https://twitter.com/ShibSpain/status/1869526083575644494Currently, Shiba Inu’s trading volume has exploded by 66.69% over the past 24 hours to $1.39 billion.

Stating that he will continue to buy even if the price of Bitcoin increases, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor announced that they will change their strategy in the future. Speaking to Bloomberg, Michael Saylor said the company will reexamine its capital plans once it reaches its $42 million fundraising goal. MicroStrategy plans to focus more on fixed-income securities, such as convertible bonds, likely in the first quarter of 2025, Saylor said. “When we announced our $42 billion plan, we had no idea what kind of response we would get. But the response has been overwhelmingly positive. So we will revisit our capital plan from period to period and implement a new plan based on market conditions at that time. “We now want to create a smarter leveraged return system for the benefit of our shareholders, especially after Q1 2025.” I Want to Be on Trump's Advisory Board! Saylor has signaled that he could be on US President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto advisory council. When asked about his relationship with the famously bullish Trump or the new administration, he replied, “I've spoken to a lot of people in the new administration, but I can't comment any further than that.” However, when asked if he would serve on a potential crypto advisory board, Saylor said, “I am always willing to share my thoughts on constructive digital asset policy, whether privately or publicly.

Currently trading between $7 and $10, it's nearing the resistance level around $12. A breakthrough here could propel DOT towards the next target near $15. The Relative Strength Index sits just above 30, suggesting it may be oversold and primed for a rebound. Despite a minor 2% dip this week, the overall trend remains positive. The simple moving averages point to potential growth ahead. With the anticipated altcoin season approaching, Polkadot could experience significant gains soon. AVAX Poised for Rebound Amid Oversold Conditions and Bullish Indicators Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a significant price dip over the past six months, dropping by over 67%. However, technical indicators suggest a potential reversal. The Relative Strength Index sits at 31.18, signaling oversold conditions. The Stochastic oscillator is even lower at around 9, further indicating the asset may be undervalued. With the nearest resistance level at $63.55, a move towards this price could result in gains exceeding 30% from current levels. The upcoming altcoin season and anticipated crypto bull run could fuel this growth. Traders may watch for a breakout above the 10-day simple moving average of $46.95 as an early sign of upward momentum. Aave (AAVE) Targets New Highs with Bull Run on the Horizon Aave (AAVE) has seen a massive rise in the past month, with its price increasing by nearly 129%. Over the past week alone, it has climbed by over 34%. Currently trading between $265 and $434, AAVE is approaching its nearest resistance level at $499. Breaking this level could pave the way toward the next resistance at $667. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) around 53 suggests there is still room for upward movement before reaching overbought conditions. The Stochastic indicator over 76 supports this potential growth. With the upcoming altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, AAVE might be poised for substantial gains. Jupiter (JUP) Eyeing Major Breakout Ahead of Altcoin Surge Jupiter's price hovers between $0.91 and $1.32, indicating a potential upswing. The Relative Strength Index sits just above 35, suggesting the coin is nearing oversold territory. With a low stochastic reading around 14, momentum could shift positively soon. Breaking past the nearest resistance at $1.54 may lead to gains exceeding 20%. Over the past six months, Jupiter has already climbed more than 30%, showcasing strong growth potential. As the anticipated altcoin season approaches, JUP could ascend toward the second resistance near $1.95, marking a substantial increase from current levels. The negative MACD level might reverse, signaling the start of a bullish trend ahead. Conclusion DOT, AVAX, AAVE, and JUP may see slower short-term growth, but DOGEN stands out as the key opportunity. Designed for those who strive for luxury and success, it offers unmatched benefits.

The market analytics platform Arkham Intelligence notes that someone bought only $6 worth of PENGU , the new utility token for the NFT project Pudgy Penguins, then added it to the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium ( RAY ) paired with $1100 worth of SOL. Explains Arkham, “Multiple users trying to snipe PENGU’s launch swapped into his pool, and bought tokens at highly unfavorable prices – earning him a profit of $87,000 in SOL and PENGU from this position.” Source: Arkham/X Binance listed PENGU for trading on Tuesday after the project’s airdrop on Monday. The token, which is already the 68th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $0.0383 at time of writing and is up nearly 12% in the past 24 hours. Pudgy Penguins announced earlier this month that it planned to launch PENGU on the Solana network. “With PENGU, the millions of Pudgy Penguin fans and the hundreds of millions of people outside of crypto that see and share the Pudgy Penguin every day finally have the opportunity to align themselves with the character… PENGU will have a total supply of 88,888,888,888 and will launch on Solana.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With her term ending soon, the industry hopes President Trump will push for crypto-friendly replacements, such as Chris Brummer or Jai Messai, in the new Congress. Caroline Crenshaw, a Democrat who is not supportive of crypto, had her reappointment to the SEC canceled . The Senate Banking Committee canceled the vote after significant pressure from the crypto industry, which urged Senate Democrats to stop her due to her negative views on cryptocurrency. Crypto industry blocks Crenshaw’s renomination Crenshaw, who was nominated by President Trump and confirmed during his first term, now faces uncertainty about her future at the SEC. If President Biden had renominated her, she would have likely stayed for another five years. However, her critical views on crypto, especially her role in cracking down on the $3 trillion digital asset industry have become hurdles in her way to returning to her role. It became a major issue as the crypto industry, which had a major influence on President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory, used its political influence to prevent her renomination. Major figures in the crypto industry, including Tyler Winklevoss from the Gemini exchange, campaigned against Crenshaw’s renomination. They argued that her stance was blocking innovation in the U.S., and with millions of crypto supporters backing the movement, it could be a pressure on Senate Democrats. The Senate Banking Committee, controlled by Democrats, had planned to vote on her nomination, but the vote was delayed due to limited time before the end of the current Congressional session. Crenshaw still holds her position at the SEC, but her term will likely end soon unless President Trump renominates her when he takes office in January. However, since Trump has strong support from the crypto community and wants to reverse some of Biden’s policies, it’s unlikely she will stay in her role under his leadership. Who could replace Crenshaw? As the Senate prepares for the new Congress, the crypto industry is already considering possible replacements for Crenshaw. Some names being discussed include Georgetown law professor Chris Brummer, Jai Messai from Lightspark, and former SEC lawyer TuongVy Le. These candidates are seen as more supportive of digital assets and bring hope for clearer regulations. The cancellation of Crenshaw’s renomination vote shows how much influence the crypto industry has in Washington, D.C. In the coming months, it will become clear if her time at the SEC is over and if President Trump will push for candidates who support crypto to replace her.

AVAX Poised for Rebound Amid Oversold Conditions and Bullish Indicators Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a significant price dip over the past six months, dropping by over 67%. However, technical indicators suggest a potential reversal. The Relative Strength Index sits at 31.18, signaling oversold conditions. The Stochastic oscillator is even lower at around 9, further indicating the asset may be undervalued. With the nearest resistance level at $63.55, a move towards this price could result in gains exceeding 30% from current levels. The upcoming altcoin season and anticipated crypto bull run could fuel this growth. Traders may watch for a breakout above the 10-day simple moving average of $46.95 as an early sign of upward momentum. Chainlink Soars with Eye on $37 Resistance Amid Bullish Momentum Chainlink has seen impressive gains, jumping over 95% in the past month and nearly 22% this week. Currently trading between $22 and $33, it's making its way toward the first resistance level around $37. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, indicating potential for a trend shift. The relative strength index is in the low 30s, suggesting the asset is not overbought and may have room to climb. With the anticipated altcoin season and an overall crypto bull run, Chainlink could break through resistance levels. A move past $37 may propel it toward the next resistance near $49, offering significant upside potential from current prices. Conclusion AVAX and LINK show limited short-term potential compared to DOGEN. Designed for those who value luxury and success, DOGEN targets alpha leaders aiming to dominate the market. With projected 700% growth by the end of the presale and inspiration from tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN is positioned for massive returns during this altcoin season.

Bitcoin ETFs have achieved a groundbreaking $50 billion milestone, marking significant institutional interest. XRP has surged over 12% as Ripple prepares to launch its much-anticipated RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a new and viral altcoin, is making waves in its presale, with prices jumping over 40%. With so much action. Bitcoin ETFs: Bullish Institutional Intents Drive BTC Higher As institutional investors pull in both around ETFs, Bitcoin price surges in its bull run. U.S.-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs have gathered more than 500,000 BTC since inception. Now, the total value of this giant inflow is $50.5 billion. It shows increasing trust from large finance and a movement toward Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional markets. 1-month Bitcoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap As if this wasn't enough, MicroStrategy recently revealed the purchase of 21,550 BTC. With this acquisition, its overall holdings now exceed 423,650 BTC, solidifying its place as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin investors. The average purchase price of $98,782 per BTC indicates confidence in BTC price in the long run. Analysts say the price of bitcoin could test new highs in 2025, while others predict it if hit $150K or more as soon as next year. Such levels of institutional adoption imply a new paradigm for Bitcoin. Increasing numbers of investors, both large and small, also seek to cash in on the rally. XRP Climbing In Anticipation Of The Launch Of RLUSD XRP has piqued the interest of investors with its price breaking out over 12% on the week. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launched by CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, and the token also soars. On December 17, RLUSD will be launched on major exchanges including Bitstamp, Uphold and MoonPay. 1-month XRP price chart- source: CoinMarketCap According to Ripple Labs, RLUSD is a disruptive player in the stablecoin sector. The goal is to compete against dominant players such as USDT and USDC with enterprise-grade solutions. The stablecoin is purportedly going to support XRP and add to its utilizations for cross-line exchanges. This news could likely drive the XRP price to the $2 mark by early 2025. But RLUSD still has many problems to face. There is a lot of competition in the stablecoin space, and user adoption is far from guaranteed. Nevertheless, the well-established performance of Ripple along with its advancements in adjusting to regulations form a substantial basis for upcoming success. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): The Presale That Is Making Waves As Bitcoin and XRP steal the news, Yeti Ouro silently gains investors' attention. YETIO is an innovative and utility-based memecoin with an ecosystem designed for gaming, staking and real-world use cases. Its presale has already spiked more than 40%, leading some to draw comparisons with early successes like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Yeti Ouro’s presale has seen a rapid increase in investor activity. The token price started at $0.012 and has now climbed to $0.017 in Stage 2. Early investors are already enjoying strong gains, with the project raising over $1.25 million. Analysts predict YETIO could deliver 100X returns as it enters the broader market. Yeti Ouro has launched a meme contest with a prize pool of $2000 for 1st place , $1000 for second place and $500 for third place. To participate, create engaging Yeti-themed memes, and share on X. Make sure to tag @yetiouro and use hashtag #YetiMeme. To learn more head over to the official Yeti Ouro X channel . What makes Yeti Ouro different is the ecosystem it provides. It is associated with Yeti Go, a Unreal Engine-built Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game. Players can also earn YETIO tokens, stake them for rewards, and trade in-game assets on an open marketplace. Additionally, the token burn mechanism and staking rewards also guarantee there will always be continual demand for YETIO. Why Yeti Ouro Stands Out While Bitcoin and XRP remain strong contenders, Yeti Ouro’s unique ecosystem is creating excitement. It blends the appeal of memecoins with real utility. This combination is rare and could lead to explosive growth. Here’s why investors are paying attention: Presale Success: Over 3.2 million tokens sold in Stage 2. Gaming Integration: Tied to the fun and chaotic Yeti Go racing game. Staking Rewards: Holders earn passive income through token staking. Strong Community: A growing base of early supporters and gamers. With Bitcoin ETFs and XRP making headlines, Yeti Ouro is emerging as the underdog that could outperform expectations. Conclusion The crypto market is bullish in all aspects. Bitcoin ETF milestone demonstrates increasing trust from institutions, and XRP’s re-establishing of the bullish trend prepares the ground for Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin. On the other hand, Yeti Ouro is blazing its way through with a successful presale and an innovative ecosystem. Having gained over 40% in Stage 2 alone, YETIO could be the next big name in crypto. Yeti Ouro is attracting investors seeking the next 100x opportunity. And a unique and promising contender it is, balancing utility, gaming, and community. So, whether you are a BTC holder or an XRP enthusiast, following Yeti Ouro could make sense for 2025.

However, the current session sees the Solana price trading between the $220- $215 range. With the token successfully breaking the key resistance level, experts usually predict highly bullish rallies. Yet, in this case, market experts place bets on DTX Exchange, claiming that the $0.12 token will outpace SOL’s rally and surge exponentially in this bull run! Solana Price Analysis: Can SOL Break Out to $300? Solana (SOL) is showing promising signs of a potentially significant price rally, with multiple analysts and market indicators suggesting the altcoin could be on the brink of a substantial uptrend. Recent Glassnode data points to a fascinating change in Solana’s market performance. Although SOL led bitcoin performance in early Q4 2024, the past thirty days have shown a slowing down, with Ethereum and Bitcoin outperforming SOL. However, the Solana price is surging again as it breaks the $220 resistance. The launch of staking ETPs in Europe by Bitwise and VanEck, offering annual staking rewards of around 5-6%, further underscores growing institutional interest in the SOL network. Firms showing increasing institutional interest have applied for SOL spot ETFs, including VanEck and Bitwise. After BTC, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies ETFs, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas expects SOL ETFs may be approved, causing a surge in Solana price actions. With full deployment expected in 2025, Jump Trading’s Firedancer client pledges to improve Solana’s transaction speeds and network scalability. Indicating great investor confidence, Messari notes Solana secured $173 million in ecosystem funding in Q3 2024, the largest since mid-2022. Solana’s price charts show an interesting bullish trend even if the Solana price has been down over the past 25 days. Previously preceding a triple-digit surge, analysts have found a repeating “bull flag” fractal reminiscent of the one seen in January 2024. The key metrics that hint at a bullish SOL rally include the fact that Solana’s price has retested the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). The RSI has reset below the 50 mark, and the Fibonacci extension targets suggest potential price targets between $320 and $440. DTX Exchange Attracts Utility Investors With Its 34,000% Upside DTX Exchange (DTX) has gained recognition as an innovative trading platform, offering an all-in-one trading strategy with features like 1000x leverage.

Key Takeaways Earlier, Solana's price was having trouble as the SOL token attempted to overcome the $220 barrier. The Solana price is currently trading between $220 and $215, nevertheless.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin has seen significant changes in the past six months, with its price increasing by 207.62%. Over the last month, it rose by 4.58%, showing a steady climb. However, in the past week, the price dipped by 2.81%, indicating some short-term volatility. The current price ranges between $0.36 and $0.46, hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.38 and $0.40. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.39, suggesting the coin is not overbought and may have potential to rise. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.004012, but close to zero, which could point to a possible upward shift soon. If Dogecoin moves past the nearest resistance level at $0.51, it might reach the second resistance at $0.616, which would be an increase of around 34%. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $0.31, it could drop to the next support at $0.21, a decrease of about 41%. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge where the price might head next. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by about 6%. In contrast, the past month brought a slight increase of 3%. Looking at the last six months, SHIB's price surged by nearly 42%, highlighting its strong growth over a longer period. The recent weekly dip might suggest a short-term correction. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 34.51, which is approaching oversold territory. This could signal a potential rebound in price soon. The Stochastic value is 23.71, also indicating possible undervaluation. SHIB is currently trading between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00003614. If the price breaks this level, it could see gains of around 13%. The nearest support level is at $0.00002006. Falling below this could lead to a decline of approximately 16%. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $0.00002572, slightly below the 100-day SMA of $0.00002704. This alignment suggests a cautious outlook, but the significant six-month growth points to potential for future increases. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB have made their mark, XYZVerse (XYZ) is uniting sports fans in a unique memecoin, aiming for significant growth through its community-driven ecosystem.

37840000,https://crypto.news/?p=14319981,1734611701,Gaming chains are winning over developers and players | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. TON, Immutable, Ronin—the rise of gaming chains is one of this year’s major web3 stories. The Open Network, Telegram’s “ official web3 infrastructure ,” is a good example of this success by enabling in-app onboarding and new levels of engagement and reward . TON simply makes it easier for builders to build and players to play, demonstrated by year-defining titles like Notcoin, Hamster Kombat, and BANANA. After starting the year with just over 4M on-chain accounts, TON will finish the year with more than 120M. You might also like: What clicker boom on TON reveals about crypto games, players, and platforms | Opinion Answering “why” this is happening is a story in three parts. For developers, gaming chains provide a foundation that bridges the gap between web2 and web3, offering better tools, smoother onboarding, and more efficient scaling. For players, they benefit from connected ecosystems where their assets, achievements, and identities are more malleable on the backend. Meanwhile, for the industry, we move even closer to AI-enhanced experiences and cross-game economies. The explosive growth of gaming chains isn’t just about better technology—it’s about enabling the connected gaming experiences that will define web3 over the coming year and beyond. Building without barriers Gaming chains went seriously wide in 2024. In Q3 , further to the runaway success of TON, Immutable’s ecosystem hit about 200 titles, and Sky Mavis’ Ronin grew about 40% in the game count. Much of this success is indebted to how chains help developers bridge technical gaps. In a similar way to Unreal Engine transforming game development with specialized tools, gaming chains create purpose-built environments where developers can focus on creativity and build without compromise. Native gaming tools handle high-throughput player actions and complex smart contracts while ensuring low latency for real-time experiences. This goes a long way to helping developers feel at home and using something familiar to traditional infrastructure. With less technical headaches, they can focus on what they do best. Further, the relationship is synergetic. For their part, gaming chains can support developers from the ground up. Gas fee reductions are possible for gaming partners, for example, in addition to specialized technical and tokenomics support for games transitioning from web2. Gaming chain creators can also incubate and invest in select games, drive adoption, and create buzz, thereby fostering ecosystem growth. This virtuous cycle helps developers succeed while building more engaging player experiences. Gaming across the universe There’s a lot for players to like in this gaming chain evolution, too. For starters, one of their biggest pain points is onboarding. Things like wallets introduce technical know-how, which isn’t always an easy barrier to clear. Here, again, gaming chains offer a solution by seamlessly introducing players to the ecosystem and invisibly integrating the blockchain. Telegram made gaming waves this year because it does both of these things exceedingly well. Most users in most parts of the world (depending on regulation) enjoy automatic wallet connectivity on their Telegram profiles, letting them jump straight into mini-games without even needing to know crypto concepts. The result is big games, hyped airdrops, and hundreds of millions of players. Gaming chains also solve a key challenge: blockchain games often exist in isolation. With shared infrastructure, players more easily maintain a single identity across multiple titles. Ronin Name Service is a good example since players create a unique callsign across the Ronin ecosystem and games, wallets, and dApps. Solutions like this help bring player value and utility—creating genuine digital ownership across the gaming universe without sacrificing gameplay. Unlocking new gaming possibilities Once siloed gaming data is unlocked and unified by gaming chains, possibilities expand dramatically. Cross-game economies, long promised by NFTs, have finally become a reality. Whether trading assets or sharing currencies, experiences deepen when they extend across titles. As a result, player digital footprints gain value across entire ecosystems rather than single games. This unlocked data brings other knock-on effects like richer player experiences. Imagine rewards adapting based on cross-game achievements or reputation systems reflecting your complete gaming identity. Gaming chains create the shared infrastructure that makes player data portable and meaningful. AI then supercharges these connected experiences. Chain-specific tools can personalize missions based on behavior, generate dynamic content that matches player preferences, and power AI companions that learn from interactions. This makes gaming specific to every player and, in turn, improves acquisition and retention. United data on the backend also gives game makers a better view of what players want and the ability to develop in that direction. Clearly, when game data flows freely, all sides of the gaming equation win. Gaming chains are here to stay This breakthrough year for gaming chains is just the beginning. The digital era is defined by data as the “new oil,” and gaming chains unlock this asset to foster innovation, participation, and smarter decisions. It’s a value proposition that increasingly resonates with all stakeholders—developers get purpose-built infrastructure, players enjoy tailored experiences, and the industry unlocks new data-driven possibilities. As we move into 2025, gaming chains are redefining how we build, play, and connect. Expect this momentum to continue.

37839950,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630269,1734611510,US urges court to uphold Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) conviction,"The US government has finally responded to Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) appeal, stating that the initial conviction and forfeiture order against the former CEO of the bankrupt exchange should be affirmed. In its response, the government countered all the arguments raised in the SBF appeal. The US team, led by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, filed the response on December 13. They noted that the District Court made the right decisions throughout the trial and was not biased against SBF, as the former CEO had claimed. To prove this point, they argued that the court was right to instruct the jury to consider fraudulent intent, as there was overwhelming evidence of this in the trial. According to the government counsel, Bankman-Fried intended to cause loss to the victims, and none of the trial court instructions wrongly influenced the jury to convict him of this intention to cause loss. They wrote : “(The) loss to the victim was not “an incidental byproduct of the scheme,” Kelly, 590 US at 402—obtaining the victims’ property was the core object of Bankman-Fried’s deception.” Based on this, the government argued that the court’s instruction to the jury to ignore the SBF “No Ultimate Harm” defense in the trial was correct. During the trial, SBF said that the instruction was unnecessary but later argued on appeal that it was a wrong statement of law. However, the US counsel claims that standard instructions in fraud trials and temporary deprivation of another’s property for personal profit is enough to constitute a scheme to defraud. Government says the exclusion of evidence by the trial judge was correct Meanwhile, a chunk of SBF’s arguments in the appeal relied on what he believed was the wrongful exclusion of evidence that could have helped his case by the trial judge. Unsurprisingly, the government focused on disproving these arguments, noting that the judge was right. During the trial, the judge ruled that the evidence that SBF could present should be limited to show that he was acting in good faith. In his attempt to prove this, SBF wanted to present evidence showing that his investments with FTX funds were strategic, and he repaid the debt to customers and creditors. He also tried to prove that his decisions were based on legal counsel. However, the trial judge limited the evidence he could provide and sometimes made him give evidence without the jury, noting that it was not specific, and some could even mislead the jury. SBF argued in his appeal that these limitations ruined his case. In its response, the government stated that its own evidence about losses suffered due to SBF actions is relevant, and even if the former CEO had presented evidence showing he could repay, it would still not absolve him of the crime. It added that the court was right to order the criminal forfeiture of $11 billion against SBF as these funds were fraudulently obtained, and the size of the forfeiture is commensurate to the gravity of the action. What next for SBF? With the US government now filing its response to the appeal, it is up to SBF to reply to the counterarguments raised, and he has until January 31 to do that. However, whether the convicted CEO, who is currently serving his 25-year sentence, will win the appeal remains questionable. The core of his appeal has been that he did not get a fair trial and was presumed guilty by the prosecutors and judges involved in his case. However, many legal experts believe that it is unlikely for the Appellate court to grant a retrial especially if the appellant cannot sufficiently prove that the trial court acted inappropriately. While SBF has alleged some bias, noting the several criticisms of his counsel by the trial judge, the government lawyers noted that the judge also criticized the prosecution during the trial. Meanwhile, FTX is already planning to repay the customers with 98% of the customers likely to get their refunds within the next three months. However, they will be receiving their funds at November 2022 valuations even though prices have more than tripled since then.

While heavyweights like Solana (SOL) and Ripple’s XRP encounter regulatory and logistical hurdles, newer projects like Lightchain AI (LCAI) and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) are emerging as top contenders to lead the charge. With their innovative technologies and rapidly growing ecosystems, LCAI and HBAR are capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Why Solana and XRP Are Facing ETF Delays Even though they are popular, Solana and XRP is having a hard time to meet the tough rules for ETF inclusion. Solana's rare network breaks and growth troubles bring up worries for big investors, while XRP keeps facing leftover doubt from its court fights with the SEC, even after some wins. Though these problems dont lessen their worth as block chain plans, they slow down their chance to be in ETFs, giving new assets like Lightchain AI and HBAR a shot to take the stage. Also, with the rising trend for green investments, Solana's need for Proo͏f-of-Stake (PoS) way and XRP high energy use might hurt their odds of being ETF favorites. Lightchain AI The Newcomer Poised for ETF Domination Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rapidly positioning itself as the blockchain project to watch in 2025. With its focus on integrating artificial intelligence into decentralized applications, it offers unique use cases that cater to a wide range of industries. What Makes Lightchain AI ETF-Ready? Unlike many traditional cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI addresses the growing demand for real-world applications and enterprise-level adoption. Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables businesses to deploy AI-driven applications securely and transparently on the blockchain. Additionally, its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism ensures that computational resources are used meaningfully, aligning with sustainability goals that appeal to institutional investors. Moreover, Lightchain AI’s deflationary tokenomics, early-stage pricing of just $0.003, and a roadmap targeting cross-chain integrations make it an ideal candidate for ETF inclusion. Its ability to deliver high utility and sustainable growth positions it as a frontrunner in the next wave of blockchain innovation. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) A Sustainable and Institutional Favorite Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) has long been regarded as one of the most energy-efficient blockchain alternatives, thanks to its unique consensus algorithm that combines speed, scalability, and security. With governance led by a council of global enterprises like Google, IBM, and Boeing, Hedera offers the kind of institutional backing that ETFs are drawn to. HBAR’s focus on enterprise solutions, including supply chain management, digital identity, and tokenized assets, gives it broad appeal for use cases that extend beyond cryptocurrency speculation. This focus on tangible applications makes HBAR a strong candidate for ETFs targeting long-term, value-driven investments. The Role of ETFs in Crypto Adoption The launch of crypto ETFs is expected to bring a wave of new capital into the market, providing mainstream exposure to digital assets without requiring direct ownership of tokens. These ETFs will likely prioritize projects with. Real-World Utility Tokens like Lightchain AI and HBAR, which solve real problems, are more likely to attract ETF attention than speculative assets. Regulatory Compliance Projects with clear governance and transparent operations, such as HBAR’s enterprise council and LCAI’s community-driven approach, stand out. Sustainability Energy-efficient and environmentally friendly protocols are favored in an era of increasing ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) awareness. Lightchain AI, with its AI-driven blockchain innovations, and Hedera, with its enterprise-grade solutions, perfectly align with these criteria. How ETFs Could Impact Lightchain AI ETFs have the potential to catapult Lightchain AI into mainstream adoption, pushing its token price higher and increasing liquidity. With greater visibility and accessibility through ETF inclusion, more investors will be drawn to LCAI’s utility-driven approach, amplifying demand for its tokens. Moreover, ETFs are expected to bring institutional interest and capital into the market, which could accelerate Lightchain AI’s cross-chain integration plans and partnerships with enterprise clients. This would further solidify its position as a leading blockchain project in 2025. Plus the price stability that ETFs bring could attract more businesses looking to build applications on the LCAI network, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and adoption. New Leaders in the ETF Race As Solana and XRP face delays in their ETF journeys, Lightchain AI and Hedera Hashgraph are emerging as strong contenders to lead the next wave of blockchain innovation. Their emphasis on real-world applications, sustainability, and institutional appeal positions them as frontrunners for ETF inclusion in 2025. For investors seeking the next big opportunity, Lightchain AI’s presale at $0.003 offers an unprecedented chance to get in early on a project poised for exponential growth. With ETFs on the horizon, now is the time to watch these projects closely. Who knows, they could soon become the new darlings of the ETF world. Keep an eye out for Lightchain AI and Hedera Hashgraph as they continue to make strides towards mainstream adoption. The future of blockchain is bright, and these projects are leading the way. So don't miss out on this potential opportunity and keep a close watch on these projects as they take center stage in the ETF race. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Solana (SOL) Over the past six months, Solana (SOL) has surged by 62.92%. In contrast, the last month saw a decline of 8.33%, showing some volatility. This past week, there’s been a modest gain of 1.81%. The current price ranges between $205.85 and $239.87, nearing key support and resistance levels. The nearest support level is $187.60. If the price falls below this, it might drop to the second support at $153.58, a decrease of about 25%. On the upside, the nearest resistance is at $255.64. Breaking above this could send the price to $289.66, roughly 21% higher than now. Technical indicators are mixed. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $216.40 and $219.50. The RSI is at 47.04, indicating neutral conditions. The MACD is -1.256, and the Stochastic is 31.02, hinting at slight bearish momentum. Based on this data, Solana may experience mild downward pressure but could find support and potentially rebound. XRP (XRP) Over the past month, XRP (XRP) has experienced a significant surge, with its price increasing by 134.53%. Currently trading in the range of $2.03 to $2.73, the cryptocurrency has maintained upward momentum. In the last week alone, the price has risen by 4.22%, reflecting growing interest and investment. The coin’s impressive performance extends over the past six months, boasting a remarkable 406.22% increase. Technical indicators show that the simple moving averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $2.52 and $2.47 respectively, suggesting potential stability. The Relative Strength Index stands at 38.90, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 24.40, which may indicate that XRP is approaching oversold territory. Looking ahead, XRP faces a nearest resistance level at $3.02. If it breaks through, the next target could be $3.73. Achieving the first resistance would mean an increase of approximately 10% from the current upper price range. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $1.61, and falling to this point would represent a decrease of about 20% from the current lower price range. Traders are watching these levels closely to gauge XRP’s next move. Conclusion While SOL and XRP show strong bullish momentum, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as a pioneering all-sport memecoin, uniting sports fans and targeting massive growth in a community-driven ecosystem.

Currently in its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $7 million, with more than 355 million $TICS tokens sold to over 10,600 holders. And here’s the kicker—analysts predict that $TICS could skyrocket to $10-15 after its mainnet launch. That’s a jaw-dropping potential return for early investors. The tokenized marketplace isn’t just buzzwords, either. It’s a platform where creators, sellers, and buyers can exchange value directly, without the red tape. Imagine investing $1,000 today while $TICS is priced at just $0.0342. If analysts are right, you’re looking at a potential $300,000 in returns at the top end of their predictions. That’s life-changing money. With its decentralised structure and frictionless transactions, Qubetics is solving the inefficiencies that plagued earlier crypto platforms. It’s innovation like this that makes it one of the best coins to invest in right now. To learn more about Qubetics, you can check this out: Watch the Video . Monero: Privacy in a Transparent World In an era where your every move online is tracked, Monero ($XMR) is a breath of fresh air. Known as the ultimate privacy coin, Monero has remained a go-to for users who value anonymity. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Monero transactions are completely untraceable. What’s new? Developers are ramping up its features, including speedier transactions and enhanced cryptography, making Monero even harder to crack. According to Binance’s latest updates, Monero has seen a surge in adoption among users who need private payments—think freelancers, businesses, or just people wanting to keep their finances under wraps. Investing $1,000 in Monero today? Its steady growth and unwavering reputation suggest it could be a smart long-term play. While it might not boast the explosive potential of presale coins like Qubetics, it offers unmatched reliability in privacy. Fantom: Speed Meets Scalability If you’ve ever been frustrated by Ethereum’s high fees and slow transaction speeds, Fantom ($FTM) might be the solution you’ve been waiting for. This high-performance blockchain is all about speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency. Fantom’s unique Lachesis consensus mechanism allows it to process thousands of transactions per second. The result? A blockchain that’s lightning-fast and cheap to use. Fantom has become a favourite for developers building decentralised apps (dApps) and DeFi projects. Per Binance’s latest report, Fantom is gaining significant traction with new partnerships and integrations. It’s becoming the go-to for users who need a blockchain that doesn’t break the bank. Investing $1,000 in Fantom now could deliver impressive returns, especially as the DeFi space continues to expand. Conclusion While Monero and Fantom bring strong privacy and performance to the table, Qubetics takes the crown for sheer potential. Its tokenized marketplace is not just innovative—it’s transformative. With over $7 million raised and analysts predicting a price surge to $10-15, $TICS is the most exciting opportunity in the market today. The presale is moving fast, and early investors are already seeing the benefits. If you’re looking for the best coins to invest in right now, don’t let Qubetics pass you by. Act now before the presale ends, and secure your stake in a project that’s rewriting the rules of crypto marketplaces. Ready to join the Qubetics revolution? Don’t wait.

Dive Into the Best Coins to Invest in December 2024!","What’s hot in crypto this December? The buzz is all about three heavyweights—Qubetics, Polkadot, and XRP. With Qubetics making waves in its presale, Polkadot striving for the $20 mark, and XRP set to hit $4.75, there’s no shortage of action in the market. These coins are shaping up as the best coins to invest in December 2024 . While XRP’s integration into centralised finance and Polkadot’s robust ecosystem are making headlines, Qubetics is the talk of the town for its game-changing QubeQode IDE. Let’s unpack what makes these cryptos must-watch and how they stack up for the end of 2024. Qubetics: Revolutionising Decentralised Development At the heart of Qubetics’ rise lies its cutting-edge QubeQode IDE , a seamless environment empowering developers to create and deploy decentralised applications (dApps) with ease. If you’re tired of clunky tools and want a platform that delivers both speed and scalability, QubeQode might be your new favourite. This innovation isn’t the only reason why over 10,600 holders are backing $TICS. The presale tally has soared past $7 million, with over 355 million tokens sold. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $10-15 after its mainnet launch, and at its current price of $0.0342, it’s no wonder investors are flocking to it. Imagine this: you invest $1,000 today. When $TICS hits the low end of analyst predictions at $10, your investment could explode to over $292,000. If it reaches $15? You’re looking at a staggering $438,000. Talk about life-changing potential! Beyond the numbers, Qubetics solves real-world problems its predecessors couldn’t. By simplifying blockchain development, it opens the door to more widespread adoption of Web3 technologies. If you’re hunting for the best coins to invest in December 2024, Qubetics should be on your radar. Qubetics held an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) event to be more open with its community. During the session, the team answered questions and shared their future plans, reinforcing their image as a top cryptocurrency investment. Watch it now! Polkadot: Can It Smash Through $20? Polkadot isn’t just another blockchain—it’s a multi-chain network revolutionising interoperability. Designed to bridge the gaps between blockchains, Polkadot allows seamless communication and asset transfers, which are game-changers in a fragmented crypto ecosystem. According to recent reports, Polkadot’s native token, DOT, is eyeing a major breakout to $20. With its strong developer community and growing use cases, this milestone doesn’t seem far off. A $1,000 investment in DOT today could yield promising returns as the network gains traction. For those prioritising scalability and innovation in their crypto picks, Polkadot offers a compelling case. XRP: Gearing Up for a $4.75 Rally Ripple’s XRP has always been a trailblazer in cross-border payments. Now, it’s set to make an even bigger splash with the launch of RLUSD, a fiat-backed digital asset designed for real-time settlements. XRP’s use case as a liquidity bridge continues to be its strongest suit. FXStreet suggests that this development could propel XRP to $4.75 in the coming days. With a current market price hovering much lower, there’s serious potential for gains. Let’s talk numbers: a $1,000 investment in XRP today could see a 3x to 4x return if predictions hold true. Add Ripple’s focus on regulatory compliance, and XRP becomes a safer bet in the volatile crypto world. Conclusion If you’re still on the fence about which crypto deserves your attention, here’s the deal: Polkadot offers unparalleled scalability, XRP leads in real-world utility, and Qubetics redefines blockchain development. But if you’re hunting for life-changing returns, Qubetics is the name to watch. With $TICS’s presale price still at $0.0342 and analysts projecting a $10-15 value post-mainnet, the time to act is now. Join the Qubetics revolution and secure your spot among the next generation of crypto millionaires!

As part of the deal, the country will make Bitcoin acceptance voluntary for merchants and restrict public sector involvement in Bitcoin-related activities. Voluntary Bitcoin Acceptance for Merchants These steps are aimed at easing the country’s debt burden while minimizing potential risks linked to Bitcoin’s volatility. The IMF has long been skeptical of El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, highlighting the risks associated with its speculative nature. Under the new agreement, El Salvador will gradually unwind its involvement with Chivo, the state-backed cryptocurrency wallet. While the government’s role in Bitcoin-related transactions will be confined, the country will continue to accumulate Bitcoin . A National Bitcoin Office spokesperson confirmed that El Salvador plans to keep buying one Bitcoin per day, with no plans to sell its existing holdings. Currently, El Salvador holds around 5,969 BTC, worth approximately $602 million. Despite the shift in policy, the country’s commitment to Bitcoin remains a central part of its long-term economic strategy. Negotiations with IMF This change comes after a series of negotiations with the IMF, which have lasted four years. The IMF’s concerns over the country’s Bitcoin adoption have been well-documented, with the global lender fearing that the cryptocurrency’s speculative nature could expose the nation to financial instability. As part of the new loan agreement, El Salvador is expected to focus on stabilizing its economy, which includes a reduction in its debt-to-GDP ratio. The $1.4 billion loan will be distributed over 40 months and is part of a broader financial package that will also involve additional support from other international banks, including the World Bank. Despite the IMF’s push for a reevaluation of Bitcoin’s role in El Salvador’s economy, Bitcoin advocate and advisor Max Keiser dismissed the criticism. He argued that Bitcoin’s adoption in El Salvador had always been voluntary and that its usage continues to grow. In contrast, a recent survey revealed that the majority of Salvadorans—92%—do not use Bitcoin for transactions, further highlighting the challenges of widespread adoption. El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment, which started in 2021 , remains a controversial topic, but with the IMF deal in place, the country’s financial strategy appears to be evolving to ensure its long-term economic stability.

37842717,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321102,1734611374,"Dark Web Sees 135% Spike in Crypto-Drainer Discussions, Signaling Rising Threat: Kaspersky","Discussions surrounding crypto-drainers, malicious software designed to drain cryptocurrency wallets, have surged by 135% on dark web forums. Discussions related to crypto-drainers on the dark web rose from 55 threads in 2022 to 129 threads in 2024, according to a report from global cybersecurity firm Kaspersky . These forums have become a hub for cybercriminals to buy, sell, and distribute malware, as well as to recruit collaborators for broader distribution efforts. Interest in Illicit Trade Increases The significant uptick in discussions around crypto-drainers suggests a growing interest in the illicit trade and development of these tools among cybercriminals, per the report. Crypto-drainers, which have been active for about three years, operate by deceiving users into authorizing fraudulent transactions. Cybercriminals use tactics such as phishing websites, fake airdrops, malicious browser extensions, fraudulent smart contracts, and counterfeit NFT marketplaces to achieve their goals. Alexander Zabrovsky, a cybersecurity expert at Kaspersky, warned that this upward trend in crypto-drainer activity is likely to continue in 2025. He urges companies and organizations to increase vigilance, monitor their digital presence, and act quickly to counter fraudulent activity. Drainers often exploit the brand recognition of major wallets and exchanges to lure unsuspecting victims. Kaspersky’s report also highlights a 40% increase in the number of posts advertising corporate databases on one of the most active dark web forums. From August to November 2024, the volume of such posts grew significantly. While some of these database offers include old leaks disguised as new, they indicate persistent demand for corporate data. Dark web and dark market in 2025: What’s next? Our latest predictions reveal: – Rise in trusted relationship attacks and real/fake data leaks – Cybercriminals shifting back to #darkweb forums as #Telegram bans increase – META region poised for a surge in hacktivism and… pic.twitter.com/0iEePvZmYR — Kaspersky (@kaspersky) December 19, 2024 Zabrovsky said that certain breach advertisements are entirely fake, often blending publicly available information with older leaked data. These tactics are used to damage corporate reputations or generate attention in underground markets. He advised companies to track mentions of their brands and data on dark web platforms to enable a swift response to potential breaches. Cybersecurity Landscape for 2025 Kaspersky’s forecast for 2025 predicts a shift in cybercriminal behavior. Criminals are expected to retreat from Telegram channels back to dark web forums following a wave of bans targeting Telegram-based operations. Additionally, increased law enforcement action against major cybercrime groups in 2024 may push bad actors toward invite-only forums to evade detection. The threat of ransomware is also evolving. Kaspersky anticipates ransomware groups will splinter into smaller, more nimble units, making it harder for authorities to track and dismantle them. Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) operations, which enable criminals to rent out drainers and stealers, are also expected to grow. This will likely result in a larger volume of stolen data being sold on underground platforms. The Middle East is particularly vulnerable to this evolving threat landscape. Geopolitical tensions in the region are expected to fuel a rise in hacktivism and ransomware attacks. Data shows that ransomware victims in the region increased from an average of 28 per half-year in 2022-2023 to 45 in the first half of 2024. More recently, it was revealed that cybersecurity scammers are using automated email replies to compromise systems and deliver stealthy crypto mining malware. This came on the heels of another malware threat identified in August. The “Cthulhu Stealer,” which affects MacOS systems , similarly disguises itself as legitimate software and targets personal information, including MetaMask passwords, IP addresses, and cold wallet private keys.

37839768,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395156,1734611368,XRP News: Is XRP Still a Good Investment After Its 500% Rally?,"The post XRP News: Is XRP Still a Good Investment After Its 500% Rally? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, has been a standout performer in the crypto market , surging nearly 500% from $0.50 to $2.60 in recent months. Despite this remarkable growth, XRP has come under fire in a video titled “Everything That’s Wrong With XRP,” sparking debate within the crypto community. Key Criticisms of XRP The author of this video has outlined three key reasons why XRP might not be a solid investment. Replacement by Stablecoins: Author argued that XRP’s original role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments has been overshadowed by stablecoins, which offer more stability. Ripple’s recent launch of its stablecoin , RLUSD, has added fuel to this claim. Ripple’s IPO Plans: The video suggested that Ripple’s plans for an IPO undermine XRP’s relevance, as the company’s stock performance could overshadow the cryptocurrency. Ripple’s Large XRP Holdings: Ripple currently holds over 38 billion XRP tokens and has been selling them to fund operations. This centralization, according to the author, poses risks to XRP’s long-term value. Ripple CTO David Schwartz Responds In response, Ripple CTO David Schwartz took to X to address these criticisms head-on. I think its first point is completely wrong. It's true that you can use XRP to make payments without holding it, which is good because it means you aren't exposed to its volatility if you don't want to be, it doesn't follow that people won't hold XRP. For one thing, the only… — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 18, 2024 Schwartz dismissed the claim that stablecoins make XRP obsolete. He explained that XRP’s unique role as a bridge currency relies on its liquidity and the ability of holders to buy and sell the token freely. This liquidity ensures that XRP remains a valuable asset for payments. Furthermore, Schwartz noted that holding XRP can simplify transactions by reducing the number of currency exchanges needed. “If you don’t know which currency you’ll need next, holding XRP makes sense,” he said. Schwartz also expressed skepticism about predictions regarding XRP’s price movements, highlighting how XRP and Stellar (XLM) often follow similar market trends, driven by broader factors rather than Ripple-specific developments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Could Hit New ATH in 2025: Key Events Explained , Why XRP Still Has Potential Despite the criticisms, Schwartz supports XRP’s importance in the digital payment ecosystem. For individuals and businesses navigating multiple currencies, holding XRP can streamline operations, making it an efficient choice in a complex financial landscape. While debates continue, Ripple is looking toward the approval of an XRP ETF . The company has been working closely with financial institutions, and so far, four filings for XRP ETFs have been submitted. These efforts suggest a strong possibility that the proposals could gain approval before 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB started with 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, increasing SHIB's scarcity. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and DAO-based governance. This broad utility enhances its potential, and in the current market cycle, SHIB's growing utility and community support may make it an attractive option for investors. Polkadot (DOT): Bridging Blockchains for Enhanced Scalability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows for the sharing of value and data across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. By employing parachains—parallel blockchains that run alongside the main chain—Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The native token, DOT, is used for governance and staking, allowing holders to participate in network development and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood and launched in May 2020, Polkadot aims to create a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem. With its innovative technology, Polkadot has significant potential, and DOT remains a notable asset in the current market cycle. Fantom (FTM): A High-Speed Platform for Decentralized Finance Fantom is an open-source decentralized platform designed to offer fast, secure, and scalable solutions for decentralized applications (DApps) and digital assets. It utilizes its native FTM token and a unique consensus mechanism called Lachesis, an Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant Proof-of-Stake algorithm. This technology allows Fantom to process thousands of transactions per second with near-instant finality and minimal fees. By balancing scalability, security, and decentralization, Fantom aims to overcome the limitations of previous blockchains. Its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and support for the Solidity programming language provide developers with efficient tools for building DeFi services. The platform's innovative approach enhances transaction efficiency in the blockchain space. Raydium (RAY): Solana AMM Connecting Liquidity to Serum DEX Raydium is an automated market maker and liquidity provider built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum decentralized exchange. Unlike other AMMs, Raydium supplies on-chain liquidity to a central limit orderbook. Funds deposited into Raydium are turned into limit orders on Serum's orderbooks. This allows Raydium liquidity providers to access Serum's order flow and existing liquidity. RAY is the native token used for staking to earn protocol fees, receiving IDO allocations, and governance votes on protocol decisions. The coin's integration with Solana and Serum may offer potential in the current market cycle, as it combines AMM features with orderbook liquidity. Conclusion While SHIB, DOT, FTM, and RAY show limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla invites crypto enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens.

42389438,5871de26-d8e3-411d-acf0-3cd28cffd601,1734611065,"Razzlekhan's Husband, the Bitfinex Hacker, Makes First Public Statement Since Arrest","Ilya Lichtenstein, who pled guilty last year to charges related to the 2016 theft of 120,000 bitcoin from Bitfinex, has made his first public statement since his 2022 arrest.  In a five-minute video posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, Lichtenstein reiterated that he was the hacker and that he acted alone, denying speculation in a Netflix documentary that his father (or, perhaps, some spy agency, maybe Russia's) might have been involved in the theft.  “My dad is no hacker, he doesn’t even know how to use Instagram,” said Lichtenstein, who was sentenced to five years in prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering, including the time he was incarcerated after the arrest while the case was pending.   ""I offer my sincerest apologies to Bitfinex for all the stress that I have caused them,"" he said in the video, recorded from prison during a remote visit with his wife. ""I knew what I was doing was wrong and I did it anyway because I didn't care ... I look back at the person I was then, and I hate myself. I hate myself.""    In the video,  Lichtenstein also provided an update on restitution for the funds he stole from Bitfinex.   ""For the past three years, I have worked hard to account for and return all assets down to the last satoshi, as required by my plea agreement, and I will continue to do so,"" Lichtenstein said, showing bags under his eyes. A restitution hearing is set for February to determine whether they should be distributed to Bitfinex or to its customers who were affected by the hack.  Razzlekhan speaks  Lichtenstein's wife, Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan, pled guilty to one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.   Prosecutors said she became aware of the hack only years after the fact and was enlisted by her husband to launder the stolen bitcoin.   ""In many ways, my wife ... is just another victim of my bad decisions,"" Lichtenstein said in the video.  Last month, Morgan was sentenced to 18 months in prison for her supporting role in Lichtenstein's crimes.   ""It’s nice to begin to have the public record surrounding our case set straight,"" Morgan told CoinDesk, referring to the video her husband released. ""You would think that would have happened after our sentencing memos got filed, but that really hasn’t been the case. There are so many myths that I look forward to debunking when we tell the real story.”   Best known for her goofy rap videos, Morgan recently began selling custom videos for $125 a pop on Cameo, a sort of non-pornographic version of Onlyfans. Her prison sentence could begin as soon as next month.  ""Despite everything you’ve read, my Razzlekhan persona never had anything to do with this case, besides the government mentioning it in their charging documents. I created Razzlekhan years before I ever knew my husband had hacked Bitfinex,"" Morgan told CoinDesk.  “While our criminal case was open, I was unable to speak publicly or tell my story,"" she said. ""This also meant I could not publish any articles or release any new artworks or songs the last three years. Now that the case is over, I look forward to freely expressing myself creatively again. ... I am eager to tell the story of what really happened.”  Takes one to catch one  Atoning for his misdeeds in court, Lichtenstein said that after he serves his time he plans to pursue a career fighting cybercrime.   In Tuesday's video, Lichtenstein reiterated that pledge.   ""When I am released from prison ... I plan to dedicate myself to working in the cybersecurity industry,"" Lichtenstein said. ""I know the cyber threats that we face and I know how to stop them.""  The bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack was worth $70 million at the time and around $12 billion today.   The Netflix documentary leaves viewers with the impression that a substantial portion of the stolen funds remain missing, but according to Lichtenstein's lawyer, this is not the case.  “With significant help from Mr. Lichtenstein, the government has recovered nearly all of the assets stolen during the 2016 Bitfinex hack,"" the lawyer, Samson Enzer of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, told CoinDesk. ""In total, approximately 114,601 BTC (representing 96% of the approximately 119,754 BTC taken in the hack) were recovered, as well as 29 additional assets with substantial value.”  After this article was published, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesperson pointed a reporter to an October 25 court order, which details the various properties Lichtenstein forfeited.  Enzer's numbers check out.

37839621,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395154,1734610976,WLFI Ditches $10M cbBTC for WBTC Amid Coinbase Controversy,"The post WLFI Ditches $10M cbBTC for WBTC Amid Coinbase Controversy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance project supported by Donald Trump, has made waves by swapping $10.4 million worth of cbBTC for Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). This significant move follows Coinbase’s controversial decision to delist WBTC, raising questions about WLFI’s motives. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, WLFI exchanged 102.9 cbBTC for 103.15 WBTC. This swap comes as cbBTC—Coinbase’s Bitcoin wrapper—gains popularity with a market cap of $1 billion. Despite this growth, WLFI’s choice to pivot toward WBTC suggests a clear preference for its established reputation and infrastructure. Trump's World Liberty( @worldlibertyfi ) exchanged all 102.9 $cbBTC ($10.4M) for 103.15 $WBTC 4 hours ago. https://t.co/mtD0c2tvvo pic.twitter.com/tfN60lgStm — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 19, 2024 cbBTC vs. WBTC: What’s at Stake? While cbBTC’s adoption is growing, WBTC has come under scrutiny. Coinbase’s announcement to delist WBTC has intensified questions about its role in the DeFi ecosystem. By moving away from cbBTC, WLFI appears to be steering clear of potential controversies tied to the newer Bitcoin wrapper. Justin Sun’s Role in the Move Justin Sun, founder of TRON DAO and a major WLFI investor, has played a key role in this transition. Recently Sun, a vocal critic of cbBTC’s governance and transparency, invested $30 million in WLFI and joined as an advisor. His association with BitGo, the custodian of WBTC, further underscores his influence on WLFI’s alignment. Sun’s involvement has brought significant collaborations to WLFI, including partnerships with Chainlink and TRON. These alliances aim to bolster WLFI’s infrastructure while reflecting Sun’s vision for advancing decentralized finance. By integrating Chainlink’s decentralized tools and TRON’s Scale program, WLFI is positioning itself for sustained growth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Curve DAO Founder Denies Liquidation, CRV Price Plunges 13% , Coinbase Controversy Adds Fuel Coinbase introduced cbBTC in September, aiming to rival WBTC in the DeFi space. However, the exchange announced plans to delist WBTC, prompting a legal challenge from BiT Global, a custodian linked to WBTC. On Wednesday, a court sided with Coinbase, allowing the delisting to proceed. WLFI’s move aligns it with WBTC’s trusted infrastructure and market presence, distancing itself from cbBTC’s controversies. This decision also reflects a broader strategy to leverage Sun’s blockchain expertise and partnerships, including Chainlink’s decentralized services and TRON’s Scale program. It remains to be seen whether this represents a calculated risk or a deeper alignment. Actions like these remind us that narratives can influence markets just as much as numbers do. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After going as high as $2.73, the coin plummeted by more than 18% merely 24 hours after Ripple’s stablecoin went live. On December 17, the highly anticipated stablecoin RLUSD was unveiled, sparking a significant rally in XRP’s price. At the start of the week, XRP was trading around $2.35. On Monday evening, after Ripple’s announcement of the RLUSD launch scheduled for the following day, XRP’s price skyrocketed to nearly $2.6. The cryptocurrency surged again, reaching a multi-week high of $2.73 on the launch day. Despite the strong bullish trend, XRP struggled to sustain its gains. As the broader market corrected, XRP’s price began to pull back, falling to $2.41 at the time of this publication, while the market-wide drop intensified. Fed rate cut causes market bloodbath The market-wide correction was partly driven by the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. This move, though widely expected, set off a wave of panic selling across the crypto space. The recent rate cut triggered a sharp decline across all major cryptocurrencies, and XRP was no exception, dropping to a seven-day low of $2.19. XRP Price post-Fed cuts and RLUSD launch. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP had gained over 130% in the past month, only to lose substantial ground following the market’s downturn. According to analysts, the real cause for concern was not just the rate cut itself but the realization that inflation could persist longer than anticipated, and the Fed may not be ready to ease its tightening measures. One market analyst said , “It wasn’t today’s 25 bps cut that made markets freak out, it was the realization that inflation might stick around longer.” The Fed isn’t unanimously in favor of these cuts. That one sentence sent the US dollar soaring to levels we haven’t seen since 2022. When the dollar climbs, risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto tend to slide—and that’s exactly what happened. RLUSD’s market activity hasn’t been “intense,” even though Ripple did predict supply shortages post-launch. As RLUSD goes live, there may be supply shortages in the very early days before the market stabilizes. There actually is someone willing to pay $1,200/RLUSD for a tiny fraction of one RLUSD. Tools will show you the highest price anyone is willing to pay, even if it's just for a… https://t.co/LOx4rGiiiJ — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 15, 2024 According to CoinMarketCap data, the stablecoin’s trading volume in the last 24 hours is slightly above $600,000 at press time . Crypto market crash imminent? Bitcoin saw a significant drop in the past 24 hours, with its price falling by as much as 3% to a low of $102,000. The plunge in BTC prompted panic selling, triggering losses across other top cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, for example, extended its loss to two days, dipping below $3,800 and marking a 4.5% drop over the last 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) each experienced declines of 6%, 5.7%, and 3.2%, respectively, over the last day. Overall, market sentiment has been marked by uncertainty, with some analysts suggesting that volatility could persist until the dust settles. The downturn has also led to massive liquidations in the crypto derivatives market. According to data from Coinglass, approximately $792 million worth of positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with long positions accounting for $661 million of that total. Leading the charge was BTC, which had $149 million in liquidations, followed by ETH and XRP, which had $126 million and $42 million, respectively. However, analysts such as Ali are cautioning investors to avoid panic selling. “Markets hate uncertainty, but they also thrive on it when the dust settles,” he noted, urging caution and suggesting that patience may be required for a potential recovery.

37839639,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/viral-meme-coin-crypto-all-stars-raises-22m-just-days-before-launch-next-100x-token,1734610961,Viral Meme Coin Crypto All-Stars Raises $22M Just Days Before Launch - Next 100x Token?,"Crypto All-Stars (STARS) has emerged as the latest viral meme coin just days ahead of its highly-anticipated launch. The project is adding over $1 million to its presale total daily and has already raised $22 million. With the presale concluding on December 20th, the hype and FOMO have reached a fever pitch, positioning the project for a strong chance of surpassing the $25 million mark before its IEO. For perspective, First Neiro On Ethereum and Act I: The Prophecy had lower market caps when Binance announced their spot listings. STARS’s strong presale performance has impressed many prominent investors, some of whom are eyeing up to 100x returns from it. Crypto All-Stars - 11 Top Meme Coins Under One Roof Crypto All-Stars isn’t just any run-of-the-mill token. It doesn’t depend on an animal or a fictional character for its growth. Instead, STARS is a high-utility meme coin, with MemeVault being its key selling point. MemeVault is the world’s first multi-token staking platform. Soon after its launch, it will offer staking rewards for 11 top meme coins, including Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Based Brett (BRETT), Mog Coin (MOG), Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), Turbo (TURBO), Toshi (TOSHI), Coq Inu (COQ) and Bonk (BONK). Meme coins have become an increasingly significant part of investors' portfolios as they prepare for the 2025 supercycle. However, top meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe do not offer any secondary source of income, unlike most of the newer projects. This means investors lose significant money in short-term price action as well as opportunity cost. For instance, those who purchased Pepe after it hit its all-time high of $0.000028 are now in a 25% loss. While the frog-themed meme coin will eventually recoup its gains, the lack of any passive income is a major flaw. However, holders can now stake their coins with MemeVault and earn significant passive income. The platform’s ERC-1155 design and multiple audits mean investors’ funds will remain safe and continue to attract staking rewards, irrespective of any short-term price action. STARS holders can earn thrice the rewards through MemeVault. They can also benefit from a secondary presale staking pool , which is currently offering a reward rate of just under 150%. Is The Viral Meme Coin The Next 100x Token A few prominent experts are viewing Crypto All-Stars as the next 100x meme token. Even some of the more conservative predictions have STARS seeing 10x growth following its launch. After all, it is not without any reason why the viral meme coin is seeing heavy whale bidding in its presale. Last week, a deep-pocketed investor swapped 50 ETH for Crypto All-Stars, buying nearly $200k worth of the meme coin, data from Etherscan reveals. He invested another $120k in STARS later the same day. These smart money investors are seeing strong upside potential for Crypto All-Stars, especially due to the strong demand for its MemeVault feature. Moreover, STARS is a meme coin with strong fundamentals. For instance, it has community-centric tokenomics, with no separate allocation for the developer team or any private sale. Similarly, the Crypto All-Stars smart contract has been audited multiple times and did not reveal any vulnerabilities or centralization risks. Most new meme coins do not offer this level of surety even before their launch. However, interested buyers now have less than 2 days to buy STARS at its current price of $0.0016782. They can visit the presale website, use the over-the-counter widget and buy the meme coin with just a few clicks. They are also advised to follow the project’s X and Telegram accounts for the latest on its upcoming launch.

37842716,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319763,1734610955,Shiba Inu Sells Off as Traders Starts Shifting Money Around,"Shiba Inu ($SHIB) and the family of large-cap doge-themed meme coins have taken some heavy losses over the last 24 hours and over the last week as Web3 investors throw their money into smaller projects, banking on some festive upside. Shiba Inu fell 6.9% overnight and 17.7% over the week and currently changes hands at $0.00002412. It appears to be broadly tracking the price movements of its inspiration, Dogecoin ($DOGE) . The original and biggest meme coin $DOGE dipped 7% overnight and shed 13.6% of its value over the week to trade at $0.3601 as of this writing. For context, in the last 24 hours, crypto’s lofty $3.69 trillion market has fallen 4.4%, while the meme coin sector, which corners a towering $117 billion of the market, has crashed 9.1%. Original cryptocurrency and market leader Bitcoin ($BTC) , which usually sets the pace for the rest of the market to follow, is proving resilient today after only sheding 2.3% overnight and actually growing 0.7% over the week to trade at $101,696. Its market cap remains slightly above $2 trillion. Bitcoin’s number one rival, Ethereum ($ETH) , shed 5.1% overnight and a nominal 6.1% over the week to trade at $3,676. Shiba Inu: Where Will it Go Next? Shiba Inu holders probably don’t have anything to fear by the recent adverse price movements. All in all, the token’s performance has held up better than other Shiba Inu coins, like Bonk ($BONK) and Floki ($FLOKI), which both shed around 24% over the week, while DogWifHat dropped 27%. In fact, $SHIB may even be rebounding soon. As we can see by the green line on the chart below, support for the token had been rising over the last three months until the overnight meme coin crash. Source: TradingView The token’s relative strength index (RSI) is another helpful indicator of an incoming recovery. Shiba Inu’s RSI is currently at 40 and rising. This indicates the token is rebounding out of oversold territory and, thanks to some market-wide dip, buying will help consolidate recent gains and stabilize at $0.000026. Interestingly, newer coins such as Movement , PENGU, and Hyperliquid have been catching a bid during this sell-off. If current momentum continues, we may begin to see new trends emerging as we approach the new year. Meme Coin Investors Exit Doggy Coins For Slap-to-Earn Catslap Incidentally, one of the biggest reasons Shiba Inu and the doge meme coins are struggling is because there is no shortage of competition heading into the festive period. Right now, a brand new Ethereum meme coin that launched directly to DEXs recently called Catslap ($SLAP) has gone viral among meme coin investors. It debuted on Uniswap last month, and within 24 hours it had blown up over 1,500% as investors bundled in, intrigued by the project’s tap-to-slap mini game. The game is on Catslap’s official website , where players click (or tap) the screen in order to animate a gif of the viral slapping cat.

And those slaps pay off too. Recently, the project announced that Catslap players can enable a new slap-to-earn feature that rewards high ranking players with $SLAP.

This New Coin Resembles Solana (SOL) Right Before Its Epic 17,100% Rally in 2021","Every once in a while, the crypto market presents an opportunity so compelling it feels like déjà vu. Back in 2021, Solana (SOL) stunned the crypto world with its incredible 17,100% rally, transforming early believers into millionaires. Now, analysts are buzzing about a new contender— Lightchain AI (LCAI) —that bears striking similarities to Solana’s early days. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, this AI-powered blockchain is creating waves for its innovative technology and explosive growth potential. Could Lightchain AI follow in Solana’s footsteps and deliver astronomical returns? Let’s explore why history might just repeat itself. How Solana Rose from $0.50 to Over $260 in 2024 Solana’s meteoric rise began with its promise of unmatched scalability and speed. Leveraging its unique Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism, Solana became a haven for developers seeking a high-performance blockchain for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. Key drivers of Solana’s success included: Developer Adoption: A rapidly expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications. Institutional Backing: Support from major investors like Alameda Research. Community Growth: Grassroots campaigns that built strong investor confidence. By the time Solana’s ecosystem reached maturity, its early investors were already enjoying life-changing returns. Lightchain AI: The New Contender for Massive Gains Just as Solana transformed blockchain scalability, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is set to revolutionize the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized systems. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, LCAI is positioning itself as a leader in AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). Like Solana’s early days, Lightchain AI offers a developer-friendly ecosystem with tools tailored for AI-driven applications, including its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which lets developers embed machine learning models into dApps. This unlocks new possibilities in industries like predictive analytics, logistics, and finance. For scalability, Lightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for meaningful AI computations, advancing both network efficiency and AI research—similar to Solana’s Proof of History (PoH). Lightchain AI’s growing community reflects Solana’s grassroots beginnings. With over $1.2 million raised in its presale and rising interest from institutional investors, it’s quickly becoming a transformative player in the blockchain and AI space. Keep an eye on Lightchain AI as it bridges AI and decentralized tech. Key Features That Set Lightchain AI Apart Lightchain AI is more than just another blockchain—it’s a next-generation platform designed to address real-world challenges through AI integration. Data Privacy Innovations: Lightchain AI enables secure data sharing using advanced encryption methods, ensuring compliance with global privacy regulations. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Unlike Solana, which faced congestion issues, Lightchain AI supports seamless interactions across multiple blockchains, providing unparalleled flexibility for developers. Deflationary Tokenomics: With a burn mechanism that reduces token supply over time, Lightchain AI ensures long-term value appreciation for LCAI holders. Why Analysts Predict a Massive Rally for Lightchain AI Just like Solana took the chance for big blockchains in 2021, Lightchain AI is ready to le͏ad the next round of new ideas with its AI-linked blockchain answers. Experts guess that LCAI might hit $5–$10 by 2025, giving a possible return of 1,500 times to 3,000 times for first investors. The plan’s path is just as hopeful. By start of 2024, Lightchain AI aims to start its testnet and begin taking in builders. In March 2025, a mainnet will go live, letting full use for its Proof of Smartness (PoS) plan and Artificial Mind Virtual Machine (AMVM). After 2025, the project wants to grow into business-level AI uses and make cross-chain links paving the way for more adoption and new ideas. A Rare Opportunity in the Making Investors and crypto enthusiasts alike are keeping a close eye on Lightchain AI , as the project has all the makings of a potential game-changer. With its innovative technology, growing community, and strong backing from both retail and institutional investors, Lightchain AI could very well follow in Solana’s footsteps and provide astronomical returns for early believers. But as with any investment opportunity, it is important to conduct thorough research and due diligence before making any decisions. While history may be hinting at a repeat performance, there are always risks involved in investing in emerging technologies. Only time will tell if Lightchain AI can deliver on its promises and potentially become the next big thing in the crypto world. So, it is crucial to keep a close eye on this exciting project as it continues to evolve and make its mark in the ever-changing landscape of blockchain and AI technology. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

37839289,https://square.htx.com/?p=42032,1734610198,HTX DAO’s “Confidence Journey” Second Stop a Success: Partnering with DOGE Community to Build an Open and Inclusive Crypto Ecosystem,"The second stop of HTX DAO’s “Confidence Journey” in China concluded successfully on December 13, 2024. The event, hosted by HTX DAO and co-organized by the SUNDOG Community, Balance, and HTX, featured prominent figures like Jiang En, founder of the China DOGE Association; Cheng Qian from the DOGE community; and Molly, spokesperson for HTX DAO. Attendees discussed key topics, such as the Dogecoin ecosystem’s development, investment opportunities, and emerging cryptocurrency trends. HTX DAO Partners with Dogecoin Community to Create a Meme-Friendly Exchange $DOGE has once again garnered attention, fueled by the favorable news of Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president and Elon Musk’s key role in shaping political and economic decisions in Trump’s administration. Since its inception in 2013, Dogecoin has weathered several market cycles. With its current momentum, some predict it could surpass previous highs and hit a market cap of $100 billion, potentially reclaiming its position as the most significant meme coin in the crypto space. The popularity of $DOGE suggests that traditional metrics, such as market capitalization, are no longer the sole indicator of value. “Meme” culture has become increasingly significant. The collaboration between HTX DAO and the Dogecoin community represents more than a simple connection; it signifies a broader movement toward decentralized ecosystems, pushing boundaries and exploring unlimited possibilities. During the event, Cheng Qian and Molly stated their mutual objective: collaborating on key areas like community governance, R&D, and ecological applications to foster a more open and inclusive decentralized ecosystem. This partnership aims to deliver greater value and innovation to global users while establishing a model for win-win cooperation within the cryptocurrency industry. The planned collaborations include: 1. Enhancing Cross-Community Interaction and Engagement: Joint events, online and offline exchanges, and active engagement on social platforms will strengthen ties between the two communities. 2. Optimizing Decentralized Governance: Collaborative initiatives will refine decentralized governance mechanisms, establishing a more transparent and effective decision-making process. This includes innovative approaches to governance proposals, equity allocation, and key decisions, ensuring all community members’ views and interests are considered. 3. Expanding the Utility of $DOGE and $HTX: The partnership will focus on elevating the ecosystem value of $DOGE and $HTX. More efforts will be made to enhance the practical application of $DOGE and $HTX, such as promoting collaboration within the Web3 ecosystem, expanding use cases in more payment scenarios, and driving deeper integration into the DeFi space. Cheng Qian and Molly also stated that they would work together to make HTX a more welcoming and beneficial exchange for users interested in meme coins, and empower the sustainable growth of the meme coin ecosystem. Co-Building and Sharing the Crypto Space: HTX DAO and HTX Committed to Driving Industry Progress During the event, Molly shared the latest developments of HTX DAO and $HTX. She reported that $HTX has seen a significant recovery from its low of $0.0000008 in early August, reaching a peak of $0.000003596. Currently, There are 695,540 $HTX holders, with over 164,000 holding on the HTX platform. The number of users holding more than 100,000 USDT worth of $HTX has increased by 110%, while the number of large holders has grown by 268%. HTX has also established 138 strategic partnerships. Molly, as a core builder of HTX DAO, explained earlier this year, that some people sold $HTX due to a lack of understanding and trust in the 50% burning mechanism and platform governance — essential for the healthy and long-term growth of HTX DAO. Those who maintained their belief and saw the market correction as an opportunity, have benefited from their conviction. Molly also highlighted the rapid transformation of the crypto industry and its impact on the global financial landscape. With innovations and gradual development of clearer regulatory frameworks in recent years, she emphasized that the crypto space is at a pivotal moment, moving toward greater openness, connectivity, and sustainability. HTX DAO and HTX believe the future belongs to everyone, not a select few, and that continued exploration and collaboration are vital to the foundation of this ecosystem. She stressed HTX DAO and HTX are committed to driving industry development and working with all co-builders to create an open, transparent, and equitable crypto future for everyone. The event concluded with a lively banana auction, a symbolizing community spirit. This auction captured the attention of the entire audience, with everyone vying for the banana in fierce competition. The winning bid of 650 million $HTX was placed by an elementary school girl, who in a post-auction interview, proudly stated, “I am also a Bitcoin holder,” generating laughter and applause, reflecting the enduring blockchain spirit and the enthusiasm of the next generation. About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

The Results Were Surprising!,"While memecoins continue to be in the spotlight of investors, a critical memecoin survey came from Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance reported in a survey of global users that cryptocurrency investors have more memecoins in their wallets than Bitcoin. Binance stated that this survey was conducted with over 27,000 users from six continents, including Asia, Australia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. The survey results revealed that cryptocurrency holders own more memecoins than Bitcoin. 16.1% of surveyed users stated that they own memecoins, while 14.4% of participants stated that they own Bitcoin (BTC). Memecoins and Bitcoin were followed by BNB with a rate of 14.2%. Interestingly, survey participants holding BNB are outperforming Ethereum, which has a 10.9% investment rate. The survey results show that memecoins are not only popular in terms of current investment rate, but also a cryptocurrency class that users are very excited about for the future.” While Binance survey respondents indicated that they were optimistic that memecoins would become market leaders by 2025, AI altcoins took the first place despite memecoin expectations, with 23% of respondents predicting that AI altcoins would drive market growth in 2025. Binance recently said that the survey results revealed that Binance Spot trading was the most widely used product among respondents. “25.89% of the 27,000 respondents identified Binance Spot as their preferred product. Binance Earn came in second, with 25.34% of users actively using its features to grow their crypto assets.

The Chairman said that there may only be two rate cuts for 2025. This news plunged all markets into the red, and Bitcoin sank to just above $100,000. Powell speech sends markets crashing Wednesday’s FOMC meeting ended with the customary speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. it was announced that there would be a 25 basis points rate cut, which the market was ready and prepared for. However, as his speech continued, he let it be known that there would likely only be two more adjustments to come for the whole of 2025. On top of this, the newly updated dot plot chart which has the future rate expectations of all the individual Fed members, was actually pointing to a rate rise of 50 basis points. As the news sunk in, the U.S. stock market plunged heavily, while the dollar rocketed to the upside. Bitcoin fell around $6,000 on the day, and the altcoins were generally smashed across the board. The Federal Reserve generally has the most incredible juggling act to do in some of these FOMC meetings. While it sees the absolute necessity of cutting, given the dire state of the jobs market, it does not want to give rein to inflation once again. Therefore, announcing a rate cut, while at the same time sounding incredibly hawkish in the speech afterwards, had the desired effect of dampening down any market enthusiasm. $BTC price touches bottom of ascending channel Source: TradingView For the Bitcoin price it was probably just business as usual. While the drop was very sudden and precipitous, the bears only really succeeded in bringing the price down to the bottom of the ascending channel, within which the price is currently traversing. The price did fall below a trendline that $BTC had been respecting since 4 November, and it now remains to be seen whether the bulls can regain the upper hand and push the price back above this trendline. The price is right at the trendline now, and therefore we will either see a confirmation of the breakdown and rejection, or the price will get above and head back to the top of the ascending channel. Weekly chart nothing out of the ordinary for $BTC Source: TradingView On the weekly chart view there doesn’t appear to be anything out of the ordinary going on with the $BTC price. Last week’s hammer candle, plus all the last few candle wicks to the downside, augur more upside movement to come. Looking at the bottom of the chart at the RSI, it can be seen that the indicator line has started to turn back down. That said, the 70.00 level could act as strong support, as it has done several times so far. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As a result, DTX Exchange (DTX) has emerged as the most promising investment option. However, there are more. Solana (SOL) is also a great pick for the altcoin season. Next, we also have SUI. Lastly, there’s Ethereum (ETH). All four of these can bring you great profits during the altcoin season. Read on for more details! SOL’s Price Dips: Is This a Good Buying Opportunity for Solana? SOL’s price is decreasing right now. Before this, Solana’s token price reached over $260. This increase for Solana was mainly due to the US elections. After that, Solana’s price took a hit. Now, SOL’s price stands at $214. With this, Solana’s price is back where it was before the elections. So, SOL effectively erased its November gains. This might seem bad. However, experts say it isn’t. They say that this is normal for Solana. So, they see this SOL price dip as a good buying opportunity. That’s because they deem SOL to be one of the best investments for the altcoin season. They say that SOL’s price will go up again. This rise will be driven by the altcoin season and Solana’s utility. Namely, many will use Solana for transactions and trading. With that in mind, experts say SOL’s price can go above $300 in the altcoin season. So, now is a good time to stack up SOL coins! SUI Inches Closer to $5: Will It Cross This Level During the Altcoin Season? SUI’s price went to $4.89 recently. However, it failed to break above $5. Instead of rising more, SUI’s price went down to $4.69. However, experts say that this is still great for SUI. It shows that the DeFi coin is strong and still performing well. So, they’ve picked SUI as one of the best investments for the altcoin season. There’s also a lot of interest in SUI right now. This is another great sign that it will do well in the future. Also, the Sui network is always developing. So, new developments will help SUI’s price rise even more in the altcoin season. With that in mind, experts see SUI’s price at $8-$10 in the coming months. However, they say that the token price will likely decrease a bit more before it reaches these targets. Ethereum’s Price Dips After Hitting $4,000: Can ETH Rebound Soon? Many altcoins recorded big price increases recently. Ethereum did, too. Namely, ETH’s price went to $4,011. However, Ethereum’s price dropped soon after. Now, it is at $3,907. That’s because many Ethereum investors sold their tokens for a profit. So, it’s normal for ETH’s price to dip. With this in mind, experts say that Ethereum investors will soon be done taking profits. This means that ETH’s price will be able to rise again. That’s because selling pressure around Ethereum will subside. Ethereum will also reach key resistance levels. All of these factors point to increases in ETH’s price in 2025. Also, the altcoin season will give Ethereum a further boost. Because of this, experts see ETH’s price at around $7,000 in the months to come! What Makes DTX Exchange the Most Promising Investment for the Altcoin Season? DTX Exchange is a revolutionary new trading platform. As such, it’s set to change how we trade. Also, DTX Exchange makes trading much easier for everyone. How? Well, first, it lets you trade everything from one place. Also, DTX Exchange provides you with the Phoenix Wallet for better asset management. It supports a wide range of assets and makes managing them a breeze. Next, DTX Exchange offers incredible speeds. This will help you get better entries and make massive profits. It uses the VulcanX blockchain to do this. With this blockchain, DTX Exchange provides 100,000 TPS! This is much faster than Solana’s 600 TPS. Keep in mind that Solana is considered incredibly fast. So, imagine what traders can do with DTX Exchange when it finally goes live. But there’s more. DTX Exchange also gives everyone an equal opportunity to invest early. That’s because it has a great fair launch system. Most new projects are usually supported by VCs and whales. On the other hand, DTX Exchange isn’t. Instead, it has an incremental price structure. This ensures that DTX’s price increases gradually over time. So, VCs or whales can’t nuke the chart and leave smaller investors hanging! DTX Could be the Real Winner in the Altcoin Season: Get Yours Now Before the Presale Ends! You can buy your DTX tokens at just $0.12 right now. That’s because DTX Exchange is in Stage 6 of its public presale. This gives you the chance to invest very early in this promising project. So far, the DTX presale has raised over $10.2 million. This clearly shows just how much interest DTX has fetched so far! As the presale continues, DTX will rise in price with each new stage. At the end, DTX will launch at $0.20. So, even at launch, early DTX investors will make over 66% of profits. However, this will be just the beginning. Thanks to the massive benefits it offers, experts see DTX rising much higher during the altcoin season. Their primary target is a 100x increase for DTX by Q1 of 2025!

Bitcoin (BTC) briefly tumbled below $100,000; U.S. equities dropped around 3%, while the dollar index (DXY) index soared to a two-year high of 108, which continues to put pressure on currencies worldwide.  The most significant movement came from the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which skyrocketed by 74%, marking the largest one-day jump in the Wall Street's so-called fear gauge since Feb. 5, 2018. It was also the second-largest increase in its history. The VIX serves as a measure of market fear and expected volatility over the next 30 days.  Historically, significant spikes in the VIX have marked local bottoms for both bitcoin and the S&P 500.   Examining the top three one-day changes in the VIX, the first occurred on Feb. 5, 2018, when it surged by 116%. On that day, bitcoin plunged 16% to $6,891, which turned out to be a local bottom. By Feb. 20, prices had rebounded to over $11,000.  The second-largest spike in the VIX occurred on Dec. 18, registering a 74% increase.  The third biggest spike happened on Aug. 5, 2024, during the Yen carry trade unwind, when the VIX jumped 65%. On that occasion, bitcoin dropped 6% to hit a local bottom around $54,000 and climbed back up to over $64,000 by Aug. 23.   A similar pattern has consistently played out in the S&P 500 over the years, data shared by Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at Creative Planning, show.   Let's see if history repeats itself. At press time, BTC traded above $102,000 while the S&P 500 futures pointed to a positive open with a 0.37% gain.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/19/vixs-second-largest-spike-in-history-indicates-a-local-bottom-for-bitcoin-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bf8695edeba13d6513af0aba6f107863a0a76f8-1201x675.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416444,d66c1e81-10dc-4075-9af8-922f72128314,1734609600,Crypto Daybook Americas: Fed Dashes Quiet Christmas Hopes,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  If you were looking forward to a quiet Christmas away from your computer, expecting bitcoin to rise steadily through the year-end, forget it. Looks like the Fed has dashed those plans.  First of all, Chair Jerome Powell's comments distancing the central bank from President-elect Donald Trump's potential creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve mean traders hoping for one will need some solid reassurance. Many are likely to sit on the sidelines until the new administration makes good on its promises. That will weaken the market's bid side until Trump takes office on Jan. 20.  The second concern revolves around rate projections. Fed officials are anticipating just two rate cuts in 2025, saying they see the benchmark borrowing cost dropping to 3.9% in 12 months' time from the current 4.25%-4.5% range. That is a 50 basis-point upward revision from an earlier forecast of 3.40%.  The market could quickly question a cut to below 4% should incoming data point to sticky inflation and/or labor market strength. This situation has led to concerns that long-end rates, including the 10-year yield, might be too low, according to ING.  Interestingly, the 10-year yield has just broken out of a 14-month downward trend that characterized bitcoin's bull run to over $100,000 from $30,000. A further rise in yields could bolster the already strong while triggering a broader decline in risk assets, including BTC. Bitcoin dipped below $100,000 overnight and dragged the broader market down along with it.  This yield breakout poses particular concerns for ether, often viewed as an ""internet bond"" with an annualized staking yield of around 3%, weakening the case for a sustained bounce in the ETH-BTC ratio. The continued decline in risk-sensitive assets like the Australian and New Zealand dollars and emerging-market currencies, partly reflecting worries about the Chinese economy, also signals caution.  Still, pullbacks of 20% or more are typical in crypto bull markets, and the overall outlook remains positive.   ""Looking ahead, heightened volatility is on the horizon as markets adjust to the expectations surrounding Donald Trump’s presidency. Although short-term turbulence may occur, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and Ether remains bullish,"" said Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN.  In this uncertain climate, traders might seek refuge in high-yielding crypto assets like Ethena's USDe, which offers returns of around 12%. Pseudonymous analyst OxJeff suggests these pullbacks could present a golden opportunity to invest in tokens linked to AI-powered systems in the blockchain space.

AI tokens are predicted to be the stars of 2025, with nearly 24% of respondents in a survey of 27,000 Binance users saying they'll lead market growth next year. Memecoins are not far behind, with 19% saying they expect them to rise next year. The tokens are fun, popular and currently the most held crypto assets, with 16% of Binance users owning them.

Derivatives Positioning  The panic from the overnight sell-off has faded, and BTC and ETH calls expiring on Dec. 27 and beyond are back to trading at a premium relative to puts. However, the overall bias is still considerably weaker than it was earlier this month.  BTC flows have been mixed, with large bull call spread, involving $105K and $100K strikes alongside a long straddle at $100K strike options expiring on Jan. 31 and notable buying in $102K and $100K puts.

The Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut policy triggered a market-wide price correction. XRP maintains a bullish outlook despite the recent price corrections. XRP’s price fell 20% in less than 48 hours after a recent rally tied to Tuesday’s RLUSD launch, according to data from TradingView . The Ripple token retraced on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut news caused a market-wide price correction. XRP slid from Tuesday’s $2.7255 high to retest the support at $2.1708 early Thursday. Beyond the Fed’s interest rate news impact, XRP’s pullback looked like a “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario.

The case was brought by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance, which argued that Wright's suit in October violated the London court's July ruling barring him from pursuing proceedings related to his claim to be Nakamoto.  “When it comes to the grounds of contempt I have found each of them proved beyond reasonable doubt,” Judge James Mellor said.  Wright, who was in Asia, attended the court virtually on Thursday to hear the sentence, which is suspended for two years. Wright declined to say where in Asia he was and insisted he would appeal the verdict.  In March, Mellor ruled that Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto. He then issued a court order preventing Wright from pursuing proceedings in the U.K. and other jurisdictions related to the claim.  ""Dr. Wright is perfectly capable, once the dust has settled, of ramping up his public pronouncements again,"" Mellor wrote at the time.

37838803,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375297,1734609259,"Fartcoin Reaches ATH, Surpassing $1B Market Cap Despite Fed-Induced Downturn","On December 18, Solana-based meme coin Fartcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH), briefly pushing its market capitalization beyond the $1 billion mark. The surge came amidst a slump in the broader crypto market caused by pressure from the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing a 25-basis point rate cut, coupled with projections of fewer rate reductions in 2025. Lighting Up the Market Gloom The Fed’s announcement seemed to have rattled investors, with major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum shedding 4% and 5% of their values, respectively, in the last 24 hours. Among the top ten, XRP and Dogecoin performed even more poorly, with the former down 6.8% while the latter lost 5.8% of its worth. Despite the gloom, Fartcoin was among the few altcoins to stay in the green, jumping 21% to reach an all-time high of $1.02. With a circulating supply of 999,995,862 tokens, the new price pushed its market cap to about $1.01 billion, according to CoinGecko data . However, the rally didn’t last long, with the meme coin subsequently retracing to $0.7158 before kicking off another recovery rally. At the time of this writing, it was changing hands at $0.9889, a 17.6% improvement across 24 hours and just 5.4% below its all-time high. The token’s current price puts its overall value at around $955 million, placing it at #129 among the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Fartcoin’s gains were more pronounced across longer periods, with a whopping 446.1% increase over the past fortnight and an equally impressive 220.8% jump in the last 30 days. Additionally, over seven days, the meme coin registered an 85% uptick, significantly outperforming the broader crypto market, which was down 2.7% in the same period. Analysis and Future Outlook The irreverently named cryptocurrency’s performance aligns with a bullish five-wave impulse pattern noted by analysts. Its $1.01 ATH was the culmination of Wave 3 of that pattern, which was marked by major resistance. As such, market watchers are now predicting a corrective Wave 4 pullback toward the $0.70 to $0.58 range before the coin resumes its uptrend in Wave 5, with targets set at $1.12 and $1.27. However, they urge caution since, in their opinion, a drop below $0.58 could invalidate Fartcoin’s bullish outlook. Similarly, the meme token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, suggesting a potential cooldown before its next rally.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

Ink launched on mainnet on Wednesday, fueled by considerable developer enthusiasm and community support. The Layer2 blockchain, built using Optimism’s OP Stack, was initially scheduled to go live in early 2025. Kraken’s Layer2 Blockchain Goes Live Ahead Of Schedule Ink is based on the OP Stack, a highly customizable framework that allows developers to build their own rollups by leveraging Optimism’s technology. The Layer2 blockchain was initially set for launch in early 2025, putting its launch ahead of schedule. According to the announcement, Kraken fast-tracked the launch due to millions of testnet transactions and connected wallets, indicating strong demand. The Layer2 network will now progress towards Stage 1 decentralization, with permissionless fault proofs in January. Andrew Koller, the founder of Ink, stated, “Today is just the beginning for Ink, and now our boldest work really begins – growing Ink. We’re pushing the boundaries of on-chain experiences to unlock new applications and opportunities for builders and users alike. Thank you to the earliest supporters of Ink, who have been overwhelmingly positive. We’re Inking the future together.” Ink also posted an announcement on their official X handle, stating, “We’re excited to announce Ink is live on mainnet! Months ahead of schedule, we’re officially launching as part of the Optimism Superchain. This is just the beginning of our journey to bridge the gap between users and builders in DeFi.” Kraken also agreed to receive 25 million OP tokens worth around $58 million as part of a deal to build on the OP Stack. Optimism has said giving developer grants for participants building on OP Stack is part of its strategy and will contribute towards the wider Superchain ecosystem. Unprecedented Demand According to statements made by Kraken, unprecedented demand from builders and support from the crypto community helped speed up the launch. Moving forward, Ink will focus on decentralization and interoperability. Ink was developed as a Layer2 on the Optimism Superchain. According to representatives from Optimism, Ink quickly grew to over 100,000 users, with the testnet reporting significant activity levels. Ryan Wyatt, Chief Growth Officer at Optimism Unlimited, stated, “Ink’s accelerated mainnet launch is a testament to the strength of the team, the resources dedicated to its success, and the developer community’s enthusiasm for the launch. As part of the Superchain, Ink will participate in Optimism. We look forward to working together to attract developers and users to Ink as we bring Ethereum to scale.” Considerable Challenges Both Kraken and Optimism faced significant challenges over the past few months. Kraken is facing an $8 million fine in Australia. It was also forced to shut down its NFT marketplace following a market downturn and redirect resources towards newer projects. Optimism also faced several challenges before the mainnet launch. In October, its ecosystem came under immense pressure, and the OP token suffered several price shocks. The current bull run has also done very little for the OP token’s value, with the token performing poorly throughout the year. Other Layer2 Networks Several other platforms are also using OP Stack to build a Layer2 network. These include Kraken’s competitor, Coinbase. Coinbase announced in August 2023 that it was building a Layer2 with OP Stack. The Layer2, called Base, is now the second largest rollup network, according to data from L2beat. At the time, Optimism said the Base team would receive up to 118 million OP tokens. Others building a Layer2 using OP Stack include Uniswap, World Network, and Sony Blockchain Labs.

37838854,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630117,1734609138,SEC’s 90-day crypto reform plan under Trump,"The crypto industry’s hopes for improved SEC relations under Paul Atkins received a major boost with the introduction of a 90-day plan focusing on clearer regulations, halting unnecessary litigation, and removing outdated rules. The proposal is expected to rebuild trust and encourage innovation. The next three months will be critical for shaping a more balanced regulatory approach under Trump. Recognized as a pro-crypto advocate, the Paul Atkins-led SEC could signal potential regulatory changes and improve crypto relations under the Trump administration. This shift could lead to clearer and more supportive regulations for the crypto industry. In a December 18 statement , the Digital Chamber said, “The digital asset industry is striving to operate responsibly, and the SEC must recognize this to foster a productive and transparent ecosystem.” The group emphasized the need for mutual trust. The SEC has been criticized for “regulating through enforcement”, which has caused much confusion and slowed down innovations. The Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance is calling for a change by urging the SEC to build trust with the crypto industry. It believes this can happen if the SEC recognizes that most crypto participants act responsibly. it also maintains that a more transparent approach would help both sides move forward. The 90-day crypto plan The Token Alliance has proposed a 90-day plan to change the way how SEC handles cryptocurrency regulations. One key suggestion is to immediately review all current crypto-related investigations, Wells notices, and lawsuits. The plan also calls for pausing litigation in cases that don’t involve fraud, investor harm, or immediate risk. This includes major cases involving companies like Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple, which have caused inconveniences between the SEC and the crypto industry on a regular basis. The goal is to create a more balanced approach and avoid obstructing innovation. This reset’s goal is especially to build trust and clear up confusion in the digital asset space. The Alliance suggests removing outdated rules that have caused confusion, including the 2019 framework applying the Howey test to digital assets and the 2018 “Hinman Speech.” The group also wants to stop regulating the industry through enforcement actions. Instead, it urges the SEC to create clear and consistent rules to help businesses. These changes are necessary to clear up confusion, make the market fairer, rebuild trust in investors, and encourage innovation in the crypto world. Another priority is to deal with the burden of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which forces companies holding cryptocurrencies to list them as liabilities. The Token Alliance argues that this rule pushes investors away from the U.S. market and to the riskier options abroad. Although President Biden rejected a bill to repeal SAB 121, may be the new administration could reverse this decision and provide relief. It also mentioned reconsidering the SEC’s plan to expand “exchanges” to cover decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms under Rule 3b-16. Critics argue that this could limit innovation in the DeFi space and reduce its benefits. SEC’s new era Paul Atkins is expected to take a different approach from the outgoing Gary Gensler.

With a massive liquidation spree hitting the crypto market, Dogecoin faces significant selling pressure, resulting in a sharp decline. Amid such conditions, DOGE's price stands at a critical juncture in determining its upcoming trend.As the meme coin segment sees an exodus of investors, Dogecoin’s chances of reversal appear slim. Will the largest meme coin withstand the bearish pressure, or is a crash to $0.30 inevitable?Dogecoin (DOGE) Price AnalysisThe Dogecoin price trend on the 4-hour chart shows a significant correction over the past few weeks. After failing to reach the $0.50 psychological mark, the DOGE rally peaked at $0.4846 on December 8, 2024.Since then, increased market volatility has dampened buying pressure for Dogecoin. After breaking below the 200-EMA line on the 4-hour chart, DOGE crashed to a 24-hour low of $0.3574 as the broader market corrected. However, Dogecoin’s price action shows a lower price rejection, currently trading at $0.35962. The sudden surge in supply, which triggered the massive crash, has led to a bearish crossover between the 20-EMA and 200-EMA lines.Furthermore, the increased bearish momentum on the 4-hour DOGE has caused a decline in the 4-hour RSI, which has entered the oversold zone and is signaling a sell.This limits the chances of a double bottom forming at $0.35, as the Dogecoin price bounced from similar levels in November. Therefore, the technical indicators suggest that a bullish reversal is unlikely.Dogecoin Key Price LevelsIf the Dogecoin uptrend continues above the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.3732, it will face multiple dynamic resistances, including the 200-day and 20-day EMA lines. These could hinder the uptrend, making it difficult for the price to reclaim the $0.40 mark.Conversely, speculative traders in the meme coin space are likely to exit their positions as market volatility increases. In such a case, the Dogecoin price will likely retest the crucial $0.34 support, with added pressure.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/19/dogecoin-risks-0-35-breakdown-is-doge-price-entering-bearish-territory/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dogecoin-risks-0-35-breakdown-is-doge-price-entering-bearish-territory,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The data also indicated that the Chinese banks’ margins are narrowing due to a persistent property slump and a slowdown in China’s economy. Data from Singapore-based firm Data Motion International Trading Pte also revealed that the average mortgage rate for buyers’ first homes in 42 big cities inched up to 3.08% last month from a record low of 3.05% in October. The increase in mortgage rates remains surprising because the housing market is still in a persistent decline that began three years ago. The Chinese housing market prices are still plummeting despite recent signs of improvements in sales following a stimulus push that began in late September. Chinese regulators guide banks to raise mortgage rates on new loans Chinese Banks raise mortgage rates for the first time in 3 years pic.twitter.com/NlP5RWX0ot — Barchart (@Barchart) December 19, 2024 Chinese banks are battling a record-low net interest margin but are still under pressure to boost their books. The pressure seems to be constraining the central bank’s ability to further bring down interest rates. More rate cuts could indicate that next year will intensify the challenge for lenders to find ways to deal with declining loan rates. Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co, believes that home sales will likely remain challenging in the near future, making the rate increase unjustified from a market perspective. “It’s likely that regulators guided the banks to raise mortgage rates on new loans in a concerted move, so as to create enough buffer for further and bigger rate reductions next year.” – Shen Meng, Director at Chanson & Co. The world’s No.2 economy moved to lower costs in late September on as much as $5.3 trillion in outstanding mortgages for homeowners to bolster the property market. Pang Gongsheng, Central Bank governor, revealed that the measures would result in an average 50 basis point cut for borrowers and reduce their annual interest expenses by about 150 billion yuan ($20.6 billion). PBOC’s executives issue guidance to ease price war among banks Figures from Data Motion that surveyed banks’ local branches across Chinese cities also disclosed that 17 out of the 42 cities lifted first-home mortgage rates in November. Cities like Wuhan, Wenzhou, and Changsha recorded the biggest increase of 20 basis points. A report by Caixin revealed that the uptick trickled down from guidance given by local branches of a supervisory body overseen by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). The supervisory body known as the interest rate self-disciplinary mechanism cited two unnamed bank executives. The report also disclosed that the executives’ guidance was intended to ease a “price war” among banks that undermined profitability as they raced to slash mortgage rates to draw clients. Official data also indicated that combined profits at commercial lenders edged up just 0.5% in the first three quarters to 1.9 trillion yuan. The data also showed that total non-performing loans surged to a record 3.4 trillion yuan at the end of September. Net interest margins also narrowed to 1.53%, the lowest ever and well below the 1.8% threshold regarded as necessary to maintain reasonable profitability. The nation’s central bank cut the reserve requirement ratio in recent years to free up low-cost money and address lenders’ profit pressure. China’s banks also cut deposit rates to reduce funding costs. The country’s authorities joined in vowing to beef up capital positions at the biggest state-owned lenders using funding from the sale of special sovereign bonds.

Solana and Its Native Cryptocurrency SOL Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and decentralized applications. It focuses on fast transactions and flexible tools for developers. Solana’s approach avoids sharding, relying instead on a high-capacity network for efficiency. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is used for transactions, running programs, and rewarding contributors. SOL also gives users access to projects built on the platform. The network’s architecture and support for multiple programming languages make it attractive for hosting high-demand applications. Its potential to handle large volumes of activity has drawn attention from developers and investors. The coin’s appeal in the market depends on ongoing adoption and the success of projects within the Solana ecosystem. AVAX: A Fast and Flexible Blockchain Platform AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a high-speed, eco-friendly blockchain. Avalanche processes up to 4,500 transactions per second with finality in under two seconds. It uses a hybrid consensus model and features three chains (X-Chain, C-Chain, P-Chain) to handle diverse functions like transactions and smart contracts. A unique feature is its customizable Subnets, which allow users to create new blockchains. AVAX is used for paying transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and powering Subnets. Its low fees, rapid transaction speeds, and flexibility may appeal to users looking for scalable, energy-efficient solutions. Whether AVAX is attractive depends on market conditions and individual investment goals. Polkadot (DOT) and Its Role in Blockchain Interconnection Polkadot is a system that connects different blockchains, allowing them to share data and value without needing a middleman. It uses parachains to make transactions faster and more efficient than Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOT is the network’s token, which is used for managing updates and ensuring transactions are valid. DOT holders can vote on changes to the system and earn rewards by staking. Polkadot was created by Gavin Wood, who also helped build Ethereum, and was launched in May 2020. Its focus on blockchain communication and scalability makes it an interesting option, especially as demand grows for more efficient and flexible blockchain solutions. Polygon (POL) and Its Role in Scaling Ethereum Polygon is a layer two solution for Ethereum designed to improve transaction speed and reduce fees. Its native coin, POL, is used for fees, staking, and governance. The platform uses proof-of-stake, involving validators and delegators to secure the network and process transactions. Originally launched as Matic Network, it rebranded to Polygon in 2021. By allowing users to bridge assets and engage with decentralized applications at lower costs, Polygon expands Ethereum’s functionality. Its low fees and efficiency make it appealing for DeFi activities. The coin and technology benefit from Ethereum’s growing ecosystem, suggesting potential for sustained use in the market. Conclusion SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show steady promise but may deliver slower short-term results. For those chasing elite growth and lifestyle, DOGEN emerges as the standout pick. Positioned for a projected 700% rise before its presale closes, it aligns with past breakout tokens and offers unique perks to early adopters seeking dominance and unmatched returns.

The Miami, Florida-based company said it bought about 990 bitcoin for an average price of $101,710 each. The latest purchase will bring the amount of bitcoin held in Hut 8's reserve to 10,096, or about $1 billion in market value, and make it among the top 10 largest corporate owners of bitcoin, the company said in a statement on Thursday.   The miner is planning to use the reserve through options strategies, pledges, sales or other strategies, according to the statement. Hut 8's CEO, Asher Genoot, told CoinDesk that his firm will be opportunistic in buying more bitcoin in the open market.   “Today, the market recognizes and values our strategic reserve, which effectively lowers our cost of capital and strengthens our financial position. As long as this market dynamic persists, we will remain opportunistic in expanding our Bitcoin reserve,” Genoot said.  The move follows Hut 8's announcement earlier this month that it started a new $500 million at-the-market share issuance program. At the time, the firm said some of the proceeds from the fund would be used to buy bitcoin in the open market, among other things.   MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin on its balance sheet, started the trend of buying bitcoin in the open market. It wasn't until MARA Holdings' purchase of bitcoin in the open market this year that this became prominent among the miners. Most recently, peer Riot Platforms (RIOT) bought 667 bitcoin at an average price of $101,135 on Dec. 16.  Buying large amounts of bitcoin in the open market has paid off for miners opening up new avenues of raising funds at a time when the industry is grappling with a profit squeeze after the recent Bitcoin halving event. Last month, MARA was able to raise $1 billion in convertible debts—a financial instrument where investors can convert debt into equity—with zero interest. This means investors are willing to let go of the interest income from the debt for the equities that provide them with exposure to bitcoin.   Hut 8 said holding bitcoin reserve serves as a flexible option for the firm that can help the company grow. ""We view our strategic reserve as a dynamic financial asset that can be actively managed to drive returns well beyond simple price appreciation,"" Genoot told CoinDesk.   ""Together with the significant investments we are making to expand our core operating business—with a clear path to 24 EH/s of self-mining capacity by Q2 2025—strategic Bitcoin purchases in the open market can strengthen our balance sheet and ability to invest thoughtfully in growth,"" he said.

37838165,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745270-ybit-why-the-time-may-be-right-for-this-covered-call-bitcoin-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1734607800,YBIT: Why The Time May Be Right For This Covered-Call Bitcoin Play,"Summary Bitcoin has surged 148% this year, with a 65% rise post-election, driven by potential policy support from the incoming President. I have a buy rating on the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF for lower-risk exposure to bitcoin, despite its high expense ratio. YBIT's covered call strategy offers income from bitcoin's volatility, but caps upside gains; it's up 29% versus IBIT's 73% in three months. Seasonal trends favor bitcoin in Q1, making YBIT a compelling play amid high implied volatility and potential consolidation in bitcoin prices. Bitcoin is up 148% so far this year. Just since the US election, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has risen by about 65%. Indeed, bitcoin and its related ETFs have been perhaps the ultimate Trump trade. With the incoming President poised to potentially move to create a “bitcoin reserve” and allow the industry to write its own regulations, there are clear fundamental and policy tailwinds at play for the years ahead. A new ETF is on the scene to help investors potentially capture even more return from bitcoin. The YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF (YBIT) is a covered call strategy on spot bitcoin. I have a buy rating on the product as I see it as a lower-risk (though with less upside too) play on bitcoin. Its primary drawback is an elevated expense ratio, but I see the fund as being a viable option for those seeking option premium income return from a notoriously highly volatile asset. As it stands, traders price in the potential for 20% more upside to bitcoin this year, underscoring its high volatility. Of course, this is just a ‘max price’ market, and nobody knows how the token will trade for the balance of 2024 and beyond. More Bitcoin Gains to Come? High Volatility Expected Kalshi According to the issuer , YBIT seeks to generate current income via a synthetic covered call strategy on one or more select U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETPs. YBIT is actively managed by ZEGA Financial. When selecting Bitcoin ETPs on which to trade options, ZEGA focuses primarily on the following two key factors: Preference for Bitcoin ETPs that hold “physical” or “spot” Bitcoin over such ETPs that reference Bitcoin indirectly via futures contracts. It prefers Bitcoin ETPs that have sufficient option liquidity to support YBIT’s trading activities. The Fund’s primary investment objective is to seek current income. The Fund’s secondary investment objective is to seek exposure to the share price of the Bitcoin ETP(s), subject to a limit on potential investment gains. YBIT is a small ETF with just $105 million in assets under management as of December 17, 2024. Its annual expense ratio is high at 0.99% while the forward dividend yield is very high at 46%. Of course, the high distribution rate is due to option premium generation that is procured from writing call options on bitcoin-related products. The dividend does not come from the cash flows of a company – that's a key difference for prospective investors to recognize. On liquidity , I also encourage prospective investors to use limit orders during the trading day since the ETF’s median 30-day bid/ask spread is high at 28bps, per YieldMax. Share-price momentum with YBIT is strong right now given bitcoin’s rapid appreciation in the past seven weeks, but its relative return to spot bitcoin is weak due to the nature of capping potential upside through selling upside call options. In the past three months, YBIT is up 29% (total return) compared to a 73% gain in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). IBIT Soaring, YBIT's Return About Half Last 3 Months Seeking Alpha I also assert that paying attention to seasonal trends with anything crypto-related is key, as the market moves not on fundamentals like profits of a company, but rather on animal spirits like fear and greed. Bitcoin has tended to perform well over the first three months of the year; since 2021, only January 2022 was a negative month in Q1. So, that would augur for a long bitcoin position. Aggressive investors might choose to buy something like IBIT while those who are more risk-sensitive might prefer YBIT. In general, a call-selling strategy should outperform when the asset it tracks falls or trades sideways, but underperforming during quickly rising markets. Bitcoin Seasonality: Strong Q1 History Barchart Now let’s take a look at a key variable for an option-income fund: volatility. Today, implied volatility on bitcoin (using IBIT as a proxy) is high at 60%. Historical volatility has ranged from 40% to 75%, so IV is not too far from where we’d expect it. I think that there may be added implied volatility discounted into bitcoin with the new year looming – a risk is that we could see so-called “tax gain” harvesting among holders who want to sell, but do not want to realize a gain until the following tax year. IBIT: Implied Volatility Near 60% Fidelity Investments As for YBIT’s distribution history, there have been varied monthly payouts. When implied volatility is higher, I would expect larger dividends. The July and November distributions were relatively large, so those who are sensitive to taxes must be aware that high payouts can come about with relatively little warning – July and November were very different in terms of bitcoin returns, so I will be curious to see what the December distribution will be. YBIT: Distribution History YieldMax ETFs YBIT currently uses IBIT options to create its bitcoin exposure. I like that since IBIT is the largest spot bitcoin ETF, so liquidity is high. YBIT: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha The Technical Take Now let’s briefly take a look at bitcoin’s technical situation. Notice in the chart below that shares broke out from a bull flag pattern following the November election. Then, $100k was near-term resistance, which the bulls managed to get through without too much delay. I see a measured move upside target to $115k-$120k based on the $45k range height of the 2021-2024 cup and handle pattern. We are getting close to that zone now. Considering that bettors see a $124k max price this year, we might be due for limited upside in the months ahead, making YBIT a compelling play compared to an outright long bitcoin position. Bitcoin: Upside Target $115k-$120k, $100k Support Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on YBIT. Now could be a favorable time to own a covered call play on bitcoin, with potential consolidation on tap. Bullish seasonal trends suggest that a material downside move is not too likely, so holding some long exposure with YBIT also fits the narrative and broad set of indicators I see today.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745270-ybit-why-the-time-may-be-right-for-this-covered-call-bitcoin-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37838165.jpeg

While some investors made panic sales in the face of these declines, some investors turned the declines into opportunities and made purchases. At this point, Lookonchain said that Chinese investment firm Longling Capital acquired Ethereum (ETH). Chinese investment firm Longling Capital purchased 6,000 ETH following the recent price drop of ETH. Since May 8 last year, the company has raised a total of 75,400 ETH ($180.4 million) at an average price of $2,392 and sold 50,800 ETH ($172.8 million) at an average price of $3,401. “A smart whale (probably associated with LonglingCapital) bought 6,000 ETH after the price drop. This whale is very good at buying ETH low and selling it high, and made a total profit of $83 million.” Ethereum, which has fallen 5.2% in the last 24 hours, continues to be traded at $3,660 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

37838029,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375320,1734607653,Don’t Sell Your Ripple (XRP) Until These Seven Things Happen (Analyst),"TL;DR The launch of Ripple’s stablecoin launch, leadership changes at the SEC, and a potential lawsuit settlement could impact XRP’s future. Analysts forecast short-term targets of $2.78 to $8.76, with potential for further growth if the price reaches $10. Wait for These Things to Happen Despite the latest correction, which briefly suppressed the price of XRP to under $2.25, Ripple’s native token remains one of the best performers in the market this year. It currently trades at around $2.42, which represents a whopping 300% increase since January 1. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko The pump was long anticipated by the XRP army, and some members might be contemplating whether to sell some of their holdings. However, one market observer, using the X moniker Maxi, said investors should wait a bit longer. The analyst outlined seven vital factors XRP investors should get checked before eventually cashing out. The first element is the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin – RLUSD. As CryptoPotato reported , the financial product meant to be pegged 1:1 to the American dollar saw the light of day on December 17. The second thing is Donald Trump’s inauguration, scheduled for January 20, 2025, while Gary Gensler’s departure from the US SEC is the third factor. The agency’s leader, who is known for his anti-crypto approach, will vacate his post next month, with Paul Atkins replacing him at the helm. The latter has a completely different stance toward the digital asset sector, advocating for implementing regulations that foster innovation in the space. Next on the list is the eventual settlement of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC . The entities have been confronting on the legal front for four years, with some seeing the agency as the underdog. After all, Ripple secured some vital (yet partial) court wins, while the upcoming shift in the leadership of the Commission could lead to a favorable resolution. The other factors investors should wait for include the beginning of the altseason, a potential partnership between Ripple and a large banking institution, and the possible launch of an XRP ETF. XRP Price Predictions Some of the people making bullish forecasts as of late include the X users JAVON MARKS and Dark Defender. The former expects a potential price explosion, while the latter set $5.85 and $8.76 as short-term targets. Most recently, Armando Pantoja also chipped in. He claimed that XRP could be headed toward $2.78 and then $3.87. The analyst went even further, forecasting a mass FOMO effect if the price reach $10-$12, and “that’s when it will get crazy.” The post Don’t Sell Your Ripple (XRP) Until These Seven Things Happen (Analyst) appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/dont-sell-your-ripple-xrp-until-these-seven-things-happen-analyst/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37838029.jpeg

The leverage and margin levels for USDⓈ-M perpetual contracts, including DAR, ME, CAKE , IOTA , LPT, ONE, and ZEN, will be updated by Binance Futures today, with effect from 08:15 UTC on Dec. 19, 2024. USDⓈ-M stands for USD-Margined Futures, a type of cryptocurrency futures contract offered on platforms like Binance. It refers to stablecoins such as USDT ( Tether ) or BUSD (BUSD), which are pegged to the US dollar. These contracts are settled in these stablecoins, rather than traditional fiat currency or the underlying crypto asset. Depending on the contract and position size, the revised leverage tiers will vary from 1x to 75x, enabling traders to fully benefit from their leveraged positions in the crypto market.

Margin is the total amount of collateral needed to open and sustain a trading position, whereas leverage is the borrowing of funds to increase the size of a position. The possible return increases with leverage, but the chance of loss also goes up. By adjusting the margin and leverage tiers, Binance Futures continues to give traders more choices to control risk and profit from volatile crypto market movements.

As the broader market experiences a massive crash due to selling pressure, altcoins are falling rapidly. However, amid these rising bearish conditions, SUI is maintaining dominance at its crucial support levels.As the altcoin showcases resilience amid increased market volatility, its ability to hold above the $4 psychological mark reflects strong underlying support. Will this strength lead to a bullish comeback, pushing the price past the $5 psychological level to establish a new all-time high?SUI Price AnalysisOn the 4-hour chart, the SUI price trend reveals a rising channel pattern. The bullish extension is triggered by a breakout of a falling channel within this bullish pattern.However, SUI has encountered strong resistance near the $5 psychological level. The trend is struggling to close decisively above $4.75 while facing significant price rejections as it attempts to surpass the $5 mark. With multiple long-wick formations due to massive supply pressure, SUI's price consolidated for a while. The consolidation range extended between the 61.80% Fibonacci and 78.60% Fibonacci levels, at $4.44 and $4.75, respectively.The pullback in the broader market recently caused SUI's price to drop below the consolidation support. While increased supply pushed the price to a new 24-hour low of $4.07, the underlying strength and psychological support led to a swift recovery.SUI is currently trading at $4.3850, reflecting an intraday growth of 1.16%. However, the negative cycle within the rising channel pattern resulted in a 6.67% drop yesterday.With lower price rejections, SUI maintains a close above the 50% Fibonacci at $4.194. The recovery aims to reclaim the $4.50 level.The recent shift in sentiment has led to a declining MACD and signal line trend, extending its bearish momentum. Additionally, the RSI is approaching the oversold boundary. These momentum indicators suggest a strong bearish trend in SUI prices.SUI Price TargetsUsing the trend-based Fibonacci levels, the lower price rejection from the 50% level increases the likelihood of a bullish reversal. If the uptrend continues, a breakout rally could push the price to re-test the 78.60% Fibonacci level.In the event of a strong close and a broader market recovery, the uptrend could target $5.24 by the end of 2024.

Bitcoin mining economics improved in November as the average price of bitcoin was 31% higher while the average network hashrate rose by almost 4%, the report said.  The hashrate, representing the total computing power dedicated to a network, is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  ""Average daily revenue per exahash was $55,649, which represented a 20.7% month-on-month increase,"" analysts Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul wrote.  U.S.-listed miners mined less bitcoin in November than the previous month, the bank said. Still, they mined more on a ""network basis,"" accounting for 24.7% of the total network.  The bank noted that uptime improved, which could be partly due to colder temperatures as winter approaches.  MARA Holdings (MARA) mined the most bitcoin, with 907 in November, and CleanSpark (CLSK) was second, with 622, the report noted.

37838169,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52563,1734607374,"Should You Bother With Crypto? Best Token to Buy If You Missed Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) & Ripple (XRP)?","From a little financial experiment, cryptocurrencies are today a worldwide economic phenomenon. From Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH), early investors have exhibited amazing gains generating billionaires. However, the crypto market has opened new possibilities as these currencies have developed. Still worth considering cryptocurrencies? Let’s investigate whether crypto investing is profitable and select the best token to purchase if you miss BTC, ETH, and XRP. The Journey of Bitcoin (BTC): A $1 Dream Turned $100K Reality A turning point came when BTC first reached equilibrium with the US currency in February 2011. Early adopters started flooding in, seeing the promise of a dispersed financial system. Bitcoin had jumped to $30 by June 2011, but it wasn’t until late 2013 that it crossed the $1,000 mark, indicating its global presence. The craze started in 2017 when Bitcoin’s price surged to an all-time high (ATH) of $19,850, a figure many felt was impossible. However, the coin exceeded expectations in December 2020, rising to $64,799 quickly. With its price around $101,881.73, Bitcoin’s ATH in 2024 sits at $103,900. Although BTC is already firmly established as “digital gold,” many new investors looking for exponential returns cannot afford its incredible price. Ethereum (ETH): The Growth of the Smart Contract Giant Ethereum transformed the crypto landscape by adding smart contracts, allowing distributed apps (dApps), and creating the environment for the larger DeFi ecosystem. Founded in 2014, ETH first traded for less than $1. It took off only during the 2017 bull market, rising beyond $100 and reaching $414 by June. The trip did not stop there. Ethereum exceeded $1,418 by January 2018 and fell drastically during the crypto winter. Following years of development and adoption, ETH retested its prior ATH in February 2021, and by May, it had skyrocketed to $4,399. Though its utility has spurred Ethereum’s expansion, like Bitcoin, its price has matured, and triple-digit percentage rises are less likely in the foreseeable future. Ripple (XRP): The Sleeper Giant with a Parabolic Rally Starting in 2017, Ripple’s XRP coin shocked many with its explosive growth. From under $0.01 to an all-time high of $3.40, XRP gained almost 51,000% between March 2017 and January 2018. Top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ripple’s promise of transforming cross-border payments drew institutional interest. However, regulating issues, especially with the SEC, have hampered its recent expansion. Though XRP still has promise, its days of parabolic rallies are behind it. Investors increasingly seek significant returns to more recent coins with untapped potential and substantial use cases. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Best Token for Missed Opportunities Rexas Finance (RXS) is the next great prospect for investors who believe they missed the boat on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Positioned as a revolutionary token in the real-world asset (RWA) space, Rexas Finance is not just a cryptocurrency but also a gateway to a future whereby tokenization and asset liquidity are seamless. With fractional ownership and worldwide access, Rexas Finance (RXS) lets consumers tokenize real-world assets, including real estate, art, and commodities. Both institutional and retail investors find it appealing since its Certik-audited system guarantees top-tier security and confidence. The cryptocurrency’s presale performance has been outstanding. Priced at $0.15 and in its tenth stage, RXS has now raised approximately $28.46 million in presale money. With each stage selling out earlier than expected, Rexas Finance has regularly outperformed expectations. The expected listing price of $0.20 for late entries guarantees assured returns. Since its first-stage presale, Rexas Finance (RXS) has already experienced a price increase of five times. Analysts project a 47,000% increase so that RXS might be among the most profitable tokens of this cycle. Unlike more established cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, which mainly depend on market mood, RXS is motivated by actual use and acceptance. Set to list on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, Rexas Finance guarantees strong liquidity and accessibility for worldwide investors. The token’s creative approach would be ideal for diversifying their portfolios or making money in the next bull run. RXS provides access to a groundbreaking investment ecosystem and a notable price increase.

37839295,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321056,1734607342,"CoinDesk Faces Pressure Over Justin Sun Report, Editor Resigns","In late November, CoinDesk, a leading crypto publication, published a story spotlighting blockchain billionaire Justin Sun’s latest headline-grabbing antics. The article detailed how Sun consumed the $6.2 million banana he had purchased at a Sotheby’s auction . The banana was originally crafted by Maurizio Cattelan and titled as a “Comedian” art piece. The report, titled “I Watched Justin Sun Eat the World’s Most Expensive Banana. I Don’t Get It,” explored the stunt’s context in the art world and included background on Sun, including his legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Source: YahooFinance The SEC has charged Sun with fraud , allegations that Sun and his blockchain company Tron have moved to dismiss. Soon after publication, CoinDesk faced significant pressure. According to sources cited in a Fortune report , Sun’s team complained about the tone of the article, leading CoinDesk’s parent company, the crypto exchange Bullish, to allegedly demand its removal. The incident has grown in tensions between CoinDesk and its new owner, Bullish, which purchased the publication last year for $75 million. These concerns about editorial independence follow Bullish’s assurances that CoinDesk would operate as an independent subsidiary. However, Matt Murray, chair of CoinDesk’s editorial committee, resigned on December 16, and the Fortune report claims this has caused staff unease. CoinDesk Vs. Justin Sun: What’s Bullish’s Stance? Bullish, a crypto exchange led by former NYSE president Tom Farley, has ambitious plans, including a potential IPO next year. Despite these plans, the controversy over the Justin Sun article has exposed potential conflicts between CoinDesk’s journalistic integrity and its business interests. Sources suggest Sun’s team’s objections to the article extended beyond its tone. The article also discusses media coverage of Tron and its alleged connections to illicit finance. Bullish’s acquisition of CoinDesk followed a challenging period for the publication’s previous owner, Digital Currency Group (DCG), which sold the outlet to strengthen its balance sheet. Although Bullish paid $75 million, far less than the $200 million valuations initially anticipated, the purchase was seen as a strategic move to bolster the exchange’s media presence. Since the acquisition, Bullish has emphasized its commitment to maintaining CoinDesk’s editorial independence. However, incidents like removing the Justin Sun article have cast doubt on these promises. The resignation of Matt Murray, chair of the editorial committee, further complicates the situation. Justin Sun: A Polarizing Figure Sun’s decision to eat the banana —a performance art piece designed to provoke dialogue about the intersection of art and commerce—was met with mixed reactions. While Sun’s PR team framed the act as an homage to contemporary art, CoinDesk’s critics dismissed it as a publicity stunt. Sun, known for his extravagant gestures such as paying $4.57 million to dine with Warren Buffett , has a history of courting attention. However, the CoinDesk article also discussed his legal challenges and the SEC’s fraud allegations. The original text, which has been removed but is still available on Yahoo News through a syndication agreement, evoked a mix of skepticism and curiosity. It noted Sun’s penchant for theatricality while also delving into the broader implications of his actions within the art and crypto communities. However, removing the piece has raised concerns about how sponsors can influence coverage, particularly when significant financial interests are at stake. Tron is notably a major sponsor of CoinDesk’s Consensus conference series. Per Fortune, CoinDesk’s journalists reportedly raised concerns over editorial independence during a recent newsroom meeting with Bullish CEO Tom Farley and CoinDesk CEO Sara Stratoberdha. They called for the article to be reinstated with an editor’s note and sought reassurances about the integrity of future editorial decisions. As of now, neither party has commented on any of Furtune’s claims.

37837975,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630299,1734607243,On-chain leverage through lending protocols back to levels from 2021 peak,"On-chain active loans have returned to levels not seen since the peak euphoria of 2021. The proxy metric for DeFi activity shows borrowers had confidence in the bull market up to this point, seeking gains through collateral-based loans. DeFi lending has become one of the leading apps in 2024. While the overall DeFi value locked is still lower than in 2021, on-chain loans are just as active as during the previous bull cycle. The on-chain leverage metric reveals a more mature market, where the leading protocols have spread to multiple chains. Additionally, the current on-chain leverage is only similar to 2021 in nominal terms. The metric was reached at a time when Bitcoin (BTC) is at a crossroads that has once again raised questions about its cycle peak. In 2021, peak lending coincided with price euphoria, but ended up spreading contagion to multiple protocols. Since then, the growth of DeFi lending has been more conservative, taking into account the value of the collaterals. Additionally, some protocols switched to T-Bills as collateral, removing a layer of risk tied to crypto prices. Lending gets a boost from a larger pool of stablecoins As a percentage of the available money supply in the crypto market, this cycle is still using a smaller percentage of the available stablecoins. This has led to expectations for even wider lending, which could in turn boost DEX swaps and other activities. With a higher stablecoin supply, DeFi lending is also limiting its contagion in case of a market drawdown. Leverage is building, but as % of the money supply, #DeFi active loans have only crossed 50% of the level reached last cycle. pic.twitter.com/2kysPxjyQg — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) December 17, 2024 During the 2024 cycle, DeFi and centralized trading have exposure to nearly 200B in various stablecoins. The DeFi space also has new algorithmic or asset-backed coins and tokens that can create niche sources of liquidity, as in the case of USDe, USDS, the remaining supply of DAI and other minor stablecoins. On-chain loans have exceeded $22.85B, as lending protocols from 2021 were replaced by new hubs. The market for DeFi lending has recovered from the crash following the Terra (LUNA) unraveling, as well as the subsequent crash of FTX. On-chain leverage works as far as the underlying collateral is stable and in excess of the loan. The loans are then often used in other DeFi protocols. Loans are usually in the form of stablecoins, which can then be used to purchase assets or to park in high-yield vaults. Reporting on DeFi lending hinges on the method used to track value. The current level of active loans, as measured by Token Terminal, is lower compared to other leverage metrics. Based on DeFi Llama data, lending protocols lock in more than $50B in value, the highest level since before the crash of LUNA and UST. Aave leads the lending movement While other protocols grew with some level of caution, Aave (AAVE) was the leading app in terms of active loans and value locked. Aave is the leading protocol for on-chain loans with crypto collaterals. | Source: Token Terminal Aave was available during bear market years, building up its infrastructure and user base. The lending protocol is now growing aggressively, offering its lending pool model to other DeFi hubs. The value in Aave is now above $22B , including the reported loans and collaterals. The project also issues its own stablecoin, GHO, although the growth is limited and relatively conservative. Aave still relies mostly on WETH and WBTC, while also including smaller tokens in its lending vaults. Even other lending protocols have moved their activity to Aave, in a bid to consolidate liquidity and offer users a simpler approach. The native AAVE token recently failed its climb to $400, instead sinking to $343.61. AAVE observers expect it to rise to four-digit valuations as it is seen as being early in the lending cycle. Recently, AAVE also got a boost from whale buying. On-chain lending is sometimes rolled back into DeFi tokens, as in the case of a recently reported whale activity. The whale took GHO as an on-chain loan and used the proceeds to buy more AAVE. Those practices can boost a token’s price. However, that can also expose the loans to liquidation.

This recommendation, issued on December 18, reflects the group’s hope for a “reset” in the SEC’s relationship with the cryptocurrency sector , which has often been marked by tension and regulatory uncertainty. Paul Atkins, Trump’s nominee for SEC chair and a former commissioner, is a member of the alliance’s advisory board, signaling potential alignment in priorities. The advocacy group also noted the need to rebuild trust between the SEC and the digital asset industry. Token Alliance’s Recommendations to the SEC The Token Alliance’s proposals include reviewing existing investigations, issuing stays on non-fraud litigation, and abandoning enforcement-heavy policies. They also urge the SEC to rescind the 2019 framework for applying the Howey test to digital assets, which the group claims has fostered confusion and inconsistency. Additionally, the group recommends rejecting the controversial Hinman speech as a reference for determining token classifications. Critics argue the speech, delivered by former SEC Director William Hinman, has led to unequal treatment of market participants. Another contentious point is the SAB 121, which mandates SEC-reporting entities to list cryptocurrency holdings as liabilities. The Digital Chamber described the rule as excessively burdensome, and lawmakers have voiced concerns that it could drive U.S. investors toward unregulated custodial solutions abroad. A New Chapter for Crypto Regulation? The upcoming leadership transition, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepping down on January 20, has raised hopes for a regulatory shift. Under Gensler’s tenure, the SEC pursued high-profile lawsuits against Coinbase , Binance, and Ripple, among others, while issuing Wells notices to companies like Uniswap and Immutable. Paul Atkins, expected to replace Gensler, is seen as a more industry-friendly figure . His tenure as commissioner from 2002 to 2008 suggests a pragmatic approach, fueling optimism for a balanced regulatory framework. The advocacy group also urged the SEC to reconsider Rule 3b-16, which proposes extending the definition of exchanges to include decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Industry stakeholders anticipate whether these recommendations will lead to a more cooperative regulatory environment.

37837767,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111730,1734607052,Hong Kong SFC Grants Conditional Licenses to Four Crypto Exchanges,"The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has taken another significant step toward regulating the cryptocurrency sector. On December 18, 2024, the SFC announced that it had issued conditional licenses to four virtual asset trading platforms. The licensed exchanges—Accumulus GBA Technology (Hongkong) Co., Limited, DFX Labs Company Limited, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX Limited, and Thousand Whales Technology (BVI) Limited—are required to fulfill strict regulatory obligations before commencing full operations. This move aligns with Hong Kong’s ambition to position itself as a global hub for crypto innovation while maintaining robust investor protections. Here’s a closer look at the details of the licensing process and its implications for the crypto industry. Who Are the Licensed Exchanges? The four platforms granted conditional licenses represent a diverse range of players in the crypto space: Accumulus GBA Technology (Hongkong) Co., Limited: Focused on blockchain infrastructure and financial technology solutions. DFX Labs Company Limited: Known for its DeFi trading and liquidity solutions. Hong Kong Digital Asset EX Limited: Specializes in institutional-grade trading services for digital assets. Thousand Whales Technology (BVI) Limited: Offers comprehensive asset management services for high-net-worth clients and institutional investors. These companies were selected following comprehensive risk-based inspections conducted by the SFC, ensuring adherence to the regulatory framework established in 2023. What Are the Licensing Conditions? The conditional licenses come with stringent requirements designed to enhance operational transparency and security. The exchanges must: Address Regulatory Feedback: Implement changes based on the SFC’s recommendations to mitigate potential risks. Perform Third-Party Vulnerability Assessments: Engage independent cybersecurity firms to identify and address vulnerabilities in their platforms. Pass Penetration Tests: Ensure systems are resistant to cyberattacks by simulating real-world hacking attempts. Failure to meet these conditions could result in license revocation or suspension, signaling the SFC’s firm stance on compliance. Hong Kong’s Vision for Crypto Regulation The issuance of conditional licenses underscores Hong Kong’s evolving approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry. By implementing a risk-based, pragmatic framework, the SFC aims to balance innovation with investor protection. Key aspects of Hong Kong’s crypto regulations include: Mandatory Licensing: All crypto exchanges serving Hong Kong residents must obtain a license. AML and KYC Compliance: Exchanges must adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards. Custody Standards: Platforms must implement robust custodial solutions to protect user funds. This comprehensive regulatory structure has attracted crypto firms from around the world, solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction. Impact on the Global Crypto Ecosystem Hong Kong’s licensing move carries significant implications for the global cryptocurrency market: Increased Credibility: Licensed platforms can leverage their regulatory compliance to attract institutional investors. Enhanced Investor Confidence: Stringent licensing conditions ensure a safer trading environment for retail and professional traders. Global Benchmark: Other jurisdictions may look to Hong Kong’s framework as a model for regulating their own crypto industries. However, some industry players express concerns that strict regulations may stifle innovation, urging the SFC to strike a balance between oversight and flexibility. Cybersecurity: A Top Priority With cyberattacks on the rise, the SFC’s emphasis on cybersecurity is timely. By mandating third-party vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, the regulator ensures that licensed exchanges are well-equipped to safeguard user assets and data. In 2024 alone, the crypto industry witnessed over $2 billion in losses due to hacking incidents, highlighting the need for robust security measures. The SFC’s proactive approach sets a precedent for other regulators worldwide. FAQs What is the significance of conditional licenses? Conditional licenses allow exchanges to prepare for full operations while addressing regulatory requirements. This phased approach ensures compliance without abrupt disruptions. Why is Hong Kong regulating crypto exchanges? Hong Kong aims to foster innovation in the crypto industry while protecting investors from risks like fraud and cyberattacks through a robust regulatory framework. What happens if an exchange fails to meet licensing conditions? Exchanges that do not fulfill the SFC’s requirements risk losing their licenses, effectively barring them from operating in Hong Kong. How does Hong Kong’s regulatory approach compare to other countries? Hong Kong’s balanced approach prioritizes both innovation and investor protection, making it a global leader in crypto regulation. What are third-party vulnerability assessments? These assessments involve independent cybersecurity experts evaluating a platform’s systems to identify and fix vulnerabilities. Will other jurisdictions adopt similar licensing frameworks? Given Hong Kong’s reputation as a financial hub, its regulatory framework may influence global standards for crypto governance. Conclusion The Hong Kong SFC’s decision to grant conditional licenses to four crypto exchanges marks a pivotal moment for the industry. By prioritizing compliance, cybersecurity, and investor protection, Hong Kong continues to establish itself as a leader in the global crypto landscape. As these exchanges work to meet the SFC’s stringent requirements, they pave the way for a safer and more transparent trading ecosystem. Investors and industry stakeholders alike will be closely watching how these developments unfold.

What Was the SEC Lawsuit About? Crypto.com’s lawsuit, filed earlier in 2024, challenged the SEC’s authority to classify certain digital assets as securities.

Crypto.com dropped the case after CEO Kris Marszalek met with President-elect Trump, signaling a shift toward collaborative efforts to shape crypto-friendly regulations. What is Trump’s national Bitcoin reserve proposal?

What are the next steps for Crypto.com? Crypto.com aims to work closely with the incoming administration to establish clear and supportive crypto regulations. What does this mean for the SEC’s role in crypto regulation? While the SEC remains a key regulator, its approach may evolve under the influence of industry collaboration and new federal policies. Conclusion Crypto.com’s withdrawal of its SEC lawsuit marks a significant shift in the regulatory narrative for the cryptocurrency industry. The meeting between Kris Marszalek and President-elect Donald Trump signals a new era of collaboration, with the potential to shape a more transparent and supportive framework for digital assets.

Powell clarified that any potential reserve would require Congressional consideration, reinforcing the Fed’s neutral stance on digital assets. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Uncertainty President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to create a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which could include 200,000 seized BTC tokens worth approximately $21 billion, has sparked interest. However, Powell’s cautious tone and lack of support for the initiative dampened investor enthusiasm. The Fed chief emphasized that the central bank does not intend to advocate for Bitcoin stockpiling, leaving the decision to policymakers in Congress. Analysts attribute Bitcoin’s recent volatility to a combination of profit-taking, hawkish Fed signals, and uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal and crypto policies under the incoming administration. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year, fueled by optimism over pro-crypto policies and growing institutional adoption. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Technical Analysis Bitcoin remains under pressure, consolidating below the $104,252 50-day EMA. Immediate resistance levels are noted at $103,410, with further hurdles at $105,723 and $108,280. On the downside, immediate support lies at $101,147, with critical levels at $98,656 and $96,482. The RSI at 44 suggests bearish momentum but hints at potential stabilization. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin tested support near $101,147 amid hawkish Fed commentary. Powell dismissed speculation about a central bank-led Bitcoin reserve. Resistance at $103,410 limits upside potential, with RSI indicating continued caution. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 $BEST Wallet Raises $4.98M: Last Chance to Invest Best Wallet continues to revolutionize Web3, now supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A Historic Deal in the Municipal Bond Market The municipal bonds, issued by Quincy, Massachusetts, represent a significant milestone in financial innovation. Using JPMorgan’s blockchain platform, the entire lifecycle of the bonds—from issuance to settlement and custody—was conducted on blockchain. This streamlined process offers a glimpse into how technology can enhance efficiency and transparency in capital markets. Key aspects of the transaction include: Blockchain Integration: The use of blockchain eliminates intermediaries, reducing settlement times and costs. Institutional Participation: BlackRock’s involvement underscores the growing acceptance of blockchain-based financial instruments among major institutional players. Proof of Concept: This deal serves as a proof of concept for blockchain’s applicability in municipal finance, potentially encouraging other municipalities to explore similar innovations.

Transactions that typically take days can now be completed within minutes. Transparency: The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that all transaction details are securely recorded and accessible, enhancing trust among participants. Cost Reduction: By eliminating intermediaries, blockchain significantly lowers transaction costs, making financial products more accessible. For the municipal bond market, these benefits are particularly compelling. Municipal bonds are traditionally associated with lengthy and cumbersome processes, but blockchain could address these inefficiencies while boosting investor confidence. BlackRock’s Strategic Move BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has been at the forefront of integrating innovative technologies into its investment strategies. The purchase of blockchain-issued municipal bonds through its iShares MEAR ETF highlights the firm’s commitment to exploring cutting-edge financial instruments. iShares MEAR ETF: This ETF primarily focuses on short-term municipal bonds, making the inclusion of blockchain-issued debt a strategic fit. Market Leadership: By participating in this historic transaction, BlackRock positions itself as a leader in adopting blockchain technology in traditional asset classes. JPMorgan’s Blockchain Platform: The Backbone of the Deal JPMorgan’s blockchain platform played a central role in facilitating this transaction. The platform leverages distributed ledger technology to streamline financial operations, offering features such as: End-to-End Automation: From issuance to settlement, the entire process is conducted on a secure blockchain network. Enhanced Security: Cryptographic features ensure the safety and integrity of transaction data. Scalability: Designed to handle high volumes of transactions, JPMorgan’s platform is scalable for widespread adoption. This successful implementation could pave the way for other financial institutions and municipalities to adopt blockchain for similar use cases. Implications for the Municipal Bond Market The success of this blockchain-based municipal bond issuance has far-reaching implications: Modernization: The integration of blockchain technology modernizes the municipal bond market, making it more accessible and efficient. Investor Confidence: Enhanced transparency and security could attract a broader base of investors, including younger, tech-savvy individuals. Cost Savings: Municipalities could save on issuance and administrative costs, making bonds a more attractive financing option. However, the adoption of blockchain in this sector also faces challenges, such as regulatory uncertainty and the need for standardized protocols across platforms. FAQs What makes blockchain-issued municipal bonds unique? Blockchain-issued municipal bonds are processed entirely on a blockchain platform, streamlining issuance, settlement, and custody, while reducing costs and enhancing transparency. Why did BlackRock invest in blockchain-based municipal bonds? BlackRock’s iShares MEAR ETF focuses on innovative financial instruments, and this purchase aligns with the fund’s strategy to explore cutting-edge opportunities in municipal finance. How does JPMorgan’s blockchain platform work?

What are the benefits of blockchain for municipal finance? Blockchain offers faster settlement times, lower costs, enhanced transparency, and improved security, addressing key inefficiencies in the traditional municipal bond market. What challenges remain for blockchain adoption in municipal bonds? Challenges include regulatory uncertainty, technological standardization, and the need for widespread industry acceptance. Will more municipalities adopt blockchain for bond issuance?

Enhancing sustainability and accessibility AI’s role in promoting sustainable tourism practices is a focal point of the OECD’s recommendations. By leveraging real-time data, AI can help destinations manage visitor flows to avoid overcrowding, preserve cultural heritage sites, and minimize environmental impacts. OECD mentioned Barcelona Zoo’s AI chatbot, Zoobot, as an example of how technology can enhance accessibility for visitors with disabilities. Similarly, it highlighted Notre Dame Cathedral’s use of AI-driven digital twins for restoration efforts, demonstrating AI’s capability to aid in the preservation of historical landmarks. Additionally, per the report, AI can improve the socio-economic value of tourism by fostering green mobility options, reducing carbon footprints, and promoting local economies. OECD also encouraged international collaboration among G7 nations to align AI research and policy efforts, which could make it easier to address global challenges collectively. OECD: AI supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) In the paper, the OECD echoes the importance of supporting SMEs in tourism as they adapt to AI. These smaller enterprises often struggle to keep pace with rapid technological advancements, facing barriers such as high implementation costs, limited expertise, and regulatory complexities. According to the OECD, the divide in AI adoption risks exacerbating existing inequalities within the tourism sector, favoring large, tech-savvy enterprises over smaller players. The organization deems tailored support programs and training initiatives imperative to bridge this gap and ensure inclusive growth. However, for SMEs to leverage AI effectively, governments and industry bodies need to focus on accessible innovation hubs, practical training opportunities, and financial support mechanisms. Addressing risks and challenges Despite its benefits, the OECD cautions against the risks of AI adoption. Data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and workforce displacement require careful management. While AI has the potential to automate routine tasks and create more complex, rewarding jobs, there is also a risk of job displacement, particularly in roles reliant on manual labor or repetitive tasks. OECD shed light on the misuse of AI for manipulative marketing, such as deepfake tourism videos or fake reviews, which can erode trust and harm destination reputations. To address these concerns, the organization calls for international cooperation in developing ethical AI standards and ensuring compliance. “ Existing regulatory and legal frameworks can promote responsible AI use in tourism by providing clear guidelines for developers and operators, and facilitate the safe and ethical integration of AI technologies. It is also important to provide a safe environment for businesses to test and pilot innovation including AI applications, ” the paper outlined. The OECD report concludes that while AI adoption in tourism is still in its early stages, its potential to revolutionize the sector is immense.

Amid increased market volatility following the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cuts, Bitcoin quickly retested the $100k level. The increased supply and a surge in FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) signal a potential correction.While technical indicators suggest a potential bounce, a bearish shift in derivatives warns of a dip to $90k. Could continued institutional support be the game changer?Bitcoin Price AnalysisAfter a massive 5.68% correction last night, Bitcoin formed a large bearish engulfing candle, temporarily dropping below the $100,000 psychological level.Meanwhile, shorting after hitting a 24-hour low of $98,695, Bitcoin reclaimed the $101,000 level. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin's price action shows a bullish reversal, breaking above the local support trendline. Bitcoin price chart There’s a minor reversal with lower price rejection just above the 23.6% Fibonacci level at $98,769. Additionally, Bitcoin has avoided closing below the long-standing support trendline.The MACD and signal lines are in a steep bearish decline, and the RSI is nearing the oversold zone. These momentum indicators trigger a sell signal for BTC in the short term.Bitcoin ETFs Inflows Continue, Open Interest Surges to $67BDespite the correction, institutional support for Bitcoin remains strong. On December 18, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, saw an inflow of $359.6 million, while others experienced significant outflows. Overall, the daily net inflow for US spot Bitcoin ETFs was $275.3 million.Amid the correction, Bitcoin's open interest has risen to $67.75 billion, and trading volume has increased by 34%, reaching $146.38 billion. This surge in open interest reflects growing bearish sentiment, as the overall funding rate drops to 0.0101%.Bitcoin Price TargetsFrom a bearish perspective, technical indicators and derivatives are signaling a sell. A close below the support trendline could likely lead to a retest of the $90,000 support level.However, if the market stabilizes, the chances of a bullish rebound from the support trendline will improve significantly. Based on the Fibonacci levels, a potential uptrend could target the 50% Fibonacci level at $106,912.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/19/as-bitcoin-btc-price-drops-to-98k-will-it-crash-to-90k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=as-bitcoin-btc-price-drops-to-98k-will-it-crash-to-90k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shib-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

It has outperformed major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. However, renowned crypto analyst Velo Maxi advises investors to remain cautious and keep an eye on several critical developments before deciding to sell. Here’s a closer look at the key events shaping XRP’s future. Ripple’s Stablecoin Launch Creates Buzz On December 17, Ripple introduced RLUSD , its much-anticipated stablecoin. Maxi believes this launch could have a lasting positive impact on XRP’s price. The release has already generated significant excitement within the crypto community, particularly among XRP supporters. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Presidency: Good Times Incoming? Pro-Crypto candidate Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris, who represented a crypto-skeptical regime, in the US presidential election . He is set to take the oath as the President of the United States in late January, 2025. The expert notes that if Trump introduces pro-crypto policies, it would positively impact the price of XRP. SEC Leadership Changes to Impact XRP Soon after the victory of Donald Trump, Gary Gensler, known for his aggressive stance against the crypto industry, announced his resignation from the post of the SEC chairman . Trump has already named a pro-crypto executive, Paul Atkins, to succeed Gensler . The expert thinks that the leadership change would benefit the entire crypto industry. Ripple is fighting a tough legal battle against the SEC. Maxi points out that the next SEC leadership could help settle the issue. If this happens, it could push the price of XRP to new heights. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Is XRP Still a Good Investment After Its 500% Rally? , Altseason on the Horizon? The dominance of Bitcoin currently stands at 58.32%. Once the dominance drops below the level of 50%, it would mark the beginning of an Altseason. The expert asserts that XRP would see significant growth during the Altseason. Ripple’s Upcoming Partnerships Highlighting the fact that Ripple is currently working with financial institutions to promote XRP-based deals, Maxi opines that any major partnership announcement could boost the market value of XRP significantly. Potential XRP ETF Approval At least four filings seeking approval for the launch of XRP ETFs have been submitted so far. Indicating the possibility for these proposals to receive approval before 2025, Maxi emphasises that the launch of XRP ETFs would pave the way for the entrance of more institutional players into the XRP market. In conclusion, XRP’s journey is influenced by multiple key events. Velo Maxi advises XRP holders to remain patient and watch these developments closely before deciding their next move. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37837443,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111754,1734606264,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls to 75, Entering the ‘Greed’ Zone","The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular gauge of market sentiment, has fallen to 75 , signaling a shift from the “Extreme Greed” zone to the “Greed” zone. The index, provided by software development platform Alternative , measures emotions and attitudes in the cryptocurrency market on a scale from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed) . As of December 19, 2024, the index is down six points from the previous day, reflecting weakened sentiment amidst market fluctuations. The decline comes at a time when the crypto market is facing mixed signals, with factors like volatility and social media sentiment contributing to this shift. What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a composite metric designed to capture the emotional landscape of the cryptocurrency market. It provides insight into whether investors are overly fearful or greedy, helping them make more informed trading decisions. How It Works: The index is calculated using six key factors, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%) : Examines current volatility and maximum drawdowns in Bitcoin and compares them with recent averages. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Tracks trading volume and market momentum in comparison to historical trends. Social Media (15%) : Analyzes mentions, hashtags, and engagement across platforms like Twitter. Surveys (15%) : Incorporates investor surveys, though this component is less frequently updated. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Measures Bitcoin’s share of the overall cryptocurrency market cap. Google Trends (10%) : Tracks search trends and query volumes for cryptocurrency-related terms. What Does a Score of 75 Indicate? With the index now standing at 75 , it indicates a market leaning toward “Greed.” Greed Zone (50–74): Reflects moderate optimism among investors, with a tendency for higher risk-taking behavior. Extreme Greed Zone (75–100): Signals potential overvaluation and an overheated market, often a precursor to corrections. This shift from “Extreme Greed” to “Greed” suggests that while optimism remains high, market participants are becoming more cautious. What Caused the Shift? 1. Volatility and Market Trends Increased Volatility: Recent fluctuations in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have tempered market exuberance. Lower Momentum: A slowdown in trading volume has contributed to reduced bullish sentiment. 2. Social Media and Sentiment Analysis Decreased Engagement: Social media activity surrounding major cryptocurrencies has dipped, reflecting tempered enthusiasm. 3. External Factors Regulatory Developments: Ongoing discussions about U.S. crypto regulation and global monetary policies may have influenced investor sentiment. Why Is the Fear & Greed Index Important? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable tool for understanding market psychology: Greed Indicates Overconfidence: High scores often coincide with market tops, where excessive optimism leads to potential corrections. Fear Suggests Undervaluation: Low scores signal widespread caution or panic, which can present buying opportunities for contrarian investors. By tracking changes in the index, traders can gauge whether the market is leaning toward irrational exuberance or excessive fear. Recent Market Behavior The current reading of 75 aligns with broader trends observed in the cryptocurrency market: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong but has slightly declined as investors explore altcoins. ETH and Altcoins: Ethereum and other altcoins have seen mixed performance, contributing to a less unified market sentiment. Institutional Activity: Despite strong interest, institutional buying has slowed, adding to the cautious tone. FAQs What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? It is a composite metric that measures emotions and sentiments in the cryptocurrency market on a scale from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). What does a score of 75 mean? A score of 75 places the market in the “Greed” zone, indicating optimism among investors but with growing caution. Why did the index drop from 81 to 75? The decline reflects reduced trading momentum, increased volatility, and subdued social media engagement. How is the Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index uses six factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends (10%). Why is the Fear & Greed Index important? It provides insights into market psychology, helping traders identify potential buying or selling opportunities based on sentiment extremes. What does the “Extreme Greed” zone signify? The “Extreme Greed” zone indicates potential overvaluation and market exuberance, often a precursor to corrections.

Matt Hougan stated that Ethereum will surpass Solana by 2025 thanks to Layer-2 growth, artificial intelligence projects, and improved scalability. Bitwise CIO noted that Ethereum’s reputation for being slow and expensive is beginning to fade, saying that ETH is making progress in scalability and user experience, and is competing with Solana, which has traditionally been known for its ease of use. Hougan stated that Layer-2 networks in the Ethereum ecosystem increase the platform's attractiveness for both developers and users, and that they solve Ethereum's scalability problems and become competitive with Solana. Hougan also highlighted projects such as Clanker and Virtuals, which are AI-focused applications developing on the Ethereum Base network, stating that these applications demonstrate Ethereum’s ability to support innovative, user-friendly solutions while maintaining its robust infrastructure. According to Hougan, this change to Ethereum is crucial as it aims to combine institutional-grade reliability for ETH with improved accessibility for everyday users. “If Ethereum can maintain its institutional reputation and improve its ease of use, 2025 will be a really good year for ETH.” *This is not investment advice.

The reforms include making Bitcoin acceptance voluntary for merchants, reducing government involvement in the Chivo wallet , and limiting public sector participation in Bitcoin-related transactions. The IMF, which has been critical of El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin, welcomed these policy adjustments, stating they would significantly reduce the risks associated with the country’s Bitcoin initiatives. Reforming El Salvador’s Bitcoin Policies In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership. While the move aimed to boost financial inclusion and attract investment, it has drawn criticism from institutions like the IMF due to concerns over volatility and speculative risks . Key Changes Under the IMF Loan Deal: Voluntary Bitcoin Acceptance: Merchants will no longer be required to accept Bitcoin, marking a significant shift from the original mandate. Chivo Wallet Rollback: The government plans to scale back its involvement in the state-run Chivo wallet, which was designed to facilitate Bitcoin transactions. Reduced Public Sector Role: Public entities will be restricted from engaging in Bitcoin transactions or holding Bitcoin in their reserves. These measures align with the IMF’s recommendations to minimize cryptocurrency-related risks while maintaining some aspects of Bitcoin’s integration. IMF’s Stance on El Salvador’s Bitcoin Adoption The IMF has consistently expressed concerns about El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy, citing: Economic Risks: Bitcoin’s price volatility could destabilize the country’s financial system. Fiscal Strain: Public investments in Bitcoin could divert resources from critical social and economic programs. Speculative Nature: The IMF has warned against using cryptocurrency as a core financial instrument due to its speculative nature. With the new reforms, the IMF expects El Salvador to mitigate these risks while still exploring the potential benefits of blockchain technology. Impacts on the Chivo Wallet The Chivo wallet , launched alongside El Salvador’s Bitcoin law, was designed to facilitate digital payments and remittances. However, its rollout faced challenges, including: Technical Issues: Users reported glitches and security vulnerabilities. Low Adoption Rates: Despite government incentives, the wallet has seen limited use among the population. Under the new agreement, the government will reduce its involvement in Chivo, allowing the private sector to play a larger role in managing digital payment solutions. Economic Implications of the Reforms For the Private Sector: Flexibility: Businesses will have the option to accept Bitcoin based on their preferences, potentially easing operational pressures. Regulatory Clarity: Legal reforms will provide clear guidelines, fostering a more stable business environment. For the Public Sector: Risk Reduction: Limiting public sector engagement in Bitcoin transactions will shield government finances from cryptocurrency volatility. Focus on Core Priorities: The reforms may enable the government to reallocate resources toward critical infrastructure and social programs. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey: A Mixed Legacy El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption has had its share of highs and lows: Achievements: Increased global visibility and investment interest. Promoted financial inclusion through digital wallets. Challenges: Criticism over mandatory Bitcoin acceptance. Concerns about the fiscal impact of Bitcoin purchases. The IMF-backed reforms signal a more measured approach, balancing the potential benefits of cryptocurrency with the need for economic stability. FAQs What changes are being made to El Salvador’s Bitcoin mandate? The government will make Bitcoin acceptance voluntary for merchants, reduce its role in the Chivo wallet, and limit public sector Bitcoin transactions. Why is El Salvador changing its Bitcoin policies? The reforms are part of a $1.4 billion loan deal with the IMF, aimed at reducing economic risks associated with Bitcoin adoption. What is the IMF’s position on Bitcoin in El Salvador? The IMF has urged El Salvador to scale back its Bitcoin project, citing concerns about volatility, fiscal strain, and speculative risks. What happens to the Chivo wallet under the new policy? The government will reduce its involvement in the Chivo wallet, potentially handing over management to private sector players. How will these changes affect businesses in El Salvador? Businesses will no longer be required to accept Bitcoin, giving them greater flexibility in their payment options. What are the broader implications of these reforms? The reforms aim to balance innovation with economic stability, addressing concerns while retaining some aspects of Bitcoin’s integration. Conclusion El Salvador’s decision to ease its Bitcoin usage mandate reflects a pragmatic response to domestic and international concerns. By aligning with the IMF’s recommendations, the country aims to reduce the risks associated with its Bitcoin policies while maintaining its position as a pioneer in cryptocurrency adoption. The reforms mark a turning point in El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment, signaling a shift toward a more sustainable and balanced approach.

With ETH showing strong recovery signals, many are expanding their investments into IntelMarkets (INTL), a new DeFi project. Entering Stage 8 of its presale and having raised over $4.9 million, IntelMarkets is becoming a key contender to outperform top altcoins like Cardano (ADA) in the next bull run. Let’s see why! Ethereum Bulls on the Move: ETH Wallets Grow as IntelMarkets Raises $4.9 Million Ethereum whales have been busy with one massive move involving the withdrawal of 5,160 ETH, worth a staggering $20 million, from Binance. This accumulation highlights growing confidence in Ethereum’s future. Furthermore, the number of ETH addresses holding over $10,000 has increased. This suggests that investors are positioning themselves for the bull run ahead. ETH’s price surge, particularly surpassing the $4,000 mark, has led many to predict continued growth. As Ethereum holders bet big on the crypto market, one project stands out—IntelMarkets. This DeFi project has raised over $4.9 million in its ongoing presale, attracting attention. Many investors see IntelMarkets as a promising opportunity to ride the bull run. Unlocking Maximum Profits: IntelMarkets – A Game-Changer for Crypto Investors and Traders IntelMarkets is rapidly gaining attention as Ethereum holders look to capitalize on its revolutionary platform. The crypto market is excited about IntelMarkets’ innovative features. Its dual-chain functionality, allowing traders to choose between Ethereum and Solana blockchains, is a key factor driving the hype. IntelMarkets delivers the flexibility needed for maximum scalability and speed, improving traders’ experiences as the bull run approaches.

The platform’s innovation and structure have investors predicting that it will surpass prominent altcoins like Cardano’s ADA. Cardano’s New Wallet Upgrade: Will ADA Thrive in the 2025 Bull Run? ADA recently soared after the launch of Daedalus v7.0.0, a new version of Cardano’s full-node wallet. This update includes key improvements to the ADA delegation system. The change helps users delegate their voting rights to DReps within Cardano’s governance. Its aim is to make governance more inclusive and efficient. A stronger governance system could attract more users and boost investor confidence. Increased governance participation could lead to a rise in ADA’s demand and price. For the past few weeks, ADA’s price has hovered around $1.09. With this new development, projections suggest it might climb to $1.50 by January 2025. These developments are helping Cardano prepare for the upcoming bull run. However, competition is intensifying as investors place their bets on INTL’s potential to outperform ADA during the 2025 bull run. Bet Big on INTL: The DeFi Token to Watch in the 2025 Bull Run The 2025 bull run is poised to deliver excitement, and although Ethereum’s performance is thrilling, IntelMarkets is now in the spotlight. Now in Stage 8 of its public presale, INTL is currently priced at $0.073. With the public presale nearing completion, IntelMarkets is set to launch at $0.110, creating excitement among investors.

37837249,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111727,1734605905,MicroStrategy Rumored to Pause Bitcoin Bond Issuance During January Blackout,"MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), renowned for its substantial Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, is rumored to be planning a suspension of stock and convertible bond issuance in January 2025. This anticipated pause, attributed to a blackout period, could temporarily halt the company’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The speculation, initially reported by crypto media outlet Protos and highlighted by Wu Blockchain on X (formerly Twitter), has yet to elicit an official response from MicroStrategy. Understanding Blackout Periods and Their Implications In corporate finance, a blackout period refers to a timeframe during which a company restricts specific activities involving its securities. These self-imposed restrictions are often implemented to prevent insider trading and maintain market integrity, particularly around sensitive times such as earnings reports or significant corporate actions. For MicroStrategy, entering a blackout period in January 2025 would mean suspending the issuance of new shares or convertible bonds. Given that the company has been financing its Bitcoin purchases through such issuances, a temporary halt could impact its ability to acquire additional BTC during this period. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Since its initial investment in August 2020, MicroStrategy has consistently expanded its Bitcoin holdings, positioning itself as a leading corporate BTC holder. As of December 16, 2024, the company owns approximately 439,000 BTC, acquired at an aggregate purchase price of $27.1 billion, averaging $61,725 per Bitcoin. This aggressive acquisition strategy has been primarily funded through the issuance of stocks and convertible bonds. For instance, in December 2024, MicroStrategy purchased 15,350 BTC for $1.5 billion, financed by selling company shares. Potential Impact of the January Blackout The rumored January blackout could have several implications: Temporary Halt in Bitcoin Purchases: With the suspension of stock and bond issuance, MicroStrategy may lack immediate funds to continue its Bitcoin buying spree, leading to a temporary pause in acquisitions. Market Speculation: The company’s aggressive Bitcoin purchases have been a significant factor in market dynamics. A pause could influence investor sentiment and BTC price movements. Strategic Reassessment: The blackout period might provide MicroStrategy with an opportunity to reassess its acquisition strategy and explore alternative financing methods for future purchases. Market Reactions and Speculations The crypto community has been abuzz with discussions regarding the potential pause. Some analysts suggest that the blackout could be linked to insider trading regulations or the company’s recent inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, effective December 23, 2024. Others believe that the pause might be a routine measure associated with quarterly earnings reports, during which companies often enter blackout periods to prevent insider trading. MicroStrategy’s next earnings report is anticipated between February 3 and 5, 2025, which could mean the blackout spans the entire month of January or begins mid-month. MicroStrategy’s Recent Performance Despite the rumors, MicroStrategy’s recent financial maneuvers have been noteworthy: Bitcoin Purchases: In December 2024 alone, the company acquired over $3 billion worth of BTC at prices exceeding $100,000 per coin, underscoring its bullish stance on the cryptocurrency. BeInCrypto Stock Performance: MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has experienced a remarkable surge, rising over 460% year-to-date, reflecting investor confidence in its Bitcoin-centric strategy.

37840693,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/improving-data-quality-via-collective-error-detection-and-creative-problem-solving,1734605876,Improving Data Quality via Collective Error Detection and Creative Problem-Solving,"Inaccurate, duplicate, and incomplete data continues to plague industries. Artificial intelligence is leveraged to mitigate these issues, but it has inherent limitations. AI datasets can contain mislabeled or irrelevant data. Fraction AI is pioneering a new approach to data labeling by combining the efficiency of AI agents with human insights. The company recently completed a $6 million pre-seed funding round co-led by Symbolic and Spartan alongside strategic investments from Illia Polosukhin (Near), Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon), and other outstanding angel investors. Fraction AI tackles the increasing challenge of producing high-quality data. Traditional methods depend solely on AI or humans. Fraction AI aims to use human understanding as guidance for AI agents. Funds from the round will go toward in-depth exploration and infrastructure upgrades to scale the cutting-edge hybrid approach, whose effectiveness is confirmed by research . Introducing Gamified Adversarial Prompting Data scientists have demonstrated that the datasets created using GAP, or gamified adversarial prompting, enhance the performance of the latest AI models. The GAP framework involves crowdsourcing high-quality data to fine-tune large multimodal models, turning data collection into an engaging game. It encourages players to provide complex, fine-grained questions and answers that fill gaps in the models’ knowledge. In lay terms, Fraction AI incentivizes AI agents to create high-quality data through real-time competitions. Developers set up and launch agents using detailed instructions to guide their actions and achieve the best possible outcomes, while ether is staked as the economic foundation. Participants get economic incentives in what facilitates a continuous stream of valuable training data. Current issues with data quality Inaccurate data costs organizations tens of millions of dollars a year. Banal examples include misspelled customer names, customer addresses with errors, and incorrect data entries in general. Whatever the cause, inaccurate data cannot be used because it causes deviations throughout any data analysis. When one imports data from multiple sources, it is not uncommon to end up with duplicate sets. Using retail as an example again, you might import customer lists from two sources and find a few people who bought things from both retailers. Duplicate records become a problem because you only want to count each customer once. When data is combined from two different systems, inconsistent formatting can arise. Cross-system inconsistencies can cause major data quality issues unless they are identified and rectified swiftly. Incomplete data and dark data are two additional problems. Some records are missing key information, such as phone numbers without area codes or demographic details without the age entered. Dark or hidden data is data that’s collected and stored but not actively used. IBM estimates that 90% of all sensor data collected from IoT devices remains unused . Many organizations aren’t even aware of this wasted resource, which accounts for more than 50% of the average organization’s data storage expenses. Human understanding facilitates improvement As an educational tool, GAP motivates humans to challenge the limitations of AI models, leading to notable improvements in performance. It encourages error detection by tasking players to identify inaccuracies or inconsistencies in datasets or AI outputs. Their diverse backgrounds can bring varied perspectives, making it easier to spot biases that a single development team might overlook. Gamification encourages innovative thinking through challenges or puzzles designed to stretch the limits of a dataset or model. Players can uncover novel use cases, detect biased outputs or inputs, and propose more inclusive alternatives. This reduces systemic biases in data and models, creating a more equitable foundation for all kinds of applications. Additionally, participants will flag previously unnoticed data anomalies because they’ll be rewarded for uncovering flaws. Rewards for identifying significant flaws could conceivably be higher, reducing the risk of unexpected failures or vulnerabilities in real-world applications. As the technology scales, more and more people can play games simultaneously, enabling exponential improvements as the sheer volume of input accelerates the identification of weaknesses. The dark side of creativity Creative problem-solving doesn’t have to be for the public good. The rewards would be the primary motivation for some users, leading to an excessive focus on them. Taking this a step further, it’s not unreasonable to expect malicious actors to try and game the system, and platforms will need to deploy mechanisms to detect and block harmful activities. An example is using AI and statistical models to monitor user behavior patterns, flagging anomalies that indicate spamming or unusual submission patterns. Unusually high submission rates or repetitive patterns from a single user could be flagged for review. The GAP framework could assign reputation scores to participants based on their contribution history. Ideally, new users would have limited influence until they establish credibility to reduce the risk of initial exploitation. Finally, there will be users flagging issues randomly. Platforms leveraging GAP will need to involve human experts or AI to deter participants from flagging accurate and valuable data. Taking data quality mainstream Risks aside, humans will be encouraged to spot mislabeled or irrelevant data in AI datasets, improving the quality of machine learning and AI models. Beyond AI, gamified contributions can enhance the accuracy and completeness of free, publicly accessible datasets like Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap. Flagging misinformation in real time will lead to more reliable repositories. GAP will also impact harmful, biased, or inappropriate content. Platforms like Reddit or YouTube could adopt it to identify and remove such content faster. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37837196,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111725,1734605846,Ethereum Could Hit $5K as Bitcoin Profits Rotate: Justin Bennett,"Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could be on the brink of a significant surge, according to crypto strategist Justin Bennett. If Ethereum clears the crucial resistance zone of $4,000 to $4,100, Bennett predicts it could skyrocket to $4,800 or even $5,000. This projection aligns with the anticipated rotation of Bitcoin (BTC) profits into ETH, potentially fueling a bullish rally. Bennett’s analysis, shared via The Daily Hodl , paints a promising picture for both Ethereum and Bitcoin as the crypto market navigates heightened investor interest and speculation. Here’s a closer look at what this could mean for crypto enthusiasts and investors. Ethereum’s Path to $5K: The $4,000 Resistance Barrier Ethereum’s ability to surpass the $4,000-$4,100 resistance zone is a pivotal factor in its journey toward the $5,000 mark. Historically, this level has served as a significant psychological and technical barrier. Breaking past it could unlock massive upward potential for ETH, bolstered by increased market confidence and trading volumes. The underlying factors contributing to Ethereum’s bullish outlook include: Ethereum 2.0 Upgrades: The transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism is drawing positive sentiment, reducing ETH supply while boosting staking incentives. Increased Institutional Interest: As institutions diversify their crypto portfolios, Ethereum remains a top choice due to its diverse use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Bitcoin Profit Rotation: Bennett’s prediction hinges on the assumption that profits from Bitcoin’s impressive rally will flow into Ethereum, enhancing its upward trajectory. Bitcoin’s Christmas Rally: What It Means for Ethereum Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, is also poised for a stellar performance. Bennett forecasts BTC could reach $116,000 to $125,000 during a “Christmas rally.” This anticipated surge is rooted in growing adoption, speculation, and an evolving narrative surrounding Bitcoin as a potential U.S. reserve asset under a possible second Trump administration. As Bitcoin climbs to new heights, profit-taking by investors is inevitable. According to Bennett, these profits are likely to rotate into Ethereum, a trend often observed during bullish market cycles. This phenomenon could act as a catalyst for ETH, further strengthening its case for a $5,000 valuation. Macro Factors Boosting Ethereum’s Potential Ethereum’s bullish outlook is not only tied to Bitcoin’s success but also influenced by macroeconomic and industry-specific factors: Increased Network Activity: With more users and developers leveraging Ethereum’s ecosystem for DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts, demand for ETH continues to rise. Supply Dynamics: Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade has introduced a deflationary mechanism by burning a portion of transaction fees, reducing overall supply. Global Adoption: From retail investors to enterprises, Ethereum is becoming a staple in diverse crypto portfolios, driving long-term growth prospects. The Trump Effect: Speculation Drives Crypto Momentum Bennett’s mention of Bitcoin potentially becoming a U.S. reserve asset under Trump has added an intriguing layer of speculation to the crypto narrative. While such a development remains speculative, its mere possibility has fueled market excitement. The implications for Ethereum are equally significant, as broader crypto adoption could elevate ETH’s standing as a core digital asset. What’s Next for Ethereum Investors? For investors eyeing Ethereum’s potential, the current market dynamics present an enticing opportunity: Watch the Resistance Levels: A breakout above $4,000-$4,100 could signal the start of a strong upward trend. Monitor Bitcoin’s Performance: BTC’s rally and profit-taking could directly influence ETH’s price action. Diversify and Stake: Staking Ethereum in preparation for Ethereum 2.0 offers both yield and a way to support the network’s evolution. FAQs Why is Ethereum’s $4,000 resistance significant? The $4,000-$4,100 range serves as a major technical and psychological barrier. A breakout above this level could signal strong bullish momentum for ETH. What factors are driving Ethereum’s potential rise to $5,000? Key factors include Bitcoin profit rotation, Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, institutional interest, and reduced supply due to EIP-1559. How does Bitcoin’s Christmas rally impact Ethereum? Bitcoin’s anticipated rally could lead to profit-taking, with a portion of those profits flowing into Ethereum, boosting its price. What is Justin Bennett’s prediction for Bitcoin? Bennett forecasts Bitcoin could reach $116,000 to $125,000 amid growing adoption and speculation, especially regarding its potential as a U.S. reserve asset. Is Ethereum a good investment in 2024? While market conditions are volatile, Ethereum’s strong fundamentals, diverse use cases, and network upgrades make it a promising long-term investment. What is the Trump connection to Bitcoin and Ethereum? Speculation about Bitcoin becoming a U.S. reserve asset under Trump has added momentum to the crypto market, indirectly benefiting Ethereum due to increased adoption. Conclusion Justin Bennett’s predictions for Ethereum and Bitcoin highlight the dynamic nature of the crypto market. With Ethereum poised to break resistance and potentially reach $5,000, and Bitcoin eyeing a Christmas rally to $125,000, investors have much to anticipate. Whether driven by macroeconomic trends, institutional interest, or speculative narratives, Ethereum and Bitcoin remain at the forefront of innovation and growth.

While Egorov has denied the claims, blockchain data hints at a more complex narrative. Meanwhile, CRV has seen a sharp 13% dip, leaving investors in fear of a potential drop ahead. Egorov Rejects Liquidation Claim Reports from blockchain analytics firm PeckShield indicate that Egorov’s account faced a significant liquidation event on December 19, involving 918,830 CRV tokens valued at around $882,660. #PeckShieldAlert #Liquidation Michael Egorov-labeled address (0x7a16…5428) has been liquidated for 918.83K $CRV (totaling $882.66K). pic.twitter.com/ZXehpFZT81 — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) December 19, 2024 This development came shortly after Egorov’s recent buyback of 1.08 million tokens for $1.2 million at an average price of $1.114 per token. However, Egorov has dismissed these claims, suggesting that the tokens in question were connected to the June 10 “uwu” hack. He referred to them as “receipts of Sifu’s promise to repay the hacked funds” rather than legitimate holdings. This statement has left room for speculation , as the timing of the supposed liquidation coincided with a sharp 12% decline in CRV’s price. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : World Liberty Finance’s $10M Bitcoin Swap: Strategic or Politically Motivated? , Signs of Hope Amidst Volatility On the positive side, Curve DAO has made some progress, the token has shown signs of recovery, trading above $1 for the first time since April last year. The launch of Curve Finance’s decentralized stablecoin, Savings-crvUSD (scrvUSD), has played a significant role in this. The stablecoin has boosted the ecosystem’s scalability and attracted more investors, with staking volumes surging to $839.29 million by late November. Curve Price Update Following the liquidation reports, CRV’s price dipped to as low as $0.90, before slightly recovering to $0.945, a 13% drop overall. This decline shows that the market is reacting nervously to the news, even with Egorov’s clarifications. Looking ahead, if CRV’s price fails to stay above $0.90, it could face a deeper drop, possibly reaching the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level around $0.83. On the other hand, if the price rebounds and climbs back above $1, it could indicate a positive turn, with the potential for the token to move toward the $1.25 resistance level. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37837194,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111769,1734605767,FNAF 4: The Darkest Chapter of Five Nights at Freddy’s,"The Five Nights at Freddy’s (FNAF) series has become a cornerstone of survival horror gaming, and FNAF 4 takes the terror to a whole new level. Released in 2015, this installment shifts away from the familiar pizza parlors to a chilling new setting: a child’s bedroom. With its eerie ambiance, nightmarish animatronics, and challenging gameplay mechanics, FNAF 4 remains a fan favorite. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the game’s story, mechanics, characters, and tips to help you survive the night. What is FNAF 4 About? FNAF 4 is the fourth installment in Scott Cawthon’s beloved horror series. It serves as both a sequel and a prequel, exploring the psychological and physical horrors of a young child plagued by nightmarish visions. Unlike previous games set in Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, FNAF 4 takes place in a dimly lit bedroom. This shift intensifies the fear factor, as players must fend off twisted versions of animatronics while grappling with an oppressive sense of isolation. Gameplay Overview: How FNAF 4 Works Objective The goal in FNAF 4 is simple yet terrifying: survive from 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM while defending yourself against Nightmare Animatronics .

37837102,https://crypto.news/?p=14320658,1734605586,Here’s how the crypto market reacted to the Fed’s 0.25% cut,"After the Fed cut the interest rate by 0.25%, the crypto market’s liquidation of more than $239 million in mere minutes. Bitcoin dipped briefly below $100k with other major tokens following suit. On Dec. 19, the Federal Reserve reduced its key interest rate by 25 basis points and warned of cuts in the following years. The Fed hinted that it would probably lower only twice more in the new year ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell explained that since the U.S. government’s stance has become less restrictive, then the agency can afford “be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate.” “We think the economy is in [a] really good place. We think policy is in a really good place,” he said. Following the Fed rate cut, the crypto market saw its total long liquidation surge by $200 million from a mere $39.73 million to a staggering $239.2 million just 30 minutes after the news broke, based on Coinglass data . In the past 24 hours, there have been a total of $853 million crypto asset liquidations, with Ethereum ( ETH ) leading the charge at $134.9 million.

According to data from crypto.news, Bitcoin ( BTC ) went under the $100,000 threshold as it dropped by 5%, but it recovered slightly not long after. Bitcoin is currently trading hands at $101,705, the price having gone down by 2.35% in the past 24 hours of trading. Other major cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Solana ( SOL ), and XRP ( XRP ) followed Bitcoin’s descent. Additionally, a number of altcoin like DOGE ( DOGE ) and PEPE ( PEPE ) also struggled after the Fed cut. Ethereum dipped by 0.68% after the Fed rate cut. In the past 24 hours, Ethereum has gone down by 4.5% and maintains its price at $3,674. Meanwhile, XRP saw its price dip by nearly 3%. In the past 24 hours of trading, XRP has plummeted nearly 7% and sits at $2.36. You might also like: Powell: Fed not allowed to own Bitcoin Solana was not immune to the effects of the Fed cut either. The meme coin favorite saw its price go down by 1.15% and continued its downward trend to 3.58% in the past 24 hours of trading. The token is currently trading hands at $208.98. The altcoins market suffered as well, with the total market cap of meme coins falling by nearly 8% to $105.2 billion according to CoinMarketCap . The number one meme coin by market cap, Dogecoin, fell by more than 7% shortly after the Fed cut and has not recovered since. DOGE is currently trading hands at $0.36. Meanwhile, PEPE dipped by nearly 4% shortly after the Fed cut and has gone down by more than 11% in the past 24 hours, according to data from crypto.news. The Fed’s cautious approach toward future rate cuts suggests a continued focus on controlling inflation, which could lead to a strengthening of the dollar.

The prediction market, Polymarket, has seen almost $1.55 billion in trading volume in the last 30 days. Yet one market has brought controversy, with a resolution criteria stating that it should resolve to “Yes” if, at any time between Sept. 12, 2024, and Dec. 31, 2024, Israel carries out a military action against Syria or any Syrian territory. here is an explainer thread by an oracle provider: https://t.co/XSgv3638nU — Squiggly Hair Shanks (@redhairshanks86) December 18, 2024 The resolution requires credible confirmation from someone like Syria, Israel, the U.N., or a consensus of reputable reporting. Importantly, under the rules of the market, it is not noted as Syrian territory in the Golan Heights.

Credible news agencies have confirmed these developments. That said, despite these confirmations, UMA voters have turned down attempts to settle the market as “Yes” on two occasions. You might also like: Justin Sun allegedly asked CoinDesk owners to remove banana article: report According to critics, there is an intentional delay of resolution by a category of UMA token holders, commonly referred to as “UMA whales,” in order to extract economic benefit. Based on detailed research by crypto commentators, and among them OxNimrod.eth of eOracle , several proposals were offered to resolve the market in “Yes,” but all went down by two governance votes, 97.3% of the votes cast against resolution. This has led to accusations of dominant players exploiting their position to adopt no-risk trading options. Hi, I'm the co-founder of UMA. I rarely respond publicly to criticism like this because I do not want to influence market outcomes. However there is some FUD here that should be addressed. First point I want to address is the accusation that ""UMA whales"" want to manipulate this… — Hart Lambur (⛺️,⛺️) (@hal2001) December 18, 2024 However, co-founder Hart Lambur disagreed, saying voters of UMA are rule followers for Polymarket and thus have a significant interest in the long-term sustainability of the system. Lambur further argued that UMA token holders lack incentives to manipulate the system since their actions would lead to a decrease in the token’s price and damage its protocol’s reputation. He added a further view on this matter by stating that rules from the makers govern governance at UMA. The controversy brings to light the flaws that exist in decentralized betting platforms. Fair, transparent, and accurate resolutions of markets through oracles are of key importance to user trust. This was seen in a similar challenge of market clarity and resolution at another prediction market, Kalshi . Manipulation allegations and eventual resolution of high-stakes markets stress the need for governance, transparency, and clear criteria.

With Bitcoin struggling near $100K and smaller tokens like Floki taking massive hits , people are asking: Is a crypto crash incoming? Bitcoin Battles to Stay Above $100K Bitcoin didn’t have a great day. It dipped below $100K briefly, hitting $98,695, before clawing back to $101,767. But things aren’t stable yet.

Since December 9, Floki’s value has tumbled by 34%. The RSI ( Relative Strength Index ) is sitting at a concerning 23.03, which means it’s deep in oversold territory. Some might see this as a chance for a rebound, but it’s not guaranteed. If the downtrend continues, Floki could slide further to $0.00014. Optimists are looking at $0.0002066 as the next resistance level, but it’s going to be a tough climb. Ethereum: Signs of Life in the Chaos Ethereum hasn’t escaped the downturn either, with a 5.08% drop in the last 24 hours. But here’s the interesting part: trading volume for ETH surged by 40% . That’s a lot of activity for a day like this. Some experts think Ethereum could break past $4,000 soon, maybe even challenge its all-time high. But for now, it’s caught in the same turbulence as the rest of the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bank of Japan Interest Rates Unchanged: Yen Slumps, Bitcoin Surges , What to Expect The crypto market is no stranger to volatility, but even by its standards, this is a tough period but definitely not a crypto crash. Bitcoin’s fight to stay above $100K is crucial. Floki’s free fall shows how quickly things can change, while Ethereum’s trading activity hints at underlying investor interest. Jerome Powell’s comments and the Fed’s rate cut have clearly shaken confidence. Still, crypto has always been unpredictable. Whether this is just a pause before a rebound or the start of a longer downturn depends on how investors respond in the coming days. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37836818,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112085,1734604954,Mantle Network Advances Technical Roadmap As The First ZK Validity Rollup with Succinct’s SP1,"Singapore, Singapore, December 19th, 2024, Chainwire Succinct alliance establishes Mantle Network as highest-TVL ZK validity rollup Mantle Network , an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) known for its modular design and being the first adopter of EigenLayer’s EigenDA, today announced its architectural transition to a zero-knowledge (ZK) validity rollup through an industry-first alliance with Succinct . Combining its modular architecture, data availability solutions through EigenDA, and now zero-knowledge proofs via SP1, Mantle Network embarks on creating the liquidity chain for institutional-grade settlement and value transfer in the crypto ecosystem. Since Mantle Network’s mainnet launch on July 7, 2023, the burgeoning on-chain ecosystem has grown to become a top 5 L2 by total value locked (TVL) with $2.2 billion and counting. The network has processed 175 million on-chain transactions, seen 1.4 million smart contracts deployed, connected to 10 million unique wallet addresses and maintained 4.9 million monthly active wallet addresses since its inception. Mantle Network continues to drive capital efficiency in the on-chain economy with the integration of ZK validity rollup technology, providing crucial next-generation technical infrastructure to support and amplify secure growth of high-value asset settlements. Backed by one of the largest community-owned treasuries globally with $4.3 billion in asset reserves, Mantle Network’s technical roadmap directly supports its vision of accelerating seamless, secure and efficient movement of institutional capital across traditional and decentralized markets. Accelerating Institutional-Grade Asset Settlements Through ZK Validity Innovation With the testnet launch in Q1 2025 with intention towards mainnet upgrade, Mantle Network is set to evolve from an optimistic rollup model to a ZK validity rollup through Succinct’s SP1. This architectural change drastically reduces chain finality from seven days to one hour – enabling fast institutional-grade asset settlements that support and address capital efficiency opportunities throughout traditional finance and the blockchain industry. The transformative efficiency gains of ZK validity proofs have garnered significant market traction. Already powering applications with a cumulative $4.4 billion capital across leading ZK L2 ecosystems, Mantle Network maintains a bullish belief in the advancement of ZK technology to further the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Performance benefits can allow Mantle’s flagship assets, such as $mETH, $cmETH and $FBTC, with an aggregate $3.9 billion TVL, to proliferate across the wider decentralized finance (DeFi) domain. This enables better swap market spreads, lower slippage, deeper money markets, improved interest rates, and broader asset availability. Market intermediaries can rapidly rebalance inventories between Mantle Network (Layer 2) and Ethereum (Layer 1), and users can quickly move permissionlessly to access a unique set of onward routes and integrations. Key Technical Benefits The strategic integration of Succinct’s SP1 offers a suite of advanced features catered to developers and users: Fast Finality: Boasting a 168x improvement in bridging capabilities, transactions achieve finality in one hour – enabling quick withdrawals and seamless operations to redefine user experience. EVM Equivalence: Succinct’s SP1 full EVM bytecode compatibility ensures developers can leverage existing Ethereum tooling and smart contracts without compromise. Cost Efficiency: Prover fees integrated into transaction costs eliminate additional financial burdens for rollup teams with minimal cost impact to users, as low as fractions of a cent per transaction. Enabling a Multi-Chain Future: The advancement reaffirms Mantle Network’s alignment with Ethereum’s security ethos while laying the groundwork for cross-rollup interoperability at scale through ZK proofs. Driving the Future of ZK Rollups OP Succinct combines the power of Succinct’s SP1 zkVM with the modularity of the OP Stack, bridging the gap between user-friendly optimistic rollups and complex zero-knowledge technology. The innovation promotes interoperability, flexibility, and standardization that addresses Ethereum’s existing challenges. By adopting ZK validity proofs, Mantle Network transactions are cryptographically verified to be correctly sequenced and settled. This higher tier of security allows everyone to more easily and safely explore frontier areas that enhance the Ethereum experience — such as supporting more advanced application logic, enabling cross-chain actions, improving latency, and adopting multi-sequencer architectures. Joshua Cheong, Product Lead at Mantle said: “In my previous banking career, I witnessed traditional banking infrastructure and legacy banking business models struggle to keep up with the emergence of FinTech disruptors built with cloud services that boast cost advantages. The introduction of programmable blockchains along with stablecoins heralds the next natural step in disruption of financial services – being even more operationally efficient and resilient. The integration of Succinct’s SP1 marks a defining chapter in Mantle Network’s strategic blockchain journey to support banking for the next generation. By uniting zero-knowledge proofs with the proven versatility of the OP Stack, we’re not just evolving as a Layer-2 solution – we’re setting a new benchmark for institutional-grade Ethereum scalability that enables highly efficient and unparalleled security for high-value transactions at the cost of a few cents with 24/7 settlements.” Uma Roy, CEO and Co-Founder at Succinct added: “Succinct’s SP1 empowers any developer to make ZK applications by just writing Rust, accelerating the adoption of ZK and verifiable computation. With OP Succinct, we can propel any OP Stack rollup into the future by providing fast finality with no downsides. By merging SP1’s blazing fast performance with Mantle’s progressive vision, we’re enabling developers to reimagine decentralized applications with unprecedented speed, efficiency, and reliability. Together, we’re building the foundation for Ethereum’s interconnected and scalable future.” A Unified Ethereum Ecosystem The synergy of fast finality, Ethereum-standard compatibility, and cost efficiency promises a profound impact, reducing fragmentation and unlocking the potential for next-generation decentralized applications (dApps). The transition enhances Mantle Network’s commitment to Ethereum’s decentralized security model as an ETH-aligned Layer 2, enabling a more cohesive ecosystem with seamless asset and information flows. Mantle Network is now poised to be a future-ready L2 chain as a native ZK rollup. As the Ethereum landscape evolves, Mantle Network’s adoption of Succinct’s SP1 positions it as a leader in scalability and innovation. Developers, users, and ecosystem partners can look forward to a faster, more secure, and interconnected Ethereum future.

This architectural change drastically reduces chain finality from seven days to one hour – enabling fast institutional-grade asset settlements that support and address capital efficiency opportunities throughout traditional finance and the blockchain industry. The transformative efficiency gains of ZK validity proofs have garnered significant market traction. Already powering applications with a cumulative $4.4 billion capital across leading ZK L2 ecosystems, Mantle Network maintains a bullish belief in the advancement of ZK technology to further the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Performance benefits can allow Mantle’s flagship assets, such as $mETH, $cmETH and $FBTC, with an aggregate $3.9 billion TVL, to proliferate across the wider decentralized finance (DeFi) domain. This enables better swap market spreads, lower slippage, deeper money markets, improved interest rates, and broader asset availability. Market intermediaries can rapidly rebalance inventories between Mantle Network (Layer 2) and Ethereum (Layer 1), and users can quickly move permissionlessly to access a unique set of onward routes and integrations. Key Technical Benefits The strategic integration of Succinct’s SP1 offers a suite of advanced features catered to developers and users: Fast Finality: Boasting a 168x improvement in bridging capabilities, transactions achieve finality in one hour – enabling quick withdrawals and seamless operations to redefine user experience. EVM Equivalence: Succinct’s SP1 full EVM bytecode compatibility ensures developers can leverage existing Ethereum tooling and smart contracts without compromise. Cost Efficiency: Prover fees integrated into transaction costs eliminate additional financial burdens for rollup teams with minimal cost impact to users, as low as fractions of a cent per transaction. Enabling a Multi-Chain Future: The advancement reaffirms Mantle Network’s alignment with Ethereum’s security ethos while laying the groundwork for cross-rollup interoperability at scale through ZK proofs. Driving the Future of ZK Rollups OP Succinct combines the power of Succinct’s SP1 zkVM with the modularity of the OP Stack, bridging the gap between user-friendly optimistic rollups and complex zero-knowledge technology. The innovation promotes interoperability, flexibility, and standardization that addresses Ethereum’s existing challenges. By adopting ZK validity proofs, Mantle Network transactions are cryptographically verified to be correctly sequenced and settled. This higher tier of security allows everyone to more easily and safely explore frontier areas that enhance the Ethereum experience — such as supporting more advanced application logic, enabling cross-chain actions, improving latency, and adopting multi-sequencer architectures. Joshua Cheong, Product Lead at Mantle said: “In my previous banking career, I witnessed traditional banking infrastructure and legacy banking business models struggle to keep up with the emergence of FinTech disruptors built with cloud services that boast cost advantages. The introduction of programmable blockchains along with stablecoins heralds the next natural step in disruption of financial services – being even more operationally efficient and resilient. The integration of Succinct’s SP1 marks a defining chapter in Mantle Network’s strategic blockchain journey to support banking for the next generation. By uniting zero-knowledge proofs with the proven versatility of the OP Stack, we’re not just evolving as a Layer-2 solution – we’re setting a new benchmark for institutional-grade Ethereum scalability that enables highly efficient and unparalleled security for high-value transactions at the cost of a few cents with 24/7 settlements.” Uma Roy, CEO and Co-Founder at Succinct added: “Succinct’s SP1 empowers any developer to make ZK applications by just writing Rust, accelerating the adoption of ZK and verifiable computation. With OP Succinct, we can propel any OP Stack rollup into the future by providing fast finality with no downsides. By merging SP1’s blazing fast performance with Mantle’s progressive vision, we’re enabling developers to reimagine decentralized applications with unprecedented speed, efficiency, and reliability. Together, we’re building the foundation for Ethereum’s interconnected and scalable future.” A Unified Ethereum Ecosystem The synergy of fast finality, Ethereum-standard compatibility, and cost efficiency promises a profound impact, reducing fragmentation and unlocking the potential for next-generation decentralized applications (dApps). The transition enhances Mantle Network’s commitment to Ethereum’s decentralized security model as an ETH-aligned Layer 2, enabling a more cohesive ecosystem with seamless asset and information flows. Mantle Network is now poised to be a future-ready L2 chain as a native ZK rollup. As the Ethereum landscape evolves, Mantle Network’s adoption of Succinct’s SP1 positions it as a leader in scalability and innovation. Developers, users, and ecosystem partners can look forward to a faster, more secure, and interconnected Ethereum future.

The survey indicates that its customers hold a greater percentage of memecoins compared to Bitcoin, with figures standing at 16% for memecoins and 14% for Bitcoin. Binance said, “The survey results suggest that memecoins are not only popular in terms of current holdings but are also the class of digital assets that users are highly excited about for the future.” In addition, survey respondents identified memecoins as a major source of market development in the upcoming year. On-chain data shows the total market cap for the memecoin market is currently at $117 billion, with Dogecoin as the top performer. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s market cap is over $2 trillion. In addition, according to Binance users, BNB holdings outnumber ETH holdings among survey participants, accounting for 10.95% of total ownership. Other leading layer-1 tokens account for 10.38%. Memecoins compete with AI in terms of growth In 2025, Binance users anticipate that AI tokens will dominate the market ahead of other emergent sub-sectors, followed by memecoins. AI tokens are the category of digital assets with the greatest perceived upward potential. An impressive 23.89% of the survey participants believe they will drive the market’s growth. Interestingly, memecoins had a solid 19.09% of respondents expressing confidence in their potential for growth. Being the most risky investment, users have embraced them since they equally have great returns in comparison to other crypto categories. Donald Trump’s election victory caused the leading memecoin DOGE to pump by over 160% in November. This proves that memecoins demonstrate highly speculative tendencies.

The term “memecoin” experienced a peak search volume of 100 on December 5 over the past 30 days, only to decline to 66 as of December 19. On the contrary, the volume of inquiries for “Bitcoin” decreased from its peak of 100 on the same date to 50. Also, DeFi tokens and layer-1 tokens follow at 12.37% and 12.28%, respectively. Traders embraced the crypto market globally this year The survey also emphasizes the increase in the number of new crypto adopters. Nearly half of the respondents (45%) entered the crypto market in 2024. 24.52% entered the market within the past six months, and 20.60% joined within the past year. Binance asserted, “The Binance community is characterized by a balanced blend of experience levels, as 41.86% of respondents have been active in the crypto market for one to five years, despite the fact that many new users are still establishing their footing.” According to the survey, A substantial 43.97% of respondents have allocated less than 10% of their overall fortune to crypto, while 24.33% hold between 10% and 25% in crypto assets. In addition, trading activity continues to be strong, with 31.09% of respondents reporting daily trades and 22.91% trading weekly. The survey explained that the primary motivator for crypto users sticking to the market is the potential for rapid appreciation of digital assets. 22.4% of respondents identified it as their primary reason for joining. Decentralization and financial independence are also significant drivers, affecting 18.78% of participants. Still, 17.16% of respondents identified the quickness and simplicity of transactions as a critical factor in their decision to enter the market.

37836455,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664831,1734604250,Interest Rate Cut Impact: Bitcoin Price Reaction Unraveled With Future Projections,"The Bitcoin price experienced a significant downturn on Wednesday, briefly falling below the $100,000 milestone as the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) cautious outlook on interest rate cuts dampened crypto investments. At one point in Wednesday’s trading session, the market’s leading crypto dropped to $98,760 before recovering to the six-figure mark. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), also faced substantial retraces. Fed’s Cautious Rate Cut Sparks Uncertainty In Markets The Federal Reserve’s decision to lower borrowing costs for the third consecutive time came with a tempered forecast for future reductions, particularly for 2025. Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that more progress is needed on inflation before the central bank can consider further easing of monetary policy. Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty, noted that the Fed’s decision was largely anticipated given recent trends in US inflation and economic activity. However, it acted as a catalyst for shedding some of the “speculative excess” that had entered risk assets, including stocks and Bitcoin, especially following the recent US elections, according to Sycamore. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Still Mirroring Bullish Move From 2023, What To Expect After Hitting $108,000 ATH Despite this dip, the Bitcoin price remains up approximately 50% since the US elections on November 5, largely due to President-elect Donald Trump’s commitment to deregulating the cryptocurrency sector while floating the idea of establishing a national stockpile of Bitcoin, further boosting market sentiment. Paul Veradittakit, managing partner at Pantera Capital, expressed optimism about the Bitcoin price future, stating, “All signs point to a good floor and outlook for Bitcoin,” even as some traders took profits following the Fed meeting. Market dynamics shifted post-Fed meeting, with Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets, reporting an uptick in demand for options to hedge against potential Bitcoin declines. Zann Kwan, chief investment officer at Revo Digital Family Office, indicated that a temporary retreat into the low $90,000s for Bitcoin is possible. Bitcoin Price Eyes Key Resistance Level At $105,400 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez provided insights into market sentiment, emphasizing that current market behavior reflects expectations about future conditions rather than past events. The analyst noted that while the 25 basis point rate cut was largely anticipated, the Fed’s updated outlook for 2025 was not well received. Instead of three anticipated rate cuts in 2025, the Fed now projects only two, raising concerns about persistent inflation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Peak Between $160,000 And $290,000 If These Historical Patterns Repeat – Report Recent inflation data has also been disheartening, with core consumer price index (CPI) figures annualizing at 4% and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) approaching 3.5%. Producer price index (PPI) figures are similarly trending upward, suggesting that inflation could remain an ongoing challenge. However, Martinez emphasizes that the real turning point came during Powell’s press conference when he described the decision as a “closer call,” indicating that not all Fed officials were in agreement about the cuts. This sent the US dollar soaring to levels not seen since 2022, which typically correlates with declines for BTC. Martinez also disclosed that the Bitcoin price had broken out of a head-and-shoulders pattern on Wednesday, which resulted in its drop just below $99,000, but emphasized that the cryptocurrency must surpass $105,400 to negate any bearish outlook. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $101,180, down 2.2% over the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin Near Key Support, Set for Major Upside in Upcoming Altcoin Season Dogecoin is trading between $0.36 and $0.46, hovering close to its nearest support level at $0.3115. The Relative Strength Index is around 32, indicating oversold conditions. Over the past six months, DOGE has surged over 200%. With the altcoin season on the horizon, a bounce from current levels could see DOGE targeting its first resistance at $0.5145 and potentially reaching the second resistance at $0.616. This would represent a significant percentage gain from current prices. The convergence of the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages around $0.39-$0.40 supports a bullish outlook. DOGE could potentially rally along with the broader crypto market. XRP Gains 137% in a Month: Eyeing Key Resistance Levels Amid Bull Run Hopes XRP is trading between $2.03 and $2.73, showing significant movement in recent weeks. Over the past month, the cryptocurrency surged by 137.46%, and it’s up 412.55% in six months. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.53, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $2.47, indicating bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.85, and the Stochastic indicator reads 22.00, both suggesting that XRP is not overbought. Traders are watching the nearest resistance level at $3.02 and support at $1.61 closely. A move beyond these levels could signal further action. With growing optimism for an altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, XRP’s performance is drawing attention. Cardano (ADA) Set to Soar: Indicators Suggest Potential Breakout Cardano (ADA) is currently trading between $0.94 and $1.22. Over the last month, its price jumped by 45.38%, and in six months, it surged 165.45%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 32.06, nearing oversold territory, suggesting a potential upward move. The nearest resistance level is at $1.35. If ADA breaks through this, it could rally towards the second resistance at $1.64, representing a possible gain of over 30%. The stochastic at 10.71 also indicates oversold conditions. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $1.03, slightly below the 100-day average of $1.08, which may signal consolidation before a rise. With altcoin season approaching, Cardano could be poised for significant growth. Shiba Inu Eyes Potential Surge Amid Altcoin Season Buzz Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a slight uptick over the past month, rising by 3.59%. Currently trading between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200, SHIB is showing signs of potential growth. The Relative Strength Index sits at 33.07, hinting that the coin is nearing oversold conditions. The Stochastic indicator at 17.89 suggests possible upward momentum. If SHIB can break through its nearest resistance level of $0.00003614, it may aim for the next resistance at $0.00004418. This would represent a significant increase from its current price range. With the anticipation of an altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, SHIB could be poised for a notable surge. Conclusion DOGE, XRP, ADA, and SHIB show steady appeal but are expected to deliver smaller gains in the short term. DOGEN stands out as a token built for leaders who push boundaries. With a projected 700% growth by the end of the presale, its exclusive perks and bold vision position it for extraordinary success this altcoin season.

37836430,https://coinpaper.com/6621/ethena-partners-with-world-liberty-financial-for-dual-reward-de-fi-integration,1734604200,Ethena Partners with World Liberty Financial for Dual Reward DeFi Integration,"The cryptocurrency market is bracing for significant developments as the industry navigates shifting political landscapes and ambitious partnerships. From Ethena’s integration with Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes’ tempered outlook on crypto market trends under Trump’s presidency, the intersection of policy, innovation, and market sentiment is poised to shape the sector’s trajectory in 2025. While bold moves like Ethena’s dual-reward initiative signal growth, cautionary perspectives like Hayes’ remind investors of the complexities ahead. Ethena Partners with Trump-Backed World Liberty Financial to Expand DeFi Horizons Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena has announced a landmark partnership with Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLF), marking a significant step toward enhancing stablecoin liquidity and incentivizing DeFi adoption. The collaboration, revealed on Dec. 18, aims to integrate Ethena’s sUSDe token — a staked derivative of its USDe synthetic dollar stablecoin — into World Liberty Financial’s Aave instance. This strategic partnership is expected to enable users to deposit USDe and earn dual rewards in sUSDe and WLF’s native token. The move is designed to boost stablecoin utilization while aligning incentives for participants across both platforms. Ethena Labs took to X to announce the partnership, emphasizing the proposal’s potential to reshape the liquidity and functionality of stablecoins within the DeFi ecosystem. “Should it pass, this proposal will enable World Liberty Financial users to benefit from sUSDe rewards and also WLF token rewards. This integration will increase stablecoin liquidity and utilization rates on the protocol, as sUSDe's integration has on Aave's Core instance.” In conjunction with the announcement, Ethena Labs submitted an official proposal to the World Liberty Financial community on Dec. 18, requesting approval to introduce sUSDe as the first new collateral asset for the platform. This move follows sUSDe’s successful risk analysis and adoption in Aave’s Core and Lido instances, further solidifying the token’s credibility. According to a detailed post on the community forum, the Ethena Foundation plans to “co-incentivize supply of sUSDe to come to the instance via its points program.” This approach is designed to encourage user participation while supporting the platform’s dual-reward mechanism. Challenges and the Trump Factor The announcement comes at a critical time for World Liberty Financial , which has faced challenges in establishing itself as a key player in the crypto space. Despite being backed by former US President Donald Trump, the company’s initial token offering in October struggled to gain traction. Out of 20 billion WLFI tokens available for sale, only 848.63 million tokens ($12.7 million worth) were sold in the first 24 hours, leaving an estimated $287 million worth unsold. However, November brought renewed momentum when prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun purchased $30 million worth of WLF tokens, becoming its largest single holder. This influx of capital allowed World Liberty Financial to make significant investments in assets including Ethereum (ETH), Aave (AAVE), ENA, ONDO, Chainlink (LINK), and cbBTC, collectively valued at $30 million. The partnership with Ethena adds a much-needed strategic boost to World Liberty Financial as it seeks to compete with more established players in the crypto and DeFi markets. The integration of sUSDe into World Liberty Financial’s ecosystem is expected to have ripple effects throughout the DeFi landscape. As stablecoins like USDe gain traction, enhanced liquidity and dual-reward structures can encourage wider adoption and foster greater confidence among users. Ethena’s partnership aligns with broader industry trends emphasizing collaboration between innovative DeFi protocols and centralized platforms seeking to expand their reach. The success of this initiative may set a precedent for future integrations between synthetic assets and platforms looking to maximize user incentives. Arthur Hayes Predicts Crypto Market Volatility Amid Trump’s Inauguration: A Cautionary Perspective Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market is abuzz with speculation about the impact of United States President-elect Donald Trump’s January 2025 inauguration. Many analysts anticipate a surge in market activity and positive trends driven by potential pro-crypto policies under Trump’s administration. However, Arthur Hayes , co-founder of BitMEX and a prominent figure in the crypto space, offers a contrarian view. In his Dec. 17 blog post, titled “Trump Truth,” Hayes warns of an impending ”reality check” for crypto investors who expect rapid policy changes. He predicts a volatile market trajectory that could see significant price drops in early 2025 before recovering later in the year. High Expectations Meet Political Realities Hayes cautions against the market’s lofty expectations, highlighting a significant disconnect between the optimism surrounding Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric and the realities of policy implementation. “The market believes that Trump and his people can immediately achieve economic and political miracles,” Hayes wrote, adding that these hopes are likely misplaced in the short term. He notes the absence of politically feasible solutions that could be enacted swiftly. While Trump’s administration has fueled hopes for a more favorable regulatory environment, Hayes predicts that tangible policy changes will take much longer to materialize. This delay, he argues, could lead to disillusionment among investors and a corresponding sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Hayes anticipates a sharp market correction around Trump’s inauguration day, Jan. 20, 2025. He describes this phase as a “harrowing dump” that will act as a wake-up call for overzealous investors. Despite this forecast, Hayes remains bullish on the long-term trajectory of cryptocurrencies, predicting a recovery and “crack-up-boom phase” later in 2025. Hayes also provided insights into the investment strategy of his family office fund, Maelstrom. In anticipation of a market downturn, Maelstrom plans to reduce its positions before Trump’s inauguration, with the intention of re-entering the market at lower prices in the first half of 2025. “Maelstrom will be lightening up on certain positions in advance, hoping to rebuy some core positions at lower prices,” Hayes explained. He added that the fund is prepared to adjust its strategy if the bull market defies expectations and continues through the inauguration. The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced significant momentum since Trump’s victory in the presidential election in November 2024. Bitcoin (BTC) shattered records, surpassing $100,000 for the first time in early December. Analysts, including those from Singapore-based crypto platform Matrixport, forecast a strong start for Bitcoin in 2025, with many investors likely regretting missed accumulation opportunities. However, Hayes’ cautious outlook is not without company. Rumors suggest that MicroStrategy, a major institutional Bitcoin holder, could enter a blackout period in January 2025, temporarily halting its BTC acquisitions. This potential development has added another layer of uncertainty to the market’s near-term trajectory. Balancing Optimism with Prudence While many commentators view Trump’s presidency as a catalyst for mainstream crypto adoption, Hayes offers a sobering reminder of the complexities involved. He argues that the timeline for policy enactment and market adoption is often slower than anticipated, creating opportunities for volatility. “We are committed to admitting defeat if the bull market steamrolls through Jan. 20, licking our wounds, and getting back on the bull [...] I will be buying dips and rips,” Hayes said. As Trump’s inauguration approaches, the cryptocurrency market faces a pivotal moment. The interplay between investor expectations, regulatory realities, and macroeconomic trends will likely shape the market’s direction in early 2025. Hayes’ measured approach serves as a reminder that periods of exuberance often require a tempered perspective. While the short-term outlook remains uncertain, the long-term case for cryptocurrencies continues to strengthen. Whether Trump’s administration delivers the anticipated policy changes or not, the resilience of the crypto market will likely be tested — and, as Hayes suggests, those who manage risks effectively may find the greatest opportunities.",POSITIVE,BTC | ENA,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ENA,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6621/ethena-partners-with-world-liberty-financial-for-dual-reward-de-fi-integration,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-loves-bitcoin-muskbtc-solana-memecoin-to-rally-13000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-underperform-2/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37836392,https://finbold.com/?p=220795,1734603994,Stock market wipes $1.5 trillion in a day; Crash imminent?,"Wednesday, December 18, proved a particularly bloody day for the stock market as approximately $1.5 trillion was wiped from it before the closing bell. Prominent indices like the small-cap Russell 2,000 and the large-cap S&P 500 both effectively erased their post-election gains. The S&P 500 fell to 5,872.16 points – right between the November 5 close at 5,782.76 and November 6 close at 5,929.04 – and Russell 2,000 to 2,231.51 – below both 2,260.84 ‎on November 5 and 2,392.92 on November 6. S&P 500 and Russell 2,000 6-month price charts with November 6 levels marked. Source: Google The cryptocurrency market didn’t fare much better – though it doubtlessly benefitted from never closing – as it, at one point, erased some $300 billion, but reduced the losses to about $100 billion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) likewise made a $7,000 swing, first falling from just under $105,000 to approximately $98,000 and then recovering to its press time price of $101,708. Why the stock market is crashing The entirety of the latest market tumult can be traced back to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which ended on Wednesday. Still, the downturn could appear strange at face value, as the 25 basis points (BPS) cut the Fed announced has been widely expected, as reported by Finbold on December 4. Indeed, as is usually the case, the devil is in the details. Specifically, despite providing the expected interest rate reduction, the Federal Reserve cautioned there would be fewer cuts than previously anticipated in 2025. Similarly, it revised its inflation outlook upward, from 2.1% to 2.5%. Some investors took the announcements as something of an admission that the Federal Reserve’s strategy has not been a resounding success, while others began fearing the return of rampant inflation. The price-rise worries might be particularly pointed as, as it turned out, the feared recession over high interest rates never materialized, but inflation did begin reheating as soon as rate reductions became a reality. Such a setup – provided the trend continues – could lead to particularly bad outcomes, the worst of which is the ‘most predictable forthcoming inflation crisis,’ outlined early in 2024 and forecasting double-digit inflation in the coming years.

The project aims to provide light for schoolchildren in underdeveloped areas of Africa, promoting education equality and improving their living conditions. This charitable initiative originated at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in 2023, where KuCoin made a firm commitment to support social welfare initiatives during the “KuCoin Green Future Dinner”, witnessed by over 200 guests from various countries. In 2024, KuCoin has continued to fulfill its social responsibilities by launching a series of impactful public welfare projects, with the “Light Up Africa” Children’s Solar Lamp Project standing out as a prime example. Through the donation of solar reading lamps, the project provides opportunities for children in rural African areas without electricity to study at night, illuminating their path to knowledge. In February 2024, the first batch of 2,500 solar lamps was delivered to 25 schools in Nigeria. By October 2024, an additional 7,200 solar lamps were distributed to various communities in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Ghana, benefiting even more children. At the donation ceremony in Ghana, Dr. Anita Nana Okuribido from the Smiling Simon Green Building Foundation expressed sincere gratitude to KuCoin. She highlighted that local children previously relied on candles or dim moonlight for their evening studies. The solar lamps donated by KuCoin have significantly improved their learning conditions. One solar lamp impacts at least five students, meaning this project directly benefits 36,000 children, helping them step out of darkness and embrace the light of knowledge. Zhao Jing, Chairman of Global CSR, emphasized that this project has ignited African children’s enthusiasm for learning, boosting their confidence and instilling hope for a brighter future. This effort is not merely a material donation but also a profound source of encouragement. As a global leader in the digital economy, KuCoin remains committed to sustainable development goals, focusing on areas such as climate change, health, and education, and has achieved significant positive social impact. KuCoin’s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), Nancy Cheung, stated that the “Light Up Africa” project is a key step in KuCoin’s journey to advance the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. KuCoin will continue to support children’s education and technological innovation, driving society toward a better future.

Discover Why 1Fuel Could Be The Next 100x Altcoin Sensation! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the market enters the recovery phase with several assets seeing month-long gains, there’s been a high level of interest in certain tokens for their utility and potential returns. ADA is one of these tokens, but its rally isn’t yet defined as several factors surround it. For 1Fuel (OFT) , its rally is guaranteed and expected to return over 500x from its current presale price of $0.012. The excitement and anticipation by investors and institutional traders buying 1Fuel stems from its role as the utility token for the best cryptocurrency wallet. You’ll learn more about why 1Fuel’s boom is more anticipated than ADA’s. Whales Are Accumulating ADA: A Strong Indication Of Buying ADA has seen notable interest among whales, otherwise known as large investors, as they activate their buying spree. In a recent move, over $1 million worth of ADA has been purchased according to Santiment. When such buying occurs, it means there’s ongoing demand for ADA that can take its price higher. The asset has naturally been bullish, with a gain of 45.84% in the past month and 6,123.93% since its all-time low of $0.01735 according to CoinMarketCap. With the current bullish momentum in the market and the positive developments surrounding Cardano, the Layer 1 blockchain could trade back to its previous all-time high of $3.10. However, a move to $20 could remain a stretch unless there’s continued strength in the market. While there’s no guarantee of ADA’s super surge, it’s a different scenario with 1Fuel , which has been investors’ priority. Utility Drives Investor Interest in 1Fuel The utility of 1Fuel remains unrivaled as it sits at the center of all activities happening on the platform, serving as one of the best cryptocurrency wallets. Unlike the multiple cryptocurrency exchanges available, which come in a very fragmented nature, there’s no seamless transaction system. Traders wanting to interact with different blockchains require specific tokens—for example, BNB for BEP20 and ETH for ERC20 transactions. With 1Fuel, the situation is different. All you need is the token to consolidate transactions across multiple blockchains on its platform without any difficulties or delays. This means you’ll only require the token to complete transactions. With multiple activities happening on the wallet, the asset is expected to see a significant price surge, especially post-launch. Beyond the above, there are multiple other reasons why 1Fuel is of interest in the market . One major reason is its unique staking mechanism, which provides up to 30% Annual Percentage Rate (APR). Additionally, its peer-to-peer (P2P) mechanism allows it to compete with some of the best cryptocurrency exchanges. Conclusion 1Fuel is expected to deliver gains of over 100x when it finally launches, trading far higher than its current level of $0.012—offering returns far greater than what ADA can deliver. This makes 1Fuel the best choice for investors looking for guaranteed returns, significant gains, and superior utility. A major factor in its expected impact is its listing on some of the best cryptocurrency exchanges, which will make the asset even more valuable. 1 Fuel is currently trading at $0.012, slightly above its Stage 1 price of $0.01 and with Stage 2 filling up quickly and over $650k raised in a few days, you need to be quick to secure the lowest possible price. Don’t be late—join the presale today and be part of the future of secure, cross-chain cryptocurrency transactions. More about 1FUEL?

37836092,https://thecoinrise.com/former-delphi-digital-vp-face-4-years-jail-sentence-for-4-5m-crypto-embezzlement/,1734603476,Former Delphi Digital VP Face 4 Years Jail Sentence for $4.5M Crypto Embezzlement,"Dylan Meissner, the former finance vice president of crypto research firm Delphi Digital, has faced a four years imprisonment sentence after admitting to embezzling nearly $4.5 million. Connecticut District Court Judge Michael P. Shea delivered the verdict on December 17, also ordering Meissner to repay over $4.6 million, covering the stolen funds and an unpaid loan. Meissner, who served as Delphi’s finance VP from October 2021 to November 2022, used his privileged access to company wallets and accounts to orchestrate the theft. In January 2022, Delphi provided Meissner with a loan of 50 Ether (valued at $170,000 at the time) to mitigate his personal crypto investment losses. However, he failed to repay the loan and, over the next several months, misappropriated $4.46 million, falsifying financial entries to conceal his activities. A Careful Scheme Unveiled Court documents revealed that Meissner’s embezzlement was not an impulsive act but a calculated scheme . Prosecutors argued that his actions were deliberate, intending to recoup personal losses by leveraging company funds, with plans to repay Delphi once the crypto market rebounded. Meissner’s lawyer, in a sentence memo , cited his struggles with substance abuse and highlighted his efforts to assist Delphi in assessing the financial damage through detailed documentation. Prosecutors, however, dismissed these claims as insufficient justification. “The defendant’s crimes reflect rational but wrongful intentions,” they argued, emphasizing that Meissner prioritized personal gain over professional integrity, betraying the company’s trust. A Sobering Sentence with Lingering Impact As part of a plea deal, Meissner pleaded guilty to wire fraud in July, waiving his right to appeal. While his defense sought a reduced sentence of 51 to 63 months, the prosecution recommended a term of 6.5 to 8 years. The court’s decision to sentence him to 48 months reflects a compromise, factoring in both his admissions and mitigating circumstances. Meissner, who remains free on a $100,000 bond, is required to report to prison on February 21, 2025.

Qubetics Presale Heats Up as Cardano & NEAR Protocol Gain Traction—Which Crypto Will Lead in 2024?,"Are you ready to catch the next big wave in crypto? December 2024 is buzzing with exciting developments as Qubetics smashes milestones, Cardano makes a strong comeback, and NEAR Protocol surprises the market with massive user growth. It’s a showdown of innovation, utility, and potential gains, leaving investors wondering—where should their money go next? Among these standout projects, Qubetics’ game-changing QubeQode IDE is redefining decentralised app development, while Cardano’s advancements in governance are attracting more users. Meanwhile, NEAR Protocol has crossed a jaw-dropping three million daily active addresses, making its ecosystem one of the fastest-growing in the industry. So, which of these is the best coin for massive return potential in 2024? Qubetics: The Powerhouse Revolutionising Decentralised Development Qubetics ($TICS) is lighting up the crypto space with its cutting-edge QubeQode IDE . This integrated development environment is making it easier for developers to create decentralised applications (dApps) without the steep learning curve typically associated with blockchain coding. Think of it as the tool that’s turning blockchain complexity into simplicity, empowering developers of all skill levels. Qubetics held an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) event to be more open with its community. During the session, the team answered questions and shared their future plans, reinforcing their image as a top cryptocurrency investment. Watch it now! Having raised over $7 million in its presale and sold more than 355 million tokens, Qubetics has proven its growing appeal. Its price is currently at $0.0342 in the 13th stage of presale, with over 10,600 token holders jumping in. Analysts predict a potential post-launch surge to $10-$15, which could turn a $1,000 investment at presale prices into a jaw-dropping $439,000 at its peak. With the rising demand for dApps across industries, Qubetics is poised to solve real-world problems that older blockchain ecosystems have struggled with. Imagine a future where launching a secure, scalable app is as easy as drag-and-drop—that’s the vision Qubetics is delivering. Why Qubetics’ Presale is Turning Heads Unlike its competitors, Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s a toolkit for innovation. The QubeQode IDE stands out by offering a user-friendly platform that bridges the gap between blockchain and mainstream app development. Whether it’s decentralised finance (DeFi), gaming, or enterprise solutions, Qubetics is paving the way for a more accessible blockchain revolution. Investors are flocking to its presale not only for its innovative tech but also for its lucrative growth potential. The excitement around its upcoming mainnet launch is creating serious FOMO, with many seeing it as the best coin for massive return potential in 2024. If you’ve been waiting for the perfect entry point into the next big thing in crypto, this might be it. Cardano: Strengthening Its Ecosystem with Governance Upgrades Cardano ($ADA) continues to prove its staying power with major upgrades that focus on decentralisation and governance. The platform recently launched the first phase of its Voltaire era, introducing on-chain voting and decentralised decision-making. These features aim to make Cardano one of the most democratic blockchains out there. The Binance report highlights how Cardano is successfully drawing in developers and users, further solidifying its reputation as a top-tier blockchain. For investors, this ecosystem growth translates into long-term value. With ADA trading at an attractive price point, it’s an excellent opportunity to capitalise on its expansion. So, what could $1,000 in Cardano look like in 2024? Given its track record and ecosystem growth, a conservative estimate could see gains of 5-10x, especially as its governance upgrades take hold. NEAR Protocol: Scaling Heights with Explosive User Growth NEAR Protocol is rewriting the script on scalability and usability in blockchain. With over three million daily active addresses, the network is proving its ability to attract and retain users. Analysts are already speculating that NEAR’s Rollblock feature could rival giants like Solana and Ethereum in terms of user engagement and ecosystem development. What makes NEAR stand out? It’s not just about numbers; it’s about usability. NEAR’s focus on simple and efficient tools is bringing blockchain to the masses. Its low transaction costs and high throughput make it ideal for dApps, attracting developers in droves. An investment of $1,000 in NEAR today could yield significant returns as its user base continues to expand. With NEAR climbing the ranks as a go-to platform for developers, its position as one of the best coins for massive return potential is hard to ignore. Which Crypto Wins the Race? All three projects—Qubetics, Cardano, and NEAR Protocol—bring something unique to the table. Cardano is doubling down on governance, NEAR is breaking user engagement records, and Qubetics is leading the charge in dApp development. But if we’re talking about the biggest growth potential, Qubetics’ $7 million presale and groundbreaking QubeQode IDE give it a clear edge. As analysts predict $10-$15 for $TICS after launch, now’s the time to secure your stake. The best opportunities in crypto often lie in presales, and Qubetics is proving why. Don’t miss your chance to join the Qubetics revolution—your next massive return potential could be just a few clicks away.

37836001,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313280,1734603300,"Bitcoin on Cusp of Rallying Higher as One Indicator Turns Bullish, Says Kevin Svenson – But There’s a Catch","Analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is leaning bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the flagship crypto asset continues to hover above the $100,000 price. Svenson tells his 81,000 YouTube subscribers that based on the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily time frame, Bitcoin could surge higher over the short term. According to the analyst, Bitcoin could go up by around six percent from the current price based on the Fibonacci extension levels – a tool used to determine potential price targets based on the Fibonacci sequence of numbers. “I want to bring your attention to the daily MACD histograms. And what we can see is that we are attempting a cross-up – the bulls may be regaining momentum fully in the very near future… … the bears have now lost their momentum and the bulls are regaining momentum. We are crossing up right now on the daily. So if we do get this cross-up and we close with a confirmed cross-up, I do think Bitcoin may be able to actually break this channel line, this resistance line and punch up towards the 1.618 Fibonacci [extension level]. $111,600 is the next major target.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Svenson, however, says that Bitcoin “has a lot of room to move down” even amid a bullish trend. “If you’re looking at this upward-sloping channel, in theory, Bitcoin’s price could come all the way down to $100,000 and still be in an uptrend. You can imagine if Bitcoin’s price… let’s say chopped sideways for a bit and then dipped to $100,000, people would be freaking out as they always do. But you just look at the uptrend line – that is a perfect buy zone for Bitcoin that is a great support target and that would be a higher low in the midst of a major bull market. I think the outcome would end up being pretty positive regardless if we saw a slight dip to retest the channel line, the upward-sloping channel line. I think Bitcoin would do just fine from there and continue the bull run.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $105,135 at time of writing.

37835949,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630196,1734603073,"Jerome Powell, FED switch up to Trump – A new administration, new life, new tone","As many economists know, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the US President-elect Donald J. Trump do not see eye to eye on practically everything. The political “indifference” is nothing short of pronounced; Trump has been asked if he would request Powell to leave office, to which he said, “No I wouldn’t.” President-elect Trump is preparing to assume office. However, his commitment to mainstream crypto adoption and aggressive spending cuts collides with Powell’s more cautious, inflation-focused approach. This simmering tension has been brewing since the election, as speculation mounted over how Trump’s policy priorities; lower taxes, stricter immigration controls, higher tariffs, and a push for digital asset integration, would align with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of price stability. Powell’s recent remarks following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting reveal a central bank bracing for a policy environment rife with uncertainty. Powell’s cryptic stance on crypto and policy rates At the FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 25 basis points, as anticipated. Yet, the move was overshadowed by the central bank’s shifting projections. The Summary of Economic Projections now forecasts a 3.9% policy rate by the end of next year, signaling two additional rate cuts. Inflation expectations for 2025 climbed to 2.5%, while uncertainty surrounding inflation projections surged, with a broader range of potential outcomes. Powell addressed these projections cautiously, attributing part of the uncertainty to the impact of Trump’s potential tariffs and other economic policies. “We don’t know when we will face that question,” Powell stated, emphasizing the Fed’s focus on studying how tariffs could drive inflation. However, he conceded that some FOMC members had tentatively factored in the possible effects of Trump’s policies, likening the situation to “driving on a foggy night.” While Powell’s comments seem measured, critics argue that they betray a political bias. By incorporating speculative estimates of Trump’s economic agenda into their forecasts, the Fed may have overstepped its neutral role, a criticism Trump and his camp have been more than blithe to exploit. Crypto at the crossroads: No strategic reserve? We can’t ignore the big elephant in the room, a particularly contentious issue: Trump’s suggestion to build a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the Fed is “not allowed to own Bitcoin.” #JeromePowell #FED #FOMC #InterestRates pic.twitter.com/Atq66Kl5VY — Crypto Seth 🌿 🦄 (@waleefin) December 19, 2024 In a press briefing yesterday, Powell dismissed the idea outright, stating, “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin,” while reiterating that any legal changes to permit such a reserve would require Congressional approval. The comments triggered a pullback in Bitcoin prices, which had rallied sharply post-election amid optimism over Trump’s crypto-friendly agenda. Bitcoin price dips. Source: CoinMarketCap Powell’s skepticism echoes the Fed’s broader caution toward digital assets, and we all know that Trump does not share the same sentiment. The chairman has consistently opposed the idea of federal involvement in cryptocurrencies, framing it as a matter best left to Congress. This cautious stance places Powell at odds with Trump, who sees digital currencies as a tool for innovation and economic growth. We have to wait to see if it is a divide that could further strain the relationship between the White House and the central bank. Make no mistake about it: Bitcoin has been around for more than a decade, and if he didn’t support it before, Fed chair Jerome Powell would never go pro-crypto. Trump’s frustration with Fed independence The conflict is not limited to crypto policy. Trump has a long history of criticizing Powell’s leadership, accusing the Fed of being “political” and suggesting that its rate cuts were timed to benefit electoral outcomes. Despite his criticisms, Trump has also voiced frustration that Powell’s rate cuts did not go far enough, highlighting his desire for more influence over monetary policy. “I feel the president should have at least a say in there,” Trump declared in August, arguing that his business acumen made him better qualified to guide rate decisions than Fed officials. This perspective further outlines Trump’s broader ambition to reshape the central bank’s independence, a move Powell has publicly opposed. “Independent central banks typically have lower inflation,” Powell said in September, defending the existing institutional framework. He stressed the importance of insulating monetary policy from political influence, calling it “a good institutional arrangement” that benefits the public. Political overreach or necessary reform? Trump’s assertion that the Fed should consult him on interest rate decisions raised eyebrows across the political spectrum. Critics warn that undermining the Fed’s independence could destabilize financial markets and erode public trust in monetary policy. Yet, Trump’s supporters, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk , argue that his push for greater oversight reflects legitimate concerns about a central bank they perceive as out of touch with Main Street. The tension between Trump and Powell is simply a battle over who has the power to shape economic policy. Powell insists that the Fed is committed to price stability, even as it invites accusations of political bias. On the other hand, Trump’s more aggressive, interventionist stance echoes his belief in the need for a radical rethinking of monetary policy. The stakes are undoubtedly high for both men. It could go two ways: A constructive dialogue or an outright confrontation about whose policies are the “best for America.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jerome-powell-fed-switch-to-trump-new-tone/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37835949.jpeg

This shift has occurred through two key avenues: first, the integration of bitcoin into public balance sheets as a treasury asset, and second, the success of U.S. spot-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have amassed over 1 million BTC.  A report from K33 Research reveals that U.S.-listed bitcoin ETFs have surpassed U.S.-listed Gold ETFs in terms of assets under management (AUM), including leveraged products such as futures-based ETFs. As of Dec. 17, Bitcoin ETFs reached assets under management (AUM) worth $129.25 billion, edging out Gold ETF AUM at $128.88 billion, according to Vetle Lunde, analyst at K33 Research.  However, when comparing spot-based products exclusively, Gold remains slightly ahead. According to Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, U.S. bitcoin spot ETFs hold $120 billion in AUM compared to $125 billion for Gold ETFs.  CME activity remains strong  The CME exchange, primarily used by institutions, continues to have strong activity, with futures open interest approaching new highs, with 212,635 BTC in open interest contracts.  According to the report, the basis trade premium has continued to rise, reaching 16.4% — the highest level since November 2023. This indicates that CME traders anticipate increased momentum as the year comes to a close.  The report notes, ""January contracts are trading at sharp premiums relative to December contracts, with the contango widening to 1.5% on Monday — the highest next-month premium recorded since November 2023. The December contract on CME remains the most valuable, with open interest equivalent to 113,480 BTC. The upcoming December roll is expected to be significant, as several upcoming banking holidays may contribute to a further widening of the January premium.""  The momentum has continued for the past month, as the U.S. spot-listed bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows every day since Nov. 27, totaling $6.5 billion, according to Farside data. It is important to note that as the basis trade premium continues to widen and with a growing amount of open interest contracts on the CME, a large portion of these net inflows are part of the cash and carry trade.

Ever since the BTC price rose above the consolidation around $102K towards the ATH, whales intensified their activity while raising their holdings. In the last few days, whales were seen buying two tokens, Polygon and Ethena, soon after the BTC price breached above the zone. According to the data from Santiment, the whales have accumulated over 36.65 million Ethena and over 40 million Arbitrum over the past week. These accumulations were recorded by the wallets holding between 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 ARB or ENA tokens. In the meantime, the price of ENA has maintained a consistent upswing, while the ARB price continues to plunge. After the latest reversal in the price of ENA, the bulls have been constantly failing to defend the support levels. However, they are trying hard to prevent the price from breaking below the support zone between $0.83 and $0.79 as the sell-offs continue to accumulate. Besides, the MACD validates a rise in the buying pressure while the supertrend has turned bearish, indicating a breach below the levels could be imminent. Apart from these, whale activity over other platforms also rose, but unfortunately, they sold their holdings instead of buying. Polygon (POL) has witnessed a massive sell-off, mainly led by the whales holding between 10M and 100M, which have sold over 80 million POL in the last 48 hours. This is feared to push the MATIC price into a short-term dip or else a major trend could be expected for the POL price rally. The current trade setup of POL suggests the price is in extreme danger of losing another 15% before the end of the year. The price is testing the neckline of the head & shoulder pattern and a breakdown from here may lead to an extended bearish action below $0.45. Meanwhile, the RSI has turned bearish with the base & conversion line of Ichimoku clouds undergoing a bearish crossover, validating the bearish claim. However, if the price manages to sustain within the zone between $0.49 and $0.51, the bearish narrative could be squashed for a while.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ARB | ENA,ALTCOIN | BTC | TRADING | ARB | ENA,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/whale-activity-increases-among-these-altcoins-are-they-preparing-for-a-mega-altseason/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is trading between $0.36 and $0.46, showing stability amid market fluctuations. Over the past week, the price has dipped by 2.81%, but it has gained 4.58% in the last month. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 36.39, nearing oversold levels, which could hint at a potential bullish reversal. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $0.38 and $0.40 respectively, suggesting consolidation. Bulls are focusing on the nearest resistance at $0.51. If the price breaks above this level, it could climb toward the next resistance at $0.616, representing a significant increase from current levels. This move could mean a rise of over 30%. On the downside, if the price falls, it may find support at $0.31 or even $0.21. With a 6-month gain of over 200%, Dogecoin has shown strong growth. As the crypto market anticipates an altcoin season, traders are watching to see if Dogecoin can push higher. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading between $0.00002396 and $0.00003200. In the past week, the price has dipped by about 6%, but over the last month, it has gained 3%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 34.51, indicating that SHIB is approaching oversold conditions. The Stochastic oscillator is at 23.71, which also suggests potential undervaluation. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $0.00002572, slightly below the 100-day SMA of $0.00002704, pointing to short-term bearish momentum. Despite recent declines, SHIB may be setting up for a rebound. The nearest resistance level is $0.00003614. Breaking above this could see SHIB targeting the second resistance at $0.00004418, which would be an increase of around 50% from current levels. With a 6-month price increase of over 41% and positive market sentiment for altcoins, SHIB could experience further growth in the upcoming altcoin season. Conclusion While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are popular, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by combining sports and memes, aiming for massive growth in the current bull run.

The Solana ecosystem has been witnessing rapid growth and evolution, with demand for scalability, performance, and real-time capabilities reaching new heights. This growth is driven not only by traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) applications but also by the rise of emerging sectors like GameFi (gaming on blockchain) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). In response to these expanding needs, Marinade Finance, a prominent self-custodial staking protocol on the Solana network, has made a strategic investment in SuperSol, the first native Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana. Marinade enables SOL holders to automatically delegate their tokens to top-performing validators in a competitive open marketplace, optimizing yields by allowing validators to share fees directly with stakers. Strengthening Solana’s Infrastructure for a New Era SuperSol, designed to significantly enhance Solana’s scalability and performance, aims to address the growing demand for efficient and reliable infrastructure that can support the next wave of decentralized applications (dApps). With a primary focus on sectors such as GameFi, which combines gaming with decentralized finance, and DePIN, which utilizes decentralized networks for physical infrastructure, SuperSol is poised to become a critical component in the future of the Solana blockchain. The investment by Marinade Finance is seen as a crucial move to help SuperSol accelerate its development and adoption. By supporting innovations like SuperSol, Marinade is positioning itself at the forefront of the efforts to improve Solana’s Layer-1 and Layer-2 capabilities, ensuring that the network can handle the next generation of dApps and meet the increasing demand for high-performance, low-cost, and scalable solutions. The Role of Marinade Finance in the Solana Ecosystem Founded in 2021, Marinade Finance has quickly established itself as one of the most prominent players in the Solana ecosystem. The platform allows users to automatically stake SOL tokens, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, while receiving mSOL, a liquid staking derivative. mSOL allows users to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity, enabling them to participate in other DeFi activities without locking their assets. Through this innovative approach to staking, Marinade Finance has significantly contributed to the overall growth and decentralization of the Solana network.

Its decision to invest in SuperSol is in line with its long-term vision to support projects that aim to improve Solana’s scalability and bring real-world use cases to life. SuperSol: A Key Enabler for the Future of GameFi and DePIN The main challenge facing blockchain networks like Solana has always been the need to scale in a way that maintains high throughput while minimizing costs. Solana’s high-speed and low-cost architecture has made it a popular choice for developers, but as adoption grows and more applications are built on the network, there is an increasing need for solutions that can handle even more transactions without compromising performance. This is where SuperSol comes into play. SuperSol is a Layer-2 scaling solution that builds on top of Solana’s existing architecture to offer increased scalability and enhanced performance. By utilizing SuperSol, developers will be able to create more efficient applications, particularly in GameFi and DePIN - two sectors experiencing explosive growth.

By investing in projects like SuperSol, Marinade is positioning itself as a key player in the infrastructure and scalability efforts that will shape the future of blockchain technology. The collaboration between Marinade Finance and SuperSol is a testament to the growing synergies within the Solana ecosystem. As Solana continues to attract developers and projects across a variety of sectors, the combination of robust staking solutions and scalable infrastructure will be key to meeting the demands of an increasingly complex and diverse decentralized economy. Looking Ahead: Solana’s Continued Evolution As Solana’s ecosystem matures, the need for effective Layer-2 scaling solutions will only become more pressing. SuperSol’s focus on improving Solana’s real-time performance and scalability will help address these challenges head-on, making Solana an even more attractive option for developers and users alike. The strategic investment by Marinade Finance signals confidence in SuperSol’s vision and the potential impact it will have on the network. It also highlights Marinade’s commitment to not only providing liquidity solutions through its liquid staking protocol but also actively contributing to the broader development of Solana’s infrastructure.

Thanks to the introduction of a MetaMask Snap – the name for the mini-apps that extend the wallet’s utility – millions of users can now access EOS without needing to change their web3 setup. With its 30 million active users, MetaMask’s EOS integration is a big deal for the revitalized smart contract network. EOS Gains the Original Web Wallet The fox, as MetaMask is affectionately known, is the browser extension wallet where many crypto users first learned the ropes, starting with the DeFi summer of 2020 when Uniswap was fresh out the gates and a world of onchain opportunities was waiting to be discovered. Today, both MetaMask and EOS are undergoing something of a renaissance, which makes the integration of the latter into the former feel appropriate. Greymass, a key contributor to the EOS ecosystem, is responsible for launching the EOS Wallet as a MetaMask Snap that allows users to seamlessly interact with EOS-based dapps. With MetaMask boasting tens of millions of active users, the integration should significantly boost the number of web3 natives exploring EOS, which now lies just a couple of clicks away. Why MetaMask Still Matters MetaMask has long been the go-to wallet for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains, offering users a secure and user-friendly way to manage their crypto assets and interact with dapps. Its browser extension and mobile app make it one of the most convenient wallets for users getting to grips with the onchain universe. The wallet’s innovative Snaps feature extends its compatibility to non-EVM blockchains including Bitcoin, Solana, and now EOS. This modular architecture allows developers to build plugins such as the EOS Wallet, expanding MetaMask’s capabilities and bringing new ecosystems into its fold. By integrating with MetaMask, EOS gains direct exposure to this sizable user base, creating new opportunities for adoption and engagement. EOS Keeps on Trucking The EOS Wallet, developed by Greymass, enables users to create EOS accounts, sign transactions, and interact with the network through MetaMask. New users can start their journey on Unicove, the official portal for the EOS Wallet, where they can manage their accounts, stake EOS, and participate in the RAM market. The wallet has been audited by Cure53, a leading cybersecurity firm approved by MetaMask for Snap audits. This ensures that users can interact with EOS confidently knowing their assets are secure. For developers, meanwhile, tools like the MetaMask Wallet Plugin and Wharf make it easier to integrate EOS connectivity into dapps, unlocking broader functionality and expanding user access. While the MetaMask integration is a boon for EOS Network, it’s also good news for MetaMask users, who are understandably hesitant to install multiple web wallets, complete with the complexities this adds in terms of key management. For MetaMask users, the EOS release is an invitation to explore a network designed for scalability, efficiency, and near-zero fees. For EOS, it’s a chance to showcase its potential to millions of new users. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At this point, BinanceUS, the US arm of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, said that it aims to restart USD services in early 2025 in the face of expected changes in US cryptocurrency policy. The announcement comes after regulatory pressure in the US forced the exchange to suspend fiat trading last year. BinanceUS suspended dollar deposits and withdrawals in June 2023 as a result of the SEC's lawsuits and has been operating with restricted banking access since then. “I can't yet give a firm launch date for USD trading to resume, but let me be clear: It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,” interim CEO Norman Reed said in a statement. BinanceUS said that despite regulatory hurdles, the company has maintained stable operations despite the investigation it faces over compliance and alleged financial violations. The CEO said in his statement that despite Binance.US’s restrictive activities and investigations, it continued to support 160 cryptocurrencies and provide staking services for more than 20 assets during this period, which is much more than its closest competitors. The CEO noted that BinanceUS survived the SEC’s 17-month investigation, which included numerous depositions and hundreds of document requests, and that he was confident that the SEC could not find any evidence of wrongdoing on the exchange’s part. “Now that we are alive, our goal is to help crypto thrive and provide freedom of choice to all Americans.” *This is not investment advice.

The altcoins suffered even more, with massive price drops from the likes of XRP, AVAX, DOGE, LINK, and many, many others. BTC’s Crash Bitcoin’s price movements ahead of yesterday’s crash were highly positive as the asset had added more than fourteen grand from December 10 until December 17. This resulted in soaring past $100,000 and going all the way up to just over $108,000 to register its latest all-time high. Then, all eyes turned to the US Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting, which took place yesterday. Although the central bank indeed cut the interest rates as expected by 25 basis points, Jerome Powell made a couple of statements that pushed the entire crypto market south. First, he noted that the central bank might stop reducing the rates next year. He disputed Trump’s promise that the US could start buying BTC, saying that this might not be possible. As a result, bitcoin’s price tumbled hard. It had already retraced to $105,000 after the latest peak but dumped even more to just under $99,000 as the day progressed. Although it has managed to recover some ground and now sits above $101,000, it is still more than 2% down on the day. Its market capitalization has declined to $2.010 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has exploded to 54.6%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 19.12.2024. Source: TradingView Alts in Deep Red State The alternative coins plummeted even more during the market-wide correction, with numerous double-digit price drops from the top to their respective bottom. Many have recovered some ground but are still deep in the red, such as XRP , DOGE, ETH, ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, DOT, XLM, BCH, CRO, and others. According to Santiment, four of them have a good chance to bounce off and mark some impressive gains. Still, the total crypto market cap dumped from over $3.950 trillion two days ago to under $3.6 trillion during the lows yesterday evening. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): A DOGE-Inspired Token on the Ethereum Network Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that originated as a meme token in 2020. Created by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it operates on the Ethereum blockchain, which allows compatibility with decentralized applications. Initially launched with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Vitalik Buterin, who donated a portion to a Covid relief fund and burned 40%, reducing circulating supply. SHIB is part of an ecosystem that includes features like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans for NFTs and decentralized governance. Its Ethereum-based infrastructure provides it with broader use cases compared to Dogecoin, potentially increasing its appeal depending on market trends and utility growth. PEPE Memecoin and Its Growing Popularity PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency based on the Pepe the Frog meme. It runs on the Ethereum network and has no transaction taxes or real utility, staying true to its memecoin nature. Released with inspiration from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, it reached a $1.6 billion market cap in 2023. PEPE uses a burning mechanism to reduce supply and rewards long-term holders for stability. The team plans to expand through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. Its ERC-20 structure benefits from Ethereum’s security. Available on platforms like Binance and Uniswap, PEPE has attracted a strong fan base and remains a simple but notable option in the current memecoin market trend. Floki: A Meme Coin with Expanding Utility and Global Reach Floki started as a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog name in 2021. It has since grown into a project with real-world uses and global goals. Its ecosystem includes an NFT metaverse game called Valhalla and the DeFi platform FlokiFi. Partnerships like NOWPayments enable FLOKI tokens for actual transactions, supported by a prepaid Floki Card. The project also focuses on charity by funding schools in places like Laos and Nigeria. Floki has earned attention for its diverse efforts and was listed by The Economic Times as a top meme coin. Its expanding scope and use cases may make it an attractive option in the current market. BONK: A Community-Driven Solana Memecoin BONK is a Solana-based memecoin featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It seeks to redistribute influence from venture capital-backed tokens to the Solana community. Half of BONK’s initial supply was given to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi platforms. After being listed on Coinbase, BONK’s value surged over 100%, making it the third-largest memecoin by market cap in December 2023. Its adoption extends to decentralized apps, including BonkSwap, a new decentralized exchange. While its vast supply and memecoin volatility present challenges, BONK’s strong integration into Solana’s ecosystem and extraordinary rise of over 10,000% in 2023 highlight its potential appeal in this market cycle. Conclusion DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for those craving excellence and success. Backed by a 23,700% growth forecast, it aims to redefine market dominance. Unlike PEPE, FLOKI, BONK, and SHIB, which show limited short-term potential, DOGEN is crafted for winners. With a bold community and exclusive rewards, it’s primed for extraordinary gains this altcoin season.

Table of Contents Shiba Inu poised to skyrocket by 1,700% Ethereum trades in rectangular pattern Intel Markets unleashes AI-powered trading platform In summary Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second largest meme coin in terms of market cap, may soon be the next meme token to skyrocket, according to analysts. Meanwhile, whales have been accumulating Ethereum (ETH) and a new AI coin called Intel Markets (INTL) . While ETH looks set for a new ATH, INTL has outperformed many top altcoins in the market, giving investors up to 700% returns on their investments. Shiba Inu poised to skyrocket by 1,700% A top analyst called CRYPTO SHERIFF has said that Shiba Inu could break its previous all-time high price of $0.00008616 in the current bull run. The analyst made this assertion in an X post, arguing that the Shiba Inu coin price surge was inevitable. CRYPTO SHERIFF predicts the value of the memecoin could pump to $0.000085171 in the coming weeks. Another crypto analyst, CryptoELITES, noted the Shiba Inu token could reach $0.0004729 in the current cycle, 1700% up from the current price. The prediction comes at a time when the Shiba Inu crypto is moving in a range-bound price after its meteoric rise in November 2024. At the time, the token rose by about 98% from $0.00001687 to highs of $0.00003343. At the time of writing, however, the token has lost some of these gains. CoinMarketCap shows the value of the Shiba Inu coin has dropped by 6.1% on the weekly chart and 15.1% on the biweekly timeframe. Ethereum trades in rectangular pattern Ethereum , the leading altcoin has been trading in a rectangle channel over the last week after testing and failing to break and hold above the yearly high at $4,093. The Ethereum price could rally toward $4,380 if the price maintains a breakout above this level in the long term. But if the support level near $3,820 is violated, the price of the Ethereum token may drop toward the support level near $3,550. Presently, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Ethereum coin price has small gains of 4.6% and 4.3% on the weekly and biweekly timeframes. Data from Santiment showed Ethereum’s top holders have been bullish. These ones have been accumulating ETH anticipating early bullish signals. The data shows that there are 104 wallets holding more than 100k ETH. Such a build up could form a price rally in the coming weeks.

Traditional wallets often lack safeguards to address real-world coercion scenarios. Addressing this challenge, Deus Wallet introduces a new feature: Duress Mode. This technology, integrated into Deus’s non-custodial framework, provides an added layer of security to help safeguard cryptocurrency assets and user safety in high-risk situations. The Issue: Crypto Security Is More Than Digital While digital security has advanced with multi-signature wallets, biometric authentication, and hardware devices, physical security remains overlooked. Criminals have adapted their tactics, targeting crypto holders. Considering Real-Life Examples: 2022, London: Criminals broke into a businessman’s home and extorted $1.1 million in Bitcoin at gunpoint. 2023, New York: A crypto trader was kidnapped and forced to transfer $400,000 while held captive. 2021, Bangkok: A prominent investor managing millions in crypto was ambushed by an international gang and coerced into transferring $2.7 million. In each case, victims lacked the tools to mitigate risks under pressure. Standard wallets provide no “last line of defense” for these real-world threats. Deus Wallet: Next-Level Protection Deus Wallet tackles this vulnerability with its non-custodial structure and Duress Mode. This approach allows users to retain full control over their assets while incorporating an additional security measure designed to address specific risks. Non-Custodial Goal With Deus, private keys are stored exclusively by the user, not on any centralized server. This eliminates third-party risks such as hacking, insider theft, or regulatory overreach. In an era where centralization poses increasing threats, non-custodial wallets offer unparalleled independence and security. Duress Mode was developed with one goal: to protect users in life-threatening situations. The way it works: Duress PIN Configuration: Setting a secondary PIN during wallet setup. Under Coercion: Entering the Duress PIN instead of the regular one. Seamless Decoy: The wallet opens a “fake” account with minimal or no funds, while users’ actual assets remain hidden. This feature ensures that attackers see what appears to be the entire wallet balance, without ever suspecting the existence of hidden funds. Deus Wallet is part of a growing movement to rethink cryptocurrency security. As the crypto ecosystem matures, protecting users in both digital and physical spaces is becoming more important. The Bigger Picture: Rising Crypto Adoption: As cryptocurrencies enter mainstream finance, the average user profile shifts from tech-savvy enthusiasts to general consumers, many of whom lack advanced security awareness. Criminal Adaptability: Criminals exploit the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions, knowing that once assets are transferred, they’re nearly impossible to recover. The Security Gap: While solutions like hardware wallets protect against cyber threats, tools like Duress Mode address the issue of physical security. Deus Wallet is at the forefront of this shift, setting a new standard for protecting users and their assets.

Wrapped bitcoin is a form of the world's largest cryptocurrency that can be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) on blockchains other than Bitcoin.  Coinbase introduced cbBTC in September, and in November said it would delist WBTC, citing its listing standards. That action prompted BiT Global, a custodian involved in WBTC, to sue the crypto exchange to prevent the removal. A court ruled against BiT Global on Wednesday.  There's one more link in the chain: Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain and one of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2024. In its defense, Coinbase cited BiT Global's links to Sun, who has been  accused of fraud and market manipulation in the U.S., as an ""unacceptable risk."" Sun, who denies the accusations, also became an adviser to World Liberty Financial, a position he gained after picking up a $30 million stake in the platform last month in exchange for WLFI tokens.  World Liberty Finance has not explicitly stated its decision to swap the tokens. On-chain data shows it has been active in the market in the past week, picking up millions of dollars worth of Aave (AAVE), Chainlink's LINK and Ethena's ENA tokens, all companies related to it through partnerships or integrations.  Sun has little to do with WBTC directly. In August, BitGo, the original and longtime custodian of the bitcoin backing WBTC, said it would distribute control over the project's custody to three entities globally (including BiT Global) instead of just one to help decentralize the operation.  BiT Global is registered as a Trust and Company Service Provider (TCSP) in Hong Kong and is a ""strategic partnership between BitGo, Justin Sun, and the Tron ecosystem,"" according to the August release.  Sun has no direct or indirect involvement on the cap table of those companies or the listed shareholders of BiT Global, board member Robert Liu said in an October interview  Some board members believe Sun’s involvement is actually “good for WBTC,” he said, given the success of Tron, crypto exchange HTX and other businesses.  “The Tron blockchain has more than 50% of global market share,” Liu said. “They have the highest turnover rate. So people have no issue putting more than $60 billion of the stablecoin assets circulating on Tron blockchain.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | LINK | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/19/trump-backed-world-liberty-financial-swaps-its-cbbtc-for-wbtc-after-sun-joins-as-adviser,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45508d8fdc6434c9e5ed2ca39987c81b192aec84-2636x1524.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This decline followed the US Federal Reserve’s announcement that it plans to significantly reduce easing measures in 2025. In the past 24 hours, the broader crypto market has also seen over $780.24 million in liquidations. Fed’s hawkish shift surprises markets, driving crypto and stock declines The US Federal Reserve announced that it plans to significantly reduce easing measures in 2025. The Fed proceeded with a 25-basis point rate cut as expected. However, the updated dot plot, a chart showing rate projections from individual Fed members, indicated a 50-basis point increase. This caught markets off guard, which had earlier anticipated a 100-basis point reduction in 2025. The shift spooked markets, sending the 10-year US Treasury yield and the US dollar spiked sharply while cryptocurrencies and stocks took a severe beating. During his press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said : “It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.” ~ Jerome Powell Bitcoin is presently trading at $101,393 after paring some losses. Altcoins drop as Bitcoin faces headwinds from Powell’s comments Apart from Bitcoin several altcoins also experienced a significant drop on Wednesday, with Ether plunging 6.5% and XRP falling 12.64%. The GMCI 30 index, which measures the performance of the top 30 cryptocurrencies, fell 7.18% in the last day. Bitcoin’s latest rally has been propelled by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump reaffirming his commitment to establishing a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Adding to the bullish sentiment states such as Texas, Pennsylvania, and Florida have established bills to form state-backed Bitcoin reserves , amplifying optimism among traders. However, Powell said during a news conference on Wednesday that the central bank is not allowed to hold Bitcoin and is “not looking for a law change,” in response to a question on his view on the U.S. government Bitcoin reserve. Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMEX and current CIO of Maelstrom, recently wrote in an article that he anticipates a significant sell-off in the crypto market around Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. He believes investors will begin to recognize the gap between their expectations and the reality of the market. According to Hayes, the market will instantly face the reality that Trump has at best one year to enact any policy changes on or around January 20th. He noted that this realization will trigger a sharp sell-off in crypto and other Trump 2.0 equity trades.

Trump warns BRICS countries of harsh consequences if they reject the U.S. dollar. Experts fear Trump’s duties could disrupt global trade and hurt the U.S. economy. The ongoing battle between the BRICS nations and President-elect Donald Trump over the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade intensifies as both sides brace for potential economic impacts.

In response, Trump has issued a strong warning, threatening 100% tariffs on goods from these countries if they proceed with alternative financial systems. Russia Defends BRICS Strategy Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov addressed Trump’s threats, asserting that BRICS is not trying to challenge the U.S. dollar directly but instead reacting to U.S. economic policies. In an interview with Tass , Ryabkov explained that the bloc’s actions result from Washington’s decisions, destabilizing the global financial system.

Emerging projects like Solana-based Fartcoin are also attracting the attention of traders after it defied the recent market slump. However, other projects face regulatory scrutiny. Ritardio was recently flagged by the UK's FCA for its unauthorized promotions. Meanwhile, a parody account turned meme coin profits into a $69,000 donation to Save the Children. Meme Coins Gaining Momentum in Global Crypto Holdings A recent survey that was conducted by Binance revealed that meme coins surpassed Bitcoin as the most-held cryptocurrency among users worldwide. The survey was released on Dec. 18 as part of the Binance Global User Survey, and the findings show that 16% of respondents reported holding meme coins, while 14.44% hold Bitcoin. The survey included more than 27,000 participants from various regions, including Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Binance noticed that the popularity of meme coins is not limited to current holdings but extends to their future potential as well. Although the survey did not reveal the value of respondents’ holdings, data from CoinGecko estimates the total market capitalization of meme coins to be around $117 billion. Among these, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still a leader, trading at $0.362. Bitcoin’s market cap is higher than $2 trillion, and is trading at $101,000. Survey main takeaways (Source: Binance ) The survey also indicated that there is growing optimism for 2025. Some respondents predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) tokens and meme coins will be among the top drivers of market growth. AI tokens led with 23% of respondents favoring their growth potential, while 19% expressed more confidence in meme coins’ market value rising in the coming year. Google search trends also echoed this interest, and show a peak in searches for ”meme coin” earlier in December. It also reached higher search volumes than ”Bitcoin” during the same period. 30d search volume for ‘meme coin’ (Source: Google ) Interestingly, 45% of the Binance survey participants joined the crypto space in 2024, with nearly one-third engaging in regular trading. Despite their speculative nature and lack of utility, meme coins still gained a lot of traction. Experts speculated about the possibility of a meme coin supercycle, despite some critics comparing their trajectory to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), both of which experienced dramatic rises before very sharp declines. Whether meme coins actually sustain their momentum or face a similar fate is still up for debate. Fartcoin Defies Market Slump Its not only the larger and more popular meme coins attracting the attention of investors. Fartcoin , a Solana-based meme coin with no utility, captured a lot of attention on Dec. 18 by briefly surpassing a $1 billion market cap and defying a broader altcoin market slump. Over the past 30 days, the token surged by over 250%, which made it an an outlier even as the crypto market faced pressure from the Federal Reserve's announcement of a 25-basis-point rate cut. Fartcoin all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Between 8:20 pm and 9:00 pm UTC on Dec. 18, Fartcoin’s price jumped by about 21% to $1.02, which pushed up its market cap to $1.02 billion. However, the rally was short-lived as the coin retraced 16% in hours, bringing its price to $0.83 and its market cap to $838.4 million. At press time, Fartcoin was trading hands at $1.01 after its price again managed to climb by over 20% in the past 24 hours. Despite this volatility, the rise sparked some very humorous reactions across social media. Investor Brandon Beylo commented that “the funniest possible outcome is usually the most likely.” Liquidity Capital’s founder joked about hedge fund managers underperforming against teenagers trading the token in their parents' basements. Fartcoin’s two-month trading history has been riddled with extreme volatility. Since its launch on Oct. 24, the token has fluctuated widely. Some market analysts speculated on the implications of these movements. Unlimited Funds co-founder Bob Elliot commented that Fartcoin’s parabolic rise could signal that monetary policy is still less restrictive than intended. Others like Syncracy Capital’s Daniel Cheung suggested that the current market cycle may offer prolonged “buy the dip” opportunities. The broader market, meanwhile, saw painful losses. Tokens like Dogwifhat (WIF), BONK, and Theta Network experienced double-digit declines. Amid the chaos, some people pointed out that while central banks like the Federal Reserve cannot own Bitcoin, there are no restrictions against owning tokens like Fartcoin. FCA Warns Against Solana-Based Retardio Project Things are not going as well for other meme coin projects. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a warning about the Solana-based Retardio project due to concerns over unauthorized financial promotions targeting UK consumers. On Dec. 16, the FCA stated that the project may be offering or promoting financial services without regulatory approval. The watchdog also reminded consumers to interact only with FCA-authorized firms for adequate protection. The Retardio project features a Solana-based NFT collection that reportedly achieved $31 million in lifetime sales, alongside its associated meme coin trading under the ticker “Retardio.” The token is valued at around $0.07, and holds a market cap of close to $73 million, according to Dexscreener. Retario price action over the past week (Source: CoinGecko ) According to the FCA, UK consumers dealing with Retardio will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or protection under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means that they are unlikely to recover funds if the project collapses. The regulator urged consumers to verify the authorization status of firms through the FCA registry and report unauthorized entities through official channels. In a now deleted response , the Retardio project humorously claimed to have ”issued a warning” against the FCA. Animoca Brands Chairman Yat Siu recently explained in an interview that meme coins represent the value of user attention. Unlike traditional social platforms that obscure the value of user-generated content, meme coins very transparently link market cap to the attention they garner. Siu described meme coins as a tokenized form of attention due to their correlation with user engagement and cultural significance in Web3. Parody Account Turns Meme Coin Profits into Philanthropy A parody X account claiming to represent a former trader donated proceeds from a meme coin inspired by him to charity after the token's value briefly skyrocketed to almost $1 million. The account, named Richard E. Ptardio , received 700 million Richard Ptardio (PTARDIO) tokens on Dec. 17, created through the Solana token creator Pump.fun. The tokens were Initially valued at $53,250, but surged by 1,765% in hours to reach almost $1 million. Despite the windfall, Ptardio distanced himself from the project, and stated that the token was created without his knowledge or consent. After announcing his decision to sell the tokens, he pledged to donate the entire proceeds to Save the Children, a global charity supporting education, health, and other programs for children. While the token's value eventually dropped, Ptardio donated 313.4 Solana, which is worth $69,000, to the organization. It is common for meme coin creators to allocate a portion of their tokens to the people or themes they are inspired by. The account behind Ptardio portrays an older man who spent 35 years trading in London, Hong Kong, and New York before joining the cryptocurrency space in September.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6620/meme-coins-lead-the-pack-as-bitcoin-takes-backseat-in-investor-wallets,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37834818,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395052,1734600617,Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Record Low Could Hit $120K Soon!,"The post Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Record Low Could Hit $120K Soon! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s recent surge to its ATH $108k has caught the attention of investors, especially after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump suggested the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. A major factor driving this surge is the historic drop in exchange reserves, which are now at a record low of 2.4 million BTC. With high demand and limited supply, Bitcoin could soon reach $120K. Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Hit Record Low According to Kripto Baykus, a CryptoQuant analyst, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have been steadily falling throughout 2024, dropping from 3 million in January to a record low of 2.4 million by the end of the year. This decline signals a change in how investors are approaching Bitcoin, especially among institutional investors. Many of these investors are adopting the “hodl” strategy, removing their Bitcoin from exchanges in favor of long-term holding. Baykus notes that this is a sign of confidence in Bitcoin’s future, with institutional players betting on the cryptocurrency’s potential. Potential Risks Ahead While the supply-side trends are bullish, there are some concerns about Bitcoin’s demand. Yonsei Dent, another CryptoQuant analyst, pointed out a divergence in the Coinbase Premium Index, a metric used to track demand in North America. Despite Bitcoin’s price surge, Coinpedia news reported that the Coinbase Premium Index has dropped. This suggests that the recent price surge may not be entirely driven by U.S. demand, raising concerns about the sustainability of Bitcoin’s rally in the medium term. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Bitcoin’s 21M Supply a Lie?

By November, it had soared past $100,000, even hitting a new high above $108,000. With Bitcoin’s supply tightening and demand staying strong, experts believe that Bitcoin could continue to set new price records through the rest of 2024 and into 2025. If the current trends continue, Bitcoin could reach new highs, possibly even hitting $120,000. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37834788,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664772,1734600613,"Sentiment For Ethereum Hits 1-year Low, Analyst Says A Massive Run Is Coming","Sentiment for Ethereum (ETH) has reached its lowest levels in a year as the second-largest crypto by market capitalization struggles to reclaim the $4,000 mark. Despite investors’ sentiment, some analysts suggest that the King of altcoins is about to kickstart its bullish run to new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Peak Between $160,000 And $290,000 If These Historical Patterns Repeat – Report Ethereum Sentiment Drops To Yearly Low According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum social sentiment has hit a one-year low amid its struggle to turn the $4,000 resistance into support. Per the post, this metric reached its most negative levels since December 18, 2023, when ETH was trading around $2,100-$2,200. The analyst pointed out that this is a “classic bullish indicator,” noting that when sentiment hit “rock bottom” a year ago, ETH’s price rallied around 30% in the following weeks. The cryptocurrency climbed to the $2,700 mark by January 12, a key level in ETH’s rally to the March high of $4,093. If Ethereum followed the same pattern, the cryptocurrency could see a jump to the $4,900-$5,000 price range in the next month, potentially turning the next big resistance level into support in the following two weeks. Martinez explained that the crypto’s rally will resume once ETH clears the $4,100 resistance, a level not seen since December 2021. Once this level is recovered, “$6,000 will become a magnet.” After breaking past the $4,000 mark this month, the second-largest crypto has struggled to turn this level into support. Its latest breakout attempt occurred at the start of the week when Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed its previous ATH. While BTC traded above the $107,000 range, Ethereum surged to $4,100 but quickly retraced to $3,900 before seeing a correction to the $3,800 level. Despite the pullback, ETH still registers gains in the weekly and monthly timeframes, recording a 2.3% and 22.6% increase, respectively. Will ETH Break Past $4,000 This Month? Altcoin Sherpa highlighted that ETH is “roughly at the same spot that BTC was at around 70K,” adding that it hasn’t “materially broken this level for years.” In the last three years, ETH has been rejected from the $4,000 level several times but ran to its all-time high (ATH) when it was held in 2021. If it were to mirror Bitcoin’s performance, the cryptocurrency could see a run to its $4,800 ATH before aiming for its first price discovery target of around $5,000. The analyst also noted that December and January are the “best times” for the Altcoin market’s performance. Similarly, Benjamin Cowen previously highlighted that ETH’s pair against BTC is “still following a familiar pattern” where Ethereum historically finds “renewed strength” between December and January.

Trader and analyst Skew warned that breaking past the $4,000 resistance will take “even more buying pressure” as this price has “some massive seller continuously topping up supply.” Lastly, he stated that holding the $3,800 level was key to continuing the rally. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,874, a 2% decline in the daily timeframe.

However, its hawkish tone has negatively impacted the cryptocurrency market . In the last 24 hours, the meme coin market has seen a decline of 9.3%. At the time when various crypto markets were struggling due to the sudden shift in market sentiment, a Solana-based meme coin , Fartcoin, achieved a significant milestone. Dive in for details! Fartcoin’s Record-Breaking Market Cap Fartcoin, a new entrant in the meme coin market, recently achieved an impressive milestone of a $1 billion market cap. The performance helped the meme coin to enter the list of the top ten meme coins by market cap. Now, with a market cap of $1,051,271,885, Fartcoin remains the ninth largest meme coin. This meme coin has experienced an astounding growth of 108.6% in the last seven days; it has outperformed almost all the other top meme coins, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe and Bonk. In the last one hour, it has surged by over 4.9%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Whale Activity Increases Among These Altcoins—Are They Preparing for a Mega-Altseason? , Fartcoin Market Cap: Ups and Downs In late October, the market cap of Fartcoin was just $77,362,059.

37834570,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395046,1734600197,Is Bitcoin’s 21M Supply a Lie? BlackRock’s Controversial Take,"The post Is Bitcoin’s 21M Supply a Lie? BlackRock’s Controversial Take appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After Bitcoin hit an ATH in December the concern related to its Bitcoin has always been known for its fixed supply of 21 million coins. This cap is what makes it unique and valuable, setting it apart from traditional currencies that can be printed endlessly. But now, a video from BlackRock has stirred up questions about whether this limit is truly set in stone. What Did BlackRock Say? In a recent explainer video shared by Michael Saylor, BlackRock highlighted Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a key feature, saying it helps control inflation and maintain value. However, they added a surprising disclaimer: there’s “no guarantee” that the 21 million won’t change. This statement has sparked instant reactions, with some wondering if Bitcoin’s scarcity is really as secure as people think. Critics like Joel Valenzuela even claimed that this could be part of a plan to change Bitcoin’s rules. Can the Total Supply Be Changed? Technically, yes—but it’s not easy. For the 21 million limit to be altered, the Bitcoin community would need to agree on a major change, called a “hard fork.” This would split the network into two versions: one with the original cap and one without it. However, many believe that a Bitcoin without its supply cap wouldn’t be Bitcoin anymore. As Bitcoin developer Super Testnet explained, “The cap defines Bitcoin. Without it, it’s just something else entirely.” The idea of changing the cap often comes down to miners. Miners secure the Bitcoin network and are rewarded with new Bitcoin for their work. But these rewards are halved every four years, and by 2140, all 21 million coins will have been mined. After that, miners will rely only on transaction fees for income. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Record Low Could Hit $120K Soon! , Some worry that this might not be enough to keep miners incentivized in the long run. Removing the cap could ensure miners stay profitable, but it would also disrupt Bitcoin’s core principle of scarcity. So many false statements in just three minutes. Wall Street has really hit a new low with Bitcoin. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 18, 2024 A Look at the Bigger Picture The Bitcoin community has a history of resisting big changes. Back in 2016-2017, miners tried to increase Bitcoin’s block size to improve scalability. Even though 95% of miners supported the idea, the broader community rejected it, showing that Bitcoin’s rules aren’t easily altered. As of now, the 21 million cap is Bitcoin’s unique identity and any change to this can be risky and may bring a wider crypto crash since Bitcoin is on an upward trajectory despite some short-term drops. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37834589,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630133,1734599991,Kevin O’Leary sheds light on why CEOs ‘want to suck up to Trump’,"In recent weeks, Mar-a-Lago has become a “center stage” for America’s corporate elite as CEOs from various industries meet with President-elect Donald Trump. Kevin O’Leary believes most of them are “sucking up to Trump” because the President-elect could create “good times” for businesses. Business leaders have been lining up to connect with DJT, who has framed his return as a pro-business presidency. The pace of these high-profile meetings has accelerated since his election victory over Kamala Harris in early November, with executives keen to build relationships with the incoming administration. Kevin O’Leary, chairman of O’Leary Ventures, weighed in on this surge in CEO activity, suggesting that leaders are motivated by Trump’s pro-business stance and anticipated policies. Speaking on The Evening Edit , O’Leary highlighted two key reasons behind this trend: A stable corporate tax rate of 21% and the promise of deregulation. “ This is a phenomenal platform for Trump. Everybody knows he’s pro-business ,” O’Leary said. “ All of a sudden, CEOs want to suck up to Trump in a very big way because he’s got the power, the mandate, and the reach .” Kevin O’Leary: ‘I’m licking my own chops right now’ In the interview, O’Leary drew attention to the improved economic outlook following Trump’s electoral victory. A recent survey indicates a surge in global economic confidence. This is a stark contrast to concerns during President Joe Biden’s term, which O’Leary criticized for policies that burdened American households. The O’Leary Ventures chairman, popularly known as Mr Fantastic, highlighted the speed at which Trump is addressing economic issues. He described his approach as a reflection of what voters demanded. “ This mandate is going to be way better than the last one, a lot more stable and very good for business, ” O’Leary remarked. “ I’m licking my own chops right now. These are good times .” O’Leary noted that the Republican Party’s control of both chambers of Congress alongside the presidency bolsters confidence among business leaders. A cross-industry pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago Executives from leading companies, including Netflix’s Ted Sarandos and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, have visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Sarandos, a long-time Democratic donor, and Bezos are among the many leaders signaling a willingness to work with the incoming administration, even as they navigate past political divides. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, facing a potential US ban on the popular app, met with Trump earlier this week. Meanwhile, leaders from Apple, Google, and Meta are reportedly seeking a more favorable regulatory environment under the new administration. Moreover, Wall Street executives anticipate a reversal of policies they deemed anti-business under Biden, particularly on taxes and antitrust issues. Trump adviser Jason Miller described these meetings as a “vote of confidence” in the president-elect and his economic policies. “ Some of these CEOs are showing that they will be willing partners in the upcoming administration, even if they have not been politically supportive in the past ,” Miller said. He added that many more domestic and international CEOs are expected to follow suit. Despite their enthusiasm, corporate leaders harbor reservations about some aspects of Trump’s agenda, including potential sweeping tariffs and changes to manufacturing subsidies. However, executives see Trump as a dealmaker who responds well to flattery and engagement, making it a pragmatic choice to foster relationships rather than risk public rebukes. Nikki Haley, a former Republican presidential candidate and now vice-chair at consultancy Edelman, urged CEOs to embrace the opportunity to engage with Trump. “ It’s good to let him know what you’re working on, how you’re growing business ,” Haley said, emphasizing the value of face time with the president-elect. “ I’m not talking to any CEOs that are fearful of Trump, ” she added. Corporate America’s efforts to align with the incoming administration extend beyond meetings. Companies like OpenAI , along with financial institutions such as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, are contributing to Trump’s inauguration, signaling extensive support from the business community.

37834435,https://crypto.news/?p=14320648,1734599903,Binance Coin traders are exploring Lightchain AI’s potential for big gains,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Amid the bull market, Binance Coin holders are turning to Lightchain AI for its smart fusion of AI and blockchain, as well as its massive growth potential. Table of Contents Binance Coin, a trusted giant in the crypto market Why Binance Coin traders are eyeing Lightchain AI Why LCAI could be the biggest opportunity of 2024/2025 Lightchain AI has the potential to be bigger than BNB Binance Coin (BNB) has long been a favorite among traders for its utility and consistent growth within the Binance ecosystem. However, growing interest is now shifting toward Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a cutting-edge platform merging blockchain with artificial intelligence. Offering features like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI stands out for its decentralized AI solutions. With the Lightchain AI Presale ongoing at $0.003, traders are seizing the opportunity for massive gains as LCAI positions itself for 2025 success. Binance Coin, a trusted giant in the crypto market Binance Coin, introduced in 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), has become integral to the Binance ecosystem. Initially launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, BNB transitioned to Binance’s own blockchains: the BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain. Tokenomics BNB’s total supply was capped at 200 million tokens. Binance implements a quarterly Auto-Burn mechanism to reduce supply, aiming to burn 50% of the total supply, leaving 100 million BNB in circulation. This deflationary model is designed to increase scarcity and potentially enhance value over time. Roadmap BNB’s evolution includes expanding its utility beyond fee reductions on the Binance exchange. It now powers the BNB Chain ecosystem, facilitating decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and various DeFi platforms. Future developments focus on enhancing scalability, interoperability, and decentralization to support large-scale applications like SocialFi, GameFi, and the Metaverse. BNB’s consistent performance, strategic tokenomics, and integration into a robust ecosystem have solidified its status as a trusted giant in the crypto market. Why Binance Coin traders are eyeing Lightchain AI Binance Coin traders are increasingly turning their attention to Lightchain AI due to its fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, offering significant growth potential. LCAI has a total supply of 10 billion tokens, strategically allocated to ensure sustainability, equitable distribution, and long-term value for its ecosystem participants. The allocation includes 40% (4 billion tokens) for the presale, 28.5% (2.85 billion tokens) for staking rewards, 15% (1.5 billion tokens) for the liquidity pool, 5% (500 million tokens) for marketing and partnerships, 6.5% (650 million tokens) for the treasury, and 5% (500 million tokens) for team allocation. Lightchain AI plans show its emphasis on creativity and expandability. Significant ͏points in process involve creating͏ model that showcase the͏ Proof ͏of Intelligence ͏(PoI) consensus along with the Artificial Intelligence Vi͏rtual Machine (AI͏VM). After that, there will be trial deployment to involve developer͏ and node operators in practical assessment. The launch of a mainnet will bring key features such as dece͏ntralized AI processing and token based transactions. Fu͏rthermore the roadmap detail strategies for expanding ecosystem by forming important partnerships to promote adoption in different sectors and ͏regions. The ambitious ͏advancements highlights Lig͏htchain AI’s potential as appealing investment possibility for BNB traders searching fresh opportunities͏. For further detail, consult the Lightch͏ain AI whitepaper. You might also like: How Lightchain AI combines AI solutions with blockchain tech Why LCAI could be the biggest opportunity of 2024/2025 Whenever a new token emerges with whispers of 100x or even 500x returns, one question always surfaces. Why should I trust this project? Here’s what makes Lightchain AI (LCAI) stand out. 1. A new consensus mechanism Forget outdated systems like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). Proof of Intelligence (PoI) transforms the game by rewarding meaningful AI computations instead of wasting resources on irrelevant processes. Benefits? Actively contributes to AI development. Energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable. Solves real-world AI challenges rather than consuming resources for nothing. 2. Real-world utility with AIVM Gone are the days of empty promises and zero-use blockchains. The AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) is built to support the next generation of decentralized applications. Designed specifically for AI use cases, such as: Predictive Modeling Natural Language Processing (NLP) Developers are already recognizing AIVM as the go-to platform for groundbreaking AI-driven dApps. In short: it’s not just “smart tech,” it’s a smarter platform. 3. The numbers tell the story A presale price of $0.003 for a project of this magnitude is almost unheard of. Let’s break down the math: $300 investment at $0.003 nets users 100,000 $LCAI tokens. At $1 per token (a realistic 2025 target based on its roadmap), users are looking at a $100,000 return. For perspective, early backers of major players like Solana and Binance Coin saw similarly low entry points explode into fortunes. Lightchain AI is following this trajectory, but with a distinct tech advantage. 4. A robust and transparent roadmap Lightchain AI is not a fleeting project, it’s built for the long haul, with a meticulous roadmap in place. Phase 1 : Prototype development and community expansion. Phase 2 : Testnet launch and fine-tuning for maximum performance. Phase 3 : Mainnet launch, the game-changing moment for mass adoption. Key milestones for 2024 will be pivotal, as the team is already making real progress: Validator nodes are prepped and ready. Testnets are operational. Strategic partnerships with industry leaders are actively in progress. If Lightchain AI delivers even a portion of its ambitious plans, 100x returns will be the floor, not the ceiling. Lightchain AI has the potential to be bigger than BNB Lightchain AI has emerged as a promising project that combines the best of both worlds- artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. With its consensus mechanism, real-world utility through the AIVM, and a solid roadmap in place, it has caught the attention of Binance Coin traders who are seeking new investment opportunities. With a presale price of $0.003 and a projected target price of $1 by 2025, LCAI presents an exciting opportunity for significant returns. Its focus on sustainability and meaningful innovation sets it apart from other projects in the market. Investors looking to diversify their portfolio beyond BNB should keep a close eye on Lightchain AI and join the community to stay updated on its progress.

Ripple has launched its native stablecoin RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and on the Ethereum network. Ripple's launch of RLUSD in the heat of the crypto bull market is an excellent example of leveraging market conditions. For now, the launch of RLUSD does not directly threaten the use case for XRP in the Ripple ecosystem; however, there are hypothetical scenarios in which RLUSD adoption could threaten XRP’s role in the Ripple ecosystem. Ripple USD ( XRP-USD ) has been all the rage since the crypto market got into a bull trajectory, following President Trump's election win and his pro-crypto stance during the campaign. One crypto company to potentially benefit from possible policy shifts in the coming administration is Ripple. Crypto enthusiasts are familiar with Ripple Lab’s long-drawn battle with the U.S. SEC and Gary Gensler’s anti-crypto agenda these past years. Now that Trump has nominated Paul Atkins , a pro-crypto businessman, as the candidate to head the SEC, Ripple will likely see a breadth of fresh air and see its years-long case come to a settlement and a close. RLUSD: A Strategic Addition to the Ripple Ecosystem In a full-blown crypto bull market, like we're beginning to witness, product releases and strategic partnerships that are well-timed can amplify the momentum of the related crypto assets, easily creating double-digit gains for these crypto assets. These well-timed events create sustained catalysts for the crypto asset throughout the bull market. Ripple's launch of its stablecoin , the Ripple USD (RLUSD), in the heat of the crypto bull market is an excellent example of leveraging market conditions. As we’ve been using stablecoins more and more in our flows, that really piqued our interest that we should have our own native stablecoin that can be more cost effective and more operationally efficient to use. Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins. A blockchain network is as strong as the number of users who use it for transactions and other on-chain activities. Ripple’s launch of the RLUSD stablecoin means that Ripple’s blockchain network, the XRP Ledger (“XRPL”), now taps into the $200 billion stablecoin market, and now has access to more users and liquidity. Being a native Ripple product, I believe RLUSD will not struggle to find utility from the get-go. Ripple has facilitated over $70 billion in payments for its enterprise clients, which includes banks and payment service providers, and will now use RLUSD to facilitate such transactions, moving forward. The RLUSD stablecoin was launched on both the Ripple network and on Ethereum. I think it is a smart business move to also launch the token on Ethereum to leverage the Ethereum network's large user base and liquidity pool. Some crypto analysts might perceive the launch of Ethereum - a competing network to XRPL - as counterintuitive and as diluting the focus and use case of XRPL by introducing a competing blockchain, but I see the dual launch as a strategic move. The launch on both blockchain networks opens more use case opportunities for RLUSD. Both the Ethereum network and Ripple’s XRPL network have their unique perks, and I think users will gravitate towards which blockchain to choose for their RLUSD transactions based on the users' specific use case and preference. For instance, DeFi users might prefer using RLUSD on the Ethereum network, while enterprises that offer high-frequency, low-cost payment services, like remittances, may prefer RLUSD on XRPL. Ethereum’s vast DeFi ecosystem and dApps with complex smart contract capabilities are a strength for Ethereum. XRPL’s low fees and fast transactions are strengths for XRPL. However, I feel RLUSD will naturally see more usage on XRPL based on the sheer volume of institutional payments that Ripple processes and Ripple's core focus on cross-border settlements, which XRPL was built from the ground up to handle. Ripple’s efforts to build regulatory-compliant crypto products over the years would pay off here. There has been past scrutiny of stablecoins by regulators, and there have been incidents of stablecoins losing their 1:1 peg to their fiat currency. The TerraUSD (“UST”) stablecoin crash of spring 2022 is one of such depeg cases. There have been recent regulatory actions on stablecoins where Europe-based crypto exchanges have begun delisting a handful of stablecoins , including Tether USD ( USDT-USD ), Gemini Dollar ( GUSD-USD ), Dai ( DAI-USD ), and PayPal USD ( PYUSD-USD ), found not to be compliant with the E.U.’s MiCA regulatory requirements. Ripple’s RLUSD was issued in accordance with the New York State Department of Financial Services stablecoin guidance and will be subject to periodic stringent reporting, including third-party audits of fiat reserves. Based on Ripple’s focus on building institutional and regulatory-compliant crypto products, I believe Ripple will strive to maintain regulatory compliance in other jurisdictions, and RLUSD adoption will expand to those places where other existing stablecoins currently face regulatory restrictions, winning a chunk of the stablecoin market share in the process. RLUSD: A Threat To or a Catalyst For XRP? The launch of RLUSD does not directly threaten the use case for XRP in the Ripple ecosystem. RLUSD is a stablecoin within the ecosystem, while XRP remains a liquidity token. XRP’s use in the Ripple ecosystem has been as an on-demand liquidity (“ODL”) provider in cross-border settlements. When transfers are made in cross-border settlements involving two disparate fiat currencies between a sender and a recipient, XRP serves as a bridge currency or an “interim” currency between the sender and the recipient. The sent currency is first converted to XRP and then converted next to the recipient's local currency. This process allows institutions to carry out cross-border settlements in real-time without needing pre-funding. ODL plays a crucial role in Ripple's cross-border settlement network, and XRP was specifically built and integrated into the XRP ledger to provide such liquidity. XRP has been widely adopted for its role in providing liquidity in the ecosystem over the years. Most institutional partnerships utilizing RippleNet are built around the ODL feature. I see no immediate threats to XRP’s role as a liquidity provider in the Ripple ecosystem. RLUSD and XRP will most likely complement each other in terms of demand. If adoption of RLUSD grows and more cross-border settlements take place on RippleNet, demand for XRP’s as an ODL provider should also surge. It is, however, worth mentioning that the crypto space and its related technologies evolve rapidly, and there are future scenarios that could play out in which RLUSD adoption becomes a threat to XRP’s role in the Ripple ecosystem. For example, a potential threat lies in how well the adoption of RLUSD and the Ripple ecosystem tech stack goes among financial institutions globally. If RLUSD becomes a globally recognized stablecoin, or RippleNet becomes some sort of “standard platform” among financial institutions, and the adoption of RLUSD spreads in key jurisdictions, there could be a workaround in Ripple's tech, whereby the need for XRP’s ODL will erode. This is a hypothetical scenario but shouldn't be ruled out because the crypto world evolves quickly and regulation and adoption are happening at a more accelerated and unpredictable pace. Takeaway Stablecoins have been around long enough, and Ripple's launch of its native stablecoin isn't exactly a jaw-dropping innovation. What is distinctive about RLUSD is Ripple's institutional transaction volume, the payment network, and the institutional partnerships Ripple has built over the years which will benefit RLUSD in terms of adoption. Seeking Alpha I think the launch of RLUSD has already been priced into XRP, as the coin has been on a run since early November, achieving nearly 400% price gain. The crypto market follows the news trader’s idea of “buying the rumor, and selling the news,"" which I think XRP's recent price action has been a reflection of. XRP isn't one of my favorite altcoins at the moment because I think it won't be among the most rewarding crypto assets in this bull season of the market cycle. XRP has had impressive runs in the last two bull markets, especially during the 2017 crypto bull market. However, in the spirit of the current crypto bull market, I'm upgrading my rating for XRP to a “buy” despite my reservations about XRP giving impressive gains moving forward. My rating upgrade to a “buy” is mainly based on the fact that we are in a crypto bull market and going long established crypto assets like XRP is a no-brainer.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745243-ripple-rlusd-stablecoin-impact-on-xrp-crypto-bull-market?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37834388.jpeg

This ‘W’ pattern could send #Xrp to $35 pic.twitter.com/PbYFzPhdyY — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 11, 2024 Technical Chart Formation Reveals Promising Signals Examining the monthly price chart, the analyst identified a W-shaped pattern that spans several years. This formation traces back to the cryptocurrency’s notable price movements between 2017 and 2024 and shows the potential for a massive move in the immediate future. The pattern’s origins can be traced to XRP’s remarkable journey from June 2017, when the asset traded at approximately $0.20, subsequently surging to an all-time high of $3.84 in early 2018. Following this rally, the cryptocurrency experienced significant corrections, dropping to $0.11 in March 2020 before recovering to $1.96 by April 2021. Another substantial market correction occurred in 2022, particularly after the Terra ecosystem’s collapse, which pushed XRP to a low of $0.28 in June of that year. The recent market movements in November 2024 have been interpreted as the completion of this intricate W-shaped technical formation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Projection and Market Expectations Steph’s market analysis suggests XRP could be positioned for a substantial rally to $35. While the projected target might seem ambitious, some market commentators believe it is within the realm of possibility. At its current trading price of $2.34, reaching $35 would represent a massive 1,395.7% increase. This projection has naturally generated considerable debate within the cryptocurrency investment community. Critics argue that such a valuation would inflate XRP’s market capitalization to approximately $1.9 trillion, which they consider highly speculative. Ralston Maximus, another prominent cryptocurrency analyst, recently called out a critic in the crypto community who described XRP’s chances to reach $35 as ridiculous. Other experts have also predicted targets much higher than $35, showing the confidence the most trusted voices in the crypto world have in XRP. XRP’s recent performance has also bolstered the confidence of investors. Although the asset has experienced some volatility over the past 24 hours, it is currently up over 110% from last month, and bullish patterns like the W pattern highlighted by Steph show that this bullish momentum is expected to continue.

According to the results released on December 18, 16% of respondents reported owning meme tokens, compared to 14.44% holding Bitcoin. The survey sampled over 27,000 users across Asia, Australia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Binance commented on the findings, stating, “Memecoins are not only popular in terms of current holdings but also highly anticipated for future growth.” Despite the lack of disclosed wallet values, market data highlights the rising prominence of memecoins, with their total market cap at $117 billion. Leading the pack is Dogecoin, trading at $0.362. In contrast, Bitcoin maintains its dominance in market cap, valued at over $2 trillion, with a trading price of around $101,000 after achieving a record high of $108,000 on Dec. 17. AI Tokens’ Popularity The Binance survey also provided insights into market sentiment heading into 2025. While artificial intelligence (AI) tokens took the lead, with 23% of respondents expecting them to drive market growth, memecoins secured the second spot with 19% optimism for their future value. This sentiment is mirrored in search trends. Google data shows search volumes for “memecoin” peaked at 100 on December 5 before settling at 66 by December 19. Comparatively, “Bitcoin” searches reached a volume of 50, having also peaked at 100 earlier in the month. The survey further revealed that 45% of respondents entered the cryptocurrency space in 2024, with 31% actively engaging in trading. Despite their popularity, memecoins remain hyper-speculative assets with no inherent utility, fueling debates about their long-term viability. Memecoins Set To Maintain Momentum? Industry experts are divided on the future of memecoins. While some predict a possible memecoin supercycle, others draw parallels to previous market trends, such as the boom and bust of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). At Canada’s Futurists conference in August, crypto leaders questioned whether memecoins could sustain their momentum or face a similar fate to these once-booming trends. Nevertheless, the survey results indicate a clear enthusiasm among users for memecoins, suggesting they will remain a central topic in the cryptocurrency landscape heading into 2025.

As a result, market players are turning to a new AI coin as it gears up for an explosive upward move. Let’s find out everything there is to know about this AI coin! Shiba Inu Holders Burn More Than 20 Million Coins: Here’s Why Shibburn, a SHIB burn tracking platform, reported that the Shiba Inu community had burned a massive amount of SHIB tokens during the latest burn move. In the last 24 hours, the community sent over 20 million SHIB to a dead wallet, boosting its burn rate by 1,987%. The Shiba Inu burn activity was accomplished by Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin, a well-known fan of the meme coin. The burning was done in batches, with one transaction involving half the total number of tokens burned. While the daily burn percentage rose, the weekly rate fell. Notably, only 175 million SHIB tokens were burned over the week, culminating in a 92.69% difference from previous weeks. This burn is expected to boost SHIB’s price in the long run, but it remains to be seen if Shiba Inu will react accordingly. Meanwhile, SHIB is down 3.53% to $0.000026 in the last 24 hours. Expert Sets $30 as the Next Target For Polkadot After Successful Price Retest World of Charts, a renowned crypto analyst, has commented on Polkadot’s outlook after DOT successfully retested a key support level. In an X post on December 16, 2024, the analyst suggested that DOT may be gearing up for a rally, pushing the price to $30. The last time Polkadot reached this price level was in 2021, during the bull market, when it peaked at $55. After the bear market hit, DOT entered a stretched-out bearish phase, shedding a significant portion of its market value. DOT has traded within a descending trendline for the last two years, testing lower support levels until bottoming out between $4 and $5 by the middle of 2023. However, Polkadot bounced back from these lows, rising as high as $10 twice this year With DOT on the verge of a rally, it must break resistance at $12 and $14 to begin its journey towards $30. In the meantime, it has gained 1.90% in the last 24 hours to settle at $8.88. Investors Turn to IntelMarkets as Bearish Pressure Mounts With SHIB and DOT bound to the bears, investors are shifting to the new AI coin IntelMarkets (INTL) . INTL is one of the top-performing assets of 2024, boasting a 711% year-to-date (YTD) gain. However, INTL isn’t the only attractive commodity in the IntelMarkets ecosystem. The AI-powered perpetual contracts exchange also has many exciting features under the hood. One of them is its AI-driven trading robots, which traders and investors can employ while trading over 10,000 crypto assets available on the exchange. These bots will enable them to make informed decisions as they diversify and improve their results. Also, with IntelMarkets offering 1,000x leverage, traders and investors can multiply their potential gains on every trade. These offerings and INTL’s profit potential make IntelMarkets the preferred option for SHIB and DOT investors. DOT And SHIB Investors Buy INTL: What to Expect From the AI Coin? Seeing its profit potential, DOT and SHIB investors are repositioning to INTL to recoup losses and amass more gains. The AI coin offers a 100x gain prospect, making it the ideal crypto to buy. INTL is available for $0.073 in Stage 8 of its ongoing public presale. Although early participants have secured over 700% profits, new investors can secure a 50% return on their investments as INTL aims for a launch price of $0.110.

Here Are the Details…","Last night, the final FED interest rate decision for 2024 was announced and a 25 basis point cut was made in line with expectations. However, FED Secretary Jerome Powell's hawkish statements led to a decline in Bitcoin and altcoins. BTC fell below $100,000 but recovered to rise above $100,000 in the early Asian session. Apart from BTC, altcoins such as XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) experienced declines of up to 5.5 percent, while BNB and Ethereum (ETH) experienced relatively less declines. Are Powell's Bitcoin Statements the Reason for the Decline? These declines were triggered by Powell’s hawkish statements as well as his response to a question about whether he would join Donald Trump’s Bitcoin reserve promise. Powell said the Fed does not intend to participate in any government plans to create a strategic bitcoin reserve, and that board members do not intend to amend the Fed law. “That's the kind of thing Congress should consider, but we're not planning to amend the law,” Powell said. Following Powell's statements, Bitcoin and altcoins fell, while leveraged transactions also saw major liquidations. According to Coinglass data, $780 million was liquidated in leveraged transactions in the last 24 hours, $659 million of which was from long positions and $120 million from short positions. While 269,507 investors liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation occurred in an ETH/USDT transaction worth $7.10 million on Binance. Commenting on the FED's interest rate cut and the decline in Bitcoin, LVRG Research analyst Nick Ruck said that Powell was behind the decline. “An interest rate cut would normally be a bullish reaction for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market because it was widely expected, but the market reacted strongly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation would be a continuing problem throughout the next year. Powell also said that the Fed does not intend to participate in any government plans to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. At this point, if the US Bitcoin strategic reserve is no longer among the plans, BTC and cryptocurrencies may have reached their peak. Trump's Bitcoin promise helped fuel the rally that has reached all-time highs in recent months.” Bitcoin continues to trade at $101,395 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

Originally planned for 2025, Ink's debut reflects the overwhelming demand shown through millions of testnet transactions and connected wallets. Ink is built on the Optimism Superchain and focuses on decentralization and interoperability. Kraken plans to begin Stage 1 decentralization in January, introducing permissionless fault proofs to enhance the network’s security and trust. According to Ink founder Andrew Koller, “Today is just the beginning. We’re pushing the boundaries of on-chain experiences to unlock new opportunities for users and builders.” The early launch is credited to significant support from both builders and the community. Kraken’s collaboration with Optimism aims to drive Ethereum scaling, with Ink set to actively participate in Optimism’s governance and support the development of the OP Stack. Ryan Wyatt, Chief Growth Officer at Optimism Unlimited, stated, “Ink’s accelerated launch shows the dedication of its team and the enthusiasm of the developer community. Together, we aim to attract more developers and users to scale Ethereum.” Ink has already gained significant momentum, surpassing 100,000 users after its first announcement. Despite challenges faced by Optimism earlier this year, including price drops in the OP token and ecosystem pressure, Ink’s successful mainnet launch could boost Optimism’s growth and ecosystem synergy. Kraken has faced setbacks recently, including an $8 million fine in Australia and the closure of its NFT marketplace. However, the positive reception of Ink suggests a promising future. Both Kraken and Optimism are optimistic about their partnership, expecting long-term benefits for both platforms. Moving forward, Ink will play a significant role in the Optimism Superchain , dedicating revenue to collective development and strengthening the ecosystem.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | OP,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/kraken-s-ink-blockchain-launches-early-on-mainnet,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37833854.jpeg

In his latest article, Hayes suggests this bold move could help the Treasury quickly generate dollar credits, which could then be used to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ). He believes this approach would strengthen the economy and secure the U.S.’s position as a global financial leader. Hayes argues that devaluing gold could inject significant funds into the Treasury General Account (TGA), bypassing the need for international negotiations to weaken other currencies. Currently, gold is valued at $42.22 per ounce by the Treasury. Hayes suggests that increasing its value to $10,000 or $20,000 per ounce would immediately grow the TGA balance, providing resources to stimulate the economy. According to Hayes, the first 100 days of Trump’s administration offer a limited window to enact impactful policies, including a major gold devaluation. He predicts such a move could happen early in 2025, as it would allow the U.S. to enhance its competitiveness and promote domestic production. Hayes sees this as an opportunity for Trump to achieve swift economic progress and support Republican control of Congress. Creating a Bitcoin reserve, Hayes believes, would also secure the U.S.’s financial dominance. He explains that Bitcoin, often seen as ""hard money"" due to its fixed supply, would further strengthen the nation’s currency if held in significant reserves. Hayes predicts that if the U.S. government used dollars from a gold devaluation to buy Bitcoin , its price would soar, prompting other nations to follow suit in a competitive race for cryptocurrency reserves. Hayes warns, however, that time is a critical factor. The new administration would need to act quickly to show results before mid-term elections in 2026. He cautions that delays or unmet expectations could lead to market disappointment and a sell-off in cryptocurrencies and other Trump-related investments. Other nations, including Russia, Japan , and Canada, have already considered or implemented similar Bitcoin reserve strategies. Hayes highlights the growing interest in cryptocurrency reserves as a global trend that the U.S. cannot afford to ignore. He also notes that Bitcoin ETFs now manage more assets than gold ETFs, reflecting shifting market priorities. While Hayes acknowledges the challenges of implementing such policies, he emphasizes that devaluing gold is the fastest and most practical way to generate funds and stimulate the economy. He concludes that going big early is essential for Trump to make a lasting impact during his term.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/arthur-hayes-urges-trump-to-devalue-gold-and-back-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37833712.jpeg

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

37833532,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630120,1734597643,Michael Egorov address liquidated again just days after his latest Curve (CRV) purchase,"Michael Egorov, founder of Curve Finance, got liquidated again on one of his recent CRV positions. The liquidation comes just days after Egorov made a new CRV purchase to support the price of the sliding token. One of the addresses of Michael Egorov got liquidated after the crypto market had another daily drawdown. The wallet, labeled to belong to the founder of Curve (CRV), was liquidated for 918.83K CRV, valued at above $898K. The liquidation comes after the latest $1.2M buyback from Egorov on December 17. Egorov re-bought at $1.11, after a temporary drawdown for CRV. The repurchase was the first foray of Egorov back into CRV, after suffering a liquidation for $140M on June 13. Egorov warned that the recent position did not actually affect real CRV, but was a technicality to cover the losses from the UwU Lend hack in June. The transaction was used as an on-chain receipt for a loss that Egorov already suffered in the hack. He stated the liquidation was a testimony of the expected repayment from Sifu, the founder of UwU lend. Despite the warning, news of the liquidation had a contagion effect, deepening the CRV losses and leading to additional liquidations. Curve offers soft liquidations, which try to protect the collateral. There are also hard liquidations, as well as self-caused liquidations. Self-liquidation is available for those with positions already in soft liquidation and with diminishing health. The recent drawdown of CRV may have triggered some users to close their positions in the current price range. The project’s founder continues to be an active DeFi user, with swaps between CRV and stablecoins. Transactions from Egorov’s wallet also show outflows of small amounts of stablecoins into DeFi pools and protocols. CRV sinks from yearly peak despite the buyback Egorov rebuys CRV as a tool to prop up sentiment and acquire more tokens at a lower price range. CRV can then be used as collateral to borrow stablecoins for other DeFi tasks. This approach works during favorable marker conditions, but can lead to deep liquidations. Despite the liquidation, CRV still trades near its higher range for 2024. The token peaked at $1.25, later sliding to $0.94 as the entire market had a drawdown. CRV is still down from its 2021-2022 market peak during the previous bull cycle, where the underlying asset traded above $5. Liquidations affected other CRV borrowers, leading to a drawdown of the token’s price. CRV is potentially revisiting lower positions, where active traders may buy again. CRV open interest fell in the past month, from a peak above $260M down to $179M. Long positions are above 60%, still showing some confidence of a price recovery. However, a drawdown can attack and liquidate those positions. Curve Finance is also diminished compared to its influence in the previous DeFi boom. The platform’s liquidations relegated it to a less influential position, displaced by new protocols. Despite this, Curve is an essential part of current DeFi tasks, offering access to liquidity with its specific level of liquidation risk. Curve value locked recovers slightly Curve is still important for the current DeFi space, as it is one of the main markets for Ethena’s sUSDe. The decentralized protocol carries more than 95% of all sUSDe trading activity in four different asset pairs. For now, Curve is still in position 20 based on total value locked. The protocol carries around $2.37B , down from a peak of over $23B during the height of the 2021 bull market. Curve has lost the initial hype after multiple liquidations, and was deeply affected by the 2022 failure of Terra (LUNA).

37833153,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664866,1734597056,Crypto Expert Predicts Major Altcoin Season As Market Cap Eyes Record Levels,"Market expert Lark Davis has recently taken to social media to assert that the much-anticipated altcoin season is far from over despite short-term corrections and challenges the broader crypto market faces. Davis believes that significant opportunities lie ahead for altcoins, particularly as their total market capitalization (excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) hovers around $1.05 trillion. Key Factors For Impending Altcoin Season The expert points out that the current altcoin market cap is nearing its previous high of $1.13 trillion from November 2021. He recalls a similar scenario from February 2021, when the altcoin market cap tested the highs from January 2018 before breaking through. This breakout resulted in an impressive surge from $360 billion in February 2021 to $1.13 trillion by November 2021—an increase of over 200%. Davis firmly believes that once the altcoin market cap surpasses the $1.13 trillion threshold again, we could witness one of the largest altcoin seasons in the history of cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Whales Snap Up 30 Million XRP As Ripple Launches Its RLUSD Stablecoin Several key factors contribute to Davis’s optimism regarding the impending altcoin surge: Bitcoin’s Performance: Currently at all-time highs, the Bitcoin price strength often catalyzes interest in altcoins. Political Transition: With Donald Trump set to take office in just 34 days, market sentiment may shift favorably towards cryptocurrencies. Global Rate Cuts: Central banks worldwide are reducing interest rates, which typically increases liquidity in the market. Increased Capital Investment: An influx of cheap capital is making its way into the cryptocurrency space, setting the stage for potential growth. Risk-On Environment: The current market conditions are among the strongest for risk-on assets, creating an ideal backdrop for altcoin investment. Rally Anticipated As Bitcoin Dominance Rises Echoing Davis’s sentiments, crypto analyst Miles Deutscher emphasizes that the real altcoin season has yet to commence. He points to compelling historical evidence suggesting that alt-seasons are not mere coincidences but rather distinct seasonal phenomena backed by statistical patterns. Historically, Ethereum (ETH) has shown impressive returns from January to May, often outperforming Bitcoin during this period. During these months, Ethereum averages about 28% monthly returns, compared to a mere 3% for the rest of the year. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Bankruptcy Risk: CEO Warns Bitcoin Must Drop To $16,500 To Trigger Collapse In addition, the analyst asserts that the current environment is particularly favorable for this rotation, as Ethereum has historically outperformed Bitcoin by approximately 20% per month during alt-seasons. As Bitcoin’s performance strengthens, so too does the likelihood of capital flowing into Ethereum and other altcoins. This rotation is already observable in the recent surge in Bitcoin dominance, which has mirrored patterns seen in previous alt-seasons around 2017 and 2021. At the time of writing, ETH, the largest altcoin on the market, is trading at $3,686, down 4.4% over the 24-hour period and nearly 6% over the week.

These projects offer unique innovations, active ecosystems, and immediate growth potential, making them the best coins to buy and hold for short term. Qubetics leads with its multichain wallet, a revolutionary tool for crypto asset management. Meanwhile, Chainlink powers smart contract ecosystems with reliable data, and Render brings decentralised rendering solutions to the forefront.

Chainlink ($LINK): The Backbone of Smart Contracts Chainlink recently announced a collaboration with a leading DeFi platform to enhance decentralised data feeds. This partnership is expected to boost adoption and increase the utility of $LINK in smart contract ecosystems. Chainlink’s oracles connect blockchains to external data sources, enabling smart contracts to execute based on real-world events. For instance, an insurance contract can automatically trigger payouts based on verified weather data. This functionality makes Chainlink indispensable for developers building advanced dApps.

For example, an independent filmmaker can render complex visual effects at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional methods. By decentralising the rendering process, Render not only reduces costs but also democratizes access to high-performance computing resources. This approach has made Render a favourite among creative professionals and businesses seeking efficient rendering solutions.

37833093,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-may-pause-bitcoin-buys-amid-blackout-rumors,1734596945,MicroStrategy May Pause Bitcoin Buys Amid Blackout Rumors,"Speculation is rising that MicroStrategy may temporarily halt Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases in January due to a rumored blackout period affecting the issuance of shares or convertible debt. These blackout periods, often self-imposed by publicly traded companies, restrict certain financial activities to comply with regulations or avoid the appearance of impropriety. According to a venture capitalist, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor faces restrictions in January that could prevent him from issuing convertible debt to finance additional Bitcoin purchases. This news has sparked concern among investors who follow MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy. Some analysts speculate the blackout could be linked to insider trading regulations, as many companies impose restrictions following fiscal quarter closings, lasting up to a month and ending shortly after earnings announcements. Others suggest the restrictions may apply only to “at-the-market” (ATM) share sales rather than convertible debt issuance. A theory connecting the potential pause to MicroStrategy’s recent inclusion in the NASDAQ 100 index on December 23 has also gained traction. Internal recommendations may have prompted this move. MicroStrategy is expected to announce its next earnings report between February 3 and 5, 2025. Analysts believe a blackout period could span all of January or begin around mid-month. Some argue that the impact of such a blackout is overstated, as the company has previously demonstrated a commitment to regulatory transparency through regular 8K filings and press releases. Currently, MicroStrategy holds $46.02 billion worth of Bitcoin , with an unrealized profit of over $18.9 billion. In December alone, the company reportedly purchased over $3 billion worth of BTC at prices exceeding $100,000, reflecting its bullish stance on the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s strong performance this year has significantly boosted MicroStrategy’s stock price, with MSTR shares up 460% year-to-date . This surge has elevated the company into the top 100 publicly traded firms in the US. Following its addition to the NASDAQ 100 , MicroStrategy is rumored to be a contender for the S&P 500 index next year. Despite potential short-term restrictions, the company’s massive Bitcoin holdings and strong market performance underscore its unwavering faith in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-may-pause-bitcoin-buys-amid-blackout-rumors,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37833093.jpeg

While enthusiasts exit meme Dogecoin and PEPE, the focus has switched to iDEGEN – a crypto project born by AI and raised by crypto degens. iDEGEN has created a buzz with its unique and dynamic pricing model, which has propelled IDGN up by over 5,484% in the past seven days. Let us check why iDEGEN will outshine the likes of Dogecoin and PEPE and dominate crypto rallies after its January official release. Investors lose confidence in DOGE and PEPE Dogecoin trades at 0.3628 after losing 12% and 5% in the past week and day. The downside saw the token approaching a vital region. Breaching this level could catalyze significant dips. DOGE price touched 2024 peaks at $0.48 on 8 December before losing nearly 25% the following ten days. Tuesday’s plunge saw the meme token retesting the 50-day EMA at $0.35. Failure to keep this foothold will likely welcome more declines. Meanwhile, investors appear dissatisfied with DOGE’s performance, with some offloading despite the losses. For instance, Dogecoin enthusiast Slum DOGE millionaire confirmed that he reduced his stash after the altcoin’s dip to $0.35. SlumDOGE Millionaire @ProTheDoge · Follow Sorry guys, I had to sell some #Dogecoin 8:39 am · 19 Dec 2024 252 Reply Copy link Read 105 replies That reflected faded trust in Dogecoin’s potential quick recoveries amid the ongoing bloodbath. Moreover, the RSI in the daily timeframe has plunged beneath the neutral 50, signaling robust bearish momentum. DOGE could extend its downside to $0.31 – a 14% dip from current prices. PEPE has also lost strength, with the daily chart reflecting massive bearishness in its recent price actions. Such trends have seen smart money quitting. Nansen stats show smart money PEPE holders have plunged from 115 to 94 within two weeks. Source – Nansen Also, their collective balance dipped from 8 trillion in November to 7.5 trillion. Pepe Coin exhibits significant bearishness and will likely fall further (in the near term). Currently trading at $0.00001917, the frog-themed token hovers beneath the vital $0.00001933 foothold. Failure to reclaim this support zone in the near term would trigger extended dips for the PEPE price. iDEGEN attracts investor attention with massive price actions iDEGEN establishes itself as the next big thing in the cryptocurrency world. The project has dominated trends on X less than a month after launching, and nothing seems to stop it. While cryptos remained indecisive in the past week as bears tightened their grip, IDGN stayed elevated. The new altcoin gained over 6,000% within the last seven days to trade at $0.237 during this publication. iDEGEN’s one-of-a-kind pricing model has contributed to the outperformance. IDGN price fluctuates every five minutes, staying the same if at least a single purchase happens in a five-minute interval. Meanwhile, the price surges 5% in the next interval if acquisitions occur in two successive intervals. Further, the value slumps by 5% if no purchase happens in a five-minute interval. With the continued integrations between AI and crypto, IDGN remains poised for massive gains in the upcoming months and years.

37833041,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52547,1734596294,"With Current Circulating Supply, Can XRP to Hit $100, $300, or $500? Details","The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to ambitious predictions, with XRP often at the forefront of bold forecasts. Some suggest it could reach extraordinary price levels such as $100, $300, or even $500 . However, these projections raise important questions about feasibility, especially considering XRP’s circulating supply of over 57 billion tokens and the market capitalization required for such milestones. XRP’s Track Record XRP has previously demonstrated its potential for explosive growth. During 2017, it surged from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $3.84 in early 2018. This unprecedented increase brought massive returns to early investors, solidifying its reputation as a high-reward investment. Many current holders hope for a repeat of such a rally, particularly as the market is experiencing a massive resurgence. Top analysts believe XRP can repeat this remarkable performance . Some analysts also have higher expectations, with many triple-digit targets projected for the digital asset. For example, financial expert Armando Pantoja recently claimed that a $100 price point might be within reach due to a recent breakout from a 7-year consolidation. Market Capitalization and Feasibility XRP’s current circulating supply and market conditions present significant challenges to reaching such lofty price targets. Trading at $2.49 with a supply of 57.18 billion tokens, XRP’s market cap stands at $142.44 billion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If XRP reaches its all-time high of $3.84 with its current circulating supply, its market cap will become $219.57 billion. If it hits $5 as a prominent analyst recently predicted , that would put its market cap at $285.9 billion. If it breaks into double-digit territory by hitting $10, the digital asset would have a market cap of $571.8 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s current market cap of $463.7 billion. However, more ambitious targets like $100 or beyond require far greater capital inflows. A $100 XRP price translates to a staggering $5.7 trillion market cap, exceeding the entire cryptocurrency market valuation of $3.64 trillion. Achieving $300 would necessitate a $17.155 trillion valuation, nearly matching gold’s market capitalization of $17.9 trillion. At $500, XRP’s market cap would skyrocket to $28.59 trillion. Can XRP Reach These Targets? Given the current market landscape, the likelihood of XRP reaching $100, $300, or $500 in the near term is minimal without transformative shifts in adoption or global financial systems. More modest goals, such as $5 or $10, appear far more achievable based on historical growth trends and potential future demand. However, platforms like Changelly have set long-term projections for XRP, expecting the asset to cross $300 by 2040, and $500 by 2050.

37833421,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321014,1734596134,Ex-Delphi Digital VP Jailed for 4 Years Over $4.5M Crypto Embezzlement,"Dylan Meissner, former vice president of finance at Delphi Digital, has been sentenced to four years in prison after admitting to embezzling nearly $4.5 million from the crypto research firm. The ruling was handed down by Connecticut District Court Judge Michael P. Shea on December 17, according to a press release by the Justice Department . Meissner, who held a senior finance role at Delphi Digital from October 2021 to November 2022, was found guilty of wire fraud. Meissner Ordered to Pay $4.6M in Restitution He was also ordered to pay over $4.6 million in restitution, covering both the stolen funds and an unpaid loan. Following his prison term, Meissner will face two years of supervised release. He is required to report to prison on February 21, 2025, and has waived his right to appeal the sentence. Court documents from the U.S. Justice Department did not explicitly name Delphi Digital, referring to it only as “Company A” and a “cryptocurrency research firm.” However, Meissner’s defense lawyer identified the firm as Delphi in a sentencing memo. The embezzlement scheme began after Meissner received a 50 ETH loan from Delphi in January 2022, valued at around $170,000 at the time. The loan was intended to help him avoid losses from personal crypto investments, but he failed to repay it. Over the following months, Meissner stole approximately $4.46 million from the company. To conceal the theft, he falsified financial records, manipulating the company’s books to mask the missing funds. As part of a plea deal, Meissner admitted guilt in July 2023 and was released on a $100,000 bond.

A Connecticut judge has also ordered him to pay $4.6M in restitution, covering stolen funds and an unpaid loan.… pic.twitter.com/daH2zOE94Z — Bitcoin Vista (@bitcoinvista) December 18, 2024 His sentencing fell short of the six-and-a-half to eight-year prison term sought by prosecutors, who had argued for a stricter punishment of 78 to 97 months. They highlighted the “sustained, multi-faceted scheme” Meissner used to steal from Delphi, calling it far more than a “momentary lapse in judgment.” Meissner’s Legal Team Request a Lighter Sentence In his defense, Meissner’s legal team requested a lighter sentence of 51 to 63 months, citing his struggles with substance abuse and his efforts to maintain sobriety. His lawyers also noted that Meissner admitted his crimes to Delphi and even created a spreadsheet documenting the financial damage he caused. Prosecutors, however, argued that Meissner’s behavior was calculated, not impulsive. They pointed out that he told the Probation Office he had intended to return the stolen money, suggesting he planned to use Delphi’s funds to recover his personal crypto losses. “This was not a drug-induced haze,” prosecutors stated, emphasizing that Meissner acted rationally, intending to profit from the firm’s money and pay it back once the market improved. “It suggests that the defendant was operating rationally, if wrongfully—he intended to use company money to recoup his personal losses and make money for himself, and then give the company back what he took once the market went up.” Last week, a California court fined five individuals involved in IcomTech’s fraudulent Bitcoin Ponzi scheme $5 million. The court ruling found the defendants guilty of fraud and misappropriation of funds through a fake cryptocurrency trading operation.

37832580,https://crypto.news/?p=14320621,1734595804,Bitcoin’s surge sparks 30% hike in mining gear prices as buyers move to Hong Kong,"Bitcoin’s recent price surge has driven up mining equipment costs, with Shenzhen’s Huaqiangbei district—a global hub for crypto hardware—seeing a notable 30% price hike. According to a report by Wen Wei Po , the price of the Antminer S21 335T, a mining device, has now reached $5,600, or around RMB 40,700, climbing up by 30% compared to last year’s price of $3836.19, which comes to 28,000 RMB. There is even much higher demand for the Antminer S21 XP, a raw mining device with water-cooling facilities, which has continued to cause stockouts on Bitmain’s official website . Huaqiangbei merchants report a surge in bulk orders, with buyers from Russia, the U.S., and Canada purchasing hundreds or thousands of units. This demand is driven by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) growing price, which has caused mining businesses to become more lucrative even with the inflated costs of equipment. You might also like: Bitcoin price may see a harsh reversal after Fed decision Hong Kong has become an important export hub The 2021 ban on cryptocurrency mining in China resulted in mining machine transactions being redirected through Hong Kong due to Hong Kong’s free-trade environment and ease of logistics. Merchants in Shenzhen said most of the new mining equipment is exported through Hong Kong, capitalizing on its status as a way station for international trade. Cross-border logistics services can deliver mining machines to Hong Kong on the same day, and the machines are then sent to domestic and foreign air and sea transports.

According to data from Hashrate Index , the network’s average hashrate in the last 14 days hit 771 EH/s while the seven-day moving average stood above 800 EH/s. This record hashing difficulty and fall in hash price reflects the macro impact of BTC’s price increase on mining economics. It confirms the claimed hardware shortages and price surges and also provides insight into global competition among miners. Although mining-related activities are explicitly banned in any form by mainland China, the legal framework in Hong Kong permits the sale and export of mining hardware, giving merchants an outlet to satisfy this global demand.

This misclassification allegedly deprived these clients of critical legal protections. Retail clients in Australia are entitled to safeguards like a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), a Target Market Determination (TMD), and access to dispute resolution systems. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court described Binance’s compliance as “woefully inadequate” , highlighting that many clients faced significant financial losses due to these failures. She emphasized that ASIC is committed to using all regulatory tools to protect consumers and ensure integrity in the digital asset market. The lawsuit claims Binance did not meet several obligations, including issuing mandatory PDS and TMD documents, maintaining proper internal dispute resolution systems, and training employees to comply with regulations. ASIC also accused Binance of not conducting its business “efficiently, honestly, and fairly.” The regulator is seeking penalties, declarations, and orders for adverse publicity. In April 2023, Binance’s Australian financial services license was canceled following an ASIC review. Binance stated that it had requested the cancellation, citing only 104 users on its derivatives platform at the time. The spot trading platform continues to operate in Australia . This lawsuit is part of a broader regulatory push targeting crypto platforms. Recently, Kraken’s Australian operator was fined $12.8 million for compliance breaches, and AUSTRAC has introduced stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements for crypto ATMs, including transaction monitoring and reporting of withdrawals over $10,000. Globally, Binance faces numerous legal challenges. The Indian government has accused the platform of owing $85 million in unpaid taxes. In the UK, a whistleblower lawsuit alleges that a former Binance employee solicited a bribe from a customer and was later terminated after reporting the misconduct. These mounting legal pressures reflect increasing efforts by governments to enforce stricter compliance across the crypto industry. ASIC’s legal action against Binance underscores the growing scrutiny faced by crypto platforms as regulators work to ensure compliance with financial laws and protect consumers. This case highlights the ongoing challenges for the crypto industry in meeting regulatory expectations.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/asic-sues-binance-australia-over-consumer-protection-failures,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37832487.jpeg
37833807,https://invezz.com/?p=2395054,1734595630,Jerome Powell: Federal Reserve prohibited from holding Bitcoin,"The Federal Reserve has dismissed the possibility of holding a Bitcoin reserve, citing legal and institutional limitations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated this stance during a routine press conference following the year’s final Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where the central bank announced a 25 basis point rate cut. Despite growing interest in cryptocurrencies globally, Powell made it clear that the Fed is not authorized to manage a Bitcoin reserve and has no interest in pursuing legislative changes to enable such a move. Bitcoin, already on a downward trend after the Fed’s rate cut announcement, fell to around $101,562 at the time of writing. Powell’s statements underscore the continued reluctance of the US central bank to integrate Bitcoin into its monetary strategy, even as discussions about digital currencies gain traction under the leadership of newly elected President Donald Trump. Source: CoinMarketCap Scrutiny over Trump’s Bitcoin reserve proposal Powell’s comments gained heightened attention because they followed President Trump’s controversial proposal for a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Supported by prominent figures such as Senator Cynthia Lumis, the initiative has been hailed by some as a forward-thinking strategy to diversify national reserves. Critics, including crypto expert Nic Carter, warn that such a move could undermine the dollar’s global reserve currency status. Carter, a founding partner at Castle Island Ventures, argued that a government-managed Bitcoin reserve could erode confidence in the dollar’s stability, especially amid heightened scrutiny of US fiscal policies. This marks a significant divergence in policy perspectives, as the Fed remains committed to maintaining the dollar’s central role in global markets, while parts of the Trump administration appear willing to explore alternative reserve assets. Analysts suggest that the proposal could create friction between regulatory institutions and the executive branch, further complicating the path toward integrating Bitcoin into federal financial frameworks. Bitcoin’s price movements following Fed rate cut Bitcoin’s price movements following the Fed’s announcement and Powell’s remarks highlight the cryptocurrency market’s sensitivity to regulatory developments. The rate cut, aimed at stimulating economic growth, initially boosted investor sentiment but was quickly overshadowed by concerns about the Fed’s policy outlook. The central bank’s repeated rejection of Bitcoin reserves reinforces skepticism about the broader adoption of digital currencies by mainstream financial institutions. Market watchers note that Powell’s stance on Bitcoin is consistent with his previous comments, where he emphasized the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and their unsuitability as reserve assets. His remarks now carry added weight due to the political backdrop of Trump’s presidency and growing interest in blockchain technology within other government sectors. The debate over Bitcoin’s role in US monetary policy is likely to continue as federal agencies navigate the balance between innovation and economic stability. With global competitors like China advancing their digital currency strategies, the US faces pressure to clarify its position on integrating cryptocurrencies into its financial system.

The BitMEX co-founder says in a new analysis that longstanding economic issues will make it “almost impossible” for US President-elect Donald Trump to retain control of both legislative chambers in 2026, meaning he doesn’t have much time to accomplish his policy goals. “The people are impatient because they are desperate. Trump is an astute politician and knows his base. To me, that means he must go big early, which is why my money is on a massive dollar vs. gold devaluation early into his first 100 days in office. It is an easy way to make production costs globally competitive in America quickly. It will lead to an immediate re-shoring of productive capacity, leading to an increase in hiring today and not five years from now. Before we get to the crack-up-boom phase in this crypto bull market, I believe the crypto markets will experience a harrowing dump around Trump’s January 20 th 2025 inauguration day. Maelstrom will be lightening up on certain positions in advance, hoping to rebuy some core positions at lower prices sometime in 1H25.” Maelstrom is Hayes’ family office fund.

This decision leaves a crucial vacancy in the SEC, which oversees the U.S. financial markets. Crenshaw’s replacement must, by tradition, be a Democrat since no more than three of the five Commissioners can belong to the same political party. Her departure, alongside the expected resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler in January, signals a potential shift in the SEC’s approach toward cryptocurrency regulation. Gensler is set to be replaced by Paul Atkins, who is seen as pro-crypto , raising hopes within the crypto community for more favorable policies. Crenshaw, an outspoken critic of cryptocurrencies, faced growing opposition in the Senate during her renomination process. Procedural challenges and a lack of support ultimately ended her chances of continuing in her role. Senator Sherrod Brown, a fellow crypto skeptic and recent election loser, criticized her defeat, blaming corporate interests for a ""smear campaign."" Speculation about Crenshaw’s successor is already underway, with names like Chris Brummer, a Georgetown law professor and former CFTC Chair candidate, emerging as frontrunners. Another key contender is TuongVy Le, legal counsel for Anchorage Digital, a crypto bank. Other potential candidates include Jai Messai, Chief Legal Officer at blockchain company Lightspark, and Carla Carriveau, an advisor to New York’s financial regulator. The potential for pro-crypto leadership in two vacant SEC seats has sparked optimism among cryptocurrency supporters. Crypto.com, for instance, recently dropped its lawsuit against the SEC after its CEO met President-elect Donald Trump to discuss key appointments. These developments suggest the industry is gaining momentum and may see a friendlier regulatory landscape. With new leadership on the horizon, including a potential pro-crypto majority at the SEC, the stage is set for significant policy changes.

37832316,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664690,1734595243,"Bitcoin May Surge To $200,000 By Mid-2025 Amid ‘Mild’ Price Pullbacks: Report","In a report published on December 17, analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex stated that a combination of rising institutional adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and bullish technical indicators could push the leading cryptocurrency as high as $200,000 by mid-2025. The report also predicts that any price corrections during 2025 are likely to ‘remain mild.’ Bitcoin Pullbacks To Be Mild In 2025 Earlier this month, Bitcoin crossed the psychologically significant $100,000 price level, pushing its total market capitalization to slightly above $2 trillion at the time of writing. However, according to the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report, BTC still has significant potential for growth heading into 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $275,000? Analyst Cites Cup And Handle Formation The report highlights several technical indicators, including market value to realized value (MVRV), net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL), and the bull-bear market cycle indicator, which collectively suggest that the market still reflects bullish momentum and is far from hitting euphoric peaks. According to Bitfinex analysts, while diminishing returns might temper Bitcoin’s extraordinary growth seen in previous cycles, the cryptocurrency could still reach $200,000 under ‘favorable conditions.’ The report states: Our view is that any corrections in 2025 will remain mild, thanks to institutional inflows. Historically, post-halving years have seen the strongest rallies. Minimum price estimates stand at $145,000 by mid-2025, potentially stretching to $200,000 under favourable conditions. Indeed, institutional inflows into Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have shown a steady upward trajectory, especially after Donald Trump’s win in the November presidential election. A recent analysis revealed that US spot ETFs now hold more BTC than the wallet of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. While the report projects a strong long-term bullish case, it cautions that some price volatility may emerge during Q1 2025. These pullbacks, however, are expected to be mild and short-lived. The report also notes that price corrections following Bitcoin halvings have been shrinking in size with each cycle: In previous cycles, once Bitcoin entered price discovery following a halving, corrections before mean reversion to new ATHs were relatively contained. In the 2017 cycle, the maximum correction was 33.2 percent, while the 2020 cycle saw a slightly smaller correction of 27.1 percent. Strategic Reserve May Extend BTC Gains One unique factor in this Bitcoin cycle is the speculation surrounding the potential establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Such a reserve could drive Bitcoin prices into the seven-figure range, according to Blockstream CEO Adam Back. Related Reading: VanEck Gives Official Backing To Donald Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at asset management firm Bitwise, recently noted that creating a strategic BTC reserve could propel the asset’s price to $500,000. Experts believe that if the US establishes a BTC reserve, other nations are likely to follow suit, creating a domino effect that could lead to a significant price surge. In related news, Japanese Member of Parliament Satoshi Hamada floated the idea of Japan creating its own strategic BTC reserve. At press time, BTC trades at $103,953, down 3.7% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to the $100,000 price level as well. In the past 24 hours, over $681.11 million in long positions were liquidated. Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) — the top meme coins in the market — have taken a major hit, with DOGE and SHIB down over 6% and PEPE plummeting almost 11%. According to CoinMarketCap data , all meme coins have dropped by double-digital percentages in the last seven days after rising significantly in the past few months. The meme coin crash followed a broader market crash with Bitcoin (BTC) dropping to the $100K price level and Ether (ETH) trading at $3,600. However, meme coins are an integral part of the digital asset space and have a massive market cap of $117.4 billion.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shib-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

IntelMarkets (INTL) , a new AI crypto, skyrocketed over 700% in presale and is primed to explode after Tier-1 exchange listings. On investors’ and experts’ radars, INTL has been hailed as the next Ripple (XRP) or Cardano (ADA). Its combination of AI with blockchain technology and DeFi paints a bullish picture, touted as the best new crypto to invest in. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Breakout Coin? IntelMarkets (INTL) has been rightfully hailed as the next Ripple (XRP) or Cardano (ADA) for several reasons. Its solid fundamentals as an AI-crypto are unrivaled, primed to transform the $347 billion crypto trading market. Additionally, its performance so far has been remarkable—a 700% upswing since its presale debut. In the eighth stage of the ICO, a token costs only $0.073, with over $4.9 million raised in early funding. This low entry is one of its biggest attractions, alongside its massive growth prospects. Industry experts, confident about its potential, predict a 7,500% jump in value after its scheduled listing on Tier-1 exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Even more impressive is its AI-powered trading platform. Unlike conventional exchanges, the trading ecosystem and robots will be completely driven by AI. The cutting-edge Rodeum AI is designed to identify market opportunities and automatically take positions depending on users’ objectives. Ripple (XRP): New ATH Soon? Ripple (XRP), a payment-based protocol, is among the top crypto coins. With a 300% gain to its name in the past three months, it has been one of the top performers. The XRP price retails around $2.5, targeting a breakout above $3 next. Top analysts like Mel_Senechal are optimistic about further upswings, expecting a rally toward $4.20 amid the buzz around the RLUSD launch. Lucasmcn137, another expert, anticipates a new ATH and a rally toward $5 and $7 this altseason. However, investors seeking massive gains have been betting more on projects like IntelMarkets (INTL). Notwithstanding, key technical indicators like 20-VWMA and 9-HMA suggest an increase in the Ripple (XRP) price in the coming days. A breakout above the $3 price level might just spark another big leap—one of the altcoins to watch out for. Cardano (ADA): A Good Crypto to Buy Like the rest of the crypto market, Cardano (ADA) trades upward. It changes hands above $1, registering a 40% gain on the monthly chart. Key technical indicators like the 50-EMA and 50-SMA suggest future upswings, making it among the best altcoins to invest in. At the same time, experts’ bullish stance is unwavering. Cantonmeow, a crypto expert, shared with their followers a potential rally toward $6 and $8 during this bull cycle. Deezy_BTC shares this bullish sentiment, predicting a jump above $10. While the coming weeks and months might be explosive for Cardano (ADA), investors seeking massive gains have been checking out the INTL presale instead. In addition to its significant upside potential, INTL boasts a bullish AI-DeFi narrative. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Big Thing After Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA)? The 700% IntelMarkets ’ (INTL) rally underscores its potential and investor trust. Set to explode after its much-anticipated debut, it is arguably the best crypto to invest in. This has drawn comparisons with popular cryptos like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA), which it might match or surpass.

Sources say Bullish demanded CoinDesk remove the article. According to a Fortune report published on Dec. 18, the Tron ( TRX ) founder’s team allegedly went to Bullish, a crypto exchange firm that bought the media outlet for $75 million last year, to demand the removal of an article about Justin Sun eating Maurizio Cattelan’s $6.2 million dollar banana artwork. The article was published in late November with the title “I Watched Justin Sun Eat the World’s Most Expensive Banana. I Don’t Get It,” which explained the context behind the act itself, the banana’s significance and Sun’s legal troubles with the the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to inside sources Fortune spoke with, Sun’s team disapproved of the tone of CoinDesk’s article, which resulted in Bullish demanding CoinDesk remove the article from its website. This request was met with backlash from the CoinDesk editorial staff who disagreed with the decision and asked for the article to be restored with an editor’s note at a meeting last week. Based on crypto.news’ internet search, the article titled “I Watched Justin Sun Eat the World’s Most Expensive Banana. I Don’t Get It.” could not be found anywhere on the publication site. However, it is still available on Yahoo News . This article was last updated on Dec. 2.

It is also important to note that Tron is a major sponsor of CoinDesk’s conference series, Consensus. According to the report, Bullish CEO Tom Farley has not responded to Fortune’s multiple requests for comment. The same can be said about CoinDesk’s editor-in-chief Kevin Reynolds and a spokesperson for Justin Sun, neither of them have confirmed Fortune’s findings. Moreover, sources claimed that Matt Murray, chair of CoinDesk’s editorial committee, resigned on Monday, Dec. 16. Though, Murray declined Fortune’s request for comment. In November 2023, Bullish acquired CoinDesk from its previous parent company, Digital Currency Group. As previously reported by crypto.news, the acquisition raised concerns over CoinDesk’s editorial independence moving forward. Along with the acquisition, former Editor-in-Chief of The Wall Street Journal Matt Murray was appointed Chair of CoinDesk’s Editorial Committee.

37831488,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394997,1734593504,XRP Price Crashes 5% : Should You Buy XRP Now Amid Whale Accumulation?,"The post XRP Price Crashes 5% : Should You Buy XRP Now Amid Whale Accumulation? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP News Now : Amid the ongoing crypto correction escalated by the monetary policy changes in the United States, Ripple Labs-backed XRP has retraced more than 5 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $2.36 on Thursday, during the early European session. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $235 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of around $20 billion, has been trapped in a consolidation mode for the past two weeks. Nonetheless, XRP price has already confirmed the onset of a macro bull run after breaking out of a six-year triangular consolidation following the overwhelming victory of pro-crypto US leaders led by Donald Trump . Furthermore, the XRP/BTC pair has rebounded from a crucial support level, amid the ongoing altcoin awakening catalyzed by institutional investors. XRP Whales Loads More Coins According to on-chain data analysis provided by Santiment, XRP whale investors, with a balance of between 100 million and 1 billion tokens, have added more than 860 million XRP coins this week, worth over $2 billion. During the ongoing bullish outlook, XRP whales have relentlessly accumulated more coins along the way. Betting on Robust Fundamentals Backed by Ripple and its robust business models, XRP has gained renewed interest in the recent past. Moreover, the ongoing Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is likely to be dropped under the upcoming Trump administration. On Wednesday, Ripple Labs debuted its fiat-backed RLUSD stablecoin , which has received overwhelming support from both centralized exchanges and DeFi protocols. The launch of RLUSD will significantly bolster XRP’s liquidity and enhance the company’s cross-border payments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Is Down Today? $588M Crypto Liquidations Trigger Market Panic , Midterm Target From a technical analysis perspective, the XRP price, in the daily time frame, has broken out of a bullish pennant flag formed in the past two weeks.

Interim CEO Norman Reed stated on Wednesday that the current SEC administration has caused significant harm to American consumers and the crypto industry, including Binance.US. In June 2023, the SEC accused the subsidiary of violating securities laws. It alleged the company offered unregistered investment products and engaged in anti-fraud practices. The US arm, operating independently from Binance.com since 2019, later lost its money transmitter license in seven states . These states revoked the licenses because the company failed to meet requirements and protect citizens from illegal activities.

They admitted to money laundering charges. As a result, the company was fined. Zhao also resigned as CEO. These legal challenges forced swift action, prompting the US arm to suspend USD deposits in early June 2023 after the SEC sought a court order to freeze its assets. By July 2023, Binance.US had shifted to a crypto-only platform, stopping USD withdrawals and trading. The company urged users to convert USD into stablecoins like USDT to continue crypto-to-crypto trading. Reed said that over the past 17 months, Binance.US has engaged in the discovery process, giving hours of depositions and fulfilling hundreds of document requests. “Tellingly, the SEC has not presented any evidence of wrongdoing to date despite maintaining a careful watch over the company,” he added. Binance.US Anticipates Regulatory Clarity and a Strong Comeback in 2025 Reed stated that Binance.US looks forward to a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the US. He hopes that SEC chair nominee Paul Atkins will help drive the industry toward this goal. As USD services prepare for a return, Binance.US plans to launch new features in the coming months and expand its product lineup. “I strongly believe that 2025 will be a breakout year for Binance.US, and our teams are hard at work building a comeback story for the ages,” Reed said.

37833419,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321013,1734593195,"Bitcoin Surge Drives Cost of Mining Machines in China, More Buyers From Russia","The cost of Bitcoin mining machines has surged sharply in Shenzhen, China, following the recent spike in the Bitcoin price. According to a recent report by a Beijing-based newspaper Wen Wei Po , the price of Ant mining machines developed and produced by Bitmain, has increased 30% from the previous year. Affected by the surge in Bitcoin prices, the price of Bitcoin mining machines in Shenzhen, China has risen sharply, up 30% from last year, and the buyers are mainly from Russia, the United States, Canada and other places. In particular, the cheap electricity price in Russia makes… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 19, 2024 Further, some of these machines have been in higher demand, the report added. Investors from Russia, Ethiopia, the United States and Canada have “purchased hundreds or even thousands of units,” Shenzhen-based merchants revealed. The spike in Bitcoin mining machine prices is attributed to high market enthusiasm after Bitcoin surged past $106,000, on Monday . President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve , fueled the price of Bitcoin. One merchant noted that the Antminer S21 335T is priced at $5,600 each, a 30% increase from 2023. “The price of Bitcoin is now high, and many people are rushing to buy it,” the merchant told the publication. “There is no need to worry about selling mining machines, and they are now out of stock.” Per the official website of Bitmain, the 473T S21 XP water-cooled costs 73,900 Renminbi ($10124). Russia’s Cheap Electricity Attract More Bitcoin Mining Machines According to the merchant, few miners from Russia, and other nations have imported hundreds of new BTC mining machines. Some of them have even traded thousands of machines, he added. Another business owner predicted that the next year will be the real bull market for Bitcoin. “By then, mining machines will also usher in a bull market, prices will rise further, and shortages will become even worse.” Meanwhile, with great crude oil and natural gas production output, Russia enjoys some of the cheapest electricity prices in the world. “I opened a mine in Russia to mine Bitcoin. I have hundreds of machines,” a business owner noted. “The electricity cost there is only more than 2 cents, which is very cheap.

This bloodbath has been triggered by a series of events, including the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts and global tensions, like Israel’s airstrikes on Iran-backed groups in Yemen. Let’s analyze what caused the bloodbath in Satoshi Street today. Crypto Bloodbath: A Brutal 24 Hours In the past 24 hours, the crypto market saw a huge sell-off, wiping out $588 million in positions. XRP was hit the hardest, with $69 million in liquidations after its price peaked at $2.82, the highest it’s been since 2017, before falling to $2.56. Bitcoin lost $60 million in liquidations after its price dropped below $96,000. Ethereum also took a hit, losing nearly $58 million. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Has Bitcoin Fallen Into the Hopium Trap? Here’s What You Should Know , What’s Behind the Drop? A recent report from Santiment suggests that traders are feeling uneasy after the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. While the cuts themselves weren’t the main concern, the projection that there will be fewer rate cuts in 2025 than expected has spooked both crypto and stock traders. This uncertainty, mixed with a shift from “Extreme Greed” to “Fear” in the market, has contributed to the sell-off. After the FOMC interest rate cuts, both crypto and equities traders were left feeling a bit concerned. Not because of the current cuts, but due to Jerome Powell's projection for 2025 to have half the amount of rate cuts as expected.

XRP has dropped 6.74%, now trading at $2.35, while Solana has seen a 9.79% dip over the past week, now priced at $208.49. A Few Winners Amid the Chaos Not all cryptocurrencies are suffering. Ethena (ENA) has risen 11.66% , trading at $1.18, thanks to new utility features. Movement (MOVE) has also posted a strong gain of 11.48%, now priced at $0.7171, driven by strong community engagement. After the Fed rate cut, Bitcoin and crypto took a hit, with Bitcoin dropping 5.85% read Bitcoin price prediction to find out what’s next for the market! More Bloodbath in January? Looking ahead, Arthur Hayes , the former CEO of BitMEX, has given a stark warning that the crypto market may see another major sell-off around Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025. Hayes believes the market may not see a quick turnaround after Trump takes charge as many regulatory policies may get delayed due to political clashes. This can cause market sell-off if regulatory policies are delayed further. On the flip side, it is seen as a buying opportunity despite the sell-offs analyst believe 2025 will be the year of Bitcoin and there might be some major drops before it hits another ATH. Also, there are rumors of a new ETF hitting next year which can help the market recover from this loss. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

But change might be on the way. In a recent meeting, the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance spoke with SEC staffers for Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda to discuss the 2025 SEC Digital Asset Policy Priorities. The crypto regulations in the US have never been clear. Could this mark the beginning of a more open and cooperative era? Hinman Speech Critique One major focus of the discussion was the controversial 2018 Hinman speech. The SEC’s Corporation Finance division has identified denouncing this speech as a priority. It’s been criticized for causing confusion, especially regarding the Howey Test, which determines whether an asset qualifies as a security. This test has been falsly applied to crypto. Critics argue the speech created unnecessary market confusion and a sense of favoritism. Essentially, it’s seen as dividing the industry into “winners” and “losers,” which harms transparency and fairness. Removing the legacy of such informal guidance is seen as a critical step. Instead, experts encourage the SEC to rely on clear, formal rulemaking and no-action letters to provide straightforward compliance paths for crypto asset firms. Building Trust with New Leadership The meeting also shed light on the Token Alliance’s vision for the SEC under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. Trump’s pick for SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, is viewed as a crypto-friendly figure with deep experience. Commissioners Peirce and Uyeda, known for their criticism of the SEC’s aggressive anti-crypto enforcement, could help lead this reset. The Digital Chamber’s agenda for the SEC’s first 90 days includes some bold moves. These include reviewing ongoing investigations, stopping cases without actual fraud, and rescinding confusing guidance like SAB 121. They also propose withdrawing proposed amendments that aim to redefine “exchange” to include decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Source : X.com Perhaps the most important goal is to shift away from enforcement driven regulation. They requested the SEC to foster a culture of transparency and collaboration. This could encourage innovation within the digital space. What to Expect The Token Alliance is optimistic about what the SEC’s new leadership could bring. Improving the relationship between the SEC and the digital asset industry might pave the way for clearer crypto regulations in the US. This will encourage more innovation, and stronger mutual trust. By focusing on fairness and transparency, this could finally be the fresh start the industry has been waiting for. Will these efforts pay off?

As we inch closer to the end of the year, the spotlight shines on three meme coins making waves—BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Brett. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone looking to dip their toes into crypto, these coins have something unique to offer. With BTFD Coin reaching new presale milestones, Popcat drawing on its meme origins for potential recovery, and Brett leveraging its position on the Base Chain, it’s a perfect time to evaluate your options. This week has already seen meme coins capturing the imagination of investors. Popcat, born from a meme that swept the internet, continues to intrigue with its volatile moves, while Brett’s recent dip presents potential buying opportunities for those banking on its strong ecosystem. And then there’s BTFD Coin , a star that continues to rise with a staggering $4.1M raised in its presale. Meme coins have proven time and again that they’re not just a passing trend. With innovative utilities, loyal communities, and the ability to drive massive returns, they remain a favourite among crypto enthusiasts. So, if you’re wondering which coins to bet on this week, let’s break down what makes BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Brett contenders for the best meme coins to join this week . BTFD Coin: The Bull Run You Don’t Want to Miss Have you ever wondered what it’s like to catch a coin at the perfect dip and ride it all the way to impressive gains? That’s exactly the narrative BTFD Coin is creating for its investors. With a presale performance that has already amassed over $4.1 million, this meme coin is becoming a strong contender for one of the best meme coins to join this week. BTFD Coin, short for “Buy The F***ing Dip,” captures the meme spirit like no other. But it’s not all jokes and fun—this coin packs serious potential with its upcoming play-to-earn (P2E) game, a beta version already live. Combined with staking rewards that offer an impressive 90% APY, BTFD is positioning itself as more than just a meme—it’s an opportunity. Imagine investing $8,000 in Stage 12 of its presale at $0.00013 per coin. When BTFD reaches its post-launch price of $0.0006, your investment would balloon to over $36,900. It’s not just about the numbers, though; it’s about being part of a growing community of over 5,900 coin holders who are riding the bullish momentum. And let’s not forget the fun side of BTFD Coin.

And now the sentiment has deteriorated.   Bitcoin's seven-day call-put skew shows that Deribit-listed put options offering downside protection and expiring in one week are trading at the highest implied volatility premium to call options since September, according to data source Amberdata. In other words, put options are the most expensive relative to calls in three months.  Its a sign of traders scrambling to hedge their bullish bets against a potential continuation of Wednesday's price slide, triggered by a hawkish Fed.  The dour sentiment is also evident from the negative one-month skew, reflecting a bias for puts and a significantly weaker call bias in options ranging from two to six months. These calls traded at a 3 vol premium to puts at press time, down from the 4-5 vol premium observed early this month.  On Wednesday, the Fed cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the 4.25% to 4.5% range. That's 100 basis points lower than the September levels when it began the easing cycle.  Bitcoin declined following the rate cut, as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described it as a close call and emphasized caution regarding future moves as rates approach the neutral level.  Powell also said that the Fed has no intention of participating in any government plan to create a strategic bitcoin reserve, adding that board members do not intend to push for changes to the Fed law. This comes after President-elect Trump's recent mention that his administration would consider establishing a BTC reserve similar to the country’s oil stockpile.  Meanwhile, the dot plot, an anonymous graphical representation of where the 19 committee members project the fed funds rates will be in the future, signaled only two rate cuts in 2025 instead of three expected and down from four in September.  The dot plot essentially out-hawked the markets, sending risk assets lower. While Dow Jones ended bled 2.5% or over 1,000 points, BTC slipped from roughly $105,000 to under $99,000, according to data source TradingView and CoinDesk.  As of this writing, BTC is trading at around $101,200, aiming to recover from overnight losses.   Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major currencies, continues to hold on to its overnight gains, holding steady near 108, the highest level since October 2022.

37833418,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321008,1734592151,Sky (Formerly Maker) Accelerates MKR to SKY Migration Post-Rebrand to Remove Confusions,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Sky, previously known as Maker, is fast-tracking the transition from MKR to SKY tokens as part of its ongoing rebrand, which began in August. Co-founder Rune Christensen announced the shift in a year-end update on December 18, emphasizing that a full migration push will take place in 2025. Christensen explained that the move aims to eliminate confusion surrounding the MKR and SKY tokens. New Proposals to Make Migration a Requirement He assured MKR holders that their funds remain secure, but added that “new upcoming proposals make migration a requirement in order to get usability out of the token.” Sky’s leadership plans to provide more updates and specifics about the MKR-to-SKY transition next year. According to Christensen, the overarching goal is to ensure that major platforms like CoinGecko and crypto exchanges exclusively support SKY, leaving MKR as a “legacy wrapper” representing 24,000 SKY for each MKR. The shift follows a key governance vote on November 11, where Sky’s stakeholders approved SKY as the ecosystem’s core token. The same vote established a deflationary model for SKY, with mechanisms for long-term supply reduction and token burns. Another major development for 2025 is the introduction of subDAOs, referred to as “Stars.” Christensen revealed that this new approach allows for the creation of multiple subDAOs with greater operational flexibility. The subDAOs will operate under a foundation model, which controls workforce incentives and enables quicker decision-making processes. The first subDAO, called Spark, is set to debut as the inaugural Star in the Sky ecosystem. Christensen noted that “with the new SKY and Star tokenomics, and the shift to a foundation model, the ability to create Stars becomes a lot easier.” He also revealed plans to bring in more founders and teams to launch additional Stars in the coming year. Sky end of year update It’s been a big Q4 for Sky, capping off what is a pivotal year for the project. A brand shift and new front end paved the way for a host of changes to the system, including two upgraded tokens and the activation of native rewards. USDS grew to more… — Rune (@RuneKek) December 18, 2024 Sky’s brand identity has faced challenges since its August rebrand from Maker . In October, discussions emerged about reverting to the original Maker name after confusion and backlash. However, a poll on November 4 saw 79% of tokenholders vote to maintain the Sky brand as the protocol’s official identity. Maker Rebrands to Sky as Part of ‘Endgame’ Upgrade Maker’s rebrand to Sky is a key component of its “Endgame” upgrade. The overhaul introduced USDS as a successor to the DAI stablecoin and SKY as a replacement for the MKR governance token, signaling the protocol’s evolution. A primary goal of the rebrand was to enhance the decentralization and sustainability of Maker’s governance mechanisms. Additionally, the launch of “Sky Stars” (formerly SubDAOs) aimed to enable independent business models, token-based governance, and treasury management within the Maker ecosystem. For users who chose not to transition, DAI and MKR remain as legacy tokens under the Sky protocol. Meanwhile, new features, such as token rewards for holding USDS, are available through the revamped platform, accessible at sky.money. However, the transition has stirred controversy. The crypto community has raised concerns over the “freeze function” in USDS, viewing it as a potential challenge to the decentralization principles MakerDAO has long upheld.

37831363,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52544,1734591741,Analyst Spot Signs Of SHIB Break Out to $0.000070,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) displays modest price movements, leaving holders awaiting significant gains. Despite recent underperformance compared to other meme coins and altcoins, technical indicators suggest a bullish trend may take shape. As of now, the asset is trading at $0.00002453, reflecting a 7% decline over the past week. According to market analyst Klejdi Cuni, SHIB is exhibiting signs of an upward breakout, backed by key technical patterns observed on its daily chart. Source: TradingView Daily Chart Shows Potential Bullish Pattern Klejdi Cuni, a prominent analyst on TradingView, has pointed out encouraging signals for Shiba Inu on its daily price chart. Since September, the asset has demonstrated a gradual upward trend, characterized by higher highs. This movement forms what Cuni describes as an oval pattern—a structure often indicative of bullish momentum. One critical factor highlighted by Cuni is Shiba Inu’s ability to maintain strong support around the $0.00002424 level. This price range has held steady for approximately a month, signaling a consolidation phase. The analyst interprets this as evidence of accumulation, suggesting that buyers are gradually positioning themselves for a potential rally. If Shiba Inu successfully breaks out of its consolidation phase, Cuni anticipates several potential price targets. The first target, $0.00003232, would represent a 32% increase from its current price. The analyst also identifies $0.00004 as a critical resistance level, marking a point that SHIB last reached ten months ago. Reaching this level would translate to a 64% gain from its current position. Cuni’s third target is $0.00005675, which would mark a significant 132% increase. This price level was last seen during Shiba Inu’s peak in 2021. For the long term, Cuni suggests that SHIB could reach as high as $0.00007012 in the first half of 2025, representing a 187% surge from its current value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Perspectives Other analysts have also expressed optimism regarding the token’s future, though the asset has yet to deliver the anticipated breakout. Sherif , a cryptocurrency market commentator, has stated confidence in SHIB surpassing its previous all-time high of $0.00008654 during the current market cycle. Additionally, an analyst known as CryptoELITES has projected even greater gains for Shiba Inu, forecasting a potential price of $0.0004729, which would effectively cancel a zero from its current value. This estimate is based on a cup-and-handle pattern observed on the weekly chart, a technical formation often linked to extended bullish trends. If this prediction materializes, it could yield approximately an 18-fold return for current holders. Potential Risks to Consider Despite the optimistic outlook, not all analysts are convinced of a guaranteed breakout. One market expert has warned of a potential decline to $0.000011 if Shiba Inu fails to maintain its bullish momentum. Such a move would signal a significant loss for holders and challenge the asset’s recovery prospects in the short term. While the asset has struggled to match the performance of other cryptocurrencies, signs of accumulation and bullish patterns on its daily chart have led analysts like Klejdi Cuni to predict a potential upward surge. With multiple price targets ranging from $0.00003232 to $0.00007012, SHIB’s future trajectory will largely depend on its ability to break out of its consolidation phase and overcome key resistance levels.

As the crypto market heats up, INTL demonstrates more strength and prospects than its peers, suggesting it could surpass the levels previously associated with the top altcoins. Let’s determine how high INTL will likely go during the bull market! IntelMarkets Eyes Higher Levels Than Its Rivals IntelMarkets is prepared to exceed market expectations and leave competitors like Cardano and Render in the dust during this bull run. The AI coin has rallied 711% since its presale began, significantly surpassing the wider altcoin market’s year-to-date (YTD) performance. The IntelMarkets platform harnesses blockchain and AI powers to enhance its efficiency and security. It runs on a dual-chain system, using both Ethereum and Solana to drive its operations. By integrating Ethereum, users will have access to a suite of sophisticated features, such as decentralized applications, liquidity pools, and smart contracts. In addition, transaction costs will be lower compared to other networks with Solana’s integration. With over 10,000 cryptocurrencies available on IntelMarkets, traders have a vast array of options to diversify their portfolios. The upcoming bull run presents an exciting opportunity to explore new coins and expand investment horizons. What sets IntelMarkets apart is its focus on improving profitability and mitigating market risks. The platform does so by introducing AI-powered trading bots to analyze the market thoroughly and suggest the best strategy so that you end up on the winning side even in a turbulent market. Cardano’s Breakout to $2 is Imminent as ADA’s Price Tests Key Support Level Cardano’s ADA eyes an imminent price breakout after a symmetrical show shows up on its one-day chart. It currently trades around $1.059, which is near the $0.916 lower support level. Experts consider this support zone the perfect entry for traders before ADA initiates a rally. With the symmetrical triangle formation, Cardano has shown the potential to hit targets at $1.450, $1.750, and $2.030. Rose Premium, a crypto analyst, suggested traders set a stop loss at $0.89 in case of an unexpected price reversal before ADA hits the set targets. If the price follows the pattern, it could reach $2 before the bull run ends. Cardano’s bullish outlook fueled positive sentiments about ADA’s ability to reach the set price. Meanwhile, ADA trades at $1.09, down 5.80% over the week. Render Scales Descending Trendline: Can It Reach $31 in This Bull Run? Render had demonstrated bullishness on the weekly timeframe as it broke through a descending trendline that ended the October 2023 rally. This breakout has turned RNDR’s outlook from bearish to bullish. Between October 2023 and April 2024, Render traded beneath the $6.50 resistance level, which matched the exact position of the trendline. A rise in volume coinciding with the breakout suggests that the breakout was legitimate. Price has since moved past several resistance levels unhampered as buyers overpower sellers. RNDR recently reached $10.90 after beating the $10 resistance wall. Now, RNDR is targeting $31, a price level it will attain this bull run with sufficient buying power and bullish momentum. Due to the market-wide decline, RNDR recorded a 9.62% drop to $9.20. INTL to Rise Above ADA and RNDR! INTL’s outlook suggests it could surpass ADA and RNDR in this bull market. INTL achieved a 711% increase in 2024 in its presale compared to the other top altcoins. The public presale is now in Stage 8, with INTL trading at $0.073. With INTL targeting a listing price of $0.110, investors can scoop 50% gains when the token hits the target price. Moreover, experts posit that INTL could soar 5,000% after its exchange debut as its adoption rate spikes. This projection presents it as the best cryptocurrency to buy this bull run.

Kiyosaki has urged that, given Bitcoin’s democratic nature, people should buy even 1/2 a satoshi to benefit when the price hits the sky. Robert Kiyosaki co-authored Rich Dad, Poor Dad with Sharon Lechter, a book that propelled him to popularity. The book sold more than 32 million copies and was translated into 51 languages. The book’s highlight is that it stayed on the New York Times Best Seller list for over six years. Kiyosaki always encourages people to invest in digital assets, including Bitcoin , stating that fiat money, the US government, and the dollar are unreliable. The renowned author encourages people to buy Bitcoin even in small units. He has always held that its inclusive design is meant to help people build wealth. Kiyosaki has called on people to act swiftly before 2025. A “sat” (short for satoshi) is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Named after Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, one satoshi equals 0.00000001 BTC or one hundred-millionth of a single Bitcoin. Rich Dad, Poor Dad author hails Trump as the ‘first Bitcoin president Kiyosaki believes that the current political environment favors Bitcoin and will see it maintain a bullish run. In his X post , he praised the US President-elect, Donald Trump, as “the first Bitcoin President,” claiming that Bitcoin will hit $350k. The US president-elect, Trump, has made moves that are encouraging to crypto lovers. He has outrightly advocated for blockchain technology, saying that it is the future and that people should embrace it. Additionally, his recent choice of appointment to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has renewed optimism in the crypto community. Robert Kiyosaki warns baby boomers of looming economic crash While intensifying his campaigns for crypto, the famous author has predicted the biggest economic crash that may affect all baby boomers. In his X post , Kiyosaki shared his concern, underscoring the tricky position of baby boomers. He mentioned that boomers risk losing their retirement benefits as they solely rely on conventional retirement assets such as stocks, bonds, and homes. He said that when the stock market bursts, boomers are going to lose a lot. Robert Kiyosaki has urged young people to help their parents evaluate their investments before the economic crash.

However, highlighting that the organisation has not decided on a strict plan for rate changes, he asserted the possibility of a further rate cut depends on three key factors: new economic data, the outlook for the economy, and risks to the economy and inflation. At the start of this year, the US inflation rate was at 3.1%. It touched a yearly peak of 3.5% in March. Notably, between March and September, it had declined steadily. In September, it dropped to a yearly low of 2.4%. However, since then, the rate has increased consistently. In November, it reached 2.7%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Metaplanet Stock Debuts on OTCQX: Bitcoin Strategy Pays Off – Again! , Market Reactions: Stocks and Crypto Plunge On December 18, the day when the interest cut was officially announced by the US Fed, the crypto market declined by approximately 0.58%.

Powell’s statement resulted in BTC dropping to $100K and ETH dropping to $3,600. Altcoins got “hammered” with LINK, AVAX, DOT, and XRP crashing massively. The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent comments have shaken sentiment across the digital asset space, with most altcoins suffering significant declines in the past 24 hours.

According to blockchain analytics platform Santiment , the crypto and equities markets reacted negatively to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) rate cuts. The concern, however, stems not from the current cuts but from Powell’s announcement that 2025 will only see half the number of rate cuts previously expected. Lower interest rates are generally bullish for digital assets, as traditional investment options tend to lose appeal. High-volatility assets like Bitcoin often attract investors in such scenarios due to their higher return potential.

The central bank’s Chair warned that the rate cuts for 2025 could be fewer after the three consecutive ones at the end of 2024 and warned that the US is “not allowed to own bitcoin,” despite Donald Trump’s promise to explore how the country could put BTC on its balance sheet. Riskier assets like cryptocurrencies reacted with immediate and violent price declines. Bitcoin, for one, dumped from over $105,000 to under $99,000 for the first time since December 11. The losses extend to nearly ten grand when compared to the Tuesday afternoon peak of over $108,000. The altcoins, though, were impacted even more severely. Many plummeted by double digits from their respective tops to bottoms, including XRP , DOGE, AVAX, PEPE, LTC, and LINK. Interestingly, Santiment weighed in on the correction and outlined the last four as the potential beneficiaries if the Fed-induced crash was a market overreaction. “If this was indeed an overreaction, there is a reasonable chance that the projects with the biggest drops will be the ones worth taking the biggest dip buy chances on,” – reads the tweet. After the FOMC interest rate cuts, both crypto and equities traders were left feeling a bit concerned.

In Australia, ASIC started legal action against Binance for misclassifying retail clients, while South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-kuk faces prison for allegedly concealing his crypto holdings. Meanwhile, SEC hacker Eric Council Jr. was granted holiday travel permission after being accused of a SIM swap attack on the SEC's X account back in January. BiT Global Fails to Prevent Coinbase From Delisting wBTC A federal judge ruled in favor of Coinbase in a legal dispute with BiT Global, and refused to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the exchange from delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). The decision was made during a virtual hearing in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Dec. 18, where Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín stated that BiT Global’s legal team failed to prove “imminent irreparable harm” in its case. The lawsuit was filed by BiT Global on Dec. 13, and argued that Coinbase’s decision to delist wBTC in November will harm the market and cause serious financial losses for holders of the token. The judge pointed out that BiT Global’s delay in filing the lawsuit undermined its argument and that the claims were speculative as they lacked evidence of immediate market impact. Coinbase announced the delisting decision on Nov. 19, and suspended wBTC trading starting Dec. 19, due to concerns over control of wBTC potentially falling into the hands of BiT Global’s affiliate, Justin Sun. The exchange pointed to Sun’s previous legal issues with U.S. authorities, including the SEC, as justification for its actions. BiT Global wanted the TRO to prevent the delisting before its effective date, and claimed that Coinbase’s decision was baseless and will only damage the token’s ecosystem. However, Coinbase held firm that its decision was a response to an “unacceptable risk” associated with Sun’s involvement, and pointed out that wBTC’s circulation already started to decline after BiT Global announced its partnership with Sun in August. BiT Global’s attorney, Cyclone Covey, accused Coinbase of using Sun as a pretext for the delisting and questioned the exchange’s timeline of due diligence. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s attorney, Sonal Mehta, defended the decision as necessary when it comes to mitigating risks to the platform and its users. Judge Martínez-Olguín ultimately allowed room for BiT Global to present more arguments in the future. ASIC Takes Legal Action Against Binance Australia Other crypto exchanges are also facing some legal heat. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) started legal proceedings against Binance Australia Derivatives, accusing the platform of major consumer protection failures. ASIC alleges that Binance misclassified more than 500 retail clients as wholesale investors between July of 2022 and April of 2023, which deprived them of the legal protections guaranteed under Australian financial laws. Retail clients are entitled to stronger safeguards, including a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), a Target Market Determination (TMD), and access to internal dispute resolution processes. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court criticized Binance’s compliance systems, and also labeled them as “woefully inadequate.” She shared that many clients actually suffered large financial losses because of the lack of proper protections. The lawsuit outlines regulatory violations, including Binance’s failure to issue a PDS or TMD, inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms, and insufficient employee training. ASIC also accused Binance of failing to deliver its services “efficiently, honestly, and fairly.” After a review of Binance’s operations in April of 2023, ASIC canceled the exchange’s Australian financial services license. The regulator also recently fined Kraken’s Australian operator $12.8 million for similar breaches and is preparing new guidelines to mandate financial services licensing for crypto exchanges under the Corporations Act. ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland shared plans to extend licensing requirements beyond digital currency exchanges during a speech at the AFR Crypto and Digital Assets Summit in September. He believes that major crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are considered in the scope of the Corporations Act. Binance is also facing separate allegations of intellectual property theft in the United States. Mark Longo, the owner of Peanut the Squirrel, issued a cease-and-desist letter to Binance after accusing it of trademark infringement related to its PNUT-themed meme coin. South Korean Lawmaker Faces Prison Over Crypto Scandal It is not only crypto exchanges finding themselves in legal hot water. Kim Nam-kuk, a South Korean lawmaker, faces a potential six-month prison sentence for allegedly failing to disclose all his crypto holdings to the government. Prosecutors claim that Kim reported his assets as 1.2 billion Korean won in 2021, despite allegedly owning 9.9 billion in digital assets, and concealed an additional 990 million won worth of cryptocurrency in 2022. They argued that Kim’s actions obstructed the National Assembly Ethics Committee’s review of member assets and created potential conflicts of interest. Kim left the Democratic Party in 2023 due to allegations of liquidating millions in cryptocurrency before the enforcement of South Korea’s Financial Action Task Force Travel Rule, but denied any wrongdoing. He stated that he transferred funds to another exchange and argued that he was not obligated to declare the holdings. Since assuming office in 2020, Kim has been involved in legislation concerning digital assets, including efforts to delay a 20% tax on crypto gains, which lawmakers postponed to 2027. Despite these allegations, Kim’s trial was overshadowed by a political crisis after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s sudden declaration of martial law on Dec. 3. The move caused widespread unrest, and lawmakers from both the Democratic Party and Yoon’s People Power Party scaled parliament buildings to vote on rescinding the declaration. Martial law was lifted after the vote, but Yoon refused to resign. This led to his impeachment on Dec. 14 in a National Assembly vote of 204 out of 300 members. The Constitutional Court now has 180 days to decide whether to remove Yoon from office. Not long after the impeachment, Han Dong-hoon, leader of the People Power Party, announced his resignation on Dec. 16. SEC Hacker Granted Holiday Travel Permission Eric Council Jr., who is accused of hacking the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) X account in January and posting a fake message about Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has been given permission to travel for the holidays. According to a Dec. 13 court filing, Judge Amy Berman Jackson allowed Council to travel to North Carolina between Dec. 23 and 29 under the supervision of a third-party custodian. The judge required Council to provide his travel itinerary and accommodation details to Pre-Trial Services at least two business days before departure. Council pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. The hack happened on Jan. 9, when a message posted from the SEC’s account falsely claimed that spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved. The announcement temporarily caused Bitcoin’s price to surge by more than $1,000 before being debunked. The SEC officially approved spot Bitcoin ETFs roughly 24 hours later. The fake Bitcoin ETF approval post from the SEC’s hacked account Federal Bureau of Investigation officials arrested Council in Alabama on Oct. 17. While no trial date has been set, the court indicated that a plea agreement could be filed by Jan. 17, at which time Council is expected to appear in person. Authorities allege that Council was part of a group that executed a SIM swap attack to get access to the SEC’s X account. The incident took place during a time of anticipation in the crypto industry with regards to the SEC’s decision on spot Bitcoin ETFs. After the hack, X’s safety team reported that the SEC’s account did not have two-factor authentication. Despite the breach, the SEC encountered no further issues with its social media accounts during its subsequent announcements, including the approval of spot Ether ETFs in May.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6615/judge-rules-in-favor-of-coinbase-in-bi-t-global-dispute-over-w-btc,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37829735,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664740,1734589849,"Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Record Low, Could $120K Be on the Horizon?","Bitcoin has seen continuous bullish momentum in recent weeks resulting in the asset’s consistent new highs. According to recent analysis, this momentum appears to not just be random as it comes amid major moves behind the scenes. Particularly, recent data indicates that Bitcoin reserves have dropped to a historic low of 2.4 million, signaling a “supply shock” that has coincided with a surge in Bitcoin’s price. This reduction in exchange reserves, coupled with strong demand, has created a bullish environment that could set the stage for further price increases. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Momentum Shifts As Spot Market Outpaces Futures – Here’s What It Means A Supply Shock In The Making A CryptoQuant analyst known as Kripto Baykus shared the outlook on Bitcoin’s exchange reserve hitting historic low in a post on the QuickTake platform. In the post, Baykus highlighted that the year began with Bitcoin reserves at approximately 3 million on exchanges. However, a steady decline throughout 2024 has led to the current levels, reflecting a clear shift in investor behaviour. Institutional investors, in particular, have embraced long-term holding strategies, pulling their assets off exchanges, Baykus noted. The analyst added: This shift is particularly evident among institutional investors, who have increasingly embraced the “hodl” approach, demonstrating strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future potential. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has mirrored this movement, starting the year at around $40,000 and accelerating in November to surpass $100,000, eventually reaching a new peak above $104,000. Baykus wrote: The limited supply of Bitcoin, combined with shrinking reserves, is seen as a strong bullish signal for the market. Investors are pricing in the effects of the supply shock, and if the trend persists, Bitcoin is likely to break further records in late 2024 and into 2025. Bitcoin Current Demand Stance In addition to supply-related trends, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Yonsei Dent has recently turned to the Coinbase Premium Index to offer insights into Bitcoin’s demand in North America. This metric tracks activity on Coinbase, one of the largest exchanges in the region, and has traditionally been used to predict short-term price movements. However, over the past two weeks, a divergence between the Coinbase Premium Index and Bitcoin’s price has raised concerns. Dent pointed out that despite Bitcoin’s price rising from $94,000 to $106,000 during this period, the Coinbase Premium has declined. This suggests that the recent price surge may not have been driven by US.-based demand, raising questions about the medium-term momentum of Bitcoin’s rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? Key Metric Reveals When to Cash In Profits Dent noted: If this price surge has not been supported by U.S.-based demand, it could indicate underlying weakness in medium-term upward momentum.

Per insights, the Toncoin price chart highlights a bullish outlook after forming a bullish reversal pattern known as the double bottom. The chart highlights a set that resembles a W-shaped letter, suggesting a renewed demand pressure with two significant reversals. This pattern formation coincides with the ascending support trendline. This dynamic support has been acting as a critical buyer accumulation zone. The completion of this pattern could trigger a rally that could bolster TON’s price towards a $20 peak. Moreover, the Toncoin ecosystem is also experiencing rapid growth, with its holder count showing an impressive rise over recent months. Currently, TON has surpassed 120 million, highlighting the rapid adoption of its blockchain ecosystem. If this bullish trend continues, TON could outpace ETH users by year-end. Amid the current market recovery, Toncoin’s price has notably surged from a low of $4.5 to a high of $6.03. This growth has positioned the TON token at a 3% discount from challenging a significant downsloping trendline, which has existed since July 2024. A potential breakout could push its value toward the $6 and $7.2 levels and beyond $20. It can, however, sustain its correction phase if the altcoin witnesses renewed selling pressures at the dynamic resistance Remittix (RTX) Sees Increased Investor Attention $RTX tokens are currently available at an enticing price of $0.015, creating a low barrier to entry for this new protocol.

The international financial body highlighted on Wednesday the reduced risks from Bitcoin adoption as businesses in the country now have the option to decline it. The global lender also praised the government for improving fiscal stability, stimulating the economy, lowering inflation and addressing short-term debt. President Nayib Bukele’s government has eased its Bitcoin-related policies, a key hurdle in past negotiations. New legal reforms let the private sector decide whether to accept the cryptocurrency. As a result, the IMF stated that risks from El Salvador’s Bitcoin project have “diminished significantly.” Further, the government will gradually reduce its role in the Chivo crypto wallet, which has faced many technical problems. The IMF and the EL Salvador government have reached a staff-level agreement on a 40-month EFF arrangement to support the government's economic reforms. The agreement with is subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board. https://t.co/1GLjFsEhVl pic.twitter.com/M1U77Flz4f — IMF (@IMFNews) December 18, 2024 El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy Drew IMF Warnings and Moody’s Downgrade El Salvador’s relationship with the IMF became tense after Bukele made Bitcoin legal tender in Sept. 2021. By Nov. 2022, Bukele announced plans for the government to purchase 1 BTC daily. The IMF has consistently raised concerns about the economic and legal challenges of adopting Bitcoin as a parallel legal tender, citing significant macroeconomic, financial and legal risks. Credit agencies like Moody’s downgraded El Salvador, attributing the decision to Bukele’s fiscal policies and Bitcoin adoption. Further, the fund has repeatedly urged El Salvador to revise its Bitcoin policy . It recommended scaling back the Bitcoin Law by removing its legal tender status, dissolving the $150m Bitcoin conversion trust fund and avoiding the issuance of Bitcoin-backed bonds. Bukele Celebrates Bitcoin Surge, IMF Deal Awaits Final Approval Earlier this month, as Bitcoin’s price crossed $100,000 for the first time, Bukele announced that El Salvador’s crypto holdings had more than doubled in value . He blamed political opponents for discouraging Salvadorans from benefiting from Bitcoin’s rise. While the agreement still awaits approval from the IMF’s executive board, it addresses a major concern for investors in El Salvador’s bond markets. The board is expected to review and approve the program by early February, provided the agreed measures are implemented.

BTC fell under $100,000 in late U.S. hours before slightly recovering during early Asian hours Thursday, as the Federal Reserve hinted at a few rate cuts in 2025. Fed chair Jerome Powell then said at a post-FOMC press conference that the central bank wasn’t allowed to own bitcoin under current regulations — in response to a question about President-elect Donald Trump’s strategic reserve promises.  ""That's the kind of thing that Congress should consider, but we are not looking for a law change,"" Powell said. In a July campaign, Trump said the government would keep 100% of all the bitcoin it currently holds or acquires in the future under his administration — referring to the stockpile of seized BTC held by the country.  BTC fell 3% after Powell’s comments, causing a dive across majors. XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana’s SOL fell as much as 5.5%, with BNB Chain’s BNB and ether (ETH) down 2.5%. Chainlink’s LINK fared the worst with a 10% drop — erasing some gains from earlier in the week as Trump-backed World Liberty Financial purchased $2 million worth of the tokens.  The market slide led to over $700 million in bullish bets liquidated, with futures tracking smaller altcoins and meme tokens recording higher losses than BTC or ETH futures in an unusual move, data shows.  A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the trader's inability to meet the margin requirements. Large-scale liquidations can indicate market extremes, like panic selling or buying.  A cascade of liquidations might suggest a market turning point, where a price reversal could be imminent due to an overreaction in market sentiment.  Some traders say Powell’s comment may mark a local top, dampening expectations of a continued rally toward the end of the month.  “Crypto markets may have entered a peak if a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve is no longer in play, as this promise helped to fuel the recent months' rally to new all-time highs, Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, shared with CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Although an interest rate cut would normally have a bullish reaction since it was largely expected, the market strongly reacted after Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that inflation would be a continuing problem throughout the next year.”  Traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital, however, remain generally bullish for the coming year.  “Don't get shaken out of your positions if a drop occurs.

Here’s What You Should Know appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has been surging since the start of the quarter and the U.S. election results offered a huge boost to the rally. With this, the price soared effortlessly and marked highs above $108K, marking a fresh ATH. However, what happened next raised some concerns as the price quickly dropped below $100,000 with the Fed Chair comments on the Bitcoin reserve. This suggests the BTC price could be rising with hope but when they are facing reality, it has negatively impacted the price. Does this signal the rise in the BTC price since November is just a hopium? Will the price face a sell-off after Donald Trump resumes office? After the win, Trump had shared his plans of setting up a Bitcoin reserve, which created huge bullish waves across the markets, driving the price to new highs. However, the Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell, recently commented against forming a ‘National Bitcoin Reserve’. He said that the agency is not allowed to own Bitcoin and they have no plans for a law change, responding to a question to know his thoughts on the BTC reserve. In no time, the BTC price dropped really hard, which raises concerns over it’s performance in 2025 after the new president assumes office. What’s Next—Will BTC Price Face a Crash? In the past 24 hours, contracts worth over $400 million have been liquidated, of which longs have liquidated for more than $335 million and shorts for nearly $83 million. This points towards the market participants waiting for a substantial downturn during Donald Trump’s inauguration. The prediction of a likelihood of unfullied investor expectations regarding swift policy reforms is much expected, as citied by Arthur Hayes, CEO of Bitmex. However, these are just speculations, and the real impact is not much distinct with just a month remaining. Besides the rise in spot ETF volumes, MicroStratergy’s growing BTC holdings strengthen hopes of a consistent upswing. As rightly said by a popular analyst, Lark Davis , the Bitcoin price is expected to keep on moving to it’s ATH as Trump is taking office soon.

37829009,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394958,1734588256,WazirX News Today: Delhi High Court Orders Fresh Probe into $235M Hack,"The post WazirX News Today: Delhi High Court Orders Fresh Probe into $235M Hack appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News WazirX hack news has taken a dramatic turn as the Delhi High Court ordered a fresh investigation into the $235 million breach , following the Police’s failure to find criminal evidence in their initial probe. Coinciding with this development, Binance declared its intent to delist WazirX’s native token, WRX , on December 18th, escalating challenges for the exchange. Allegation of Fraud and North Korea Involvement The court’s directive came regarding a cyber attack reportedly from the North Korean hacking group, that was able exploit the vulnerabilities of the intended platform during the period of sJuly 2024. While attempts to recovery the stolen money have been made , only 57 percent of the lost amount could be recovered implying that 43 percent of the stolen customer money is untraceable. It also drew focus to Masud Alam, a man from West Bengal, who was arrested in November. Alam is alleged to have signed up the fake account which was later sold to a hacker through the Telegram platform to affect WazirX. The actual perpetrator of the attack as still on the loose and this increases pressure on the police force to produce good results. Of Binance, Delisting and WRX Impacts The ruling arrived shortly after Binance moved to suspend its WRX listings over the company’s failure to meet the set operational norms. Although Binance, which has always refuted having any ownership stake in WazirX, says the mentioned exchange platform is operating under Indian laws by Zanmai Labs. The delisting due to be implemented on December 25 has already sparked reactions in the market, with the value of WRX falling over 51% as of writing. Regarding operational integrity concerns, investors’ trust in the platform is still declining. A Path to Recovery? Recently WazirX has stated that it intends to relaunch the platform with a focus on better service and increased transparency and has announced its 5th town hall meeting. It has the vision to begin reopening under a recovery-oriented strategy, with the key of forging a new-age DEX. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37829008,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394960,1734588179,5 Emerging Altcoins That Could Make You Rich Starting With $100 FXGuys,"The post 5 Emerging Altcoins That Could Make You Rich Starting With $100 FXGuys appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market continues to create life-changing opportunities for investors willing to bet on high potential altcoins . With as little as $100, savvy investors can gain exposure to emerging projects with exponential growth potential. Among these altcoins, FXGuys ($FXG) stands out as the most promising, leading the charge as a Top PropFi Project . Let’s explore FXGuys and four other emerging altcoins that could deliver massive returns in the next bull cycle. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 1. FXGuys ($FXG): The Future of Trade2Earn and Staking FXGuys is redefining the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape with its unique Trade2Earn model and revolutionary Trader Funding Program . Designed as more than just a token, FXGuys combines trading incentives with a robust staking system, making it the best defi token for investors looking to maximize returns. Staking Rewards : The FXGuys ecosystem rewards investors through high-yield staking programs that generate passive income. Utility-Driven Token : The $FXG token powers the FXGuys platform, offering real-world utility through funding opportunities for traders and yield incentives for holders. Low Entry Price : At just $0.04, FXGuys presents a golden opportunity for investors to enter early and ride the wave of its projected growth. FXGuys has already raised millions during its presale stages, with demand continuing to surge. For investors seeking top defi coins with explosive potential, FXGuys is the leading choice. 2. Raydium (RAY): A Solana Ecosystem Powerhouse Raydium, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) within the Solana blockchain, offers a combination of low fees and lightning-fast transactions. Its innovative liquidity pools and automated market-making (AMM) features make it a favorite among traders. Why It Stands Out : Raydium integrates with other Solana projects, enhancing its ecosystem value. Growth Potential : With Solana’s resurgence, Raydium could see significant price appreciation. 3. Flow (FLOW): The Go-To Platform for NFTs and Gaming Flow is a high-performance blockchain specifically designed for NFTs, gaming, and consumer applications. Known for powering projects like NBA Top Shot, Flow has earned a solid reputation in the digital asset space. Why It Stands Out : Its scalability and developer-friendly ecosystem make it ideal for mainstream adoption. Growth Potential : As NFT markets rebound, Flow is well-positioned to capitalize on renewed interest. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 4. Movement (MOVE): A Rising Star in DeFi Movement (MOVE) is an emerging altcoin focused on providing cutting-edge solutions for decentralized finance. With a growing user base and active development, MOVE is quickly gaining momentum. Why It Stands Out : MOVE’s focus on scalable, low-fee DeFi products sets it apart in the competitive market. Growth Potential : Its accessibility and utility make it a strong contender in the high potential altcoins category. 5. Arweave (AR): A Leader in Decentralized Storage Arweave is revolutionizing data storage with its permanent, decentralized storage solutions. As demand for decentralized cloud services grows, Arweave remains one of the most valuable tokens in the space. Why It Stands Out : Arweave’s “permaweb” ensures data is securely stored forever, a unique feature among storage solutions. Growth Potential : Growing enterprise adoption could significantly drive AR’s value in the coming years. Why FXGuys Is Leading the Pack While all these altcoins present strong growth opportunities, FXGuys stands out for its unique combination of trading utility, staking rewards, and a low entry point. Backed by its innovative Trader Funding Program and Trade2Earn model, FXGuys is attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors, positioning it among the best proprietary trading firms and top defi coins of 2024. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Conclusion With just $100, investors can enter the crypto market and gain exposure to projects like FXGuys ($FXG) , Raydium, Flow, Movement, and Arweave. Each of these altcoins brings unique value to the ecosystem, but FXGuys’ blend of utility, staking, and growth potential makes it the clear frontrunner. For those seeking the next top defi coin or high potential altcoin , FXGuys is the ultimate opportunity to turn a small investment into life-changing returns.

Metaplanet and The Bitcoin Strategy Following the adoption of the Bitcoin strategy earlier this year, which has seen the company accumulate over 1,142 BTCs, Metaplanet is projecting the first fiscal year operating profit since 2017. Furthermore, the company’s stock market has rallied like a meme coin this year, with a return of about 2,068 percent year-to-date (YTD) to trade at about ¥3,685 at the time of this writing. Having added the Bitcoin treasury operations as the official new business line, Metaplanet is well positioned to attract more investors akin to MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) . Late last month, Metaplanet announced the issuance of moving strike stock acquisition rights to raise ¥9.5 billion, equivalent to about $62 million , for accelerated Bitcoin accumulation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Japan Considers National Bitcoin Reserve as Countries Embrace Crypto , Market Impact The relentless Bitcoin accumulation by Metaplanet has strengthened the Bitcoin market in the Asian region.

Here is why you do not want to miss this PropFi altcoin investment opportunity! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE ME Token Struggles While a New DeFi Coin Rises With a 100x Profit Potential Magic Eden’s ME token was introduced on December 10, 2024, with an airdrop valued at more than $700 million. Initially, the token traded at around $4.50 , reaching a peak of $8.26 before dropping sharply to stabilize near $5.07. More than 70,000 users acquired 69 million tokens within the first hour, but most faced issues like app glitches and claim errors . Despite the challenges, traders leveraged the volatility, with one making $586,800 in profit.

This isn’t just a one-time act; Nexo is committed to Bitcoin’s future, ensuring its security for generations of HODLers to come. The collaboration between Nexo and Brink extends beyond finance.

37828349,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630094,1734586454,BOJ pauses rate hikes amid Trump’s tariff fear,"On Thursday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its key interest rate unchanged and decided against demands for a rate increase following Trump’s tariff fear. The Yen, consequently, tanked against the U.S. dollar and the Australian dollar, and it saw slow growth just before the parliament’s return to Tokyo for a pivotal session next week. According to The Japan Times , the BOJ’s decision came after a two-day policy meeting. In the meeting, analysts were split over whether rates should be raised to 0.5 percent or held at the current 0.25 percent. Markets had already begun to anticipate the BOJ’s decision, moving on to a pause. The cautious measure came after two 2024 rate hikes ended a years-long spell of negative interest rates . Markets are waiting for BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda’s updates about the bank’s next moves when he addresses the decision later. Tokyo holds rate hike asTrump tariffs continue to raise significant questions Japan's central bank kept its monetary policy settings steady, signaling it sees little urgency to raise interest rates for now https://t.co/qE5HspeK3u — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) December 19, 2024 The BOJ’s statement of its decision to hold an interest hike revealed that it was a split 8-1 decision, with only board member Naoki Tamura voting for a 25 bps hike. The decision surprised economists in a Reuters poll who advocated for a 25 basis point hike like Tamura. Credit Agricole Securities Asia’s analysts concluded that the decision to leave rates unchanged was due to the government’s opposing pressure for a third rate hike this year. Japanese officials were concerned that the real growth in 2024 would be negative. The uncertainty was exacerbated by Trump’s threat of further tariffs on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican goods. The trade strategy – promoted as a tool for preventing illegal immigration and drug trafficking – raised questions regarding the encouragement of the beginning of a more general attack on the global trading system. Japan, one of the top FDI (foreign direct investors) in the U.S., also feared the possibility of being hit by Trump’s trade tariffs, especially in the automotive industry. The U.S.-Japan tie will, however, depend on Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s ability to develop a strong relationship with the incoming administration. Trump mentioned on Monday that he would ‘love to see Japan’s Prime Minister, signaling an openness to meet Ishiba. He, however, added that it was Tokyo’s decision whether the meeting happened before or after his January inauguration. The country’s officials said plans were underway for a Trump-Ishiba meeting in the shortest time possible. Trump unveiled sweeping and ambitious economic policy changes that prompted concern and optimism among domestic and foreign markets. His proposals included implementing new steep tariffs, which economists said could have dire consequences. Michael Gapen, the chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, pointed out the uncertain outlook due to the potential policy changes, highlighting the apprehension surrounding Trump’s economic agenda. His analysis painted a scenario where severe fallout could occur if the policies were implemented as planned. “The information the Bank of Japan wanted most today was what the Fed thought about rate cuts next year. The Fed gave the impression that they weren’t in a hurry. There is a FOMC meeting in January, and with an assumption that the Fed would keep current rates steady next month, if the market becomes stronger for the dollar and weaker for the yen, the BOJ will have a better chance to raise interest rates.” – Mari Iwashita , Executive Economist, Daiwa Securities, Tokyo Takumi Tsunoda, Senior Economist at Tokyo’s Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute, agreed, ‘The BOJ should be able to raise rates easily at the January meeting.’ Charu Chanana, the Chief Investment Strategist at Singapore’s ‘SAXO, doubted that ‘Ueda can clearly signal a January rate hike given the uncertainties around the Fed and Trump presidency’ at his public address on the BOJ’s plans later today. The Yen loses against major world currencies following the BOJ’s decision The USD/JPY and the ADU/JPY currency pairs declined due to concerns about the BOJ’s decision to maintain its current interest rate. NBC Connecticut reported that the Yen weakened against the U.S. dollar after the BOJ’s rate decision. On December 19, it went down past the key level of 156 against the U.S. dollar. Japan’s currency slid as much as 0.4% to November levels of 155.44 before hitting a one-month low, trading at 155.42. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.85%. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey said they were closely watching the 155 level, seeing it as a potential trigger for a verbal intervention from Japanese authorities. Christopher Wong, a currency strategist at OCBC, observed that the Fed’s pause and the BOJ’s reluctance suggested further upward pressure for the dollar/yen. Ms Charu Chanana, the chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets, said the ‘Fed’s hawkish tilt and BOJ’s pause could give Yen traders fresh reasons to ‘carry’ on.’ The JPY also started losing ground against the AUD for the second consecutive session when it traded at 97 during the European hours on Wednesday in anticipation of the BOJ’s Thursday decision. The AUD/JPY extended its losses amid increasing pressure on the AUD of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). On Wednesday, the NAB (National Australia Bank) maintained its prediction of the first RBA rate cut during the May 2025 meeting. However, they agreed that a February rate cut was also possible. Japan’s Ministry of Finance unexpectedly announced the country’s trade deficit improvement on December 18 despite the falling Yen. November’s trade deficit had narrowed to ¥117.6 billion, an improvement from October’s ¥462.1 billion. The improvement was mainly attributed to a 3.8% YoY export growth in November. However, the country’s trade data pointed to weakening domestic demand amid Japan’s uncertain economic outlook and concerns about Trump’s tariffs, which possibly contributed to the BOJ’s decision. The Yen also traded down 0.4% at 114.03, weakening against the Singapore dollar.

37829634,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52536,1734586259,"December’s Must-Watch Altcoins: Ethereum, Dogecoin, and a Rising GambleFi Utility Token!","With most investors looking to 2025 and beyond, crypto analysts are warning that there is still the potential for big profit in 2024. These analysts have released a list of three must-watch top altcoins for December: Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and GambleFi utility superstar Rollblock (RBLK) . Crypto casino Rollblock’s 100x growth potential is the biggest for 2024 if its crypto presale ends before the new year. Rollblock Redefines GambleFi Utility With Profit Sharing Rollblock’s spectacular potential for growth out of its crypto presale is due to the massive revenue up for grabs in the global gambling industry. This industry generates over $500 billion in revenue each year, and a growing share of this revenue is moving online. Rollblock is now the undisputed top utility token of the GambleFi space. Rollblock offers both premier sports betting and more than 7,000 of the best casino games in the industry. All of this takes place on the blockchain, which means no more of the red tape, shady odds and hidden fees that have plagued online gambling for decades. Rollblock has also taken the unprecedented step of incorporating profit sharing directly into its operations. Rollblock believes that its system of staking rewards and burn events fueled by buybacks will create blistering growth in its player count. This player growth will then fuel even greater profits in a virtuous cycle that will ultimately send RBLK soaring higher. Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar on Staking Approval The potential for staking approval is already moving the Ethereum price higher in December. An inflow of almost $300 million into its spot ETFs moved the Ethereum price another 10% higher this week. Ethereum ETFs were denied the ability to stake their tokens as part of their approval by the SEC. Now, a more pro-crypto SEC is likely to lift this restriction on Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum has the potential to rally another 25% higher before 2025 if this staking restriction is lifted. Meme Coin King Dogecoin Bounces Back After Security Threat The Dogecoin price is bouncing back after a recent attack on its protocol had meme coin investors running for the exits. The Dogecoin price is already back more than 6% this week after the developer team addressed this security breach. The Dogecoin price fell as much as 20% on the news that over 50% of the nodes on its network were down at one point. This downturn marked the top of an over 300% rally for Dogecoin in a little over one month. Now Dogecoin is ready to resume this blistering rally and is expected to roar another 50% higher before 2025. Crypto Whales Could Make Rollblock Top Performer of 2024 Rollblock’s potential to outshine both Dogecoin and Ethereum at the end of 2024 depends on its crypto presale. While Rollblock does have three stages remaining, analysts warn that a handful of crypto whales could buy these tokens out in a matter of minutes. With over 100x growth expected from its current price of $0.0415, it remains a strong possibility that RBLK is the top performer in the final days of 2024.

37828175,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99107,1734586234,"Here’s When Bitcoin Will Hit Massive $350,000 Price Tag, According To ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad Author’","The crypto market is not short of ambitious six-figure Bitcoin targets, and Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the personal finance book Rich Dad Poor Dad, known for years as a Bitcoin bull, remains optimistic about 2025. While Bitcoin has slumped after setting a new all-time high above $108,000 on Tuesday, Kiyosaki still thinks BTC can reach $350,000 next year. Robert Kiyosaki Sees $350K Bitcoin In 2025 In a post on X, Robert Kiyosaki reminded his 2.6 million followers that Donald Trump, the first-ever Bitcoin president in the United States, was reelected into office last month. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump made several crypto-related promises, including establishing a strategic Bitcoin stockpile. The concept has since picked up steam both in the U.S. and abroad. While there have been plenty of discussions and proposals, lawmakers have yet to review in detail a clear roadmap and timeline for the enactment of the national BTC reserve. Nevertheless, Kiyosaki believes the premier crypto Bitcoin will skyrocket to a new epic high in 2025 and reach a staggering $350,000 per BTC. Thus, he said, it makes sense to acquire more Bitcoin. “BITCOIN to $350K in 2025. OWN more BITCOIN in 2025,” Kiyosaki posited. Interestingly, a Bitcoiner created a poll to find out whether other Kiyosaki followers believe the flagship crypto will indeed reach $350,000 heights next year. Although only a handful of X users responded to the poll, the majority of the responders are skeptical of the sky-high price target. Are Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Predictions Reliable? Since May. 2020, Kiyosaki has been a huge advocate for asset classes that cannot be directly manipulated by the Fed, having once advised investors to “Get Bitcoin and save yourself” after the Fed launched its mass money printing sprees to bolster the economy during the pandemic. It’s worth noting that Kiyosaki has a rather questionable track record of predicting Bitcoin’s price. Back in June, the best-selling author predicted that Bitcoin would be worth $350,000 by August. We are already in December, and the crypto’s current all-time high stands at $108,135 following the parabolic rally witnessed in recent weeks. Kiyosaki recently suggested that BTC was headed to $500,000 in 2025 and then climb past $1 million by 2030. In his belief, the gargantuan price appreciation would be triggered by artificial intelligence (AI) dramatically disrupting the global financial sector. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $101,046, down roughly 2.7% over the last 24 hours.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/heres-when-bitcoin-will-hit-massive-350000-price-tag-according-to-rich-dad-poor-dad-author/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37828087,https://coinpaper.com/6616/black-rock-disclaimer-sparks-controversy-on-bitcoin-scarcity,1734586200,BlackRock Disclaimer Sparks Controversy on Bitcoin Scarcity,"El Salvador’s move to scale back its Bitcoin initiatives as part of a $1.4 billion IMF loan deal, and renewed debates over Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply cap following BlackRock’s latest explainer video, highlight ongoing tensions between the cryptocurrency’s transformative potential and the practical challenges it faces. Bitcoin’s 21 Million Supply Cap: Unwavering or Vulnerable? The debate over Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million has once again taken center stage in the cryptocurrency community, following a provocative disclaimer in a recent explainer video by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. The video, which aims to shed light on Bitcoin’s fundamentals, has ignited speculation over whether its famously fixed supply cap is as immutable as many investors believe. Released on Dec. 17, BlackRock’s three-minute video touted Bitcoin’s capped supply as a key factor underpinning its value as a deflationary asset. However, a disclaimer in the video raised eyebrows: “There is no guarantee that bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” This statement has sparked a flurry of discussions, with critics and supporters alike weighing in on the implications for Bitcoin’s future. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap has been integral to its reputation as “digital gold.” By limiting supply, Bitcoin mirrors gold’s scarcity while eliminating the risks of monetary debasement associated with fiat currencies. This deflationary design has made Bitcoin a store of value, particularly in inflationary economic environments. BlackRock’s video focuses on this point, stating that Bitcoin’s hard-coded rule “controls supply, purchasing power and helps avoid the potential misuse of printing more and more currency.” Yet the disclaimer hints at the theoretical possibility of altering this cap, a notion that runs counter to Bitcoin’s core ethos and could shake investor confidence. MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and vocal Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor reposted the video, amplifying its reach and sparking further debate. Detractors, such as Joel Valenzuela, Director of Marketing and Business Development at Dashpay, expressed skepticism, claiming that such a change would undermine Bitcoin’s legitimacy. Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis also chimed in, asserting, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Could the Supply Cap Be Changed? Technically, Bitcoin’s supply cap could be altered through a hard fork, a process that would require widespread consensus among Bitcoin stakeholders, including node operators, developers, miners, and investors. However, such a change would be contentious and complex. Bitcoin developer “Super Testnet,” the mind behind BitVM, explained that while a hard fork could theoretically create a new blockchain with an uncapped supply, it would no longer represent Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin . “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” said Super Testnet, referencing Bitcoin’s whitepaper. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” This perspective suggests that any version of Bitcoin with an altered supply cap would lack the philosophical and economic underpinnings that make Bitcoin distinct. As history has shown, such changes are unlikely to gain traction. During the Blocksize War of 2016–2017, a proposal to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit was supported by 95% of miners but was ultimately rejected by node operators and the broader community, leading to the creation of Bitcoin Cash instead. The primary argument for uncapping Bitcoin’s supply centers on its long-term security model. Bitcoin miners rely on block subsidies and transaction fees to maintain the network. However, block subsidies halve approximately every four years, creating a financial challenge for miners unless Bitcoin’s price or transaction fees rise significantly. As of now, miners earn 3.125 BTC per block, worth around $316,950 at current prices. This reward will halve to 1.625 BTC in 2028, putting further pressure on the economic viability of mining. The final Bitcoin is projected to be mined in 2140, after which miners will depend entirely on transaction fees. Some argue that Bitcoin’s application layer, including developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, must evolve to sustain sufficient network activity and fee revenue for miners. During the Bitcoin Ordinals craze, transaction fees spiked, benefiting miners. However, such periods of high activity are often short-lived. While miners have a vested interest in sustaining the network’s profitability, their influence alone is insufficient to enforce changes, as demonstrated during the Blocksize War. The broader community’s resistance to altering Bitcoin’s rules suggests that any proposal to increase the supply cap would face significant hurdles. The debate over Bitcoin’s supply cap is not merely technical but deeply philosophical. For many in the community, Bitcoin’s fixed supply is sacrosanct, a core principle that defines its identity and value. Any move to change it would likely fracture the community and create competing chains, as seen with Bitcoin Cash. BlackRock’s disclaimer, while hypothetical, has reignited this longstanding debate, reminding the community of Bitcoin’s decentralized governance structure. Ultimately, the question of whether Bitcoin’s supply cap is truly fixed may rest not on its code but on the collective will of its stakeholders to preserve its foundational principles. As of now, Bitcoin’s identity as “digital gold” remains intact, but the ongoing discussion serves as a potent reminder of the delicate balance between innovation and tradition in the cryptocurrency world. El Salvador to Scale Back Bitcoin Initiatives as Part of IMF Loan Agreement In other Bitcoin news, El Salvador , the first country in the world to adopt BTC as legal tender, is set to significantly scale back its Bitcoin-related initiatives in a move tied to securing a $1.4 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This agreement marks a significant shift in the Central American nation’s approach to cryptocurrency, aiming to address its mounting debt challenges while reducing the risks associated with its Bitcoin experiment. The IMF announced on Dec. 18 that the loan agreement spans 40 months and includes measures designed to lower El Salvador’s debt-to-GDP ratio. The deal also introduces sweeping reforms to the country's cryptocurrency policies, reversing some of the bold steps taken under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership since Bitcoin was made legal tender in 2021. Among the most notable changes is the plan to make Bitcoin acceptance by private-sector merchants voluntary rather than mandatory. When the Bitcoin Law was enacted in June 2021, businesses were required to accept the cryptocurrency as a means of payment if they had the technological capability to do so. This policy, which sparked global attention and criticism, will now be revised to allow businesses to choose whether to accept Bitcoin. “For the public sector, engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of Bitcoin will be confined,” the IMF said in its statement . Additionally, the government’s involvement in the state-backed Chivo wallet, which facilitates Bitcoin transactions for citizens, will be gradually reduced. Taxes in El Salvador will also continue to be payable only in US dollars, the country’s official currency. El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office has reported that the country currently holds 5,968.8 BTC, worth approximately $602 million at current market prices. However, Bitcoin usage among Salvadorans has remained low. A recent survey conducted in October revealed that 92% of respondents did not use Bitcoin for transactions, a slight increase from the 88% reported in a 2023 survey. Despite the low adoption rates, President Bukele’s administration has continued to promote Bitcoin as a key part of its economic strategy, touting its potential to attract tourism and foreign investment. The IMF, however, has repeatedly raised concerns about the speculative nature of Bitcoin and its potential to destabilize the country’s economy. IMF’s Conditions and Broader Financing Plan The $1.4 billion loan agreement is contingent on the IMF Executive Board’s approval. If approved, the agreement will unlock additional financing from global institutions, including the World Bank, bringing the total financial package to over $3.5 billion. These funds aim to stabilize El Salvador’s economy, which has faced mounting debt and limited fiscal space. The IMF has long criticized Bukele’s Bitcoin policies, citing risks tied to volatility, financial instability, and the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market. The institution views the latest agreement as a step toward mitigating these risks and aligning El Salvador’s economic policies with global standards. Reactions to the IMF agreement have been mixed. Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and adviser to President Bukele, dismissed the IMF’s measures as “bureaucratic, meaningless nonsense.” In a series of posts on X, Keiser claimed that Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador remains robust and growing despite IMF objections. “Bitcoin use in El Salvador was always voluntary and its usage has never been higher,” Keiser wrote, dismissing concerns about the reforms' impact on adoption. However, critics argue that the low adoption rates among Salvadorans undermine the administration’s claims of Bitcoin success. Many point to surveys showing limited usage of Bitcoin for everyday transactions as evidence that the policy has failed to resonate with the public. The reforms signal a pragmatic shift in El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment. While President Bukele’s government has championed Bitcoin as a tool for economic empowerment and innovation, the new measures suggest that financial stability and debt reduction have taken precedence over furthering the cryptocurrency agenda. The gradual unwinding of the Chivo wallet, the voluntary nature of Bitcoin acceptance for merchants, and the limited public-sector involvement indicate a significant pivot. However, the government’s substantial Bitcoin holdings and the continued promotion of Bitcoin-related tourism and investment projects suggest that El Salvador is not entirely abandoning its crypto ambitions. As El Salvador navigates its obligations under the IMF agreement, the global cryptocurrency community will closely watch how these reforms impact the country’s Bitcoin narrative and its broader economic landscape. While the era of mandatory Bitcoin adoption may be coming to an end, the legacy of El Salvador’s bold experiment will likely influence debates about cryptocurrency adoption worldwide for years to come.",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | FORKS,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6616/black-rock-disclaimer-sparks-controversy-on-bitcoin-scarcity,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

This is a big deal for the crypto world because Crenshaw has been against crypto. The majority of the lawyer’s community has voiced against her renomination with over 107,000 emails from crypto supporters, helping block her re-nomination. Now, everyone is eyeing a pro-SEC Commissioner who might be more supportive of cryptocurrencies. What’s Happening at the SEC? Caroline Crenshaw, who has been a Commissioner at the SEC since 2022, is known for being tough on crypto. As per Elenor Terror, Fox Business Journalist the Senate decided not to move forward with her re-nomination, leaving a spot open at the SEC. This is important because the SEC controls rules for financial markets, including crypto. Apart from Crenshaw’s exit, Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, is also expected to leave in January . Gensler has been tough on crypto, but his replacement, Paul Atkins , is expected to be more supportive of the industry. This could mean fewer regulations and more freedom for crypto to grow. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Fed’s Anti-Bitcoin Stance Triggers Major Crypto Market Sell-off , Who Could Replace Crenshaw?

37827950,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52535,1734585395,Flare Integrates XRP on Test Network,"Flare, a blockchain platform, has officially launched FXRP, a tokenized representation of XRP, on its Songbird test network. This release marks a significant milestone following the completion of an open beta phase involving 48,000 participants. During the beta testing period, the system processed over 263,000 mints and 395,000 redemptions, highlighting the potential for broader adoption. Integration Details and Features The FXRP integration incorporates a unique verification feature called the “handshake” mechanism, which allows authorized agents to validate wallet addresses participating in minting and redemption activities. This system is a step toward bridging non-smart contract cryptocurrencies, such as XRP , Bitcoin, and Dogecoin, with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Testing on Songbird will span six weeks for each asset, operating under specific financial parameters to ensure security and reliability. Flare has introduced a $2 million issuance cap per asset and offers $300,000 in loss protection through Flare Labs, providing an added layer of security for participants. Collateral for this testing phase will be backed by Songbird’s native token (SGB) and USDX, a stablecoin linked to U.S. Treasury values. Incentives for Testing Participation To encourage active engagement, Flare has allocated $260,000 in rewards through rFLR tokens for users involved in minting, redeeming, and trading FXRP. Participants can access the system via various minting applications, reducing reliance on any single platform and mitigating centralization risks. Developers also have access to comprehensive testing parameters through the Flare Developer Hub, ensuring a wide range of tools for experimentation. The FAssets protocol, which powers FXRP , utilizes an over-collateralization model to provide security and stability. Each bridged token is backed by collateral exceeding its value, a strategy that sets it apart from traditional bridging approaches that rely on custody or multi-signature wallets. Additionally, automated liquidation processes are in place to maintain system stability and protect user assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Addressing Market Limitations The integration of FXRP addresses a critical gap in cryptocurrency markets—the limited ability of non-smart contract tokens to interact with DeFi systems. By tokenizing these assets, Flare enables their use in activities such as lending, trading, and staking, unlocking new opportunities while maintaining security through robust collateralization measures. The ongoing Songbird testing phase is a preparatory step before the potential deployment of FXRP on Flare’s main network. This stage aims to identify and resolve operational challenges and optimize the system for scalability and reliability. Flare’s infrastructure incorporates decentralized oracles at the network level, which support data processing for various blockchain operations. This setup enables the seamless handling of price feeds, blockchain events, and external API data, all critical components for DeFi functionalities. By focusing on advanced asset-bridging techniques and maintaining strict collateralization protocols, Flare demonstrates its commitment to balancing accessibility with security in cross-chain operations. This initiative aligns with the broader industry trend of integrating traditional cryptocurrencies into the rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem. The FXRP integration on Songbird signifies Flare’s innovative approach to blockchain interoperability, paving the way for non-smart contract tokens to achieve greater utility in decentralized finance.

Breaking below $2.45 support could trigger further bearish momentum for XRP prices. A move above the $2.60 resistance may signal bullish momentum toward the $2.65–$2.70 levels. XRP plays a significant role in digital payments by facilitating seamless transactions without requiring users to directly hold the asset. This unique feature minimizes exposure to volatility for those who prefer not to hold XRP, while still enabling efficient cross-border payments. But this functionality depends heavily on an active market where XRP holders provide the liquidity necessary to match buyers and sellers. This shows why holding XRP remains relevant and can be strategically advantageous for certain users. Plus, recent price trends and technical analysis underscore critical support and resistance levels, shedding light on its potential short-term movements. I think its first point is completely wrong.

ADA is consolidating and facing hurdles near the $1.020 and $1.040 levels. ADA price started a downward move below the $1.020 support zone. The price is trading below $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.015 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.020 resistance zone. Cardano Price Faces Selling Pressure After struggling to clear the $1.120 resistance zone, Cardano started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $1.10 and $1.050 support levels. The pair even declined below $1.00. A low was formed at $0.9151 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $0.940 resistance level. It cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.1113 swing high to the $0.9151 low. Cardano price is now trading below $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.00 zone. The first resistance is near $1.020. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.015 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.1113 swing high to the $0.9151 low. The next key resistance might be $1.050. If there is a close above the $1.050 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.0650 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.10 in the near term. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.020 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.9450 level. The next major support is near the $0.920 level. A downside break below the $0.920 level could open the doors for a test of $0.90. The next major support is near the $0.8650 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.

Contrary to expectations of a bullish response, the announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, impacting major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, which dropped by 6% and 10%, respectively. Despite the downturn, trading volumes surged by 40% to $251 billion, indicating heightened market activity. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin price down 3% today Bitcoin (BTC) saw a 3% drop over the past 24 hours, trading at $100,880. It reached an intraday low of $98,874 and a high of $105,389. BTC’s market capitalization stands at $2 trillion, with a trading volume of $100 billion and a dominance of 57.12%. BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced significant outflows, totaling $84 million on Wednesday. Grayscale led the outflows at $35 million, followed by Invesco with $25 million. BlackRock’s ETF data remains pending. Meanwhile, the BOB (Build on Bitcoin) initiative continues to gain traction, integrating with Babylon, a Bitcoin staking protocol aimed at expanding BTC’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum price slips 6% today Ethereum (ETH) recorded a 6% dip, trading at $3,652, with a 24-hour range of $3,543 to $3,902. Ethereum maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $440 billion and a trading volume of $52 billion. Ethereum ETFs saw outflows of $79 million, primarily driven by Grayscale ($65 million) and Bitwise ($14.62 million). Amid these developments, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicted that Ethereum could surpass Solana (SOL) in terms of growth by 2025, fueling discussions about the future of decentralized applications (dApps) and scalability. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP and Solana’s prices plunge XRP suffered a steep 10% decline, trading at $2.32 with a market cap of $132 billion and a trading volume of $22 billion. The cryptocurrency fluctuated between $2.184 and $2.585 over the past 24 hours. Ripple expanded its ecosystem by launching RLUSD, a native stablecoin, signaling the company’s ambition to strengthen its presence in the stablecoin market despite the bearish trend. Solana (SOL) dropped by 5% to $209, with a daily low of $200 and a high of $218. Despite the price dip, Solana remains the 6th largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $99 billion. Notably, the Solana network achieved a new all-time high in ecosystem activity, underlining its increasing adoption in the blockchain space. Meme coins slip Meme cryptocurrencies also faced a downturn. Dogecoin (DOGE) declined by 7% to $0.36, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped by 6%, trading at $0.00002425. Other meme coins, including PEPE, BONK, and WIF, experienced losses ranging from 12% to 15%. Top gainers Usual (USUAL): Gained 23%, trading at $1.02, with a 24-hour high of $1.16. Movement (MOVE): Rose by 14% to $0.70, showing robust momentum. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Increased 8% to $0.033, continuing its bullish streak after a Binance listing. Top losers Dogwifhat (WIF): Declined by 14%, trading at $2.26. Floki (FLOKI): Fell 13%, now at $0.00019, as meme coins bore the brunt of market negativity. Theta Network (THETA): Dropped 12% to $2.32, reflecting the broader bearish sentiment. Despite the overall market dip, the hourly charts show signs of recovery, with BTC gaining 0.5% and major altcoins like ETH, XRP, and BNB up by 1%. While the market remains volatile, the increased trading volumes and growing ecosystem developments signal optimism in the short term.

USDT Exchange Inflows Have Remained High Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment discussed the trend in the Exchange Flow Balance for Tether’s USDT. The “Exchange Flow Balance” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the net amount of a given asset entering or exiting the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the inflows outweigh the outflows, and a net amount of the coin is entered into the exchanges’ wallets. Such a trend is usually a sign of demand among investors for trading away the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Demand Should Sustain ETH Above $4,000, IntoTheBlock Says On the other hand, the negative indicator implies the holders are withdrawing a net number of tokens from these platforms. This kind of trend suggests the market is in a phase of accumulation. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Exchange Flow Balance for USDT over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Flow Balance for USDT has observed several large positive spikes over the past month, implying that large investors have been depositing their tokens. For assets like Bitcoin, a positive Exchange Flow Balance can be a bearish sign, as it could suggest the holders are planning to sell. However, the same isn’t true when the asset involved is a stablecoin. Investors generally store their capital in these fiat-tied tokens to avoid the volatility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Such users eventually plan to venture into the volatile side once they feel the conditions are right. And when the time comes, they naturally transfer to exchanges to swap to Bitcoin or whatever desired coin.

37827109,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394844,1734584100,3 Coins Ending the Year Strong and Ready for Even Bigger Moves in 2025,"The post 3 Coins Ending the Year Strong and Ready for Even Bigger Moves in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto market closes its books on 2024, a wave of optimism is sweeping through the final days of the year. December’s end brings not just festive cheer but also an opportunity to spotlight the coins that have captured attention with their strong year-end momentum. So far, $CHO, $DOGE, and $HYPE are looking like the ones to watch for gains by January 1, and there’s a good chance they’ll keep it up into 2025. $CHO $CHO, the native token of Choise.ai , an enterprise crypto platform with over one million users, experienced a 700% spike from February to April, setting a yearly high . With the token’s utility growing through updates to Choise.ai’s expanding ecosystem of products, it seems poised to cap off the year with even greater gains. One of the most recent announcements from Choise.ai highlights their work with Vault , a B2B platform specializing in white-label crypto banking solutions, on Meme Bank, a new Choise.ai ecosystem addition designed to introduce real-world utility for meme coins. This will enable holders to, for example, spend their meme coins in real life via Visa and Mastercard. Meme Bank will actually feature individual banks for each meme coin, offering seamless transactions, exchanges, withdrawals, additional utility-driven features like token burns, staking options, and many more. This is probably going to be huge for $CHO because portions of the token will be burned during transactions within Meme Bank, alongside the associated meme coins, directly increasing their scarcity. With millions of transactions anticipated, $CHO holders stand to benefit as supply decreases and demand grows. In a recent post on X, Choise.ai revealed that the first meme bank will soon be unveiled, with community chatter suggesting that $DOGE will be the inaugural coin, and this means potentially tapping into its massive community of over 6 million active holders. Image Source: X Adding to the momentum, Choise.ai just announced the addition of Ryan Horn, a former Binance executive known for high-profile partnerships like those with Cristiano Ronaldo, to its Board of Directors. Earlier in the year, $CHO’s surge was partly fueled by its listing on BingX, building on its presence on exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC. Now, anticipation is building for a new tier-1 CEX listing, which could significantly broaden its audience and drive further demand. $DOGE As of 2024, meme coins command a staggering market capitalization of over $127 billion. And, even though many of them, such as $PEPE or $POPCAT, have gained serious attention and seen impressive growth, $DOGE, the original meme coin, still stands out as having the most genuine potential. With 11 years under its belt, its rise is driven by utility, not just speculation or hype. $DOGE has already seen a 342% increase in yearly growth, and the last two weeks of 2024 could push it even higher. The most popular meme coin certainly benefited from the overall bullishness in the market, especially after Bitcoin smashed through $100,000. But the momentum continued for another reason: hints from Elon Musk about $DOGE payments for X’s premium features, as well as President Trump’s appointment of Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). The name alone sparked attention, boosting $DOGE’s trading volume and hinting at its expanding utility. Plus, beyond its current use for payments within Tesla and various online and offline stores like Newegg, Jomashop, Burger Bear, Travala, and AirBaltic, $DOGE seems poised for more. After a healthy retest, which followed the big jump in November, $DOGE appears ready to finish the year with even stronger gains. One factor that could fuel this is if it actually becomes the first meme coin bank within Choise.ai’s Meme Bank project. If this scenario unfolds, burning $DOGE with each transaction could drive up demand while decreasing the supply in circulation. Additionally, expanding $DOGE’s utility and increasing its real-world applications could also be a major boost for its further growth. $HYPE Hyperliquid burst onto the scene on November 29 with the launch of its $HYPE token, marking one of the most talked-about token generation events in recent memory. As a decentralized perpetual trading platform and layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid allows users to trade perpetual derivatives and spot assets, all while pulling liquidity from multiple sources. At the heart of the platform is the $HYPE token, which does double duty as both a utility token for trading and the gas token for HyperEVM, the platform’s execution environment. Since its launch, $HYPE quickly climbed into CoinGecko’s top 30 cryptocurrencies. Over $1 billion in USDC net inflows have been recorded, and the token is being celebrated as one of the most successful airdrops ever, despite the absence of any major centralized exchange listings. What sets Hyperliquid apart is its commitment to decentralization; no token supply was allocated to private investors or exchanges, keeping ownership squarely in the hands of its users. The platform’s unique approach to decentralized perpetual trading has resonated with the DeFi community, and its rising popularity suggests it could become a key player in the space. However, with $HYPE’s value skyrocketing by 748% in less than a month, it’s important to tread carefully. While the token shows plenty of promise, its newness and rapid rise call for cautious optimism. Summary It doesn’t matter whether it’s the beginning or end of the year for coins with real potential and ongoing developments to get the recognition they deserve, but this time, the end of the year is lining up perfectly with big things happening for some projects. With teams like Choise.ai constantly building, there’s a lot in store. With the Meme Bank launch on the horizon, $CHO seems set for some nice gains, while $DOGE and $HYPE also have some strong potential to grow.",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/3-coins-ending-the-year-strong-and-ready-for-even-bigger-moves-in-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37827128,https://crypto.news/?p=14320599,1734584092,California Court permits Coinbase to delist Wrapped Bitcoin amid legal battle with BiT Global,"Coinbase has successfully fended off a restraining order sought by BiT Global as a California court ruled in favor of the exchange’s decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin. The Hong Kong-based company BiT Global is allegedly tied to crypto entrepreneur and TRON founder Justin Sun, who had sought the order to prohibit Coinbase from removing Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ), arguing it would inflict “irreparable” damage to its business. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín permits the delisting to move forward as scheduled. The court also observed that “ self-inflicted wounds are not irreparable injury ”, suggesting that BiT Global’s purported injury stemmed from BiT Global’s own actions and decisions and was not caused by Coinbase’s delisting. As covered by crypto.news earlier, the American cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase revealed on Nov. 19 that it would delist wBTC from its platform on Dec. 19. The decision came as a result of Coinbase’s regular review process, which BiT Global alleged was biased. The firm subsequently filed a lawsuit alleging violations of competition laws and libel, claiming the exchange damaged wBTC’s reputation by promoting its own tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC. Coinbase’s legal counsel characterized the suit as frivolous and suggested sanctions could be imposed against both BiT Global and its counsel. They pointed to a failure of evidence to support claims that Coinbase’s actions had caused users to abandon wBTC. You might also like: BiT Global sues Coinbase for $1b over WBTC delisting Coinbase, as a private company, defended its decision and mentioned . A spokesman for the exchange rejected the allegations, saying that they have the right to decide whether to list or delist a token. The company further denied accusations of monopolistic behavior, saying it represented less than one percent of all wBTC trading activity. cbBTC, on the other hand, has taken off since its Sept. launch , with a market cap exceeding $2.11 billion . You might also like: This altcoin could pump 17100% like Solana 3 years ago BiT Global also asserted Justin Sun, the firm’s adviser, had been wrongly involved in the scandal. Still, Coinbase pointed to Sun’s previous accusations of financial misconduct and argued that his distancing from wBTC was a strategic decision. BiT Global also claimed that wBTC is crucial to the crypto ecosystem and defended their stance by accusing Coinbase of impartial listing policies and accusing the exchange of listing meme coins such as Mogcoin ( MOG ) and pepe ( PEPE ) that serve little purpose. So in a court filing today, @Coinbase gave their reason why they delisted wBTC, and it's basically just they don't like Justin Sun. That's really just it. They don't give any technical or legal arguments about why wBTC can't be listed. It's just guilt by association pic.twitter.com/bJmMnAue7x — Pledditor (@Pledditor) December 17, 2024 However, many crypto enthusiasts are siding with BiT Global saying Coinbase’s decision to delist wBTC is because they “don’t like Justin Sun”. Critics further argued that wBTC is more acceptable than cbBTC does not provide proof of reserves, unlike its competitor. A token requires proof of reserves to prove an issuer possesses enough assets to back the token and to expand transparency and trust. For wrapped tokens such as wBTC or cbBTC, it shows that each token is actually 1:1 backed by the original asset, in this case, Bitcoin ( BTC ). The absence of proof of reserves, on the other hand, puts each user at an increased risk of insolvency, fraud, or mismanagement by the issuer.

37833416,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320994,1734583563,Crypto Market Slumps as Bitcoin Drops Below $100K Following Fed’s Rate Cut,"The crypto market’s value dropped 7.5% on Thursday after the Fed Reserve cut the fed funds rate by 25 basis points. The new target range of 4.25%-4.50% met expectations, following which investors moved away from risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies and US equities. Officials signaled they would likely stop cutting rates next year, pointing to a stable labor market and ongoing inflation. However, the Fed’s decision was not unanimous. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack voted to keep rates unchanged. This split underscored concerns about inflation, which remains above the 2% target and is now projected to persist until 2027. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments further affected the market. At a Wednesday news conference, he stated the central bank cannot hold Bitcoin and is not seeking any legislative changes. Regarding the legal complexities of holding bitcoin, Powell clarified “that’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” Chair Powell reads opening statement at the #FOMC press conference on December 18, 2024: https://t.co/STwI9UNB9n — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) December 18, 2024 Uncertainty Over US Bitcoin Reserve Fuels Market Decline His comments led to a drop in Bitcoin’s value, which had previously surged after Donald Trump’s Nov. 5 election win. The rise stemmed from hopes for a more hands-off government approach to assets primarily used for speculation rather than as real currency. Trump has announced plans to create a US Bitcoin strategic reserve. However, he has not provided details about its structure. He mentioned it might begin with Bitcoin seized from criminals, totaling about 200,000 tokens worth roughly $21b at current prices. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed creating this reserve through legislation. Under this proposal, the US Treasury would buy 200,000 bitcoins annually until it collects one million tokens. Funding would come from Federal Reserve bank deposits and gold reserves. Bitcoin last fell 3.2% to $101,127, a day after crossing $108,000 for the first time this year. Ether fell 4.5% to $3,665, while XRP slid 6.8% to $2.35. How Fed Policies Shape Crypto Markets Through Liquidity and Sentiment Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at Swiss-based fintech platform YouHodler, said that cryptocurrencies remain too unpredictable to act as an effective safeguard against conventional currencies in developed economies. “However, they are increasingly viewed as a long-term hedge against inflation. In this context, faster rate cuts by the Fed would inject more liquidity into the financial system, potentially boosting cryptocurrency prices and global interest in the market including Europe,” he said. Lienkha further explained that Fed policies indirectly impact the crypto market. This happens as cryptocurrencies become increasingly linked to traditional financial systems and instruments. “While the administration can directly influence the crypto market through policy decisions and regulatory actions, the Fed’s role is limited to managing monetary policy, which indirectly affects crypto via its impact on liquidity and investor sentiment in the financial ecosystem.” The post Crypto Market Slumps as Bitcoin Drops Below $100K Following Fed’s Rate Cut appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-slumps-bitcoin-drops-fed-rate-cut/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37833416.jpeg

Her term is officially ending in January. The Senate Banking Committee has decided not to Re-nominate her. This feels like a big win for crypto people. Crenshaw has been a huge critic of cryptocurrency and often clashed with the industry. Now, with her departure and resignation of Gary Gensler, things could be very different at the SEC. Crenshaw’s Anti-Crypto Legacy Crypto people would be happy as Caroline Crenshaw’s SEC term ends . She was not exactly a favorite in the space. Her close relations with Gary and following his vision of a tough stance towards crypto made her the target for criticism. As a fun fact, the crypto industry poured millions into lobbying efforts to block her renomination, and it worked. People from the crypto industry spend huge funds to support candidates who align with industry goals. This influence didn’t stop with campaigns. Crypto-friendly Republican senators also pushed hard to ensure Crenshaw wouldn’t continue her role. Even Democrats felt the heat. Sherrod Brown, one of Crenshaw’s supporters, lashed out at the crypto industry, calling their lobbying efforts a “disgusting smear campaign.” But it wasn’t enough to save her spot. What Happens Now? With Crenshaw leaving and Gensler stepping down in January, things are already shifting. President-elect Donald Trump’s administration is shaping up to be much more crypto-friendly. Paul Atkins, who’s known for his pro-crypto views, will take over as SEC Chair. There’s also talk about who might replace Crenshaw. Names like Chris Brummer and TuongVy Le are being floated. Brummer, a blockchain expert, seems to have the strongest backing, but nothing is confirmed yet. If he’s chosen, it would send a clear message: the SEC might finally be ready to work with the crypto industry instead of fighting against it. What’s Next This feels like a turning point. For years, crypto companies have been calling for clearer regulations. Now, they might actually get them. Big names in the industry, like Tyler Winklevoss of Gemini , are already celebrating. He called Crenshaw’s departure “a roadblock removed” and emphasized the need for clear rules. Source : X.com The U.S. has lagged behind other countries in embracing crypto.

John Reed Stark, a former SEC enforcement official and crypto skeptic, recently appeared on Docket Media LLC podcast and opened up about the historic Ripple decisions. He said that the Ripple ruling doesn’t provide broad legal clarity and should only be applied to cases with similar specific facts. He criticized the Ripple decision, claiming that many people misunderstand the ruling, likely because they haven’t fully read it. He argued that Judge Torres was ‘mistaken on multiple counts, a view shared by other judges who have reviewed the case. “There’s so many things about the Ripple decision that people get entirely wrong because I don’t think they read it. It’s completely… it’s respectfully to Judge Torres, I think she was mistaken on multiple counts, as does Judge Rakoff and every single other judge that has looked at that decision (thought),” he said. Stark pointed out that the Ripple decision was twofold. First, he agreed that the initial offering of XRP tokens to sophisticated investors should have been registered as securities to protect those investors. However, Stark disagreed with the decision when it came to the secondary market, where XRP was traded on exchanges. ‘Ripple Decision Created Confusion’ He argued that the lack of a direct relationship between Ripple and retail investors meant they weren’t protected, which he believes is an unfair argument. Stark compared it to buying stocks in companies, where investors don’t have a direct contractual relationship with the company but are still protected under securities regulations. Stark also criticized the Ripple decision for creating confusion, especially after pro-crypto companies began citing it to argue that tokens were not securities. In response, the SEC sought an interlocutory appeal, hoping to stop the ongoing proceedings. However, the judge rejected the SEC’s request, stating that the Ripple decision could not be used as precedent unless the exact same circumstances were present.",NEGATIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-lawsuit-john-reed-stark-says-judge-torres-was-mistaken-slams-ripple-decision/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Replying to a reporter’s question during the press conference following the FOMC decision, Powell said that the Fed has little to do with Bitcoin stockpile. “We are not allowed to own Bitcoin,” said Powell. “That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider.” He further stressed that the central bank is not looking to change that. His statements came after questions about how the government could possibly hold Bitcoin reserve, akin to holding gold. On Wednesday, the Fed lowered interest rates by 0.25% to its current target range of 4.25% and 4.50%, as anticipated. The Federal Reserve Act does not allow the central bank to hold government bonds or highly speculative assets. Though the Fed expanded its asset purchases during economic crisis such as the 2008 financial crash, Bitcoin remains out of its consideration. Powell’s comments coincide with the recent cautious tone on digital assets. He described Bitcoin as a speculative asset, suggesting that its primary competition is with gold rather than the US dollar. In 2021, the Fed chair said that crypto is not useful as a store of value due to its intrinsic volatility. Powell has also differentiated cryptos like Bitcoin and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) , highlighting that the latter is much safer.

Under this proposal, the Treasury would manage Bitcoin as a national asset, starting with 200,000 seized BTC valued at $21 billion. If approved, the initiative could attract investment, reduce market volatility, and further validate Bitcoin’s role in global finance. Experts believe the reserve could be funded by debt issuance or gold reserves, signaling Bitcoin’s increasing significance in U.S. fiscal policy. Bitcoin Recovers to $101,000: Key Support Holds as Traders Eye $103,000 Resistance Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $101,144, up 1.50% for the day, showing signs of recovery after testing key support at $99,480. The price bounced off the upward trendline, highlighting strong buying interest near this level. However, BTC remains below the $103,787 pivot point, which aligns with the 50-day EMA, acting as immediate resistance. A breakout above $103,787 could pave the way for further gains, targeting $105,263 and $107,628. On the downside, failure to hold $99,480 may expose BTC to the next support levels at $97,339 and $95,773. The RSI at 39 shows oversold conditions, suggesting potential for a near-term bounce. However, sustained momentum above the 50 EMA is required to confirm a bullish reversal. For now, Bitcoin trades within a tight range, and traders are closely watching the pivot point for directional clarity. Key Insights : Immediate Resistance : $103,787; Immediate Support : $99,480.

Users should avoid sharing personal details and verify information only through official channels. Beware, ShibArmy Shibarium Trustwatch recently issued another important alert concerning the Shiba Inu community. The team cautioned that scammers request victims to send them an email containing information about the meme coin SHIFU. “Fraudsters are asking people to send them an email asking how to buy and claim SHIFU or if SHIFU has not appeared in their wallet,” the warning reads. The team advised people to remain vigilant and not send emails to anyone. Verifying information through official channels and avoiding sharing personal details is also a must . SHIFU is a dog-themed Shiba Inu-related meme coin introduced by the lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, at the beginning of December. While it is available for trading on certain decentralized exchanges, major platforms like Binance have not yet listed it. Earlier this week, the meme coin project launched a special airdrop. The team revealed that 30% of the token’s total supply (equaling 30 billion SHIFU) will be distributed to the community. 22 billion SHIFU will reach some of those holding at least 100,000 SHIB, and 100 BUBBLE. 2 billion tokens will be allocated to eligible LEASH holders, whereas lucky BONE owners will get 1 billion coins. The remaining 70% of the supply will be distributed for other purposes such as “liquidity and public pre-sale,” treasury, and market initiatives. Previous Warnings Shiba Inu has one of the largest community bases, which explains why fraudsters often target it. Last month, Shibarium Trustwatch cautioned users to stay away from dubious individuals who offer services with the meme coins SHI and TREAT. The team said the tokens are not live yet, advising people to follow the official X accounts of Shiba Inu, Shytoshi Kusama (the pseudonymous leading developer of the meme coin), Kaal Dhairya (another prominent developer), and Treat for more clarity on the matter. A few weeks later, Shibarium Trustwatch maintained that bad actors use Shytoshi Kusama’s name to promote fraudulent tokens in fake groups. “Always verify the authenticity of any group or token before participating. Stay vigilant and protect yourself and others from these scams,” the warning reads.

37826245,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52532,1734581748,Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Makes Bullish Technical Statement about XRP,"Renowned trading expert Peter L. Brandt, with decades of experience in the financial markets, has highlighted a significant bullish formation on the XRP/USD chart. The potential breakout could drive XRP to new heights. The “Half Mast Flag” Pattern On December 17, Peter Brandt shared an analysis of the XRP/USD trading pair, identifying a “Half Mast Flag” pattern. According to Brandt, this pattern often signals that an asset is gearing for an upward move, with the potential price increase matching the initial advance leading to the flag’s formation. The “Half Mast Flag” typically occurs when an asset’s price experiences a sharp move, followed by consolidation before resuming its upward trajectory. If this pattern completes as expected, XRP could be set for a significant price surge. Brandt’s observation has drawn agreement from various market commentators, with some suggesting that the asset’s price could exceed $3 if the breakout materializes. XRP @xrpusd appears to be resolving a half mast flag. If so, distance to upside should equal advance into tip of flag pic.twitter.com/Wj5c4gu5qE — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 17, 2024 In parallel, crypto analyst Ali Martinez also noted bullish signals for the token. Martinez identified a “Bull Flag” formation and predicted that breaking the $2.60 resistance level could pave the way for the token to climb toward $4. Major Transactions Linked to Binance While technical patterns point to bullish potential, on-chain activity has also caught the attention of analysts. Recently, a massive deposit of 69.3 million XRP, valued at approximately $175.8 million, was transferred to a Binance wallet from an unidentified address, according to data from the analytics platform Bithomp. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Before this, Whale Alert reported two large transfers involving Binance wallets. The transactions, totaling 920 million XRP—equivalent to $1.92 billion—indicate significant movements within the Binance ecosystem. While these transfers were substantial, they remained within Binance-associated wallets, raising questions about potential strategies or preparations linked to asset price activity. Ripple USD Stablecoin Gains Attention Adding to the excitement around the asset, the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin officially launched on December 17. Ripple minted nearly $66 million worth of RLUSD after receiving regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services. This stablecoin is expected to enhance liquidity and expand decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities on the XRP Ledger. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also expressed enthusiasm for RLUSD, describing it as “awesome” in a recent post on X . When asked whether Cardano might adopt RLUSD, Hoskinson indicated ongoing efforts toward this goal. As the asset consolidates near the $2.60 resistance level, the combination of technical patterns, whale activity, and ecosystem developments paints a promising picture. Breaking above the resistance could confirm the bullish formations identified by analysts, potentially driving the token toward $4 or higher.

With countless cryptocurrencies vying for attention, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. Today, we’re spotlighting Qubetics ($TICS) , Monero ($XMR), and Stacks ($STX)—three projects that stand out for their unique features and recent developments, making them the best cryptos to join today. Among these, Qubetics is redefining the market with its groundbreaking asset tokenisation feature. Meanwhile, Monero and Stacks continue to attract users with their strong focus on privacy and smart contract innovation, respectively. Let’s dive into what sets these projects apart. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Asset Tokenisation Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, is a rising star in the crypto landscape. In its 13th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0342. With over $7 million raised, 10,600 token holders, and 355 million tokens sold , Qubetics is steadily building momentum and trust within the community. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its asset tokenisation capability. This innovation allows users to convert tangible and intangible assets into digital tokens on the blockchain. Imagine a real estate developer tokenising property shares or a business owner digitising intellectual property. By doing so, Qubetics enables fractional ownership, easier transferability, and enhanced liquidity for these assets. For professionals like lawyers or financial advisors, asset tokenisation simplifies complex transactions, reducing paperwork and ensuring transparency. Investors can diversify portfolios by owning fractions of high-value assets—a game-changer for those previously excluded from such opportunities. Explore the full scope of Qubetics . With ROI projections of up to 43,711.73% if $TICS reaches $15, it’s clear why this token is attracting attention. Combined with its asset tokenisation feature and growing community, Qubetics is undoubtedly among the best cryptos to join today. Monero ($XMR): A Pioneer in Privacy In its latest update, Monero enhanced its privacy protocol, improving efficiency and scalability. This ensures $XMR remains competitive and reliable in a rapidly evolving crypto environment. Monero has long been a favourite among privacy-conscious users. Its robust blockchain ensures anonymity for all transactions, shielding sensitive details from public scrutiny. Launched in 2014, $XMR continues to deliver unmatched privacy and security. Monero’s unique ring signatures and stealth addresses obscure transaction details, making it the go-to choice for individuals and businesses requiring confidentiality. For example, a journalist operating in a restrictive regime can securely receive donations or payments in Monero without risking exposure. Stacks ($STX): Empowering Smart Contracts on Bitcoin Stacks is bringing smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) to Bitcoin, combining the world’s most secure blockchain with advanced programmability. By leveraging the Bitcoin network, Stacks offers a unique approach to building Web3 applications. Stacks recently announced new partnerships with Web3 developers focused on decentralised identity solutions. This expansion underscores its commitment to building a robust and scalable ecosystem. As Bitcoin’s ecosystem expands, Stacks plays a crucial role in enabling smart contract functionality. For businesses and developers seeking to innovate on a secure foundation, $STX provides the perfect platform. Conclusion: Three Projects, Endless Potential Qubetics, Monero, and Stacks each bring something unique to the table, making them the best cryptos to join today . Qubetics’ asset tokenisation feature is a game-changer for professionals and investors alike. Monero’s privacy solutions remain unmatched, while Stacks bridges the gap between Bitcoin’s security and smart contract functionality.

The price retested the $2.20 support zone and is currently attempting a recovery wave. XRP price started a fresh decline from the $2.720 zone. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.45 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.40 resistance. XRP Price Dives To $2.20 XRP price failed to start a fresh increase above the $2.50 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.45 and $2.40 levels. The price declined over 5% and there was a move below the $2.320 support. Finally, the price spiked below the $2.20 support. A low was formed at $2.171 and the price is now correcting losses.

The first major resistance is near the $2.450 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.45 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.720 swing high to the $2.171 low. The next resistance is $2.50. A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.55 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.620 resistance or even $2.80 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.25 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level.

37825589,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394926,1734580744,XRP Price Prediction For December 19,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 19 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price is currently trading between two key levels: strong support around $2 and resistance between $2.90 and $3. This $3 level has been a tough barrier for XRP, and the price hasn’t yet broken down the overall bullish trend, despite some short-term pullbacks. Right now, XRP is in a sideways consolidation phase, and it appears to be staying within this range for the time being. Key Fibonacci Levels The key Fibonacci levels have been met, but there could still be a small dip before any further upward movement. The price has maintained an overall bullish trend, with the possibility that the price bottomed around $1.90 in 2020, and we’re now seeing an upward movement that could continue. Bullish Flag Breakout According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP recently broke out from a bullish flag pattern, signaling short-term upward movement. Even with a small pullback, the price is still above the breakout point, meaning those who entered the trade are still in profit. The price target for this breakout is around $3.80, which suggests a potential 47-48% increase from current levels. Resistance Levels to Watch However, resistance levels remain important. If XRP hits the $2.90-$3 range, it could struggle to move higher. Therefore, while the bullish target is in play, other factors need to be considered. Short-Term Support and Resistance XRP is bouncing from short-term support around $2.50. If it falls below this level, the next support is around $2.38. The analyst said that a drop below $2.38 would invalidate the current bullish outlook. It is important to note that at the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.36 level. Short-term resistance to watch includes levels around $2.70, $2.78, and $2.85. If XRP breaks these levels, it could face more resistance near $2.90-$3. Conclusion Overall, XRP is still stuck in its current price range, with no clear breakout yet. The price is likely consolidating before making another move upward, but we should wait for the market to stabilize before making any conclusions, especially after the recent Fed decision.",NEUTRAL,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-19/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37825665,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630087,1734580628,Next Big Crypto? Dogizen Prepares for Liftoff Amid A-Grade Partnerships,"The altcoin season we’ve all been waiting for has finally dropped, and there’s one token that’s looking like the next big crypto to 100x. Telegram gaming platform Dogizen has reeled in over $1.6m. And is offering those who invest today 41.56% in gains before the presale ends. With Dogizen being the first-ever Telegram ICO and benefiting from multiple partnerships with dynamite names in the Telegram space, 2025 is Dogizen’s for the taking. Here’s why. Why Dogizen is looking like 2025’s next big crypto Alongside the partnerships, the market for Telegram games is entering a golden age. The sector rocketed from essentially $0 last spring to over $1.5 billion in a matter of months. There are just a handful of players in this space, which means that almost every project is approaching blue-chip status. Sector leader Notcoin has cleared over $2 billion in market cap. And Catizen , a project whose market cap has cleared as much as +$200 million, has generated an average revenue per user 200x that of the average crypto project. Also, these projects are getting Binance listings faster than you can say CZ loves you. Makes sense—especially when you consider their insane ability to onboard new users thanks to their simple UX, easy accessibility via one of the world’s most popular messaging apps, and viral growth power due to them being easily referable between Telegram users. Plus, Telegram, in particular, is witnessing outsized growth right now. It’s nearly 1 billion users strong and is growing at a phenomenal rate. Especially in the developing world; African Telegram crypto communities have exploded by +180% since 2023 . How Dogizen improves on the competition Unlike the Notcoin/Hamster Kombat/Catizen cohort, Dogizen is holding an ICO instead of airdropping its tokens. Such a strategy resulted in all of Dogizen’s rivals seeing their token prices slump after launch. Dogizen’s ICO is designed to onboard the loyal. Getting buy-in before the token hits the open market encourages long-term holding, a key element of sustaining and pumping a token’s price. It’s also the only Telegram ICO in the messaging platform’s history. This means that Dogizen is being fed straight to Telegram’s nearly 1 billion strong audience. An audience that is already hyper-engaged with crypto and Web3. Dogizen partnerships are pouring extra gas into the tank From Telegram wallet Grindery to Telegram game SHARKS , Dogizen has teamed up with some of the best names in its space. Not only does this open Dogizen up to a 3 million+ audience, but it also gives Dogizen some juicy brand equity as it piggybacks on these big names. The crypto market has been forecast to triple in size next year. And it’s game-changing products in promising sectors such as Dogizen that are ready to see the outsized gains. You can buy DOGIZ on the official Dogizen website .",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | MARKET | ZRX | BNB | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-dogizen-prepares-for-liftoff-amid-a-grade-partnerships/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37825665.jpeg

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-pepe-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37824787,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664683,1734579047,7.8M Ethereum Leaves Binance In Two Months—What Does This Mean for ETH?,"The Ethereum market has recently seen a notable shift, with significant outflows from centralized exchanges sparking discussions about the near term trajectory of the cryptocurrency. Amid this, Ethereum has recorded a 2.4% decrease in the past 24 hours with a current trading price of $3,858, marking a 21.1% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878 seen in 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? Ethereum Withdrawals from Binance Surpass 7.8 Million ETH Data from CryptoQuant reveals that approximately 20.8 million ETH have been withdrawn from centralized exchanges in the past two months, a trend reminiscent of the 2021 bull market. Binance has played a central role in this movement, accounting for over 7.8 million ETH, which represents 33-39% of the total outflows. These outflows could be indicative of investors accumulating ETH for long-term holding or staking purposes, as suggested by CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk. The analyst added: These significant outflows from Binance indicate the platform’s continued influence on the cryptocurrency market, especially in balancing supply and demand for Ethereum. Notably, Binance’s influence is particularly evident given its global user base of 250 million and a record $21.6 billion in deposits this year, according to Crazzyblockk. The substantial outflows from Binance align with bullish market sentiment, as large-scale withdrawals often signal investor confidence. These movements suggest that Ethereum holders are moving their assets off exchanges. This reduction in the available supply of ETH on exchanges can create upward pressure on prices, should demand remains consistent or grows. Etheruem Market Performance And Outlook Ethereum has so far been struggling to make significant price move to the upside ever since the latest crypto market bull run began months ago. Despite Bitcoin seeing consistent gains recording new all-time highs nearly every month, Ethereum has lacked enough upward momentum to push its price past the $4,000 barrier. It is worth noting that this sluggish performance from Ethereum comes amid the positive developments ongoing in the crypto space including the recent news of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender reportedly working on its own layer-2 (L2) blockchain on Ethereum using ZKsync technology. JUST IN: Deutsche Bank building its own Layer-2 on Ethereum – Bloomberg pic.twitter.com/5O5K3R1fRg — Radar🚨 (@RadarHits) December 18, 2024 Regardless of such news, ETH has seen a slight increase of 2.3% in the past week, , a lower performance compared to that of Bitcoin’s 5% increase over the same period.

Among the projects gaining traction, TON (The Open Network) stands out for its significant institutional adoption, setting a benchmark for others to follow. Now, Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is emerging as a game-changer, combining blockchain and artificial intelligence to drive innovation. As $LCAI continues to make waves, the spotlight is on its Lightchain AI Presale , offering early access to this transformative project. This article dives into the factors behind TON’s institutional success, explores what makes Lightchain AI unique, and assesses whether $LCAI can carve a similar path in the institutional space. Understanding TON’s Institutional Appeal TON has emerged as a blockchain platform designed for scalability, speed, and ease of use. Its appeal to institutions lies in its ability to address the limitations of traditional blockchains, such as slow transaction speeds and high costs. TON’s recent partnerships with leading financial institutions and enterprises highlight its potential to reshape the blockchain landscape. Key Factors Behind TON’s Adoption: Scalability: TON’s architecture supports millions of transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for large-scale applications. Interoperability: The platform’s ability to integrate with existing systems allows institutions to adopt blockchain technology without overhauling their infrastructure. Developer Ecosystem: TON’s developer-friendly tools and APIs enable quick deployment of decentralized applications (dApps), attracting both startups and established enterprises. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with major players in finance and technology have bolstered TON’s credibility and accelerated its adoption. Regulatory Compliance: TON’s focus on transparency and adherence to regulatory standards makes it attractive to risk-averse institutions. Lightchain AI: A Unique Proposition While TON has excelled in creating a blockchain tailored for institutional use, Lightchain AI offers something fundamentally different: the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve real-world problems. $LCAI aims to transform industries by enabling decentralized, AI-driven solutions that combine the transparency of blockchain with the computational power of AI. Key Features of Lightchain AI: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s revolutionary consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, such as model training and optimization.

37826244,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52528,1734578940,"Expert Says Once XRP Clears this Resistance, Next Is $4","The cryptocurrency market has seen remarkable movements recently, with XRP capturing attention due to its significant price rally. Over the past few weeks, the asset has surged by approximately 300%, reaching levels not seen in seven years. However, the momentum appears to be slowing, leaving investors questioning whether the upward trend can continue. A crypto analyst suggests that XRP has the potential to achieve a new milestone if it clears a critical price barrier. Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez recently stated that the asset could climb to $4 provided it breaks through a key resistance level. According to the analyst’s update on December 17, the token, currently trading around $2.6, would need to decisively overcome the $2.6 resistance point to confirm this upward trajectory. $XRP has been consolidating in this bull flag for a while, but once it clears the $2.60 resistance, I think it’s off to the races, heading toward $4!

Sign up here:… https://t.co/ZFFk6Q0vCj pic.twitter.com/AotkvkddHv — Ali (@ali_charts) December 17, 2024 Martinez’s analysis, based on a four-hour candle chart, identifies $2.6 as a significant obstacle. This price level has repeatedly acted as a barrier since December 3, following the token’s rise to $2.9. The token’s recent formation of a bull flag pattern indicates bullish momentum, but breaking the $2.6 resistance is critical to continuing its rally. Whale Activity Suggests Growing Demand While XRP consolidates below its resistance level, large investors appear to be accumulating the token. On December 16, Ali Martinez highlighted data from Santiment Feed , revealing that XRP whales had purchased approximately 830 million tokens within 24 hours. This acquisition, valued at nearly $2.2 billion, suggests strong demand from high-net-worth holders. The accumulation coincides with Ripple’s announcement of the launch of RLUSD which was earlier reported by Times Tabloid . RLUSD is a stablecoin on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum blockchain. Scheduled for release on December 17, RLUSD aims to enhance liquidity and drive participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. Many market observers believe this development could positively influence the token’s price performance. Conclusion The asset’s ability to surpass its $2.6 resistance level will be key in determining whether the asset can reach the $4 price target projected by analysts. The increasing interest from whales and the introduction of RLUSD provide additional bullish indicators. However, investors should monitor price movements closely, as breaking this key resistance is essential for confirming the next phase of the rally.

Recent developments, like Shiba Inu’s forthcoming liquid staking upgrade and Dogecoin’s bullish technical indicators, highlight the evolving opportunities in this space. At the centre of this buzz is BTFD Coin , a standout newcomer with a booming presale that has captured the attention of meme coin enthusiasts worldwide. As we dive into these three projects, you’ll see why they rank among the best meme coins to invest in this month . From BTFD Coin’s presale milestones to Shiba Inu’s ecosystem expansion and Dogecoin’s market activity, there’s a lot to unpack. BTFD Coin: Where Bulls Run Strong Have you been waiting for the right meme coin to join? BTFD Coin, the latest sensation, might just be the perfect opportunity. With over $4.1 million raised in its presale, this coin has proven it’s not just a fleeting trend but a potential game-changer in the crypto world. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale at $0.00013 per coin, BTFD has caught the attention of over 5,900 investors—or as they like to call themselves, “bulls”. But why the hype? For starters, BTFD isn’t just about fun memes—it’s about financial opportunity. Consider this: a $5,000 investment at the current presale price would yield nearly $23,077 when the coin hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. That’s the kind of ROI that investors dream of. BTFD goes beyond the typical meme coin playbook by offering a 90% APY staking reward. Imagine letting your investment grow passively while enjoying community perks and market buzz. Add to that the P2E gaming feature, where the beta version is already live, and you’ve got a coin that’s merging entertainment with tangible rewards. The power of BTFD lies in its strong community of bulls, who aren’t just investors but advocates of the coin. The project’s tagline—“Own the Dip”—resonates with crypto enthusiasts looking for a coin that understands market dynamics and offers long-term growth potential. Shiba Inu: Expanding Ecosystem with Liquid Staking Shiba Inu, one of the most recognised names in the meme coin space, continues to evolve beyond its humble beginnings. Currently trading at $0.00002564, SHIB’s price may be down 5.23% in the past 24 hours, but its trading volume has jumped 13.79%, reflecting active investor interest. The Shiba Inu team is gearing up for a major upgrade with the introduction of liquid staking on ShibaSwap. This feature will allow users to stake their SHIB tokens while maintaining liquidity. In simpler terms, you can earn staking rewards without locking up your tokens. Liquid tokens representing staked assets can be traded or used as collateral on other DeFi platforms, enhancing utility and flexibility for investors. The Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to expand with projects like the Shibarium blockchain and ongoing token burns. These efforts aren’t just about reducing supply but creating a robust ecosystem where SHIB becomes a go-to token for DeFi solutions. The introduction of liquid staking is another step in that direction, offering both active traders and long-term holders more value. Dogecoin: Signs of a Bullish Breakout As the original meme coin, Dogecoin has consistently held its ground in the crypto market. Currently trading at $0.3841, DOGE’s price is down 3.99% over the past 24 hours, but its one-month performance shows a modest 2.46% increase. Beneath this surface-level stability, however, technical indicators suggest a much bigger story. Dogecoin is in what analysts call an “accumulation phase,” where market activity hints at a potential breakout. The 200 EMA, a key technical indicator, signals that DOGE could soon enter a bullish phase. Combined with increased transactions and the movement of previously dormant tokens, these factors suggest that DOGE may be gearing up for a significant upward move. Despite being a meme coin, Dogecoin has proven its resilience and versatility over the years. From its integration into Tesla’s merchandise store to its widespread acceptance as a payment method, DOGE continues to hold a unique position in the market. With bullish signals and growing speculation, it’s no wonder investors are keeping a close eye on Dogecoin as one of the best meme coins to invest in this month. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market is as vibrant as ever, with new opportunities emerging for savvy investors. BTFD Coin leads the charge with its record-breaking presale and innovative features, making it a must-watch for anyone looking to join the crypto bull run. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is solidifying its ecosystem with game-changing upgrades like liquid staking, and Dogecoin is showing signs of a bullish breakout that could take it to new heights. If you’re looking to ride the wave of the best meme coins to invest in this month, these three projects offer unique opportunities for growth. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the action— join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in what could be the next big meme coin success story.

The bank said its new “products” and “a fully fledged infrastructure for trading” the blockchain-powered tokens should “become available to retail investors as early as the start of 2025.” Russian Banking Giant Enters Blockchain Sector The bank will work on the project with Atomyze, a Moscow-based firm backed by the blockchain-keen Russian metals mining giant Norilsk Nickel . T-Bank marketing materials aired on Russian TV channels earlier this year. (Source: T-Bank/RuTube/Screenshot) The Russian Central Bank granted T-Bank permission to launch digital financial assets (DFAs) in March this year . Other major banks have rushed to the DFAs space in recent months, including major T-Bank rivals Sberbank and Alfa-Bank . T-Bank said its premium-level customers will be able to trade its DFA before the end of this year. Russia said it had detained a citizen of Uzbekistan who had confessed to planting and detonating a bomb which killed Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov in Moscow a day earlier on the instructions of Ukraine's security service https://t.co/TbS1aMuODg — Reuters (@Reuters) December 18, 2024 It will then follow up with a general rollout in early 2025. The bank has called its new range “smart assets,” explaining that they use blockchain technology and automated smart contracts . This, the bank said, will allows it to “reduce costs and create fundamentally new products” that “are not currently available on the traditional finance market.” Investors will also “have access to a full-fledged secondary market” with “market makers and constant liquidity,” T-Bank added. Russia and Iran are fighting a proxy war in Africa and, in contrast to their recent humiliation in Syria, are currently on the winning side https://t.co/82dPFzuOoI — Bloomberg (@business) December 18, 2024 What Are Russian DFAs? In Russian legal parlance, digital financial assets (DFA) refers to tokenized versions of physical assets and traditional financial assets. While they use blockchain technology, they are not real-world assets (RWA) , as they do not use public blockchain networks. Instead, issuers release and develop them on private blockchains, and are subject to Central Bank regulation. T-Bank said its initial range includes “eight pilot instruments” with “a declared potential yield of up to 27.5% per year.” They will be issued on the Atomyze platform. The US added Atomyze and fellow DFA issuer Lighthouse to its sanctions list in March this year. The new T-Bank range includes the following: Loan products A smart factoring portfolio, tied to the “financial obligations” of small and medium-sized Russian businesses A smart floater, a bond with “a floating interest rate” that promises to be “always 2.5% higher than the key rate” Art tokens, which “give investors digital rights to income from the sale of paintings by contemporary artists” Scholarship tokens, used to “pay scholarships” to top university students Russian private individuals continue to transfer money out of the country. Sanctions have not made that impossible. Around $4bn per quarter is wired abroad according to Russia's Central Bank (plus yuan and ruble transfers). Peak 2022 was $20 bn. pic.twitter.com/ZE5MIkeQ3I — Janis Kluge (@jakluge) December 17, 2024 ‘Hundreds of Thousands of Investors’ The Atomyze CEO Alexey Ilyasov said that the platform wanted to boost the size of the DFA market to “hundreds of thousands of investors” in the first half of next year. T-Bank, the nation’s biggest neobank, was founded in 2006 by Oleg Tinkov, the founder of the Technoshock retail brand and other retail businesses. Now called T-Bank, Russia’s third-largest lender said its 43 million customers would not notice the change, with its products and services continuing as usual under the new brand. https://t.co/T4GLuc6bHt — The Moscow Times (@MoscowTimes) June 5, 2024 Tinkov has been living in exile since speaking out against the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022. He has since renounced his Russian citizenship and Moscow this year labelled him a “foreign agent.” In June this year, the bank announced it would change its name, in what its executives called a “logical step for both” its “employees and customers.” The bank added that its 43 million customers “would not notice any difference,” adding that it was “business as usual” at the bank.

37824590,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52524,1734576438,"Analyst Makes Bullish XRP Price Projection For January 1, 2025","Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Jason Williams has shared a moderate forecast for XRP, predicting that the token will cross the $3 mark by early next year. Williams, a widely followed market observer, detailed his projection in a recent post on X . He also provided price targets for other leading altcoins. My Altcoin Prediction by January 1st – $ETH $5,325 – $XRP $3.10 – $FTM $4.25 – $HEART $0.20 – $IOTA $0.9 – $DOP $0.01 – $DOT $20 – $SEI $1.50 – $SOL $310 – $Pepe $1.00 What would you add to this list? — Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) December 16, 2024 XRP Price Target Set at $3.10 Williams estimates that the token will reach $3.10 by January 1, 2025, marking a 31% increase from its current price of $2.36. Achieving this level within 13 days would solidify XRP’s market capitalization at approximately $170 billion, up from its current valuation of $135.36 billion. Such growth would maintain the token’s status as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The analyst also outlined price projections for several other altcoins. According to him, Ethereum could trade at $5,325, Solana at $310, Polkadot at $20, and Pepe at $1 by the same date. Although Williams did not specify the factors that might push the token to $3.10, several industry trends and developments could play a role in driving its value higher. Key among these is progress in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Favorable rulings or settlements could boost investor confidence and increase institutional adoption of XRP. Additionally, the rapid adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could be another catalyst. Earlier this week, RLUSD’s introduction contributed to a 9% increase in XRP’s price , lifting it to $2.56. This followed a broader 20% price surge after the stablecoin received regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Significant adoption of RLUSD by major organizations or its listing on leading exchanges like Binance could further enhance the market performance in the coming weeks. Despite optimistic predictions, the token has faced challenges in reaching the $3 threshold. The last time the token surpassed this level was the 2017-2018 bull market, peaking at an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent attempts have seen the asset approach this milestone without success. Earlier this month, XRP climbed to $2.86 on December 3 but encountered strong resistance, dropping to $1.90 shortly after. The cryptocurrency has since recovered, trading above $2 again and reaching $2.72 before falling back to its current price of $2.36 amid a market-wide correction. Recent Market Activity The digital asset initially saw a significant increase in trading activity, with its 24-hour trading volume rising by 54.25% to $19.23 billion. This surge in activity contributed to XRP overtaking Tether (USDT) as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization earlier this week. While Jason Williams’ projection of the asset reaching $3.10 by January 2025 may appear conservative compared to other forecasts, the target is achievable if key developments align in Ripple’s favor. Factors such as institutional interest, increased adoption of Ripple’s products, and progress in the SEC lawsuit could all support the token’s growth. However, market resistance at critical price levels remains a challenge, and traders should carefully monitor market conditions before making investment decisions.

37823566,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394901,1734576390,Fed’s Anti-Bitcoin Stance Triggers Major Crypto Market Sell-off,"The post Fed’s Anti-Bitcoin Stance Triggers Major Crypto Market Sell-off appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, December 19, 2024, the overall cryptocurrency market is experiencing notable losses, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP seeing significant price declines over the past 24 hours. A potential reason for this drop is the recent Federal Reserve rate cut meeting. Reason Behind the Crypto Market Decline During the conference, the Federal Reserve announced an interest rate ceiling of 4.50%, aligning with expectations, compared to the previous rate of 4.75%. Jerome Powell made a bold statement on cryptocurrency that significantly impacted the overall market. In a statement, Powell noted that we are not allowed to own Bitcoin and have no desire to change the laws. This statement by the Fed chief shows that the U.S. central bank has no interest or intention to support a scenario where the government would accumulate a significant amount of Bitcoin. Regarding the legal issues surrounding Bitcoin ownership, Powell stated, “That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” The idea of creating a so-called “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” appears to be failing, as the Federal Reserve has no intention of participating in such an initiative until President-elect Donald Trump takes office. This indicates that central banks are distancing themselves from holding large amounts of Bitcoin, unlike gold reserves. Federal Reserve’s Meeting Impacted Crypto Prices These statements by Powell have caused a significant downturn in the overall cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, dropped by over 6.5%, falling below $100,000 after reaching the $108,000 mark. Meanwhile, other assets, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), experienced price declines of 5.5%, 14.20%, 9.45%, and 11.5%, respectively. Additionally, this notable price decline in the crypto market occurred following Powell’s statement.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | SOL,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/feds-anti-bitcoin-stance-triggers-major-crypto-market-sell-off/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

With the year wrapping up, investors are scouring for projects that could bring both short-term value and long-term gains. Recently, Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin have captured attention due to their impressive developments and growing communities. Qubetics ($TICS) continues to make headlines, having secured over 10,600 token holders holding more than 355 million tokens in its presale. Meanwhile, Solana is riding a wave of institutional adoption, and Binance Coin is fostering groundbreaking innovations on the Binance ecosystem. Let’s take a closer look at why these three stand out as the best coins to join in December 2024. Qubetics Sets the Stage with Over 10,600 Token Holders Qubetics ($TICS) is breaking barriers as the world’s first web3 aggregator , solving major interoperability issues in the blockchain space. At the heart of its ecosystem is its decentralised VPN (dVPN), a revolutionary solution designed to provide enhanced privacy, security, and unrestricted internet access. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralised servers, Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring user data remains private and resistant to surveillance. For example, journalists working in regions with heavy censorship can use Qubetics’ dVPN to access information securely without the fear of government intrusion. Businesses that handle sensitive data across borders can also benefit, as the dVPN reduces the risks associated with centralised systems and potential data breaches. Currently, Qubetics is in its 13th presale phase, where tokens are priced at $0.0342 each. Each presale stage concludes every Sunday at midnight, bringing a 10% price increase. So far, the presale has attracted over 10,600 holders , with more than 355 million $TICS tokens sold, raising over $7 million. Analysts are bullish on its future, predicting that $TICS could reach $15 after its mainnet launch. For example, an investment of $400,000 today could deliver life-changing returns if these predictions hold true. You can learn more about this project by watching the video here . Solana Gains Momentum with New Staking Opportunities Solana continues to reinforce its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain networks. Recent developments highlight growing institutional interest and innovative solutions within its ecosystem. A major boost came with Bitwise launching a Solana staking ETP (exchange-traded product) in Europe, offering an impressive 6.48% yield to institutional investors. This move not only improves accessibility to Solana but also reinforces its position in the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. Adding to the momentum, the recent launch of the Solaxy ICO, a Layer 2 project built on Solana, raised over $750,000 in its first 72 hours. This demonstrates the strong investor demand for projects leveraging Solana’s high-speed, low-cost network. These developments position Solana as a serious contender for both short-term and long-term gains, making it one of the best coins to join in December 2024. Binance Coin Powers Innovation Across the Blockchain Space Binance Coin (BNB) remains a key player in driving blockchain adoption through its robust ecosystem. As the native token of the Binance exchange, BNB supports numerous applications, including transaction fee reductions, staking, and the Binance Launchpad. Recently, Binance Launchpad facilitated the listing of Simon’s Cat (CAT) on its spot market, resulting in a remarkable 50% price increase within 48 hours. The listing reflects Binance’s ability to propel promising projects into the spotlight and generate strong market interest. In addition, Binance’s continued efforts to diversify offerings through its HODLer Airdrop Program have further engaged its community, distributing tokens of newly listed projects to loyal holders. This proactive approach fosters innovation and cements Binance Coin’s importance in the blockchain ecosystem. With its consistent utility and support for emerging technologies, Binance Coin is undoubtedly one of the best coins to join in December 2024. Conclusion: Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin Shine Bright As 2024 comes to a close, Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin offer exciting opportunities for crypto investors. Qubetics has already attracted 10,600 token holders and sold 355 million $TICS tokens, with analysts predicting an extraordinary surge to $15 post-mainnet launch. Meanwhile, Solana is gaining institutional traction with new staking opportunities and a successful Layer 2 ICO. Binance Coin remains a cornerstone of blockchain innovation, driving projects that generate real value for investors. For those looking to position themselves for growth, these projects are the best coins to join in December 2024. Now is the time to research, evaluate, and make informed moves in the dynamic world of crypto.

With a near 4% price increase, Ripple is once again proving its ability to innovate in the cross-border payments space. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) remains a pillar of the crypto market, raising discussions about its long-term security and investment potential, especially as the Binance ecosystem continues to dominate. But the real dark horse in this conversation is Qubetics ($TICS) . While established giants like XRP and BNB focus on pushing boundaries in their respective domains, Qubetics is tackling crypto’s usability challenge head-on. By creating a non-custodial wallet that simplifies transactions and integrates seamlessly with Apple Pay and Google Pay, Qubetics is making crypto accessible to everyone. Let’s explore why these three projects are among the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 and how they’re leading the charge for blockchain innovation. Qubetics: Making Crypto Usable for Everyone Let’s be honest—crypto can be daunting for newcomers. Complex wallets, unpredictable market swings, and high fees often keep people at bay. Qubetics is here to change all that with a wallet that makes using crypto as easy as tapping your phone . Imagine you’re a small business owner, and a customer pays you in Ethereum. Usually, you’d need to convert that crypto into fiat, track exchange rates, and hope the market doesn’t crash. With Qubetics, payments are automatically converted at the point of sale . Whether you’re a freelancer working internationally or a café owner in New York, Qubetics makes transactions seamless and stress-free. What sets Qubetics apart is its smart contract conversion mechanism, which shields users from crypto market volatility. Plus, it works across iOS, Android, and desktop, integrating with Apple Pay and Google Pay for ultimate convenience. It’s like bringing crypto into the real world without the headaches. Currently in Presale Phase 13, Qubetics has already sold over 355 million tokens and raised $7 million. At $0.0342 per token, $TICS is a steal. But act fast—the next phase brings a 10% price hike, with the final phase promising a 20% increase. After presale, the price is set to hit $0.25, delivering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. If you’re looking for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Qubetics is a must-watch. Ripple: The Cross-Border Payment Innovator Ripple (XRP) has long been a trailblazer in the crypto space, and its recent launch of the RLUSD stablecoin proves it’s not slowing down. Designed to enhance cross-border payment efficiency, RLUSD is Ripple’s latest move to solidify its role as a leader in global finance. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network continues to expand, with partnerships across the banking and payments industries. This network allows XRP to act as a bridge currency, enabling near-instantaneous transactions at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. For global businesses, this is a game changer. Regulatory clarity in key markets like the U.S. is also boosting investor confidence. Ripple’s recent legal victories have positioned XRP as one of the most resilient cryptos, even amid market volatility. For retail investors, XRP offers both utility and long-term growth potential. If you’re searching for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Ripple’s innovation in cross-border payments makes it a strong contender. Whether you’re an enterprise or a casual investor, XRP continues to prove its relevance in an evolving crypto landscape. Binance Coin: The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s the fuel powering the Binance ecosystem. As the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance relies on BNB for everything from transaction fee discounts to staking opportunities, making it a cornerstone of the crypto market. Security has been a hot topic for BNB, with analysts debating its long-term viability. But one thing’s clear: Binance’s focus on compliance and security upgrades has strengthened investor trust. BNB’s deflationary model, driven by quarterly token burns, ensures a steady decrease in supply, boosting its value over time. The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is another reason why BNB is a must-watch. With its low fees and fast transactions, BSC has become a hub for DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps. This growing ecosystem ensures that BNB remains relevant, even as new competitors enter the market. For investors eyeing the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Binance Coin offers a mix of utility, security, and growth potential. Whether you’re using it on Binance or staking it for rewards, BNB is a reliable pick for any portfolio.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently surpassed Tether (USDT). Analysts and investors alike are growing excited about the possibility for XRP holders to become among the wealthiest investors in the foreseeable future, as indicated by the recent spike. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report Potential Price Forecasts An analyst has expressed an audacious outlook for XRP, indicating that those who retain the asset may experience substantial returns, which could result in life-changing wealth in the near future. He anticipates a significant increase in the price of the altcoin, with the goal of reaching a price point between $30 and $35 by 2025. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE THE RICHEST PEOPLE YOU KNOW – HERE’S WHY! pic.twitter.com/k0tc6tCAq0 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2024 Based on this estimate, the present price of approximately $2.54 is expected to experience a staggering increase of around 1,277%. A $1,000 investment, for example, may potentially increase to $14,000 if these objectives are accomplished. It is also possible that those who have made larger investments will have the opportunity to become millionaires as the value of XRP continues to climb. This optimism is perpetuated by recent fluctuations in prices. In the last 30 days, XRP registered a solid 124% increase, which coincided with a successful retest of its 2021 peak of $1.97. According to analysts, the demand for the crypto will continue to rise as Ripple expands its partnerships throughout Asia and beyond, further driving up its price. Causes Of Wealth Formation The positive outlook for XRP is due to a number of reasons. Investors have a lot more faith in Ripple now that its legal fight with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been settled. Legal certainty is about to arrive, hence many people believe that using XRP in worldwide banking will hasten the adoption. Since big financial institutions see Ripple’s technology’s ability to transform cross-border payments, institutional interest in it is also piquing. Some wealth managers suggests that XRP has the potential to revolutionize international payments in a manner similar to that of early Amazon. They anticipate a future in which XRP processes trillions of transactions daily, which could result in a price increase of an astonishing $132—a preposterous 23,900% from its current level. Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says Precaution In The Face Of Optimism Still, experts advise caution even if XRP has an encouraging future.

Analysts emphasize the need of realizing gains as prices rise instead of waiting for a climax that might never come to pass. Their advice for investors: make wise judgments and closely check price swings.

37822885,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52487,1734573616,"The Graph & Theta Are Good, but Web3Bay is the Game-Changer in Web3","Web3 heralds a transformative era for the internet, emphasizing decentralization, blockchain technology, and enhanced user control over data. In contrast to Web2’s centralized structure dominated by firms like Google and Facebook, Web3 grants users direct management of their digital interactions. Among the notable projects leveraging this shift are The Graph, Theta Network, and Web3Bay , each targeting distinct functionalities. The Graph is dedicated to decentralized data indexing for dApps, while Theta Network advances video streaming via decentralized bandwidth sharing. Nonetheless, these projects are somewhat niche in their focus. Web3Bay takes a broader approach by providing a decentralized e-commerce platform that amalgamates Web3 advantages including dual payment systems, community governance, and cross-chain functionality, establishing itself as a more comprehensive solution for blockchain-based commerce. Web3Bay: Spearheading Decentralized E-commerce in the Web3 Era Web3Bay distinguishes itself by pioneering a decentralized marketplace that transfers complete control of data and financial transactions back to the users. This approach starkly contrasts with that of traditional e-commerce behemoths like Amazon, which rely on intermediaries. By eliminating these middlemen, Web3Bay not only cuts down on costs but also enhances the privacy of its users. This empowers users with real ownership of their digital assets—a feature not seen in narrowly focused projects like The Graph and Theta. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its dual payment system, which accepts both cryptocurrencies and traditional payment methods such as PayPal. This flexibility makes it a bridge between the older Web2 and the new Web3, opening up the platform to both crypto enthusiasts and traditional users alike. This inclusive approach is absent in The Graph and Theta, making Web3Bay a uniquely accessible option in the marketplace. Another critical aspect of Web3Bay is its commitment to Community-Driven Governance via its DAO. This governance model allows 3BAY token holders to directly influence the platform’s direction by proposing and voting on initiatives, aligning the platform’s evolution with the desires of its community. Unlike The Graph and Theta, which do not facilitate such a level of user control, Web3Bay’s model promotes a genuinely decentralized approach, giving it a distinct advantage in the competitive landscape. The Graph: Specializing in Decentralized Data Indexing The Graph is tailored for managing blockchain data specifically for decentralized applications. By allowing developers to effectively query across multiple blockchain platforms, it becomes a fundamental tool for DeFi and NFT projects, where swift access to on-chain data is crucial. However, The Graph’s functionality is primarily confined to data indexing, serving a pivotal yet narrow role. In contrast, Web3Bay extends its reach into the broader aspects of the Web3 landscape, covering decentralized commerce and governance. This not only enriches the platform’s utility but also makes it a more holistic solution for users. While The Graph does a stellar job at enhancing data accessibility, it stops short of engaging in the broader, dynamic realms of commerce and governance where Web3Bay excels and truly makes a difference. Theta Network: Innovating Decentralized Video Streaming Theta Network is crafted to transform video streaming by leveraging a decentralized network that cuts down on bandwidth costs and boosts the quality of content delivery. Users can share their bandwidth and receive rewards in return, creating a sustainable and community-supported content distribution network. This model is especially advantageous for content creators as it lowers operational costs and improves the quality of streams. Yet, Theta’s dedication to just content streaming might limit its utility in other areas. On the flip side, Web3Bay extends its functionality by integrating decentralized storage solutions, automated payments through smart contracts, and a scalable infrastructure that supports a broad spectrum of e-commerce activities. This flexibility makes Web3Bay a more comprehensive platform. Additionally, Web3Bay ‘s forward-looking initiatives to explore NFTs and DeFi sectors significantly widen its scope, providing opportunities for users to create, purchase, and trade a variety of digital assets, moving beyond mere content. Why Web3Bay Surpasses The Graph & Theta Web3Bay’s emphasis on decentralization and scalability positions it above The Graph and Theta. By integrating dual payment options and fostering community governance, Web3Bay promotes a user-centric approach in line with Web3’s foundational values. Utilizing smart contracts and decentralized storage through IPFS, Web3Bay enhances security and operational efficiency, presenting an all-encompassing solution for digital commerce. Its scalable architecture, featuring Layer-1 with Layer-2 rollups, ensures low fees and rapid transactions, offering a user experience that outshines The Graph’s data indexing and Theta’s streaming capabilities. With plans to expand into NFTs and DeFi, Web3Bay demonstrates its commitment to leading a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem, transcending the limited functionalities of its competitors. Key Insights Web3Bay’s integration of e-commerce, community governance, and scalable infrastructure cements its status as a frontrunner among Web3 projects. While The Graph specializes in data indexing and Theta excels in streaming, Web3Bay’s extensive capabilities in commerce, payments, and governance render it a more influential and adaptable platform. With its user-centric, decentralized marketplace and diverse payment options, alongside future expansions into NFTs and DeFi, Web3Bay is not just keeping up with the Web3 evolution but actively driving the next wave of blockchain integration.

37822883,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52521,1734572943,Here’s Why XRP Price Is Crashing,"On December 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point (bps) reduction in interest rates, a widely anticipated move following signals from policymakers. Despite meeting market expectations, the announcement sparked a significant selloff in equities and cryptocurrency markets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The market’s negative reaction highlights concerns about the broader implications of the rate cut. Market Reaction to the Rate Cut Zero Hedge, a prominent financial news and analysis platform, posted the announcement on X stating “FED CUTS 25BPS AS EXPECTED.” FED CUTS 25BPS AS EXPECTED — zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 18, 2024 In response, user JP Friend 1 queried , “Why is market dumping on that news?” This question underscores confusion among retail and institutional investors, as rate cuts are traditionally viewed as supportive of financial markets. Another user, Bleeerg, offered an explanation stating “There is a theory that cutting rates after a period of raises means that there are issues with the economy and it marks the start of a recession.” Aron Meystedt, contributing to the discussion, provided historical context: “Yep. If you look at past charts over time for the major indices and overlay them with the fed funds rate, the stock drop (recession) happens AFTER the rates are dropped. It’s counterintuitive, but that’s the way it usually goes.” Historical Context and Recession Concerns The theory discussed by users aligns with historical patterns. During previous economic cycles, rate cuts following a prolonged tightening phase have often signaled underlying economic vulnerabilities. Policymakers typically lower rates to stimulate growth, but the decision can indicate that the economy has entered a period of contraction or is at risk of doing so. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This dynamic creates a paradox: while rate cuts reduce borrowing costs and aim to encourage investment, they can also signal that monetary authorities are bracing for economic downturns. Investors often react by selling risk assets, anticipating weaker earnings, reduced consumer spending, and tighter credit conditions. Cryptocurrency Market Impact The selloff was not limited to equities. Major cryptocurrencies also experienced sharp declines, with XRP down 9.8% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2.32. Meanwhile, Bitcoin , the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has fallen over 5% during the same period and currently trades at $100,700. Cryptocurrencies, often high-risk assets, tend to mirror the broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets. As fears of a potential recession grow, investors appear to be moving away from volatile assets and toward safer options such as bonds and cash. As the situation unfolds, investors will closely monitor upcoming economic data and Federal Reserve communications to assess the trajectory of monetary policy and its impact on global markets. For now, the reaction underscores the complex interplay between rate adjustments, market sentiment, and economic expectations.

Among them, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained attention from analysts forecasting significant price gains in the current market cycle. Shiba Inu Expected to Break Previous Record A notable market analyst, Crypto Sheriff, has predicted that Shiba Inu could surpass its all-time high of $0.00008616, achieved during the 2020/2021 market cycle. In a post shared on December 15, the analyst stated that the outcome is inevitable, emphasizing the coin’s potential in the ongoing bullish trend. It is inevitable that #SHIB will break down ATH in this supercycle! pic.twitter.com/owuMMgpwoh — CRYPTO SHERIFF (@Gem_Sheriff) December 15, 2024 This prediction follows the asset’s impressive performance in November 2024, where the token rallied approximately 98% after the U.S. presidential election. Many believe Donald Trump’s victory signaled a crypto-friendly shift in U.S. policy, contributing to the token’s rise from $0.00001687 to $0.00003343. Meanwhile, the asset has retraced some gains and is trading at $0.00002682. Analysts Highlight Shiba Inu (SHIB) Bullish Patterns While Crypto Sheriff maintains a positive outlook, other analysts have provided additional technical insights supporting the possibility of a significant price increase. On December 10, CryptoELITES identified a bullish cup-and-handle formation on Shiba Inu’s weekly chart. The analyst noted that if the token breaks above a long-standing downtrend line, it could potentially reach $0.0004729, marking a 1,700% increase from its current value. The downtrend, which has acted as a resistance level since October 2021, is considered a critical barrier. According to CryptoELITES, breaking through this resistance would confirm the bullish pattern and set the stage for a sustained upward trend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risk of Downside Movement Despite the optimism, some analysts have highlighted potential risks. As earlier reported by Times Tabloid, market commentator PouyanTradeFX warned that if Shiba Inu fails to overcome the downtrend, the token could significantly decline. In this scenario, prices might drop by as much as 150%, bringing SHIB to the $0.000011 range. Such contrasting analyses underscore the importance of closely monitoring technical indicators and market conditions. While many remain bullish, the outcome will largely depend on how the asset performs in the face of these key resistance levels. The asset’s recent performance and technical setups have fueled speculation about its potential to reach new highs. Analysts like Crypto Sheriff and CryptoELITES are optimistic about the token’s future, while others urge caution, emphasizing the importance of breaking resistance levels to confirm a bullish trend.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 221,100 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum’s two-hour chart looks similar to Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price action over the last two weeks. The analyst says that while Ethereum struggles to clear resistance at $4,000, he notes that BTC also had trouble breaching $100,000 for weeks before surging to new all-time highs. “Same price action, but with one difference. God candle after the breakout. ETH.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will surge close to its all-time high of $4,800 after the breakout. At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,892. The trader also has his radar locked on the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ). According to the trader, FLOKI appears to be trading in a symmetrical triangle pattern and is gearing up to shatter the structure’s diagonal resistance en route to new record highs. “Second leg up – loading. New ATH – loading. Price discovery – loading. FLOKI.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that FLOKI will explode to a new all-time high of $0.00038. At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000219. Looking at Solana ( SOL ), the trader sees the Ethereum rival bursting above its diagonal resistance to rally toward $300. “Something like this. SOL.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, SOL is worth $222.60.

37820679,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664359,1734570012,Here’s Why Dogecoin Is Poised For A Major Bullish Reversal,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price appears primed for a significant bullish reversal, supported by technical indicators and market sentiment data. Despite recent downward pressures, several factors suggest a potential upward trajectory for the popular memecoin. #1 Dogecoin Bounces Off Key Support Level (1D Chart) Crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) highlighted the resilience of Dogecoin and PEPE, another prominent memecoin, stating, “DOGE + PEPE both bouncing from important areas. The memecoin demise is greatly exaggerated IMO. Next leg up gonna take many by surprise.” CRG’s technical analysis reveals that DOGE has maintained a daily close above the critical support level of $0.385 for nine consecutive days, despite substantial selling pressure. Similarly, PEPE has sustained crucial support, indicating that the “memecoin season” might be making a comeback imminently. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ For Dogecoin, the short-term resistance zone at $0.42 remains a pivotal level. CRG suggests that a break above this threshold could signal the onset of a new bull run, potentially catching many investors off guard. #2 Bullish Market Structure (4-Hour Chart) Further technical insight comes from crypto analyst Gonzo (@GonzoXBT), who provided a technical breakdown of Dogecoin’s price action. Gonzo explained, “DOGE 4H EMA100 -> acting as resistance 4H EMA200 -> acting as support. Until we flip 4H EMA100 we will just chop in between, don’t want to see it lose 4H EMA200 tho.” This analysis underscores the importance of the 4-hour exponential moving averages (EMAs) in determining short-term price movements. The 4H EMA100 currently serves as a resistance level, while the 4H EMA200 offers support. A sustained breach above the 4H EMA100 could facilitate an upward breakout, whereas a failure to maintain above the 4H EMA200 might lead to further consolidation or decline. #3 Trading Against The Crowd Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) presented another bullish perspective on DOGE’s immediate outlook. He noted, “Market sentiment for Dogecoin has turned negative. It seems as if traders are getting impatient during the ongoing price consolidation!” Related Reading: Bull Flag Formation Puts Dogecoin Price As High As $2.15 This Cycle Martinez’s analysis, based on Santiment data, indicates a sharp decline in both search volume and Weighted Sentiment. Specifically, Weighted Sentiment has plummeted to its lowest point since mid-October, while search volume has dropped to levels not seen since early November. Martinez speculated on potential catalysts that could quickly reignite positive momentum for Dogecoin, referencing the establishment of the new US Department of Government Efficiency under the leadership of Elon Musk. He suggested, “Or you can wait the first POPULAR action of the Department of Government Efficiency.” #4 Liquidation Dynamics Indicate Potential Upside Adding another layer to the bullish thesis, crypto analyst Carlos Garcia Tapia (@CAGThe3rd) shared insights into the liquidation heatmap over the past three days, commenting, “FOMO longs just got liquidated on the 3D chart. DOGE.” The heatmap by Coinglass illustrates a significant liquidation of leveraged long positions clustered between $0.393 and $0.385 over the past two days. But there’s a bullish caveat: with the majority of longs now liquidated, the remaining liquidation cluster is positioned around the $0.42 mark. This setup suggests that Dogecoin could experience a bullish candle formation, potentially triggering further liquidations of bearish positions and propelling the price upward. Why? Because liquidation heatmaps are valuable tools in forecasting price movements as they reflect the underlying market liquidity and leverage dynamics. These heatmaps highlight where traders are most susceptible to forced liquidations, acting as psychological and technical barriers. When the price approaches these levels, large market participants can influence price direction by triggering a cascade of liquidations, thereby amplifying the resultant price movement. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.3843.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-loves-bitcoin-muskbtc-solana-memecoin-to-rally-13000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

In today’s issue, Phil Geiger from bitcoin financial services provider Unchained explains what bitcoin donor-advised funds are and how they work.  Then, Eric Tomaszewski from Verde Capital Management answers questions about funds and potential tax implications in Ask an Expert.  Happy reading.  – Sarah Morton  The Rise of Donor-Advised Funds: Tax Benefits and the Power of Bitcoin DAFs  In recent years, donor-advised funds (DAFs) have surged in popularity as a philanthropic vehicle, offering a flexible way for individuals to manage their charitable giving. Adding to the appeal is the emergence of bitcoin DAFs, which combine the flexibility and tax benefits of traditional DAFs with the unique advantages of on-chain assets.  The Rise of Donor-Advised Funds  A DAF is a charitable giving account that allows donors to contribute assets to a fund, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants to charities over time. DAFs have grown exponentially in recent years. As of 2024, there are around 2 million DAF accounts in the United States, holding a combined value of over $250 billion.  DAFs offer convenience and control. Donors can contribute at any time, make investment decisions to grow the fund’s assets and increase the amount for charity, and then direct grants to qualified charities when ready. This allows individuals to align their giving with their financial situation and support a variety of causes over the long term, but they don’t necessarily have to distribute their donations immediately.  Tax Benefits of Donor-Advised Funds  The tax advantages of DAFs are one of the primary reasons for their popularity. When donors contribute to a DAF, they can take an immediate charitable deduction for the full value of their contribution, subject to IRS limits. This applies whether the donor contributes cash, bitcoin, securities, or other assets. For example, in the case of appreciated cryptocurrencies, a donor can avoid paying capital gains taxes, which can be significant on investments that have appreciated over time.  The deduction is especially valuable for individuals looking to offset a large taxable event, such as the sale of a business or the exercise of stock options. Donors who contribute appreciated assets directly to a DAF receive the full fair-market value as a deduction, while the DAF can sell the assets without incurring capital gains taxes. This strategy allows donors to make larger charitable contributions without incurring tax penalties.  Additionally, DAFs offer flexibility in terms of timing. While donors can take an immediate deduction when they contribute assets, they can delay the actual distribution of funds to charities. This allows donors to manage their giving strategically, decide when and where their funds are allocated, and optimize their charitable impact.  The Emergence of Bitcoin DAFs  Bitcoin DAFs combine the flexibility and tax benefits of traditional DAFs with the unique advantages of on-chain bitcoin. Donors who own bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) can contribute them directly to a bitcoin DAF, receiving the same tax benefits as donating appreciated securities.  While traditional DAFs often accept cryptocurrency, they typically sell the digital asset for dollars, and then can give donors exposure to bitcoin within the DAFs via a bitcoin ETF or stocks like MicroStrategy. With a bitcoin DAF, the bitcoin can be donated directly, it remains within the DAF on-chain in mutli-signature custody, and grants can be made in bitcoin or U.S. dollars to any 501c3.  Bitcoin DAFs have seen great early success, with the world’s first bitcoin grant from a DAF going to Base58 School of Engineering and a one bitcoin grant gifted to the Human Rights Foundation.  - Phil Geiger, VP of product marketing, Unchained  Ask an Expert  Q. How do financial advisors think through a conversation about “giving”?  It all comes back to purpose and the overall intent of wanting to give. I believe that most should consider giving if there is a visceral desire to support others in some form. By leading with selflessness, people are leading with the right perspective in mind.  Q. What resources exist to support people on this journey of giving in a more well-rounded way?  Registered investment advisors are positioned to have more holistic conversations so clients can optimize their giving goals and priorities. Beyond that, The Giving Block is a great educational resource for donors and charitable organizations alike. Last but not least, Endaoment has paved the way by using blockchain technology to streamline the process of on-chain giving via a range of asset types.  Q. Why is giving even more relevant today when the markets are accelerating?  When markets move higher, any realization of gains can create tax ramifications. By design, a DAF allows you to reduce some of your tax liabilities while mitigating the volatility risks of assets that have appreciated swiftly. This could also allow donors to diversify their asset mix more broadly because of the indirect rebalancing effect.  This can also create an opportunity for legacy and multi-generational giving. Deepening values and putting your family in a situation that allows donors to support causes beyond their lifetime is a great way to take a tip from the Rockefeller family, which has been giving to philanthropic causes for six generations.  - Eric Tomaszewski, Financial Advisor, Verde Capital Management  Keep Reading  Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Trump reiterated he would create a U.S. bitcoin reserve.

The Fed cut interest rates by 25bps but pushed back against expectations for a continuation of rapid interest rate cuts in 2025. What just happened? The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points which is exactly what 97% of market participants wanted. But, the S&P 500 just posted its largest post-Fed drop since March 2020, erasing $1.8 TRILLION of market cap. Why? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 Despite the sharp intra-day decline, the Dogecoin price is holding above support in the form of the 50DMA and its recent range lows around $0.35 for now. After such a strong rally in recent weeks since Donald Trump’s election victory in early November, some are concerned that a deeper retracement could be on the cards in the short term. $0.33-35 has been a key level for Dogecoin going all the way back to mid-2021. Should this level go, the Dogecoin price would be at risk of a sharp dump back towards its early 2024 highs in the $0.23 area. While Dogecoin investors might need to brace for a short-term market dip, there remains plenty of reason to be optimistic on the cryptocurrency’s chances for 2025. Here’s why. Bullish Dogecoin Price Outlook for 2025 – When Will DOGE Hit $1? Dogecoin has two main factors that are playing in its favor. Firstly, the arrival of the Trump administration and a new US Congress is expected to usher in a new golden age for the crypto industry in the US. Meanwhile, chatter about the establishment of a US strategic reserve in the US and in other major nations continues to grow. These combined factors suggest there is massive potential for price growth ahead for major cryptocurrencies – as the number one meme coin, Dogecoin is in a prime position to benefit. Secondly, Dogecoin is inexorably tied into the new Trump administration, with Elon Musk’s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) named after it. Department of Government Efficiency pic.twitter.com/HFeHYNIkJN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 7, 2024 Musk has been a long-term supporter and proponent of Dogecoin. The world’s largest meme coin is all but guaranteed to retain a leading portion of mind share in the meme coin market as Musk’s D.O.G.E. makes headlines, for better or for worse. So, assuming everything goes to plan – Bitcoin reserves are established and the crypto industry booms – in the coming years, it’s probably just a question of when, not if, Dogecoin hits $1. Analyzing Dogecoin’s relationship to Bitcoin during the last three market cycles can help us answer this question. During the past three market cycles, when Bitcoin (BTC) entered a new phase of price discovery (as it did in April 2017, December 2020 and just recently in November 2024), Dogecoin has always still been languishing well below its record highs. This time is no different. But during the past two market cycles, it only took the Dogecoin price between 1-3 months to catch up and break out to its own record highs. So, assuming history does repeat itself, a DOGE breakout could be coming as soon as early 2025, with $1 likely to be quickly hit. Does This Vote-to-Earn Meme Coin Have Even Bigger Upside Potential? Dogecoin could easily more than 2x in 2025 to hit $1. But there are many smaller, lesser-known meme coins that could post far larger gains. The team at crypto news.com keeps a close eye on the meme coin market as they hunt for high-potential projects. And one new meme coin they like a lot is an exciting new DAO-powered vote-to-earn meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) . One of the reasons analysts at crypto news.com are so excited about this token is the impressive pace at which is has been raising funds from earlier investors. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, Flockerz (FLOCK) has already attracted over $7 million from eager buyers. The Flock is growing day by day! 7M raised and this flocks here to stay! pic.twitter.com/a8gFhYt4P8 — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 17, 2024 Couple that with its impressive social media metrics, and this token is looking like a meme coin that could really pop. With new meme coins like Fart Coin recently hitting a $1 billion market cap, the appetite for novel new meme coins appears elevated. FLOCK could easily become one of the best meme coins to launch in 2024. ClayBro outlines in the video below why he thinks the token has 25x potential.

In fact, with fresh presales, community-driven projects, and new use cases, the meme coin scene is evolving into something much bigger than a passing trend. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to invest in December 2024, then you’re in luck. This December, three meme coins stand out from the crowd: BTFD Coin (with a raging presale that gathered $4.1 million so far), Turbo, and COQ Inu. Each of these projects is packing a serious punch in terms of potential, utility, and community support. Let’s dive into why analysts are so optimistic about these coins and why they could make great investments before the year wraps up. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves As we approach the end of 2024, BTFD Coin continues to generate massive buzz in the meme coin market. The best meme coin to invest in December 2024 just might be this one, thanks to its explosive presale, highly engaged community, and features that make it a standout in the meme space. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00013, having raised over $4.1 million. The presale has been a total success, with over 56 billion tokens sold and 5,900+ Bulls holding tokens already. For investors looking to capitalise on this presale opportunity, here’s an investment scenario to consider: If you were to invest $7,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d be able to snag an impressive 53.8 million BTFD tokens. Now, if the price increases to $0.0006 post-presale (which many analysts are predicting), that $7,000 investment could skyrocket to $32,300. That’s over 460% growth—and it’s all thanks to the strong foundation and massive community backing BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin’s ecosystem also includes staking rewards, offering one of the highest APYs in the meme coin space (think 90%+). This creates an additional layer of opportunity for investors to grow their holdings even more. Add in the fact that BTFD Coin has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that ties in directly with its ecosystem, and you’ve got a meme coin with long-term potential far beyond just its presale. Turbo: A Meme Coin Changing the Game with TurboChain Turbo was born from an AI-generated meme coin idea, and it has evolved into something far more significant thanks to the launch of TurboChain. This Layer-1 blockchain is set to support decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, blockchain-based games, and much more, giving Turbo a huge edge in terms of real-world use. The collaboration between Aurora Labs and NEAR Protocol has paved the way for TurboChain to support fast transactions and scale well beyond what most other blockchains are capable of. This will be a game-changer for developers looking to create decentralised apps (dApps) on TurboChain, which has been designed with customisability in mind. Developers can now innovate quicker and more efficiently than ever before. Turbo’s market cap sits at $690 million, and it’s listed on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and KuCoin. What’s more, all gas fees on TurboChain will be paid in Turbo tokens, which further increases the utility and demand for this coin. The combination of high demand for transactions, increasing blockchain usage, and an expanding ecosystem means that Turbo is one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Additionally, analysts are predicting big things for Turbo in 2025, with the price forecasted to rise from its current value of $0.06049 to around $0.10 by mid-2025. COQ Inu: The Meme Coin with Community Power and Strong Personality COQ Inu has developed a strong presence on the AVAX blockchain, making it one of the most popular meme coins on the network. With a $138 million market cap and a circulating supply of 69.42 trillion tokens, COQ Inu may have taken a slight dip recently (down 11.16% in the last 24 hours), but this is precisely why some investors are jumping in to buy the dip. COQ Inu was founded by respected members of the community who initially placed the entire coin supply with 150 AVAX in liquidity. The team has fully renounced the contract and burned liquidity, ensuring a strong foundation for long-term growth. What makes COQ Inu particularly interesting is its community-oriented nature and meme culture. The token’s personality revolves around fun, light-hearted branding that has struck a chord with meme coin enthusiasts, helping to establish it as a cult favourite. While COQ Inu doesn’t have the same kind of groundbreaking utility as Turbo or BTFD Coin, its growing presence on top exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and Gate.io has cemented it as a meme coin worth watching. Additionally, with a price currently sitting at $0.000002, there’s room for big gains should the price rebound and continue upwards in the coming months.

37819481,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630069,1734566764,Sony deepens collaboration with AMD for PlayStation PS5 Pro,"Sony is broadening its partnership with AMD by infusing AI into PlayStation games to improve their appearance and playability. PlayStation’s lead architect, Mark Cerny, who first introduced the PS5 Pro in September, announced on Wednesday that the two companies were creating a deeper collaboration to work on “machine learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay.” Sony wants to improve game graphics According to an article by The Verge , the two companies already have an existing partnership on the PS5 Pro and PS5 Pro’s GPUs based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture. The article further explains that PS5Pro uses a feature called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) to improve image clarity and frame rates. The new GPU is a combination of what was already offered on the PS5 with, according to Engadget , some cherry-picked features from the more advanced RDNA3 architecture that AMD introduced in 2022. That’s paired with ray tracing techniques that Cerny says in a video are from future RDNA tech on AMD’s roadmap and custom machine learning features created for the PS5 pro. The machine learning components are also reportedly a crucial part of AMD and Sony’s future work together. In the 37-minute presentation , Cerny explained the technical aspects of the PS5 Pro and other additional information about the “multi-year” project with AMD which is codenamed “Amethyst.” “And I’m honored to announce that we have begun a deeper collaboration with a focus on machine learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay,” said Cerny. Although he did not give the finer details about when and where the Project Amethyst tech will be used, it appears like something the market could see on the next PlayStation and other future hardware of which AMD is a part of. “These components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics.” Cerny. According to Cerny, the two firms have two goals with Project Amethyst. “The first goal is a more ideal architecture for machine learning,” explained Cerny, adding the second goal is to develop “a set of high-quality CNNs for graphics.” “Both SIE and AMD will independently have the ability to draw from this collection of network architectures and training strategies, and these components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics as well as enabling more extensive use of ray tracing and path tracing,” added Cerny. The technology should extend beyond PlayStation The collaboration between them is a culmination of the companies’ desire to push gaming tech even further. Additionally, the collaboration is expected to improve on what PlayStation has already accomplished with SP5 Pro, with their results starting to show with future console iterations like the inevitable PS6. Cerny explained that both Sony and AMD do not want the technology to be exclusive to PlayStation but to be used “broadly across PC and console cloud.” “Through this technology collaboration we’re looking to support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices,” said Cerny. In the video, Cerny further discussed three specific areas and their future potential growth – rasterized rendering, ray tracing, and machine learning. According to Cerny, out of the three areas, rasterized rendering has the lowest potential for growth with improvements coming from using larger GPU or faster memory. Ray tracing has growth potential as the technology is still new and the tech is expected to see “quantum leaps” in the next decade, while machine learning has the greatest growth potential, which explains which it is the current focus for AMD and Sony. In his presentation, Cerny also highlighted chances were high the market might not see hardware that uses technology from Project Amethyst until PlayStation 6, since creating a console is “roughly a four-year journey.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sony-collaborates-with-amd-for-ps5-pro/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37819481.jpeg

37819479,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630064,1734566565,"American Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Pros, Cons, and Possibilities","U.S. states like Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania are exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset to hedge against inflation. However, experts like Nic Carter caution that its volatility could destabilize the global financial system. Despite these risks, Bitcoin’s growing adoption suggests it could play a larger role in future finance if the Government adopts it. Bitcoin has become an investment and a potential store of value. As governments and states explore new ways to hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, one of the best ways is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Several U.S. states are now considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset, which could alter how financial systems operate. Bitcoin as a Financial Asset Unlike traditional currencies Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any government or central authority. Over the years, Bitcoin has grown with both retail and institutional investors considering it as an alternative investment. Some see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and even a potential future currency. In recent times, even governments and large corporations are starting to take notice of Bitcoin’s potential as Reserve. One of Bitcoin’s biggest supporters has been Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy. Saylor has purchased about 439,000 Bitcoins which is about$46 billion worth for his company’s treasury. This sets an example for other companies and governments to consider Bitcoin a reserve asset. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Interest from U.S. States Ohio has recently introduced a proposal for a “Bitcoin Reserve Fund,” which is allowing the state to purchase Bitcoin as part of its investment strategy. Recently, El Salvador and the Central African Republic have both adopted Bitcoin as an official legal tender. Companies like Metaplanet also adopts Bitcoin reserve as an asset, As this follows from other states of U.S. like Pennsylvania and Texas, which have also proposed laws to create Bitcoin reserves. In Ohio, House Republican Leader Derek Merrin introduced the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 703) in December 2024. This bill would give the Ohio State Treasurer the authority to buy Bitcoin, protecting against the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Merrin stated, “The U.S. Dollar is being rapidly devalued, and our State Treasurer should have the authority and flexibility to invest in Bitcoin when determining proper asset allocation.” As Bitcoin offers strong potential as a reserve asset due to its deflationary nature, with a fixed supply of 21 million coins making it a hedge against inflation. It ensures security and independence from political or banking instability. Bitcoin also provides diversification for state reserves, which is reducing reliance on traditional assets. Risks and Challenges of a Bitcoin Reserve Nic Carter, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures recently in Bloomberg expressed concerns about the potential adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset during an interview on Bloomberg TV. He argued that such a move could undermine global confidence in the US dollar, which is the most important of the current financial system. Carter stated, “I don’t think this is going to happen because it would erode confidence in the dollar, and that would be a negative outcome for everyone involved.” He also believes that using Bitcoin as a reserve asset could cause more problems than benefits. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s price can be very unstable, which could create issues for the global financial system, which currently depends on the stable US dollar. He said, “This is not a good idea because it could lead to volatility and instability in global markets.” As Bitcoin becomes more popular, it’s important for policymakers and financial institutions to think about these risks. As we all know the main problems with using Bitcoin as a reserve asset is its price volatility. Bitcoin’s value can change dramatically in a short period. For example, in 2021, its price went from nearly $70,000 to around $30,000. This kind of price swing makes Bitcoin an unstable choice for governments, as it could lead to unexpected losses if its value drops suddenly. Another issue is the lack of clear regulations around Bitcoin as he mentioned. Recently, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said that nothing to do with Bitcoin that there are no laws governing its use. So, the market reacted all of a sudden when Powell’s comments. That led to a sudden drop in Bitcoin’s value from $107,00 to $101,300. So, Bitcoin can be a risky asset for governments, as sudden changes in the market can lead to financial instability for investors. Possible Futures for Bitcoin R eserves Matt, Bitwise CIO said that in an interview by December 2025, Bitcoin will likely surpass $200,000. He highlights three key things could support for the rally, ETFs, public companies like MicroStrategy, and even governments buying Bitcoin. As Matt puts it, “there’s just too much demand, not enough supply,” which he believes that will make the price higher. Also, Matt argues that we’re still in the early stages of this journey. As he said, “if we do get a Bitcoin strategic reserve where the government is buying Bitcoin… you’re going to be looking at three, four, $500,000 Bitcoin.” Although he still thinks the odds are less than 50%, but it could gain traction especially with the support from key leaders. He added, If the U.S. government starts holding Bitcoin as a reserve, its price could go up by reaching $300,000 to $500,000. While this is just an idea. Some U.S. states like Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania are thinking about holding Bitcoin as part of their reserves, hoping it could protect against inflation. But its price swings and lack of clear rules are big concerns.

After hitting a local top of $1.32, ADA retraced over 30%, dropping to $0.91 before returning to a critical support level. This price action has left investors speculating whether the current recovery marks the start of a new bullish phase or simply a temporary pause before further downside. Related Reading: Solana Monthly Chart ‘Looks Ready For A Monster Run’ – Details Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared key insights on X, leveraging Santiment metrics to shed light on whale activity driving Cardano’s market movements. According to Martinez, large ADA holders began taking profits as the price rallied from $1.15 to $1.33. However, the story shifted dramatically as ADA dropped below $1, with whales accumulating again at the $0.91, signaling renewed confidence in the token’s potential. With whale activity and market dynamics heating up, Cardano has returned to a pivotal price range that could define its trajectory in the coming weeks. Investors are now closely watching whether this accumulation phase will fuel a sustainable rally or if further consolidation lies ahead for ADA. One thing is certain—Cardano remains a token to watch as volatility continues to shape its price action. Data Reveals Cardano Whales Behavior The past few weeks have been highly volatile for Cardano (ADA), reflecting the broader market’s unpredictable movements and the strategic plays of smart money. ADA has become a focal point for large investors making calculated moves as the market evolves. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted data from Santiment that underscores the pivotal role of whale activity in shaping ADA’s price action. Martinez revealed that Cardano whales began offloading their holdings as the price rallied from $1.15 to $1.33, locking in significant profits. However, as the price dropped sharply to $0.91, these same whales re-entered the market, purchasing an impressive 160 million ADA during the dip. This buying spree has sparked optimism, suggesting that smart money views Cardano as bullish over the coming months. Such activity often indicates confidence in the asset’s potential to rebound and possibly outperform. However, it’s crucial to consider an alternative perspective. This accumulation phase might also serve as a short-term liquidity strategy designed to attract retail investors into ADA, potentially setting the stage for another wave of profit-taking by larger holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? As ADA hovers near critical levels, its next moves will likely depend on how these dynamics unfold. Whether this is a prelude to a sustained rally or a tactical maneuver by smart money, Cardano remains a key asset to watch in the weeks ahead. Price Holding Above $1 Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.04, marking a swift recovery after spending only a few days below the critical $1 mark last week. This rebound showcases strong buying interest around the $1 level, which has historically acted as a psychological and technical support zone. If ADA manages to sustain its position above $1 in the coming days, the next target lies around $1.20—a price level that previously triggered significant selling pressure. Reclaiming this level would confirm bullish momentum and signal buyers are ready to challenge higher resistance zones. For ADA bulls to maintain momentum and drive the price higher, breaking and consolidating above the $1.20 mark is crucial. This would demonstrate the market’s strength and potentially pave the way for a broader rally. However, failing to claim $1.20 could result in another period of consolidation or even a pullback, as sellers may step in to defend this resistance level.

With recent whale accumulation adding bullish sentiment, ADA’s ability to hold above $1 and target $1.20 will likely define its short-term trajectory.
