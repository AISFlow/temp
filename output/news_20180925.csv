42381262,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94T1F,1537910996,Coinbase Gears Up for Biggest-Ever Expansion of Crypto Asset Listings,"Coinbase has revamped its policy for listing new cryptocurrencies, replacing an ad hoc process with one the startup hopes will rapidly expand the range of assets traded on its exchange.  Announced Tuesday, the new system allows almost anyone to submit a cryptocurrency through an online form for evaluation under the company's digital asset framework. Those that meet the criteria may be listed, although not necessarily available right away to all Coinbase customers.  That's because listings will be added on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, rather than supporting all assets globally as Coinbase has done up until now. As a result, some coins won't be available for Coinbase customers to trade in places where local regulations either expressly forbid them or are unclear about their legality. It's not unlike Netflix streaming certain movies in one country but not another for copyright reasons.  Previously, there was no formal mechanism to request a listing, and some organizations would reportedly lobby Coinbase to support their assets. As such, the change represents a welcome mat of sorts to crypto development teams from a company whose mainstream popularity potentially offers unparalleled exposure.  ""We're now actively reaching out to asset developers with this,"" Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan told CoinDesk. Referring to the creators of the first two digital currencies the company listed, bitcoin and ethereum, he added:  ""Satoshi and Vitalik [Buterin] were not Coinbase customers. But all future and current asset creators and developers are. So it's like we're becoming a two-sided marketplace.""  In this marketplace, Coinbase will charge an application fee and an additional fee to list approved assets. Srinivasan would not say how much they will be but said they wouldn't be prohibitive.  Further, the application fee is only meant to deter spam, he said, and the listing fee will cover the cost of due diligence. ""We do not want that to be a burden that deters people from listing new assets with us,"" Srinivasan said.  In the meantime, Srinivasan confirmed Coinbase is still evaluating cryptocurrencies such as ada, lumens, and zcash, which may be rolled out globally or selectively depending on specific regulatory requirements.  Yet aside from regulatory and technical considerations, the main listing criterion for Coinbase is market demand.  ""We want to make sure that our customers are there,"" Srinivasan said. The three big questions are ""A) is it legally compliant? B) Is it technically secure and innovative? C) Do our customers want it?""  Worldwide compliance  Coinbase may be breaking ground here, as jurisdiction-by jurisdiction asset listings appear to be a rare practice among crypto exchanges.  ""It's actually an approach I've been advocating for a long time,"" said Stephen Palley, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill, who often pokes fun at crypto entrepreneurs' naivete about legal requirements.  ""If you're Ford or you're Apple or you're Google and you want to sell your stuff worldwide, you actually do worldwide compliance,"" he said, noting that such brands tend to customize their terms of service for specific countries.  While it's ""a smart play"" that minimizes legal risks while allowing a company to engage in selective market testing, Palley added:  ""It's a pain in the ass and it's expensive.""  Indeed, putting this policy into practice is likely to add a layer of complexity to Coinbase's operations, as the company will have to make sure that customers are not trading assets that their local regulators don't allow.  Crypto exchanges have already faced similar challenges in preventing their sites from being accessed in U.S. states where they aren't licensed to do business.  ""While geoblocking may help prevent crypto companies from inadvertently becoming subject to certain rules and regulators, even that precaution may not be enough,"" said Justin Steffen, a litigation partner at Jenner & Block LLP. ""The New York Attorney General's recent report on crypto exchanges, for example, noted the lack of exchanges that limit VPN access.""  When asked about this, Srinivasan said Coinbase ""will do whatever is necessary to remain compliant with local law. This may mean using [customer identification] details in addition to or as a supplement to IP address. (I.e., enforcing restrictions based on a customer's country of residence/bank account).""  Unanswered questions  There are still many questions to be answered about how this switch will impact Coinbase users.  For instance, will moving from California to New York mean a customer loses access to assets she purchased on Coinbase? Also, if Coinbase does block VPNs, that could be a turn-off for privacy-conscious users, or, say, Americans traveling to countries like China or Iran with restricted internet service, where ""tunneling"" is the only way to access regularly visited sites.  Further, a handful of people at the company are responsible for evaluating these assets, and Srinivasan declined to specify what benchmarks they will be expected to hit or how internal policies will prevent insider trading. Accusations related to such alleged conflicts of interest plagued the company in the past when it came to assets such as bitcoin cash and litecoin, the latter of which was created by former Coinbase employee Charlie Lee.  Finally, it remains to be seen how the crypto community will react to the idea of Coinbase charging teams a fee for listing, given that high fees at some exchanges have sparked controversy in the past and charges of ""pay to play"" practices.  But Marshall Swatt, founder of the institutional crypto asset exchange Swatt Exchange, told CoinDesk that listing fees are a standard part of running an exchange.  ""Every major exchange of financial instruments — such as the equities industry — charges listing fees. It is extremely costly for an exchange to onboard a new instrument, and there is no way to avoid that cost,"" Swatt said, adding:  ""Every new blockchain adds risk to an exchange's operations. I'm wholly in favor of an exchange charging a listing fee, and I don't see any ethical or other issues with doing so. Whether they let the market decide the fee, or set a flat fee, or some other reasonable arrangement is completely appropriate.""

42381258,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94SxT,1537907450,A Major Regulatory Effort Is Brewing to Revive the US ICO Market,"Some 80 representatives from the cryptocurrency and traditional finance industries trekked to Washington, D.C. on Tuesday with a singular message for U.S. lawmakers: we need regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs).  That message was fully on display during the ""Legislating Certainty for Cryptocurrencies"" event held this week at the Library of Congress. Over the course of the morning and early afternoon, stakeholders outlined the difficulties they face when launching projects and products in the U.S.  The culprit behind their woes: uncertainty as to when cryptocurrencies are treated as securities and how startups should approach compliance more broadly.  Members of Congress, it would seem, are receptive to their complaints. Congressman Warren Davidson, who hosted the event, positioned the forum as a round-table discussion to solicit input from the industry on these very points. A spokesperson for the lawmaker told CoinDesk that Warren intends to introduce ""light touch"" legislation sometime within the next three weeks.  ""Your input is critical to helping us preempt a heavy-handed regulatory approach that could stall innovation and kill the U.S. ICO market,"" Davidson told attendees during his prepared remarks.  He added:  ""With a thoughtful, bipartisan approach that protects consumers, advances free market solutions and defines safe-harbors for the early stage innovators, Congress can send a powerful message around the world that the U.S. is the best destination for ICO markets.""  The issues at hand  At the heart of these debates is a desire to advance cryptocurrency adoption within the U.S. However, as CoinList general counsel Georgia Quinn noted on Tuesday, there is a dearth of clarity guiding these developers.  The issues range from how cryptocurrency gains are taxed to whether someone crypto startups qualify as money transmitters. What's more, there's a question as to the U.S. government itself can take advantage of the nascent technology.  Blockchain president and chief legal officer Marco Santori explained the backstory behind treating token sales as securities offerings, in particular highlighting the development of the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) framework.  The SAFT framework, he said, was an attempt at finding a way to conduct token sales without running afoul of securities laws.  He went on to explain:  ""The SAFT project was launched around this time last year. We did not invent it by any stretch … for those of us who were involved in the early project, I think we all realized it was not an ideal solution. As Coin Center put it, it was the symptom of regulatory uncertainty. It was not the best we can do. It was the best we could do.""  Lawmaker 'ignorance'  An acknowledged barrier to positive action was once again highlighted during the event: the need for lawmaker education.  As Representative Darren Soto put it, most lawmakers in Congress aren't exactly opposed to the technology – they're just very unfamiliar with it.  Indeed, Davidson joins a growing group of U.S. lawmakers who believe that some form of accommodative legislation is necessary to spur development around cryptocurrencies.  He's not alone. Just last week, Representative Tom Emmer, one of the guests at the forum and the newly-named co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, proposed a trio of bills aimed at encouraging innovation without unfairly penalizing those who seek to launch token sales or otherwise transact with cryptocurrencies.  While one of Emmer's bills focuses on the taxation of cryptocurrency investment gains, Representative Kevin Brady and the House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service last week requesting that the nation's tax agency publish comprehensive guidance for U.S. residents – something the IRS hasn't done to date.  Quinn told CoinDesk that she was unsure what sort of legislation may be required in the end. Her goal at the forum, she explained, was to advocate for ""thoughtful"" legislation that may apply to a variety of tokens, rather than just adding a number of new regulations which may lead to further confusion and uncertainty.  ""This concept of regulation by enforcement is really not helping us. When you look at the cases being brought, they are the low-hanging fruit, it's the scammers, the liars ... It's not giving me any primers on how to operate a business,"" Quinn explained during the forum.  Providing this clarity can help the U.S. as well as startups, ConsenSys's Joyce Lai said, explaining that many startups may choose to set up shop in a friendlier country to avoid facing penalties for potential legal violations.  She concluded:  ""If we have a lot more clarity, you'll see a lot more projects.""

42381248,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Sof,1537893040,Music-Sharing Startup Audius Gives New Details on Twin Crypto Tokens,"Soon after closing a $5.5 million funding round, music-focused blockchain startup Audius is revealing just how its network will operate when it launches in roughly a year.  As previously reported, the firm is creating a decentralized platform aimed at providing artists the ability to take back control of their intellectual property's distribution, while connecting more easily with fans. Now, as revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Audius is taking the next step in the process with the publication of its white paper.  Co-founder Roneil Rumberg told CoinDesk in an email that he believes Audius distinguishes itself from existing platforms by not depending on any centralized infrastructure, adding:  ""We strongly believe in the value of a fully transparent, decentralized and community-driven effort to share the world's audio content.""  The startup plans to release two tokens: ""loud,"" to be used for conducting transactions, and ""audius,"" which will act as a governance token. Both creators and listeners can use loud tokens to ""interact with the protocol,"" according to the paper.  ""[Audius will be] used by service providers to participate in staking protocols and earn proceeds from the minting of loud tokens,"" it continues. ""This separates the mechanism for price-stable value transfer (loud) from the mechanism for value capture and accrual (audius), better serving the needs of users of each token.""  Under the proposed scheme, creators who receive loud tokens would be ""compensated in proportion to how much value they create."" Meanwhile, users who specifically contribute to the protocol itself would receive governance tokens  The startup also intends to ensure that the protocol is accessible to all, the white paper notes, provided users follow the protocol's rules.  Audius intends to maintain a stable price for the loud token algorithmically, and tokens will be created or burned as needed to ensure that there is a consistent supply and demand, according to the document.  In addition to the two tokens, the protocol is underpinned by several components, including a decentralized storage protocol, an upload manager, a payment and revenue sharing protocol, and a ""discovery protocol"" to help listeners find new music.  ""Our architecture includes novel work around how decentralized content discovery can work, including a cryptoeconomic mechanism for enforcing honest behavior of services indexing content. Discovery services index the Audius blockchain and are paid by other network participants to query this dataset,"" Rumberg explained.  To help govern the platform, the company also intends to release two meta-protocols. The first will establish a community of paid arbitrators tasked with resolving disputes, while the other will allow community members holding audius tokens to propose or vote on improvements to the system.  An alpha version of the platform is expected to go live by early next year, with a full launch slated for the end of 2019.

42381253,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94SnP,1537891241,Bitcoin Takes a Step Toward Becoming a 'Multi-Network' Cryptocurrency,"A proposal to radically expand the capabilities of bitcoin such that it would be able to add vast new features to its limited supply of cryptocurrency has arrived on testnet.  Paul Sztorc, director of research at startup Tierion, revealed to CoinDesk that a test version of the code is to be announced Tuesday, a development that comes nearly three years after the idea was first conceived in November 2015. Since then, momentum has built for the proposal, now hailed as perhaps the best way to implement sidechains on bitcoin.  First described in 2014  , the sidechains concept promises to enable the creation of branches on the bitcoin network that would function in a way not too dissimilar from ethereum tokens, in that crypto assets in these channels would, in effect, be able to be custom programmed.  Sztorc wrote in the blog post:  ""If this 'multi-network coin' idea is found to be viable, it has profound implications for the crypto's most salient problems. Bitcoin would be able to copy, without controversy, any technology, including: larger blocks, Turing-completeness, and ring signatures.""  That said, Sztorc said today's release ""isn't perfect,"" but marks the first code release for the concept.  Still, he added: ""It's good to be able to show people what exactly Drivechain does.""  Continuing, Sztorc framed Drivechain as code that, if eventually added to bitcoin, would free bitcoin developers from perhaps their biggest long-standing problem, the inability for new features to be added without changes to the incentives of the blockchain itself (Drivechain could be implemented as a soft fork).  Sztorc writes:  ""There would be no need to fight about which features bitcoin 'should' have (or over which features 'define' bitcoin).""  More details can be found in the full blog post.

And as Reuters further reports, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) wants to know why there was a ""delay in reporting the hack.""  News sources reported last week that the FSA was moving to open up a probe into the Zaif hack, though at the time officials hadn't issued a formal business improvement order, as they have now done.

""We have not received enough explanation on what exactly happened. What they told us is an employee's PC was hacked,"" the unnamed official said.

42381247,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Sm9,1537884666,"Mt Gox Trustee Has Sold $230 Million in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Since March","The trustee for the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has revealed new details about the pace of cryptocurrency sales as part of the firm's bankruptcy and rehabilitation process.  Attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi explained in a September 25 notice on the Mt. Gox website that over $230 million dollar's worth of bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) had been exchanged for fiat currency between March 18 and the start of civil rehabilitation on June 22.  According to the notice, the trustee sold 24,658.00762 BTC and 25,331.00761 BCH – quantities that brought in 25,975,702,352 Japanese yen, or $230,269,821.82.  Following the sale, the balance in the trustee account was ""approximately JPY 70,059 million,"" or around $621 million, Kobayashi added.  In the notice, the trustee also explained that a trust has been set up to preserve funds in fiat for bankruptcy creditors of the exchange.  Explaining the move to sell off the cryptos before the civil rehabilitation was initiated, Kobayashi wrote it was ""necessary and appropriate to procure a suitable amount of money to secure the interests [of] the creditors for the principal amount and delay damages of the determined and undetermined bankruptcy claims"" before the trust was set up.  While some creditors had applied for fiat refunds from the remaining holdings of Mt. Gox, others had requested to have their balances in cryptocurrency returned, since the values of BTC and BCH have climbed far above the levels seen at the time of the exchange's closure in 2014.  While likely good news for creditors seeking to be repaid in fiat, the sell-offs haven't been welcomed by some quarters of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Indeed, some have argued that the Gox trustee sales are partially behind the bear market seen across cryptocurrencies since the start of the year.  Back in March, CoinDesk reported that $400 million in BTC and BCH had been sold off in the preceding months by the Gox trustee, with Kobayashi stressing that the process was being carried out in a way that would not negatively impact the market.

42381264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94T2V,1537880423,"Early Execs Leave Block.one, the Peter Thiel-Backed Crypto Startup Behind EOS","Four early employees and two contractors have resigned from the Hong Kong cryptocurrency company Block.one to start up StrongBlock, a new blockchain project that is currently under wraps.  David Moss, Thomas Cox, Brian Abramson and Corey J. Lederer, the employees, were the second, third, fourth and fifth people to be hired by Block.one, the corporate parent of EOS. EOS, a computing protocol that competes with the technology behind the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains, supplies a native cryptocurrency of the same name.  According to LinkedIn, Abramson, Lederer, Cook and Mason left Block.one and EOS in the summer. Moss already quit by May, a month before Block.one published the EOS main network. EOS launched two test networks last year in September and December and two test networks this year in January and May. The main network was released as an open-source software platform in June.  ""We left because we saw a need in the blockchain marketplace that Block.one was not going to address,"" one of the former Block.one employees said, but did not specifically comment on StrongBlock's strategy to improve the EOS blockchain. StrongBlock CEO Moss has also said ""EOS will be a 787 and StrongBlock will be a custom 787 factory"" in a comparison of the two blockchains, according to a live tweet of the Global Media Blockchain Summit in Los Angeles last month.  The four employees, who joined Block.one last year, took on overwhelmingly technical roles. Starting in August 2017, Moss was the senior vice president of technology operations and Cox was the vice president of product. Abramson, the vice president of infrastructure, and Lederer, the senior director of technology products, on-boarded in September 2017. Software developers Jon Eric-Cook and Michael S. Mason, the contractors, began remote work on EOS in spring 2018.  The ex-Block.one associates formed StrongBlock in July 2018 with Branden Espinoza, an EOS governance specialist. Their departures have opened up a talent vacuum yet to be filled on Block.one's leading technical team. Block.one had recently raised billions in investor money and initiated the early stages of a core product roll-out on EOS. StrongBlock is in stealth and does not plan on releasing its product soon.    Billionaire backers  In August of this year, Block.one completed a year-long, $4 billion initial coin offering (ICO), the largest crowdfunding event involving the sale of a new cryptocurrency. The Block.one ICO priced EOS virtual currency, at the time an ethereum token, by market demand. One EOS reached over $20 in April and the EOS blockchain reserved $1 billion of the raise for development and financing. Today, EOS's market capitalization is valued at more than $5 billion.    A bevy of billionaires were among those who bet big on Block.one. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel, hedge fund managers Louis Bacon and Alan Howard and cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain invested in the funding round that ended at the ICO's close. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Christian Angermayer and Lansdowne Investment Company Ltd. participated in a previous round, a company press release said.  Other investors included Fred Wilson's Union Square Ventures and Multicoin Capital, a Texas cryptocurrency investment group backed by Andreessen-Horowitz and Chris Dixon. Dixon bought EOS without investing in Block.one in May 2017 around when co-founders Brock Pierce, CEO Brendan Blumer and CTO Dan Larimer introduced EOS.  Blumer, a 32-year-old video game entrepreneur, sold gaming accessories startup Gamecliff to Internet Gaming Entertainment when he was 19. Larimer, who is 36, is known for building decentralized cryptocurrency exchange BitShares and blockchain social media network Steemit.  Pierce, who is also chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation and co-founder of the Tether stablecoin and blockchain fund Blockchain Capital, no longer held a role at Block.one after the HBO talk show ""Last Week Tonight"" aired a March segment about cryptocurrency.    On the show, host John Oliver jabbed at Pierce's eccentric lifestyle, out-there promotion of EOS and leadership at Digital Entertainment Network, a 1990s dot-com company that allegedly ran a Hollywood pedophilia ring from a Los Angeles McMansion, according to lawsuits filed in California accusing two DEN executives and Pierce, now 37 years of age, of sexually assaulting three underage males at house parties.  One of the executives, DEN co-founder and then-CEO Marc Collins-Rector, was previously arrested and convicted for sexually abusing a minor in New Jersey.  Buggy blockchain  EOS claims to solve bitcoin and ethereum's scalability, smart contract writing and decentralized functionality issues with delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), a type of governance model for validating blockchain units to prevent network attacks and faulty transaction recording.  DPoS, a hybrid of the bitcoin blockchain's proof-of-work (PoW) and the ethereum blockchain's proposed proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, asks users to vote on ""witnesses"" to confirm blocks. 21 nodes produce the blocks to be controlled by parties pre-selected by EOS.  In contrast, PoW and PoS users expend computing resources. PoW network participants verify blocks by mining randomly generated cryptographic hashes without being given special preference, whereas block overseers for PoS, a closer relative of DPoS, are assigned mining power based on the amounts of cryptocurrency they hold.    PoS and DPoS have been widely criticized for enabling subjectivity and centralization of network decision-making. Staking model skeptics caution PoS and DPoS super-majorities can band together to make validation slower and less neutral than in PoW blockchains.  These concerns over unduly influenced collective interests came into full view when the entire EOS network froze on June 16, two days after the first version of EOS was released. Block producers locked 7 accounts the next day to stop malicious actors from hacking into wallets and stealing user funds.  Five days later, the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF) executed an ""Emergency Measure of Protection Order"" to halt inbound and outbound transactions for 27 wallet addresses without explanation, stoking outcry claiming the bans set a dangerous precedent of terminating users and reversing transactions without cause — a risk not seen on the bitcoin network.  A block producer, who was dealing with a medical emergency, was threatened with a lawsuit the following week for failing to comply in a timely manner with another ECAF order that instructed him to update a network configuration, according to screenshots of WhatsApp conversations posted by several users on Twitter.  Larimer, under pressure from the controversy, sent out a statement recommending the dispute resolution body retreat into a passive role.  Since going live, the EOS network has struggled with defective source code. The EOS bug bounty program awarded a freelance software developer 6-figures on the first day of the main network's release at a rate of $10,000 for every error patched.  Business bump  Kyle Samani, a managing partner at Multicoin Capital and a vocal supporter of EOS, has not been discouraged. In a June interview with Fortune, Samani admitted EOS has made mistakes but compared them to the rough start he says the ethereum blockchain has overcome.  Multicoin Capital owns large positions in both ethereum and EOS. The fund has highly praised EOS in particular for its scalability, interoperability, low transaction fees, on-chain governance, arbitration constitution and inflationary economics in a glowing review downloadable for viewing on the fund's website.  Asked about Block.one being short-staffed, however, Samani told CoinDesk in an email:  ""We don't have anything to add on this front.""  Last week, Israeli decentralized cryptocurrency liquidity protocol Bancor publicized a cross-chain expansion from the ethereum to the EOS blockchain that will leverage EOS's transaction speed and cost-savings. BancorX, the anticipated product in the move, will trade between ethereum and EOS tokens issued from ICOs and decentralized applications.  However, in an interview with ZenLedger CEO Pat Larsen, former Block.one technology VP Moss said EOS's claims about processing ""millions of transactions per second"" might be ""a lot of hyperbole"" because ""there are some physical limitations, like the speed of light.""  The network could only conduct about 4,000 transactions at most at any given time, Moss clarified.  As of June, ethereum ran 8 decentralized applications with 300 or more active users, and EOS ran three. Ethereum launched in 2015.  Block.one did not respond to requests for comments about StrongBlock and the departures.

42381259,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Syj,1537875619,Over 75 New Banks: JPMorgan Expands Blockchain Payments Trial,"A major blockchain payments trial launched by JPMorgan, Australia's ANZ and the Royal Bank of Canada has just gained over 75 new banks as participants.  As reported by CoinDesk, the three banks set up the project in October 2017, aiming to slash both the time and costs required for interbank payments using traditional methods.  Called the the Interbank Information Network (IIN), the platform is built on Quorum – the ethereum-based blockchain network developed by JPMorgan and possibly to be spun off into its own enterprise.  Now, according to a report from the FT on Tuesday, a large group of major banks – including Societe Generale and Santander – has joined the trial in response to the rising number of rival payments offerings coming to market.  Jason Goldberg, banks analyst at JPMorgan, told the FT that payments is an area in which banks are most threatened by non-bank competition, adding: ""Blockchain is a way to keep more of that [business] in-house.""  In particular, the trial is aimed to address payments that contain errors or get held up for compliance reasons – problems that can takes weeks to solve with multiple banks being involved across the payments chain.  The effort will now see the banks transact around 14,500 USD-denominated payments per day over IIN, although that number is expected to rapidly expand as more new members join the project going forward.  JPMorgan also plans to add fiat currencies other than USD to the system eventually, the FT adds.  Correction (Sept. 27, 2018): This article has been amended to clarify that the participating banks would transact 14,500 payments per day, not payments to the value of $14,500.

42381269,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94T51,1537873223,Bearish Cross Hints at More Losses Ahead for Bitcoin Price,"Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive, having breached crucial support on Monday and could suffer a deeper drop, courtesy of a bearish crossover between key moving averages.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,420 on Bitfinex, representing a 3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  The bullish break above $6,600 witnessed on Friday had set the tone for a move toward the psychological hurdle of $7,000. However, the rally in alternative cryptocurrencies fizzled out over the weekend.  As a result, while BTC managed to hit 17-day highs above $6,800 on Saturday, it fell back below $6,600 yesterday, neutralizing the bullish outlook.  Further, the pullback from the weekend high of $6,841 to today's low of $6,370 validates the bearish view put forward by the negative moving average crossover on the monthly chart. Hence, BTC risks falling to the major support at $6,000 in the next few days.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, BTC has found acceptance below the double bottom neckline of $6,600. The bull failure, though encouraging, is not enough to call a bearish reversal.  Moreover, BTC is still trapped in the large pennant, and a UTC close below the lower edge of the pattern would confirm a revival of the sell-off from May highs above $8,500.  That said, the probability of a downside break is high as per the long duration chart.  Monthly chart  As seen in the above chart, the 5-month exponential moving average (MA) crossed the 10-month EMA from above at the turn of the last month, confirming a bearish crossover. More importantly, BTC's failure to hold above the MAs over the weekend added credence to the negative MA signal.  View  BTC's drop below $6,600 yesterday has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.  A downside break of the pennant pattern in the daily chart would open doors for re-test of the June low of $5,755.  The bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month EMAs indicates that BTC is more likely to find acceptance below the pennant support, currently located at $6,265.

The group's investment arm, SBI Holdings, which launched Japan's first bank-backed crypto exchange in June, said in a news release Tuesday that it is about to kick off a proof-of-concept trial of its ""S coin"" token that is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT).  Describing S coin as a ""settlement coin,"" SBI Holdings's blockchain lead Mamoru Fujimoto and Yoshitaka Kitao, president of the company, jointly said the token will allow charging and settlement over users' smartphones.  In the trial, they explained, employees of the group will be using the firm's S Coin Platform to carry out cash-free purchases at cafes and restaurants around the firm's headquarters in Tokyo.  To allow staff to access the token, SBI Holdings installed a machine from Glory, which makes and operates automated cash devices, linking to the S-Coin Platform. Trial participants will use the machine to top up with credit card and other means, after which S coins are sent to their mobile devices via a mechanism designed by SBI.  The release hints that any future products built around the S Coin Platform may distributed in conjunction with Glory, which had total assets of nearly $3 billion in its latest financial report, saying:  ""By doing this, we exchange cash with various electronic currencies and verify whether we can meet the needs of various users envisioned. After that, we will promote consideration of electronic currency settlement, such as enabling settlement with Glory's products.""  The effort is also aimed at looking at further possibilities and use cases for DLT.  The S Coin Platform, the release further explains, was developed by SBI Holdings using DLT provided by a tech startup called Orb. The platform enables users to ""design and publish"" custom cryptocurrencies for specific applications.  Orb's blockchain is built for transaction processing and management in financial and contract applications, its website indicates, touting its ""high availability, scalability, and security in private or consortium networks.""  Looking forward, Fujimoto and Kitao said SBI aims to help build ""a cashless society by offering various settlement infrastructure,"" in conjunction with Orb and Glory.

42429709,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0p3h,1537862428,Sandboxes Aren't Enough: Blockchain Leaders Seek Regulation Relief,"Even in blockchain-friendly jurisdictions, regulatory hurdles and old-fashioned mindsets are holding back innovation and growth for the industry.  At least, that's the conclusion you might have drawn from some of the talks at the Concordia Summit in New York Monday. The event, taking place alongside the United Nations General Assembly, included a special track devoted to blockchain discussions.  For example, so-called sandboxes may help both regulators and startups to work out new practices and come to terms about specific issues. Yet even they seem too cumbersome to some industry leaders.  ""One of the problems of the regulatory sandboxes: yes, they are the way to allow companies to innovate, but if I want to mitigate the risks, and if I see that it's going to take me two times, three times longer because of the regulator, it's limiting the innovation,"" Sam Cassatt, chief strategy officer of the ethereum production ConsenSys, remarked.  Further, while Singapore was praised as a forward-thinking jurisdiction, its openness to blockchain businesses has apparently not trickled down to the Pacific city-state's regulated financial institutions.  ""There is no question about the innovation and forward thinking there, but the challenge is the banks,"" said Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Trading, a New York-based market maker in digital currencies, sharing impressions from a recent Singapore trip. ""We can have not a single bank account in Singapore because we touch crypto.""  He described similar hurdles for young companies in the United States as well.  ""Because we're compliant with the SEC and FINRA, we spend $2 million to $3 million a year on compliance costs, but if you're a startup you can't afford it,"" Moro said.  'We gotta change the rules'  Yet the person who perhaps stole in the show in their advocacy for a more agile regulation was Eva Kaili, a member of the European Parliament representing Greece.  During Monday's event, Kaili unapologetically supported a lighter approach to regulation that wouldn't impair the growth of innovation, telling the audience:  ""One thing that we have in the E.U. and the U.K. — we have too many regulations that can at least delay the innovation. In blockchain, we tend to move very fast.""  The current state of the European financial system is looking more and more insufficient to the continent's governments, she went on to say, especially the number of transaction fees accumulating across the banking system. Next week, the European Commission is expected to adopt a resolution on blockchain and distributed ledger technology, initally passed by the European Parliament in May.  The resolution seeks to define the future regulatory framework for the businesses related to distributed ledger technology (DLT) and suggests the allocation of approximately 340 million euros to support pilot public projects in the E.U. between 2018 and 2020.  Kaili recalled the time when European regulators were discussing what they should do with so-called sharing economy startups like Uber and AirBnB.  ""Uber does not follow the rules — we just have to ban it,"" was one of the ways to think about it, she said, but such a stance makes the pursuit of innovative business models impossible.  ""If it's a fraud, it's a fraud. If it's not a fraud but it's not following the rules, we gotta change the rules,"" she said, adding that ""we don't have an excuse not to explore the opportunities this technology gives us to solve global problems.""  And regulators themselves may find that blockchain helps them do their own jobs better, according Blythe Masters, founder of enterprise DLT startup Digital Asset.  ""The notion of a regulator being able to have a wide real-time visibility into the transactional status of the market without having to subpoena 18 different broker-dealers in order to aggregate, after the fact, the activity on one beneficial owner — it's extremely attractive,"" said Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase executive who pioneered credit derivatives in the 1990s.""  She concluded:  ""There are a lot of real benefits for regulators.""  Photo of (left to right) Michael J.

42429726,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0pTh,1537855203,Wallet Provider Blockchain Sues Crypto Startup Days Before ICO,"Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency wallet provider Blockchain has filed a lawsuit against a startup with a similar name, the company announced Thursday.  Blockchain – formerly known as Blockchain.info – is suing Blockchain.io just days in advance of the latter's initial coin offering (ICO) over concerns that investors may believe they are buying tokens distributed by the wallet distributor, according to a public court filing.  Specifically, the suit names Paymium SAS, the company behind Blockchain.io, and founder Pierre Noizat, as defendants, claiming that Paymium has participated in ""bad acts,"" including the operation of the now-defunct crypto wallet Instawallet.  A representative for Blockchain told CoinDesk that the move came as a result of investors confusing the two firms, adding:  ""As we allege in our complaint, blockchain.io is using our brand to cover up a history of hacking and theft of user funds. Worse, they are raising money in a dubious ICO they claim is 'registered with the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission].' There is of course no registration statement in place. Given the current climate of SEC enforcement and scam ICOs, when users and investors alerted us to this confusion, we needed to step up and take action before any further harm was done.""  Among the suit's arguments is the claim that Blockchain.io's logo is similar to Blockchain's, which infringes its design marks (both logos are pictured above).  The complaint specifically states that ""Blockchain does not claim exclusive rights to the word 'blockchain' to describe the technology underlying cryptocurrencies ...Rather, it claims exclusive rights in the BLOCKCHAIN marks, which it has been using exclusively for its Blockchain Products and which have become well and favorably known to consumers throughout the United States and the world as identifying its highly regarded and secure services.""  It goes on to note that ""in 2018, after years of doing business under different trademarks, Paymium adopted the mark BLOCKCHAIN.IO in a blatant and bad faith attempt to capitalize on the valuable and trusted BLOCKCHAIN marks and to confuse consumers into believing Paymium's inferior services emanate from or are otherwise associated with Blockchain.""  ""Paymium's digital currency services are identical or nearly identical to Blockchain's Digital Wallet Services, Mobile App Services and Website Services, which allow consumers to exchange one form of digital currency for another, such as bitcoin for ether or bitcoin cash,"" the suit continued.  However, Blockchain.io has denied the claim, with founder Pierre Noizat telling CoinDesk that ""we find it strange that Blockchain Luxembourg filed a claim just [six] days before our public token sale when they had [six] years to contact us regarding our domain name if they had issues with it.""  Indeed, whois information confirms that the domain ""blockchain.io"" was first registered in April 2012 by Paymium. Public records with the National Institute of Industrial Property, the French patent office, also show that blockchain.io was registered as a brand in 2017.  However, it is unclear if there was any activity under the domain prior to 2018. The Wayback Machine does have a snapshot from 2017, indicating the domain may have simply redirected to Paymium's website at the time.  And while ICOs cannot ""register with the SEC,"" companies offering securities sales can declare their intent to do so. Public records indicate that Paymium filed a ""Form D"" for the sale of ""digital tokens"" in June 2018, announcing the company's intent to sell tokens in the future.  CoinDesk was unable to confirm that Blockchain.io had registered with the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution, or the French bank and insurance company monitor, as the firm claimed in its pitch deck.  Lawyers weigh in  The lawsuit has failed to impress at least some lawyers who work in the space.  Stephen Palley, an attorney with corporate law firm Anderson Kill P.C., told CoinDesk that ""it's an odd argument to make in a trademark infringement action.""  His colleague, Dan Healy, explained further, saying that ""BLOCKCHAIN"" is a generic term.  ""Generic terms are not generally trademarks because they do not identify [a] source. They generically refer to a thing or service. It looks like the plaintiff is trying to show that it is using its design mark as a source identifier for digital wallet services, as something not generic to blockchain, even though they are wallets for holding blockchain currency,"" he explained.  Palley expanded on that idea, noting that ""in fact, they had to disclaim any such protection, the lawsuit even says as much.""  He added:  ""Their use of the word blockchain isn't really protected under U.S. Trademark law ... Perhaps because they couldn't get protection for the word, they filed a ""design mark"" – ""blockchain"" in all capital letters with a picture next to it. And even though they don't have trademark protection for the word, it appears that they are in effect by this lawsuit trying to use their design mark to prevent blockchain.io from using the word blockchain.""  ""We think that's a weak argument,"" he concluded.  Healy noted that Blockchain disclaimed the term, saying ""no claim is made to the exclusive right to use BLOCKCHAIN apart from the mark as shown.""  ""That means the plaintiff has a design mark and disclaimed the exclusive right to use the term BLOCKCHAIN, but appears to be trying to enforce its mark to preclude other from using the term BLOCKCHAIN,"" he said.

42429705,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0ozh,1537850445,"In Wake of 'Major Failure,' Bitcoin Code Review Comes Under Scrutiny","""Shock"" is perhaps the word that best describes the mood ever since one of bitcoin's most severe bugs was discovered and patched last week.  As the community reels over the vulnerability that was hiding in the code for two years, and that could have been exploited to print more bitcoins than the 21 million is hard-coded to be produced, developers are wondering: Is there a way to prevent such a severe bug from being added to the code again?  Days after the discover, there hasn't been any formal proposals. But that's not to say the event hasn't prompted discussion about how bitcoin works and how similar bugs in the cryptocurrency's most popular software implementation, Bitcoin Core, can be identified and resolved in the future.  It's an important question, too – What if a malicious actor had found the exploit first? What if there are other hidden bugs in the code right now?  To this point, pseudonymous bitcoin subreddit moderator 'Theymos' urged the community not to forget the bug.  He argued it was ""was undeniably a major failure"" in a widely-circulated post, adding:  ""If all of Bitcoin Core's policies and practices are kept the same, then it's inevitable that a similar failure will eventually happen again, and we might not be so lucky with how it turns out that time.""  That said, there's an argument to be made that Bitcoin Core, powered by an open network of global participants, now has a more robust process for code review than at any time in the technology's history.  Right now, the implementation has more developers than ever contributing to the open-source codebase. And it is tested quite a bit; by one estimate, tests make up nearly 20 percent of the codebase.  The community's 'fault'  Still, developers argue more could be done to make sure the digital money works smoothly.  Theymos thinks one avenue would be to build ""more sophisticated"" tests tailored at locating severe, but hard to find bugs, like the one last week. ""Perhaps all large bitcoin companies should be expected by the community to assign skilled testing specialists to Core,"" he continued, adding:  ""Currently a lot of companies don't contribute anything to Core development.""  Bitcoin Core contributor James Hilliard stressed much the same, suggesting that developers can increase the ""amount"" and ""quality"" of testing. Though, this might be easier said than done. Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell agreed in Theymos's thread that testing is important, but the quality and detail of the tests is important.  ""Directing more effort into testing has been a long-term challenge for us, in part because the art and science of testing is no less difficult than any other aspect of the system's engineering. Testing involves particular skills and aptitudes that not everyone has,"" Maxwell said.  This sort of expertise is hard to find.  ""Bitcoin development is largely bottlenecked by code review and there are not a large amount of people out there who are able to do that,"" Hilliard told CoinDesk.  Yet, many others believe the responsibility shouldn't only rest on developers. A common sentiment shared was that as a decentralized project with no leaders, keeping bitcoin free of errors is a shared responsibility.  ""My main problem with a lot of the backlash is people pointing at specific developers to assign blame. The entire project is open, there is no 'membership' and users have just as much of a responsibility to audit code as developers actively contributing,"" pseudonymous bitcoin enthusiast Shinobimonkey told CoinDesk.  Such a sentiment was shared by Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan who tweeted, ""It was wrong that the buggy code was merged. Yes, we screwed up but the 'we' that screwed up is very wide. The whole community screwed up by not reviewing consensus changes thoroughly enough.""  Chaincode engineer John Newberry agreed. Even though he didn't write the buggy code, he argued that as a developer in the bitcoin world, he played a role in the error, too, by not looking closely enough.  He went as far as to say that the code in question had looked funny to him. Yet, he assumed others had already checked.  ""Instead of verifying for myself, I trusted that people smarter and wiser than I am had it covered. I took it for granted that someone else had done the work,"" he stated.  Multiple Bitcoin Cores  Still, some argue there will always be a risk of bugs.  ""There've been bugs in bitcoin before and there'll be bugs again. It's just software. There's nothing magical to it,"" tweeted Blockstream COO Samson Mow.  Along these lines, there's another popular idea floating around.  Today in bitcoin, there's one main bitcoin software, Bitcoin Core, run by 95 percent of bitcoin nodes. (At least that's according to one count – interestingly, there's no way to see every bitcoin node, because some nodes want more privacy and don't advertise their existence to the rest of the network.)  One idea, then, is to make more bitcoin code implementations. That way if one implementation has a disastrous bug that crashes the network, the other implementations could still be fine, keeping bitcoin as a whole running.  And to a certain degree, this already exists. There are lesser-known code implementations, such as Bitcoin Knots and Btcd. Elsewhere in the cryptocurrency world, this is becoming the norm. For instance, ethereum has two dominant implementations, geth and parity, each of which can be used by anyone running the software.  Still, many bitcoin developers worry that adding more than one implementation could introduce problems that would be even worse than last week's vulnerability.  ""What many people do not realize is that having people run different implementations makes it easier for attackers to partition the network,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow argued in a conversation outlining the pros and cons.  As such, developers don't necessarily agree on exactly what needs to be done.  Theymos perhaps put it best when he said:  ""I don't know exactly how this can be prevented from happening again, but I do know that it would be a mistake for the community to brush off this bug just because it ended up being mostly harmless this time.""
