Thanks are especially in order to the 2021 bull run that saw the price of bitcoin reach as high as $69,000, triggering an influx of new users into the market, both on the retail and institutional investor side. As it now stands, there are now more than 320 million crypto users around the world, according to recent data. Here are the countries that dominate the list. The United States Takes The Lead The United States has actually seen one of the most rapid adoptions of cryptocurrencies.

This is made even more evident that more than 80% of all crypto ATMs installed in the world exist in this region.

That’s because the only person with the authority to renew the domain, Virgil Griffith, is serving a 63-month prison sentence for helping North Koreans use cryptocurrencies to circumvent sanctions and has been unable to renew the domain from prison. According to a notice domain registrar GoDaddy published on its website late Friday, eth.link expired on July 26 and is set to return to a domain registry on Sept. 5, where it will be up for grabs for anyone who is able to take it.  ENS DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the Ethereum Name Service protocol, a Web3 version of a Domain Name Service provider. ENS is the protocol behind the numerous .eth names that have popped up throughout the Ethereum community. Users have bought .eth names as a way to own their own domains. ENS names can then be tied to your wallet address, making it easier for users to send and receive crypto (instead of having to type out a long, complex Ethereum address).  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Name Service? How ENS Works and What It’s Used For  According to Khori Whittaker, the executive director of ENS, “Virgil Griffith, who was working at the Ethereum Foundation when ENS launched, was an early contributor to the ENS protocol. Because ENS is a permissionless protocol, anyone can build dapps on top of it, which is the case for Virgil’s involvement with eth.link. He purchased the domain and built an application that resolves ENS domains.”  The DAO relied on the eth.link site to provide access to information about all ENS names. ENS DAO is already advising its users to switch over to eth.limo, another community operated domain.  According to a tweet from the ENS DAO Twitter account, EasyDNS CEO Mark Jeftovic had previously struck a deal to renew the domain address for another year before the domain provider allegedly decided to stop honoring the deal “suddenly” and “without notice.”  “Events like this ultimately show the importance of decentralized naming systems,” Whittaker told CoinDesk. “After eth.link was renewed, GoDaddy decided to ‘re-expire’ the domain, revealing the power and control that this legacy naming system has. In contrast, anyone can support an ENS domain by paying for renewal or extending it.”  ENS has seen accelerated growth over the last year, reaching two million domain name registrations on Aug. 17. It took five years for ENS to register its first one million names, but only 3.5 months to get to two million names.",NEGATIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ENS,"Elizabeth Napolitano, Margaux Nijkerk",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/26/web3-domain-name-service-could-lose-its-web-address-because-programmer-who-can-renew-it-sits-in-jail,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/110d8532dad4b87dece9af6e2a0d3f6af79e39c0-1706x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Bitcoin (BTC) dipped to its lowest price in over a month after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down on restrictive monetary policy early Friday at the central bank’s Economic Symposium.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit a low of $20,549 but is now trading around $20,666, down 4.3% over the past 24 hours and below the $21,000 perch BTC had occupied as investors waited for Powell’s much-anticipated speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  The Federal Open Market Committee’s decision whether to raise rates by 50 or 75 basis points at its next meeting in September will “depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook,” Powell said, referring to the Fed's rate-setting committee.  Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in an email that traders will have to anticipate whether risk aversion will push bitcoin’s price down to the $20,000 level.  “Risky assets are struggling as Powell’s fight against inflation will remain aggressive, even as it will trigger an economic slowdown,” Moya wrote.  Most altcoins also fell following Powell’s speech, with FLOW the biggest loser, dropping 11% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin, was down 8.5%.  The S&P 500 fell 3.25%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 3.8% as equity investors responded negatively to Powell’s remarks.

Featured Story  Federal Reserve’s Powell: Inflation Battle Not Yet Close to Finished  By Helene Braun  Restrictive monetary policy will likely be required for some time, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a long-awaited speech at the central bank’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  “Restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance,” Powell said.  Bitcoin (BTC) was little changed after the Fed chair's speech, suggesting that Powell’s rather hawkish comments were largely already priced into markets. However, that later changed drastically.  ""We expect a 75 basis point rate hike in September, and do not expect there to be a drastic effect on the markets should that come to pass, followed by successive rate hikes until inflation is reined in and the unemployment rate returns to a healthier number,"" Josh Olszewicz, head of research at digital asset fund manager Valkyrie Investments, wrote in an email immediately after the speech.

42422494,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lUnh,1661543328,"The Merge May Negatively Impact DeFi Protocols, Stablecoins: Report","Ethereum’s upcoming Merge could significantly impact the way DeFi protocols operate atop crypto’s most popular decentralized finance chain, according to a new DappRadar report published Friday.  The study focuses on delays that could arise during Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, better known as the Merge. The long-awaited (and often delayed) tech upgrade may slow transaction times or create service disruptions across DeFi lending protocols, creating headaches for the platforms, the report said. In turn, this could plunge stablecoin values and shrink DeFi lending pools.  Ethereum is host to an ecosystem of decentralized token trading, lending and yield-farming projects that together process billions of dollars in crypto value daily. Those DeFi protocols rely on Ethereum’s consensus mechanism to function properly for their own services to work.  Read more: Ether May Continue to Lose Momentum Until Merge Is Completed, BofA Says  Pedro Herrera, a data analyst at DappRadar, says the Merge’s negative effect on ether market supply could affect DeFi liquidity pools, even if the transition goes off without a hitch.  “If the Merge fails to successfully be launched, we will have delays on DeFi protocols that will affect stablecoins,” Herrera told CoinDesk. “But from the supply dynamics perspective, this can also take a toll on how stablecoins will be used for liquidity pools, in the DeFi space and beyond.”  Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is expected to slow the rate at which new tokens are issued – particularly in the months immediately following the switch. As token issuance slows, the blockchain’s token-burning mechanism will continue removing ether from circulation at the same rate as before the Merge. Over time, this could decrease ether’s total market supply.  Read more: What Is Proof-of-Stake?  It is also possible that DeFi platforms could experience network downtime as some Ethereum-based protocols lag behind the Ethereum chain in their transitions to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the report said.  “There is the risk that the Merge will result in technical difficulties such as a timestamp desynchronization between nodes or other technical issues that prevent the proof-of-stake to be in sync after the Merge,” said Herrera. “This could force Ethereum to pause block production or even halt [production] temporarily as their developers work on the issue.”  Even so, platforms themselves have projected confidence that the Merge will not impact their functionality. Uniswap, a popular trading hub, said its services “will continue to work seamlessly” throughout the upgrade.  Earlier this week, the Ethereum Foundation released an official timeline and framework for the completion of the Merge. On Sept. 6, the Bellatrix upgrade, which kicks off the official transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, will activate on the Beacon Chain.

42422496,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lUph,1661540312,Blockchain Startup Aims to Open the $1T Diamond Market to More Investors,"A pioneering software entrepreneur believes his nearly five-year-old blockchain company has found a way to open the $1.2 trillion diamond market to a wider group of investors.  Cormac Kinney sees Diamond Standard as a way to remove the major obstacles from owning and investing in the precious stones. Diamond Standard’s patented technology is designed to create a more transparent system allowing investors to track supply chains and subsequent ownership of the world’s ultimate bling more easily and efficiently.  Kinney noted in an interview with CoinDesk that the diamond market is “bigger than almost all other precious metals combined, except gold.” That diamonds are uncorrelated to gold, stocks or bonds also provides investors with a hedge.  “Blockchain was the last technology that we needed to turn diamonds into a commodity and unlock this new asset as a hedge, as a store of wealth, as a speculative investment and, ultimately, as a digital currency asset,” Kinney said.  Despite diamonds’ allure throughout history, the industry has struggled to attract investors largely because gem markets, which are spaced in different parts of the world, lack a uniform system for standardizing value.  The long, antiquated process of mining and transporting diamonds also presents an obstacle for investors looking for clarity and order. “With a diamond, the only way to move ownership in a consistently provable way across several different entities (the miner, the broker and the store) is to physically move the diamond between those entities,” said Patrick White, co-founder and CEO of digital asset finance platform Bitwave.  Transforming an industry  Kinney saw an opportunity to transform the diamond industry through blockchain technology with its built-in ability to record information securely and accurately. The former quantitative finance manager at several financial services firms and founder of six technology startups has focused much of his 27-year career developing platforms that improve the way organizations collect and analyze data, including heat maps and other technologies providing real-time information.  Diamond Standard, which is licensed in Bermuda to issue, sell and redeem tokens and digital assets, provides retail and institutional investors with a diamond-backed digital currency that has standardized value and liquidity. Physical coins, which the company stores in a vault, hold eight to nine standardized diamonds. The diamond-embedded tokens are digitized through an Ethereum-based digital coin, bitcarbon, which is tradable on different exchanges. Diamond Standard Admin Trust, a Delaware statutory trust entity within the Diamond Standard Group, has also established a peer-to-peer marketplace to trade its token directly.  More recently, Diamond Standard introduced a fund that already has more than $100 million in investments, Kinney said. The fund allows investors to invest in both digital assets and commodities without having to navigate regulations, he said. “We have a lot of clients who liked the [Diamond Standard] investment thesis and wanted to allocate [funds] to diamonds, but they couldn't buy the coins or bars, and they couldn't buy the token,” Kinney said. “So they buy the fund.”  Tokenized commodities  Tokenization of commodities has been popular among investors and traders during periods of high inflation by providing access to assets that are hedges against rising prices and volatile markets. A physical gold-backed token, PAX gold (PAXG), which has a market cap of nearly $600 million according to CoinMarketCap, is one example. But even agricultural commodities such as soy and corn are being tokenized to provide access to investors and farmers.  Read more: Santander Launches Loans Backed by Tokenized Commodities Such as Soy and Corn  Digitization of commodities also creates transparency and efficiency for investors, unlocking liquidity for the asset class. “By enforcing a more efficient financial system, tokenization effectively reduces market risk and enforces a greater level of security for data analysis and reporting,” said RA Wilson, chief technology officer of digital asset exchange for carbon credits 1GCX.  “It also creates new ways for derivatives to be traded, increases liquidity in order to tighten spreads (the difference between two prices), and creates real-time reporting mechanisms that will allow for greater transparency within the commodities markets,” he added.  Bitwave’s White said that digitized assets also address potential legal issues.  “Suddenly, changing the ownership of a diamond, in a way that has enormous amounts of documented evidence and will stand up in a legal setting, can happen entirely through simple on-chain transactions,” he said.“This fundamentally changes the nature of supply chains, where ownership can move disjunct from physical location, and vice versa.”  Could Diamond Standard’s set a new trend?  1GCX’s Wilson noted optimistically that tokenization’s vastly improved “transparency and market governance within the entire commodities industry” make it “the logical next step toward advancing and scaling our most important global markets.”  “It allows these markets to trade 24/7 rather than being limited to traditional trading hours, which will create even greater opportunity for growth within the space,"" he said.

Hetzner, a German-based cloud services firm, said in a Reddit post this week that its terms of service specifically bar crypto mining and also staking, the approach Ethereum is moving to soon to run the blockchain.  “Using our products for any application related to mining, even remotely related, is not permitted,” Hetzner wrote. “This includes Ethereum. It includes proof-of-stake and proof-of-work and related applications. It includes trading.”  Read more: Ethereum Proof-of-Work Forks: Gift or Grift?  If Ethereum is forced off Hetzner, it would further whittle down where it resides, raising the question of just how decentralized the purportedly decentralized blockchain really is. According to ethernodes.org, over 60% of Ethereum nodes – the computers that process transactions on the network – are hosted by cloud service providers. Of these cloud-hosted Ethereum nodes, Hetzner powers roughly 16%, second only to Amazon Web Services at around 53%.  Hetzner didn’t respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk by press time.  It is unclear how long the ban has been in place or whether the firm has ever taken action to enforce it. “We are aware that there are many Ethereum users currently at Hetzner, and we have been internally discussing how we can best address this issue,” Hetzner said in its post.  Hetzner referenced its Reddit post in response to a tweet from Maggie Love, founder of Web3 infrastructure platform W3bCloud. “Ethereum cannot be decentralized if the stack is not decentralized…” Love tweeted. “Where is the dialogue on this?”  The statement from Hetzner comes on the heels of recent U.S. Treasury Department sanctions on cryptocurrency addresses related to Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based utility that allows users to send and receive funds without leaving a clear trail.  The Tornado Cash situation sparked debate in the Ethereum community around whether nodes operating the network – or the infrastructure powering them – might be forced to censor transactions or otherwise curtail activity in accordance with the sanctions.

Ryan Fugger launched The Ripple Payment Network in 2004, which was taken over by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen who created the XRP Ledger as a payment settlement asset exchange and international remittance system in the line of SWIFT 2012. Ripple is run by Ripple Labs led by CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Cross-border money transfer was very time-consuming and costly through SWIFT. But Ripple made sending money intentionally fast and cheap.

42421461,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPfB,1661531636,AMC and Wall Street Are Learning All the Wrong Lessons From Crypto,"The similarities between stock speculation and gambling have always been obvious to the common man. In the late 19th and early 20th century, even those who didn’t have the cash or connections to actually buy stock could still frequent so-called bucket shops, which were kind of like off-track betting parlors but for wagering on stocks instead of horses. Patrons would take “positions” on stocks that paid off if the stock went the right direction, but without ever actually owning the underlying asset.  By the early 1920s, bucket shops were outlawed in the U.S., and the 1929 stock market crash scared away manic speculators for the better part of a century. But recent years have seen a belated resurgence in the use of financial markets for entertainment purposes. The difference is that now, instead of fraudulent bucket shops, the gambling is happening with real assets.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The pump was primed by the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, but it was crypto that truly reintroduced speculative mania to finance starting circa 2015 as hordes of speculators fell down the rabbit hole of obsessive day-trading on small-cap, largely useless blockchain tokens. That was enabled by the permissionless nature of blockchain assets and coincided with the rise of zero-fee trading and retail-oriented services like Robinhood (HOOD).  Then, in early 2021, the degen mentality found its way into regulated markets via WallStreetBets and the GameStop (GME) short squeeze. At the time, this was covered as a kind of David-vs.-Goliath uprising of retail traders against big hedge funds. As Spencer Jakab laid out in his recent book ”The Revolution That Wasn’t”, that narrative doesn’t really hold up – most hedgies made out just fine, and like most small-time day traders a lot of GME bagholders got crushed when the stock fell from its meme-y highs of around $80.  Incredibly, GameStop stock still trades at around $30, roughly 10 times its pre-WSB levels. That has helped GameStop get more access to cheap capital. In other words, the meme squad materially changed GameStop’s business outlook through little more than vibes.  Read more: GameStop’s NFT Marketplace Opening Week Sales Eclipse Coinbase Volume  Now, the management teams of large public companies are increasingly willing to play memey games if it means someone will hand them more cash. The poster child here is the theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC), which experienced a GameStop-style meme pump in early 2021 and has also managed to hang on to some of the resulting premium – though a lot less of it than GME over time.  This week, AMC decided to play directly into its meme-stock status by doing a weird and complicated form of stock split. AMC can’t technically issue more stock thanks to a cap written into its corporate charter, and current shareholders have already voted down attempts to raise that cap. Instead, they decided to become legends: Each share of normal AMC common stock this week received a share of new preferred stock, which behaves almost exactly like common stock but isn’t covered by the charter cap.  The preferred stock also trades under a different ticker symbol, which (of course) is APE.  That’s why AMC stock seems to be down dramatically this week if you just look at the AMC chart – those units went overnight from covering the value of the entire company to just covering half of it.  Issuing new stock under the ticker APE is about as close as a publicly traded company can get to saying out loud “please use our stock to run your decentralized Reddit pumps.” It’s a move that most public companies wouldn’t dare pull for risk of alienating institutional investors, if nothing else because the structure of the split is annoying and is creating real market confusion. And the branding is absolutely classless, because it effectively acknowledges that the stock doesn’t have much connection to company fundamentals like, say, profits.  (Also, as a financial journalist, this is a nightmare. When your equity effectively trades under two different tickers, a lot of reporters are going to get the numbers wrong. Count on it.)  But AMC doesn’t really care, probably because, for better or for worse, in-person theaters appear to be in secular decline thanks to the rise of at-home streaming of big new movies. In other words, this is no longer a business with exciting real-world prospects, so there’s no reason not to YOLO your reputation to cater to Redditors who think it’s funny to own a stock with the ticker $APE. (Remember when people still said YOLO?)  When the meme stock mania first surfaced, many finance observers wondered whether it would outlast the coronavirus pandemic, which also juiced crypto trading among bored people stuck at home for months on end. That’s still a somewhat open question, but if more companies see upside in actively courting retail day traders we could see “meme interest” remain a significant metric in formal equity markets.  Read more: The Meme Economy | Opinion  That's probably not great for the actual intended purpose of those markets: evaluating the economic performance of companies and allocating resources according to that performance. Not only does it further push stocks off fundamentals, it seems likely to juice volatility by making sentiment a bigger part of the mix.  That’s well worth remembering, whatever market you’re in. The stories of big swing-trade winners tend to dominate clickbaity finance headlines, overshadowing the reality that those winners’ exit liquidity also includes a lot of retail traders – and when those top-buyers get wiped out, they make the news far less often.  So if you think you’re smart enough to juggle financial knives, by all means have at it. But if you’d rather keep your sanity, remember that there’s a business behind the meme and it actually matters whether it’s turning a profit.

Equity markets slid with crypto, with the S&P 500 index down more than 2%.  “The stock market had not priced this in except the last couple of days and it’s because the risk was that they would be hawkish, not the belief,” Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank, told CoinDesk.  “[The market] is pricing it in now at least as much as it believes the Fed, but it's about Powell’s legacy and his credibility at this point,” he added. Iaccino further noted that markets had rallied ahead of the speech – perhaps anticipating more dovish remarks – thus likely exacerbating today’s decline.  From Powell’s address: “Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth … While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses.”  Read more: Markets Should Prepare for Persistent Inflation and Continued Rate Hikes  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin initially showed little reaction to Powell’s remarks, but has now turned sharply lower – to the current $20,700 from just shy of $22,000 ahead of the speech.

42421470,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPoT,1661529600,In Defense of Crypto Speculation,"I want to clarify something: Speculation is not a dirty word.  Along with many others, I’ve lately called on the crypto community to emphasize real-world use cases. The way out of crypto winter, we’ve argued, is to discard the “number go up” mindset that underpinned so much pre-winter market activity and focus instead on solutions that bring real benefits to humanity – such as renewable energy projects. The argument is that if inflows into decentralized finance (DeFi) are to be more sustainable then the yields that attract investors must be based on services that deliver more tangible economic value.  But after I spoke to a gathering of credit union executives hosted by financial services provider Allied Solutions this week, I feel compelled to qualify that position. One audience member asked me how he can fulfill the demands of his credit union’s younger members that it provide crypto trading opportunities “without simply encouraging pure speculation.”  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On the surface, it sounded like a concern directly aligned with my “real-world use case” point. If we could just stop the speculators, there might be a better story of growth and purpose for this industry, rather than the get-rich-quick values that tend to be associated with “crypto bros.”  But as important as it is to build real value, the question contained a misconception on the worth and purpose of speculation. It is vital to a market economy. It is fundamental to how we determine, as a society, which ideas, projects or businesses win or lose. We need it.  Picking winners and losers  When it comes to nascent technologies that, on the one hand, hold potential for mass disruption but, on the other, run up against an especially ingrained and politically entrenched incumbent system, the speculative process is both drawn out and highly volatile. We saw this in the early days of the internet, as the dot-com boom pushed prices for web-based companies to unsustainable levels but also laid the groundwork for the boom of the Web2 era.  In crypto, the speculative furor is even more intense because of the degree of potential disruption and because the barriers to achieving that disruption are so high that the cycles of hope and disappointment are more extreme. Those factors also draw the period of speculation out longer because they extend the process a technology goes through before reaching mass adoption and full potential.  Read more: Move Over, Ethereum – Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Has Apps, Too  Consider what bitcoin (BTC) aspires to be. It’s not a new type of car, like the Tesla, or a better payment app, like Venmo. It’s designed to overhaul a centuries-old system of money. That contains unfathomable prospects for change – and profit – as well as daunting challenges in the resistance to that change. It’s a recipe for speculation and for volatility in price.  When economists dismiss bitcoin’s viability as a store-of-value to rival gold (because of its volatility), they are holding it to a ridiculously narrow standard.  How long do you think it took gold to become established in human consciousness as the embodiment of permanent, lasting value? (Note: There is nothing innate about gold’s value, even though the metal has qualities that support its convenience as a store of value; this value was socially constructed over time – a very long time.) Bitcoin has the capacity to be a superior, digitally native version of the same depoliticized form of money, but to expect it to immediately embody that status in the minds of everyone is to condemn it to failure and to deny it the process of testing that it must go through to achieve it.  The juries are still out on which crypto projects survive to prove their value propositions – bitcoin’s as “digital gold,” for example, the Ethereum blockchain’s as “world computer” – and their members deserve a decent amount of time to adjudicate. In the meantime, investors are inevitably going to speculate on whether each attains its relevant status.  Read more: Ethereum’s Merge Will Increase Its Use Cases and Drive Its Investment Narrative  Regulation lesson  That means, in this nascent, relatively illiquid period, prices are going to continue to rise and fall with a much larger variance than established asset classes.  We should shift our perspective on speculation. Regulators and self-regulators who are keen to tame crypto’s “wild west” nature don’t need to kill speculation per se, but to stop charlatans from exploiting that speculative environment by peddling falsehoods and frauds to investors.

Read more: What Is the Ethereum Merge?  Though Coinbase and other crypto exchanges broadly support the energy-saving move, other stakeholders (particularly some of Ethereum’s miners) don’t.

Kevin Dede at H.C. Wainwright continues to rate Argo a buy, but lowered his price target to $8 from $14, and versus Thursday's closing price of $4.93. Meanwhile, Jonathan Peterson and Amanda Santillo at Jefferies cut their price target to $13 from $20, while also maintaining a buy rating.  Behind Argo's year-end 2023 hashrate guidance cut to 3.2 exahash per second (EH/s) from 5.0 are delays in the miner's plans to deploy custom-made mining rigs using Intel's (INTC) Blocksale application-specific integrated circuits. Speaking to investors in a conference call this week, Argo CEO Peter Wall said the delays were in part due to his company's decision to redesign the machines to maximize efficiency as opposed to computing power, or hashrate. Wainwright's Dede noted that supply chain issues have also delayed the Intel machines deployment.  While Argo expects to reach 4.1 EH/s by the end of the first quarter of next year, the Wainwright analyst pointed out that with a new product, ""manufacturing milestones are easily jeopardized,"" meaning more delays could be in the offing.  Both Dede and the Jefferies team took down revenue targets for Argo, with Dede now expecting full-year sales at $84.3 million versus $135.5 million previously, assuming bitcoin remains at around $24,000 and total network computing power of roughly 220 EH/s. Peterson and Santillo at Jefferies cut their revenue estimate by nearly 50% to $76.8 million from $145.6 million. Their base case scenario has bitcoin is around $21,400 and network hashrate around 220 EH/s for the rest of the year.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty: Everything You Need to Know  Argo also indicated that the reduced Intel order helps keep options open by lowering its capital expenditure, Jefferies wrote. The firm said it is looking to raise $25 million-$35 million to achieve 4.1 EH/s, down from a $50 million funding goal earlier this year.  Argo expects to sign a fixed-price power purchasing agreement in the next couple of months, which will both stabilize its electricity spending and allow it to sell power back to the grid, along with other peers, Wall said. The company continues to target a long term power rate of about $2.5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in Texas, where their biggest mine is.

The U.S. Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve (Fed), will hold an important event today, and the crypto market might see a bullish continuation. Related Reading: TA: Ethereum Loses Steam, Why 100 SMA Is The Key For More Gains At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $21,800 with a 1% profit in the last 24 hours and a 6% loss in the past 7 days. The cryptocurrency was rejected north of $22,000 and seems to be on track to re-test those levels of resistance. A spike in inflation has been one of the macroeconomic factors negatively impacting Bitcoin, the crypto market, and risk-on assets. The Fed has been trying to slow down inflation and might succeed which could allow them to ease their monetary policy. Inflation is measured by several metrics in the U.S., but the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) are two of the most important. The former hinted at a decrease in inflation at the start of August when it printed an 8.5% for July 2022.

However, the post-retest reversal in the daily chart projects the possibility of a bull run. So, will the retest reversal drive the Shiba Inu market price higher like last year&apos;s bull run? Key Points: The SHIB prices action displays a bullish reversal after retesting the $0.000013 zone. The 50 and 100-day SMAs gain bullish spread after the recent crossover.

42422502,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lUzh,1661521952,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin in Stasis Ahead of Powell Speech; Coinbase's cbETH Trades At Discount to Ether,"Price Point: Bitcoin and ether traded in familiar ranges as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic conference. Coinbase's wrapped ether staking token traded at a discount to ether's price.  Market Moves: Large traders, anticipating an ether volatility spike, are buying both bullish and bearish option contracts, setting up a so-called long strangle trade.  Chart of the Day: Potential double top on the dollar index.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin traded in familiar ranges with the U.S. stock futures slipped as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value wavered between $21,000 and $22,000. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, suffered a 4% drop to $1,620 before bouncing back to $1,700.  The S&P 500 futures declined by 0.2%, tracking moderate losses in the European stocks. The dollar index held steady around 108.30 as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield bounced three basis points to 3.07%, recovering part of Thursday's decline.  Perhaps investors lightened risky positions, bracing for hawkish or anti-inflation and pro-liquidity tightening comments from Powell. Observers told CoinDesk that the dollar might drop once Powell begins talking, allowing for a bounce in the risk assets.  ""Fed Chair Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole (10 a.m. ET) is much anticipated. Going into it, the Fed funds futures are pricing in about a 70% chance of a 75 [basis poing] hike next month,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, wrote in the daily market update. ""The market has a habit of hearing Powell dovishly and later corrects itself.""  Some analysts said Fed's balance sheet shrinkage is a bigger headwind to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, than what Powell says or does with interest rates.  ""Fed balance sheet rolling over in downward trend as concern grows about the ability to run it off (via quantitative tightening). This slope down is met with weaker crypto prices as our thesis predicts,"" Decentral Park Capital said in its Telegram-based research channel. ""We continue to see this as a fundamental headwind for crypto assets and risk markets in general.""  In other news, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Synthetix's founder proposed capping the supply of the platform's native SNX tokens to 300 million. The SNX token traded 8% higher.  Singapore-based troubled crypto exchange Zipmex appointed the Australia-based restructuring firm KordaMentha to assist with reorganizing the company and preserving assets.  Japan is considering a tax reform proposal to lure crypto startups to remain in the country. Per the proposal, crypto startups that issue their own tokens will be exempt from paying taxes on unrealized gains, starting  cbETH trades at discount  On Wednesday, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) unveiled its liquid token called wrapped ethereum staking, or cbETH, representing staked ETH plus all of its accrued interest.  At press time, the token traded at a discount of around 8% to the spot price, per data source CoinGecko. Lido's stETH token, the biggest staked ether token, has been trading at a discount to ether's spot price since the collapse of Terra's stablecoin UST in May.  Note that Coinbase's cbETH and Lido's stETH tokens representing staked ether are not supposed to trade 1:1 with ether.  Here is what observers said when asked about possible reasons for the discount in cbETH:  CK Cheung, an investment analyst at DeFiance Capital:  ""The discount reflects the opportunity cost of missing out on potential forked [proof-of-work] ETH tokens. Both ETH [September] and [December] futures are trading at a discount too.""  Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer at digital asset investment firm LedgerPrime:  ""The discount perhaps reflects concerns about staking through a centralized exchange. Also, there's less you can do with Coinbase cbETH than Lido's stETH onchain.""  Ian Unsworth, researcher at Binance.US, tweeted:  ""On-chain traders could be of the opinion that cbETH should trade at a discount given all the permissioned aspects of the contract.""

And ether (ETH) traders have been doing exactly that ahead of the impending upgrade, known as the Merge, of the cryptocurrency's parent blockchain, Ethereum.  Institutions seems to be adopting an options trading strategy called a long strangle, which is indifferent to the direction in which the cryptocurrency moves and instead aims to make a profit from the degree of price turbulence or volatility.  ""Block traders have also started betting on a volatility spike in ether,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said, drawing attention to large strangle trades that crossed the tape on dominant crypto options exchange Deribit in the past 24 hours.  A long strangle involves buying both call and put options with similar expiries. Buying a call – or the right to buy the underlying asset at a preset price – is akin to purchasing insurance against bullish moves by paying a premium upfront to whoever is selling the option. Buying a put – or the right to sell the asset at a predetermined price – is analogous to purchasing protection against price slides. Buying both protects against volatility.  The strategy makes money when the asset price swings enough in either direction to make the call or put more valuable than the total premium paid to purchase both options. The strategy bleeds money when the asset is little changed, reducing the demand for and prices of options.  Chart of the Day  Potential Double Top on The Dollar Index  Dollar Index might be forming a bearish double top on the weekly chart.  Weakness in the greenback tends to bode well for cryptocurrencies and vice versa.

VGX, the 150th largest crypto by market cap, surged over 135% to $0.64 at around 9:00 a.m. ET, down slightly from its session peak of $0.66, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Still, the token remains significantly below its all-time high of $6.90 in mid-February 2021, when the crypto space was at its heights. The huge intraday upswing comes as Voyager Digital (OTCPK:VYGVQ), which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the beginning of July due to liquidity issues spurred by a market downturn, was said to have attracted takeover interest from prominent crypto exchanges Binance and Sam Bankman-Fried&apos;s FTX.

42373981,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWYe1,1661516614,Large Ether Traders Position for Volatility Spike as Merge Draws Near,"Taking unhedged or hedged directional bets on an asset's price is seen by some as the most exciting trading strategy in financial markets. And ether (ETH) traders have been doing exactly that ahead of the impending upgrade, known as the Merge, of the cryptocurrency's parent blockchain, Ethereum.  Institutions seems to be adopting an options trading strategy called a long strangle, which is indifferent to the direction in which the cryptocurrency moves and instead aims to make a profit from the degree of price turbulence or volatility.  ""Block traders have also started betting on a volatility spike in ether,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said, drawing attention to large strangle trades that crossed the tape on dominant crypto options exchange Deribit in the past 24 hours.  Read more: Institutional Investors Are Increasingly Using Crypto Options Trading to Hedge Their Bets in Bear Market  A long strangle involves buying both call and put options with similar expiries. Buying a call – or the right to buy the underlying asset at a preset price – is akin to purchasing insurance against bullish moves by paying a premium upfront to whoever is selling the option. Buying a put – or the right to sell the asset at a predetermined price – is analogous to purchasing protection against price slides. Buying both protects against volatility.  The strategy makes money when the asset price swings enough in either direction to make the call or put more valuable than the total premium paid to purchase both options. The strategy bleeds money when the asset is little changed, reducing the demand for and prices of options.  According to Ardern, the latest block – or large – trades signal increased interest in long ether strangles, pointing to confidence among sophisticated traders that volatility is set to explode.  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Merge?  The increased interest in volatility trading also points to market maturity and an influx of sophisticated traders into the industry. Block trades are large trades made by institutions that are generally broken into smaller orders and executed through different brokers or over the counter to ensure minimal impact on prices.  ""They are willing to pay relatively higher costs to obtain possible high returns,"" Ardern said.  Block traders have set up strangles in options with Sept. 9, Sept. 30 and Oct. 28 expiries. Options expiring on Sept. 30 and Oct. 28 will capture both pre- and post-Merge market activity.  The first one in the table has the trader long 4,000 contracts at $3,000 strike call and long 4,000 contracts at $800 strike put, both expiring on Oct. 28.  The strategy will make money if ether settles well beyond the $800-$3,000 range on Oct. 28, making the call or put more valuable than the initial per contract cost of $62.98. That figure is reached by adding the premium paid for one call option contract, $40.52 and one put option contract, $22.46. The total premium paid for buying the 4,000 call and put contracts is $251,920. The calculation is based on figures mentioned in the above chart.  The entire premium paid will be lost if ether settles inside that range on Oct. 28, assuming the buyer holds the position until the settlement date. However, traders often liquidate positions before the expiry, depending on market conditions.  For example, suppose that before or immediately after the Merge there is a volatility explosion that's big enough to make either call or put more valuable than the total cost. In that case, the trader can liquidate positions and pocket the difference. If the Merge turns out to be a non-event, option prices will slide and the trader can cut back on losses by immediately squaring off the long strangle.  Read more: CME Group Adds to Crypto Offerings With Ether Options  It's quite clear, volatility trading is complicated even though it looks easier than directional trading at first. It requires active management of positions and deep know-how of the so-called greeks – delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho – factors that affect options prices.

42373983,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWYfH,1661515833,Wife of Arrested Tornado Cash Developer Denies Russia Secret Service Links,"The wife of Alexey Pertsev, the web developer arrested in Amsterdam over ties to the Tornado Cash crypto mixing protocol, dismissed speculation her husband had links to the Russian secret service after allegations surfaced of his connection to a cybersecurity company blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury Department.  Xenia Malik denied claims suggested in a Thursday blog by financial-crime analysts Kharon that the developer was involved in espionage because he worked for the company, which the U.S. government had linked with the Russian secret service, the FSB.  Pertsev's arrest on Aug. 10, just days after the U.S. agency sanctioned Tornado Cash, has caused consternation among the coder community, which worries they may be held liable for any open-source software they develop. Pertsev was arrested on the orders of the Netherlands’ FIOD, the authority responsible for financial crime.  Read more: Tornado Cash Developer's Arrest in the Netherlands Draws Community Protest  “Alexey has never been associated with the FSB of the Russian Federation and similar organizations,” Malik told CoinDesk Friday. “We moved to the Netherlands in the hope of a quiet, stable and free life, which is unimaginable in military Russia.”  On Wednesday, judges ordered Pertsev to be held in jail for a further three months pending a trial, following FIOD allegations that he had facilitated money laundering through Tornado Cash. No formal charges have yet been levied.  In a statement published Friday, the Dutch public prosecutor referred to a ""suspicion that the accused, along with others, allowed the origin, destination and ownership of more than 1 billion [euros ($1 billion)] worth of criminally obtained cryptocurrencies to be disguised” using Tornado Cash. Malik has denied those claims.  On Aug. 8, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) linked the protocol, which can be used to ensure the privacy of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, to significant money laundering and North Korean hackers.  Online sources reviewed by CoinDesk appear to confirm that Pertsev previously worked for a company called Digital Security, which offers services such as penetration testing, a kind of security audit for checking how robust are a system's cyber defenses. The firm, also known as DSec, is said by Kharon to have been sanctioned in November 2018 by OFAC, which cited links between the company and Russian spies.  A January 2018 article on Russian business news site Vedomosti quotes Pertsev commenting on North Korean crypto scams, while a video of a presentation Pertsev apparently gave while working for Digital Security shows him standing next to a slide displaying the company logo and his official contact information.

42373982,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWYaF,1661515477,DeFi Platform Synthetix's Founder Proposes Capping Token Supply at 300M; Here’s Why,"The founder of the popular decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Synthetix has proposed capping the supply of its native SNX tokens to a fixed 300 million as the protocol gains revenue from newer products.  Kain Warwick, founder at Synthetix, explained in a governance proposal on Friday that the initial rationale for keeping an ever-inflationary supply for SNX had passed as the protocol was now earning “meaningful” yields from its atomic swap and perpetual products.  “Inflation was intended to bootstrap the network. It has done this extremely effectively,” Warwick said. “The fact that we are only a few weeks away from the very memeable 300 million mark is cause enough to make this change now.”  DeFi stands for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without traditional middlemen.  Synthetix, an Ethereum-based exchange and synthetic assets platform, is one of the first DeFi applications. It specializes in minting and creating synthetic tokens and recently introduced an atomic swaps product, which lead to its daily trading volumes increasing to over $200 million shortly after launch.  The atomic swaps offering has contributed to generating over $158,000 in weekly fees on the platform, data shows. A part of these fees is distributed to users.  The synthetic assets are created by users staking collateral using SNX and minting a synthetic asset against it, earning rewards on the volume of SNX they stake on Synthetix for its bespoke products or other liquidity pools.  But the continuous creation and issuance of SNX to users of the platform created selling pressure, Warwick pointed out.  “On one hand inflation redistributes ownership of the network to those who stake, but it simultaneously decreases the dollar-denominated fee yield (paid in sUSD) per SNX over time. The problem with this is that it creates constant downward pressure on the price of the SNX token,” he added.  Such selling pressure is despite SNX rewards being locked for a year before getting released to users – as holders could short, or bet against, SNX prices using SNX-tracked futures on crypto exchanges.

Should you hop onto this breakout possibility? After a remarkable downfall last week, THETA prices regain bullish momentum close to the psychological mark of $1.0. Additionally, the recovery rally challenges the 100-day SMA bringing a breakout entry opportunity for sideline buyers. So, should you consider betting on the bullish breakout? Key Points: The THETA price trend shows a bullish recovery of 10% over the last seven days. The 50 and 100-day SMAs maintain a bearish alignment to keep the bullish growth in check. With a market cap of $5.08 billion, the intraday trading volume of Theta Network has increased by 77% to reach $1.39 billion. Source - Tradingview THETA Technical Analysis The THETA prices fall by 28% in the previous two weeks, dropping close to the psychological mark of $1.0. However, buyers avoid a drop to the crucial support with a Morning Star pattern and restart a bullish recovery rally. The recovery rally regains 10% of market value within the last seven days and approaches the $1.30 mark. But, the higher price rejection near the 50 and 100-day SMA projects the possibility of a bearish turnaround. If the selling persists at $1.3 resistance, the sellers will likely revert the prices 9% lower and offset this week&apos;s relief rally.

Japan's financial services agency (FSA) and the ministry of economy, trade and industry are considering a tax reform proposal for 2023 that could exempt crypto startups that issue their own tokens from paying taxes on unrealized gains.  Under the current system, startups that issue their own tokens must pay taxes on unrealized gains for the tokens they might be holding on to because the company's holdings are taxed based on the market value at the end of the taxation period, according to Yomiuri.  The potential tax reduction is aimed at encouraging startups to remain in Japan. CoinDesk reported in December 2021 that heavy tax burdens may be causing crypto firms to quit the country altogether.  Japanese lawmaker Taira Masaaki appeared to confirm the tax review on Twitter.  Earlier this month, two crypto lobby groups in the country, the Japan Crypto-Asset Business Association (JBCA) and the Japan Crypto-Asset Exchange Association (JVCEA), asked the government to consider lowering crypto taxes, including a proposal for a 20% capital gains tax for retail investors.  Currently, investors in Japan are taxed up to 55% on capital gains.

In an affidavit delivered Aug. 19 in person in Bangkok, Zhu said the liquidator ""had not provided an entirely complete or accurate version of events"" to the court, according to Bloomberg. The Singapore court this week granted permission for Teneo to probe the local assets of Three Arrows Capital, a decision that means it legally recognizes the liquidation order originally filed in the British Virgin Islands.  Three Arrows Capital incurred around $400 million in liquidations in mid-June following the sharp downturn in the crypto markets, leaving it unable to meet its obligations to creditors.  Zhu described the complex network of Three Arrows entities registered in different jurisdictions including Singapore, the British Virgin Islands and the U.S. state of Delaware. As a result of the diffuse structure, the Singapore-based entity – Three Arrows Capital Pte Ltd (TACPL) – may not be able to comply completely with the liquidators' demands, according to Zhu.  ""Su Zhu’s affidavit was made in support of an application by Three Arrows Capital’s former investment manager seeking to set aside orders made by the Singapore court requiring relevant parties in Singapore to cooperate with the liquidators in the sharing of information relating to the affairs and assets of Three Arrows Capital,"" Teneo said in response.

The software that runs Tornado Cash was developed by a Delaware-registered company called PepperSec, and Pertsev is listed as that company&apos;s founder and CEO in the Kharon report. Treasury Department Imposed Sanctions On Tornado Cash On August 8, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Tornado Cash, claiming that hacker organizations, including the Lazarus Group from North Korea, had utilized the business to launder billions of dollars. Two days later, on suspicion of &apos;involvement in hiding unlawful financial flows and enabling money laundering,&apos; the Dutch government detained Pertsev, a resident of the Netherlands. The U.S. government&apos;s targeting of an open-source software project provoked outrage from the global crypto community in response to the action. The international community, however, supported Pertsev and declared that the American government had unfairly singled out an open-source software creator.

Sarath Ratanavadi, CEO of power company Gulf Energy Development, told Bloomberg in a Wednesday interview that his company plans to invest more in the crypto industry to create additional sources for earnings. Blockchain technology platforms and cryptocurrencies will be “key drivers for the company’s strongest returns” as the overall market remains sound and has “high potential” for growth, he said.  Ratanavadi will be following a path blazed by businesses elsewhere in the world that have, in the past few years, increasingly turned to crypto to bolster revenues. Firms taking the plunge include business software maker MicroStrategy – which has invested billions of dollars in bitcoin – electric-car maker Tesla, technology conglomerate Block and Chinese photo application firm Meitu.  Still, those bets have largely soured amid a market-wide decline: MicroStategy (MSTR) reported nearly $1 billion in losses on its holdings, Meitu lost over $52 million, and Tesla (TSLA) sold over $930 million in bitcoin earlier this year citing “uncertainty of the COVID-19 lockdowns in China.""  The decision comes as Thailand’s retail trader market is dwindling. Data from the country's Securities and Exchange Commission cited by Bloomberg showed the number of active trading accounts fell to 260,000 in July from 692,000 in January, coinciding with a fall in crypto prices. Bitcoin (BTC) is now 69% lower than its record high, with ether (ETH) and other major cryptocurrencies such as solana (SOL) registering declines of as much as 86%, CoinGecko data shows.

USDN is backed by the waves token (WAVES) and leverages the staking model of the Waves protocol’s underlying consensus algorithm.  Waves' token is trading 3.86% lower over the past 24-hours, according to CoinGecko.  Concerns over the algorithm have previously been raised by the company's founder Sasha Ivanov.  ""We have to work on the algorithm,” Ivanov said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program in June. “And what happens now is kind of inevitable, which is just a test of the whole system.”  Algorithmic stablecoins have been in the spotlight this year following the collapse of terraUSD (UST) and the LUNA ecosystem, which saw $83 billion in market cap evaporate in May.  Analysts told CoinDesk that USDN's backing was realized through WAVES and was currently about 14% backed, which created ""almost the same scenario as with UST.""  ""Just a week ago, their team made it possible to improve the mechanics of USDN reserve recapitalization through the SURF token purchase, depending on the backing ratio: the lower the ratio, the lower the token’s price,"" Iakov Levin, CEO of crypto yield platform Midas, explained in a message to CoinDesk.  Levin said that even though all purchases made with this token add to USDN backing, the move created a model similar to UST by relying on a secondary token to support the stablecoins' peg by providing liquidity. The upcoming Ethereum Merge was further cited as a reason for falling liquidity.  ""Everyone is busy preparing for the Ethereum Merge upgrade,"" he said, so ""the liquidity drops naturally. No one is keen on supporting the peg of another algorithmic stablecoin. This model potentially leads to dire consequences and extreme fragility of the peg,"" Levin added.

If Dogecoin price continues to consolidate it might fall below its closest line of support.

Ever since broad market weakness stepped in, many altcoins have fallen on their respective charts.

Over the past week, the coin depreciated 7.6%. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin price barely noted any movement. This indicated that the coin was trading within a consolidated price range. The bulls are trying to re-enter the market but selling strength continues to increase. The coin however has managed to keep the price above the $21,000 support level. The technical outlook for Bitcoin has turned mixed, meaning there could be signs of reversal over the next trading session. For a price reversal to successfully take place, buyers have to return to the market. BTC needs to soar past its immediate price ceiling of $22,000, else, a move to $20,000 will be incoming shortly.

There could be a tough resistance at the $22,000 mark, once broken past that, Bitcoin price might be able to get back on a bullish track. Local support for the coin was at $21,000.

42373978,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWYRR,1661475600,"Compound's Upgraded DeFi Lending Platform Targets Security, Scalability","Compound has launched a new version of its decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, Compound v3. The limited production release reduces the number of supported tokens that can be borrowed and collateralized on the protocol, according to a Thursday blog post from the protocol’s founder.  Compound’s latest iteration, called Comet, allows users to borrow a single, interest-earning asset, USD coin (USDC), using wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) as well as the native tokens of Chainlink (LINK), Uniswap (UNI) and Compound (COMP) as collateral. Compound version 3 also employs Chainlink as the protocol’s exclusive price feed and simplifies governance smart contracts, which will enhance the system’s security and scalability. The limited release protocol is capped at $100 million in assets, or about 2% of the $3.8 billion of assets held by Compound v2.  Compound founder Robert Leshner says Compound v3 allows users to borrow more tokens with less risk of liquidation and lower liquidation penalties.  “The architecture of [Compound v2] was too risky in that one bad asset can theoretically drain the entire protocol,” Leshner told CoinDesk. “[In Compound v3], even if one asset plummets to zero, there's no risk to users in the protocol of other assets.”  Compound’s previous iterations employed a pooled-risk model, which supported nine cryptocurrencies, including ether (ETH), dai (DAI) and tether (USDT). Under the old model, users would deposit assets into lending pools, where their assets would earn interest. In exchange for their deposits, lenders received cTokens, which represented the value of their deposits. Using those cTokens, the lender could then borrow up to a certain percentage of the value of their collateralized assets in a different cryptocurrency.  Read more: Crypto Money Market Compound Lets You HODL and Earn  Forking the protocol  In addition to reducing the platform’s number of supported tokens, Compound v3 is also cracking down on unauthorized forks.  Forking a protocol basically amounts to cloning its code over to a new project. Forks typically make adjustments to a protocol’s original code, but some low-effort Compound forks have been wholesale copies of the platform with little changed beyond branding.  In Compound’s latest iteration, forking the protocol requires community permissions. The approval process aims to ensure the code behind each proposed fork is less susceptible to exploits.  Compound has grown to become one of the most-forked blockchain protocols, but the ease with which less sophisticated developers can clone older versions of the protocol has led to problems. For example, a specific “re-entrancy” bug in some of Compound’s old code was exploited in several Compound forks that never got around to fixing it – leading to over $100 million in combined losses.  These attacks were just a few among a string of exploits that have debilitated the DeFi space, where code exploits resulting in multi-million dollar losses have become increasingly common. According to a Chainanalysis study, almost 97% of all cryptocurrency stolen in the first three months of 2022 — up from 72% in 2021 — was plundered from DeFi protocols.  Read more: $22M Drained From Compound Contract That Was Hit for $80M Last Week  Governance changes  In addition to upping the protocol’s security, Compound v3 will introduce changes to the protocol’s governance system. In Compound v3, governance is conducted through a single “Configurator” contract, instead of a network of contracts that are individually managed.  “The code base is a lot simpler, and everything's contained in a single smart contract for each deployment,” said Leshner. “That makes it very easy to govern and manage, which we think will make governance participation increase.”  Governance token holders will now also have the ability to exercise greater control over economic policy across the protocol thanks to the protocol’s use of ChainLink for price oracles. By employing ChainLink instead of relying on a custom price feed for price oracles, supply and borrow models can be decoupled and operate independently, granting the community more control over operations across the system.",POSITIVE,COMP | LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | LINK | TRADING | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/26/compounds-upgraded-defi-lending-platform-targets-security-scalability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b185a688bc9f7c3ac8b4a44d0ddd37d0677fc51f-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin and Ether Remain in Their Recent Holding Patterns  By James Rubin  A day before Jerome Powell's long-awaiting address at the Federal Reserve's conclave in Wyoming, bitcoin idled in roughly the same place it has held for much of the week – comfortably above $21,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at about $21,500, roughly flat over the past 24 hours as nervous investors continued their vigil for the U.S. central bank chair's comments Friday that might hint at the Fed's next interest rate hike. Several central bank governors talked to media outlets but offered few clues on whether the bank will continue its current hawkishness by approving another 75 basis point hike (which would likely send asset markets – crypto and traditional – spiraling) or ratchet back the rate to a more moderately aggressive 50 points.  ""People are going to be looking for some sort of dovish tilt and if we don't get it, it could be kind of ugly,"" said Matthew Tuttle, CEO and chief investment officer of exchange-traded fund provider Total Capital Management.  Ether continued its recent pattern of outperforming bitcoin. The second-largest crypto in market capitalization was recently trading just below $1,700, up more than a percentage point over the same period. Other major altcoins were mixed, with popular meme coin SHIB and CVC each recently rising more than 6% but EOS and KNC off over 2% and 1%, respectively.  Still, cryptocurrencies related to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the metaverse have underperformed over the past week, a result of sagging sentiment about the NFT market. The Flow network’s FLOW token, which can be used to build NFTs and decentralized applications (dapps), slumped 20% during the past seven days. FLOW’s decline was the second largest during that period among 52 cryptocurrencies with a market cap over $1 billion, according to crypto data and analysis firm Messari.  Other NFT and metaverse-related tokens that have sunk include AXS, GALA, MANA and GMT, which all fell between 14% and 20%.  Equities  Equity indexes closed higher after the U.S. Commerce Department released data showing that the economy contracted at a lower rate in the second quarter than preliminary estimates indicated. The tech-focused Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all climbed at least one percent. Investors were also buoyed by a slight decline in jobless claims underscoring the continued resilience of the economy. Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya called the most recent indicators ""the perfect appetizer for Friday’s hawkish Fed Chair Powell speech.""  Moya added that ""there is still a chance that this unbalanced economy will get a soft landing and that should prevent stocks from seeing severe downward pressure.""  In crypto industry news, Voyager Digital, the lender whose collapse into bankruptcy worsened this year’s crypto market crisis, is attracting takeover interest from some of the biggest players in the space including exchanges Binance and FTX, according to people familiar with the matter.  And Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX Ventures denied a Bloomberg report Thursday that the venture capital arm of FTX and the VC operations of sister company Alameda Research would be merging.  Total Capital's Tuttle warily noted that bitcoin's price remains ""below all the major moving averages.""  ""It looks like a bear flag,"" he said. ""We're seeing ""some support around that 20,800 level. If the market doesn't hear what it wants to hear on Friday, that's where crypto heads. If the market hears what it wants to hear, we're moving back up.""

Now, miners may have found a different way to offset some of their losses – selling power back to the grid.  Crypto miners consume tremendous amounts of energy to mine their digital assets, and power cost is the main variable to their profit margins. With the price of bitcoin down more than 50% this year and power costs rising, their margins have shrunk significantly.  However, some miners are now actually getting paid to shut down operations and release electricity capacity back to the grid during peak demand periods, while lowering their power cost.  “The ability for some mining companies to either generate power to sell to the grid or perform demand-response gives them an additional profitability option,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating office of the full-stack bitcoin (BTC) mining software and services provider Luxor Tech.  Riot and Mawson  Most recently, one of the largest bitcoin miners, Riot Blockchain (RIOT), said it earned an estimated $9.5 million in power credits by shuttering its mining operations in Texas during an extreme heat wave. The miner said it lowered its power cost significantly using this strategy.  Another bitcoin miner, Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI), said it generated $1.8 million in unaudited revenue by engaging in similar types of strategy as Riot. “When energy prices are low, Mawson engages in bitcoin mining and generates revenue by selling self-mined bitcoin daily, as it has from inception,” the miner said in a statement. “When energy prices are high, and where available, Mawson engages in Energy Demand Response Programs, receiving revenue and reducing overall energy costs,” it added.  One caveat to this strategy is that a miner must have a fixed-price purchasing power agreement, rather than buying electricity in the spot market. For example, Argo Blockchain (ARBK) said that unlike Riot, it wasn’t able to participate in demand response in Texas as it has been paying spot market prices, which have been higher in recent months.  However, miners who can take advantage of this strategy during summer's heat, could benefit significantly even as the bear market continues. “In the current environment mining economics have fallen, while energy prices have soared, making it an opportune time for these miners to sell power to the grid. In many cases miners can make over double per kWh by selling power rather than mining,” Luxor’s Vera said.
