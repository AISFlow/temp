42426332,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPnh,1428527144,Payments VP: One Thing Stands Between Bitcoin and Mass Adoption,"“Everyone thinks bitcoin is the currency of criminals.”  According to Alasdair Rambaud, senior vice president for payment solutions provider CardinalCommerce and a self-proclaimed bitcoin user, this is the only factor prohibiting bitcoin from mass adoption.  Rambaud believes that “most large merchants” in the US are currently looking into accepting bitcoin as payment, and that the reasons go far deeper than the publicity that can be gained.  Rambaud told CoinDesk:  “I don’t see any other barriers to mass adoption of this aside from the image. It’s easy to use, super transparent and you don’t have to take any risk as a merchant.”  The two-year CardinalCommerce veteran explains that this strong value proposition was what encouraged his company to partner with bitcoin processor Bitnet on 25th March. The deal enables any CardinalCommerce merchant to add a bitcoin payment option through its existing integration with its OneConnection service.  While positioning Cardinal at the forefront of alternative payment trends, however, the move followed what Rambaud described as 24 months of merchant demand for the offering.  “We started an inquiry and started asking other merchants. The feedback was definitely positive. They said it’s definitely something that was interesting,” Rambaud continued.  Competing today  Though enthusiasm within the bitcoin business community may be waning for e-commerce as a pressing use case of the technology, Rambaud offered a different take.  In particular, he framed bitcoin as a compelling international e-commerce option, one that would allow larger merchants to increase overall business.  “Merchants, especially internationally, if they have an order coming from Nigeria with a credit card, they’re probably not going to accept it,” Rambaud explained. “But with bitcoin, there can be a different strategy, because it’s a guaranteed payment.”  Rambaud further stressed that large merchants have an incentive to reduce the high fees they currently pay to accept payment, suggesting that any solution that attacks this pain point is likely to spark interest.  “Merchants are looking at how they can lower their cost for accepting payment and they’re seeing bitcoin as a way to lower that cost,” he added.  'Revolutionary' payment  Despite the number of alternative payments that have emerged in recent years, Rambaud said that bitcoin is pulling away from the pack by helping merchants avoid credit card fees and removing the need for currency conversion.  “If you look at Google Wallet, MasterPass, all the new ones are sort of the same and they don’t change the cost for the merchant,” Rambaud said. “All of those alternative payments don’t change the business model.”  Rambaud suggested that the ease of use promised by the products hasn’t proven enough to overcome the similarity of these payment methods to more traditional options.  Further, he explained that one of the key reasons he uses bitcoin is due to the high credit card fees he used to pay on his frequent travels to Europe from the US.  “I’m a French and US citizen, so I’m constantly using euros and dollars,” Rambaud said. “I found that using traditional methods of payment, these fees were pretty well hidden but fortunately I have a finance background so I was able to locate all of them and was not too happy with what I saw.”  Today Rambaud has two bitcoin wallets – one connected to a US bank account, the other to a bank account in Europe.  Merchant involvement  Key to lowering these overall costs, however, will be that merchants incentivize bitcoin use through discounts, something that Bitnet partner Rakuten recently did upon its bitcoin launch.  These discounts, Rambaud said, are likely to be an effective way to create what he called a “win-win” situation for merchants and consumers, even those who may currently believe the credit card rewards points are the most compelling offers.  “You have point junkies, but if you have a 2% transaction fee and you’re only getting 100 points, and someone else is saying we’ll give you 2% off for using bitcoin, I think you have a real value proposition. Your 2% that you’re going to give them is better than the reward they would get,” Rimbaud said.  Of course, promoting this activity as the best course of action for bitcoin merchants will be something left to Cardinal’s new partner, Bitnet.  “Now that we have a partner in Bitnet, they can explain the value proposition. We can engage the interest and they can come in with case studies around other merchants they have,” he added.  However, for now, Rimbaud suggested that the bitcoin industry should have one overall goal in mind, concluding:  ”Anybody who’s working with bitcoin needs to work on the image of bitcoin.”  Image via LinkedIn; John Copland / Shutterstock.com",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/08/payments-vp-one-thing-stands-between-bitcoin-and-mass-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7bbe120f762e2fe822007b90583f24a066805e4-1239x498.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426323,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPdh,1428514523,Adam Draper: New York's BitLicense Will Hurt Startup Incubators,"Boost VC CEO Adam Draper has launched a petition seeking a number of changes to New York’s proposed BitLicense framework.  The petition  calls for New York regulators to limit the amount of information they gather on virtual currency startups to what is mandated by federal standards; that the BitLicense avoid using duplicative language already enshrined in federal law; and that regulators give their approval for what Draper calls a “sandbox of innovation in the financial markets”.  In a video accompanying the petition, Draper stated that the changes are needed to reduce startup costs for digital currency businesses. He estimated an initial cost of $2m for a company seeking a BitLicense, with $1m per year in additional costs.  Draper told CoinDesk that these expenses include the costs of hiring compliance officers, meeting reporting standards, collecting necessary information, AML/KYC expenditures and associated legal costs.  He went on to state that the BitLicense would make it difficult for accelerators like Boost, which provider early funding to potential innovators, to support nascent startups in the digital currency space, explaining:  “The BitLicense frame work will definitely impair bitcoin startups from starting, which would impact my business negatively. My business is to drive innovation in technology, and over-regulation stops technology. It will not hurt the companies who have been well funded, or large funds, it will hurt the early staged startups.”  More changes needed  According to Draper, the revised BitLicense marks an improvement over the initial draft but still leaves digital currency startups at a significant cost disadvantage. His comments echo those of Union Square Ventures principal Fred Wilson and others who have commented on the reworked proposal.  “When I read the second draft, although much more thought through than the first, I felt that it would still be too expensive for startups to get through,” he said.  He characterized the proposed changes as good for both sides, adding: “I think it balances the regulatory framework with what entrepreneurs need to thrive.”  Further, Draper conceded that he had missed the end of the second comment period but still wanted to contribute to the process of developing the regulation. In part, he said, the petition aims to bring others into the conversation who might have otherwise missed the opportunity to do so.  On-ramp for innovation  Draper told CoinDesk that regulatory breathing room for startups would allow for the potential creation of new, innovative financial products, but said that the presence of onerous regulations makes it difficult for such work to take place.  “As of now, regulations strike fear into innovators rather than assist them in producing better products. Regulation should be about protecting the end consumer, but we are getting to '1984' level watching over shoulders,” he explained.  Describing the sandbox idea as a win-win for regulators, Draper suggested that startups working elsewhere in the US financial landscape would benefit from similar accommodations.  “It would be great if a bank could start and attempt to operate as a bank with 10 to 20 accounts, before they file to become a bank, which costs $25m,” said Draper. “Or a brokerage to operate as a broker with a smaller amount of volume and users.”  The petition comes shortly after the close of a 30-day comment period for the New York Department of Financial Services’ (NYDFS) proposal to regulate digital currency businesses in the state.  The agency released its revised BitLicense proposal in February.

The company, which offers a number of developer tools, says it is seeking apps that will find new use cases for bitcoin and make it ""more approachable"".  Prizes range from $10,000 (1st place) to $500 (5th place) in bitcoin at the time the awards are delivered.  Judging the submissions will be investors Adam Draper, Chris Dixon, and Fred Wilson, alongside Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation.  Developers that make it into the judge's top five will have a chance to compete for a place in Silicon Valley bitcoin accelerator Boost VC, run by Draper, which includes $50,000-worth of support, mentoring and accommodation.  Over 112 entries were received for last year's event, with a geotagging app named CoinPlanter – which allows users to ‘dig’ or ‘plant’ bitcoin – scooping the $10,000 grand prize.    Coinbase previously stipulated that entrants should use its API. However, this time round developers are free to choose between Coinbase and other APIs like VC-backed Chain, Gem and Boost VC alumni BlockCypher.

42426321,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPZh,1428507076,Canadian Bitcoin Exchange Cavirtex to Reopen Following Coinsetter Acquisition,"Top Canadian bitcoin exchange Cavirtex is expected to resume trading following its acquisition by New York platform Coinsetter.  The news comes after Cavirtex announced it was planning to shut down operations in March following a breach that compromised security information including password hashes the previous month.  Jaron Lukasiewicz  , now CEO of both Coinsetter and Cavirtex, said measures had been taken to remove the possibility of an event like this happening again. He added:  ""No customers have been financially affected by a compromise ... We feel strongly about our ability to protect customer funds and will keep minimal funds in hot wallets.""  Coinsetter's acquisition, which was completed through a negotiated agreement with Cavirtex's voting shareholders, will see both exchanges operate under their own names but share technology and capital, alongside banking access.  The CEO said he intended to bring members of the old Cavirtex team into the new exchange, though it is unclear exactly how many will remain.  Lukasiewicz concluded:  ""I’m excited to place a core focus on Canadian customers and believe Cavirtex provides important infrastructure to be successful in this market. We are the only bitcoin exchange with an approved domestic bank account in Canada, and we will be integrating Coinsetter’s trading technology to provide an unmatchable bitcoin exchange for Canadians.""  Former Cavirtex account holders will be able to use their existing login credentials to access their accounts. ""We ask all users who set passwords and 2FA devices prior to February to reset those items,"" noted Lukasiewicz.  Coinsetter  's acquisition comes two months after it raised a second round of funding, boosting its total to $1.9 million.  Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Cavirtex had resumed trading following its acquisition. The exchange will resume trading sometime in the next day, though an exact time has not been disclosed.

42378126,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MD5D,1428494130,Igot Takes on Coinbase With Bitcoin Merchant Payment Launch,"Australian exchange Igot is aiming to rival bitcoin payment giants Coinbase and BitPay with the launch of its own international merchant solution.  Igot's platform will enable e-commerce and brick-and-mortar merchants to integrate bitcoin payments in almost 40 countries and transact in 10 different fiat currencies.  Rick Day, Igot's founder, said:  ""Accepting bitcoin through Igot has multiple advantages for merchants. Perhaps most importantly, bitcoin is a free marketing tool that is likely to increase overall revenue. This is a win-win situation for merchants and the bitcoin community.""  Igot is incentivising merchants to join its payment platform with a one-off $500 bonus after reaching $25,000-worth of bitcoin payments in the first 90 days.  During a CoinDesk survey last year, 54 of 100 merchants said that bitcoin accounted for 0–2% of their monthly sales. Just how many smaller merchants will be able to reach this $25,000 mark is unclear, given reports of dipping sales and slow bitcoin transaction growth overall.  Day remains confident, however:  ""We believe our package presents a strong incentive for merchants to integrate with Igot. With a flat 0.5% transaction fee, we expect to get a lot of traction.""  Market Strategy  Day revealed that Igot's marketing strategy will mainly target e-commerce merchants, non-profit organisations and subscription businesses.  The founder also noted Igot's ""strong presence"" in Australia, India and the UAE, adding ""we [Igot] expect to become one of the biggest players in these markets"".  In February, Igot also announced the expansion of its exchange and remittance services to Kenya, following the acquisition of cryptocurrency exchange TagPesa and the integration with M-Pesa's mobile payments system.  Increasing competition  Despite having the widest coverage, with its service available in ""almost 40"" countries, Igot is entering an increasingly competitive merchant payments arena.  BitPay  , which currently claims to have over 50,000 merchants accepting bitcoin on its platform, recently signed a referral partnership with Heartland Payment Systems, the fifth largest payment processor in the United States in a bid to capture additional customers.  The processor allows merchants to convert bitcoin into 9 fiat currencies and, unlike Igot, does not charge small merchants for bitcoin or fiat withdrawals.  San Francisco-based Coinbase has been vocal about its European expansion plans. At the end of last year, the firm opened its services to residents of 18 European countries, including bitcoin hotspots like the Netherlands, France and Sweden.  It currently serves 29 countries worldwide and charges a 1% fee after merchants exceed $1,000,000 in bitcoin payments.  Additionally, February saw the launch of ChainPay, a bootstrapped startup in the Isle of Man that hopes to compete with the VC-funded payment solutions by offering lower withdrawal limits and high customer engagement.
