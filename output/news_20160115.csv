42378532,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXhl,1452898743,Bitcoin Price Falls 15% Amid Network 'Failure' Claims,"The price of bitcoin declined sharply in global markets today, falling by 15%, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Dollar-denominated markets hit a low of $372.73. BPI data shows that the declines began on Tuesday, accelerating as the week progressed.  At press time, USD markets are reporting an average price of$371.45.  The declines came amid a frenzied media response to the much-discussed exit of BitcoinJ developer Mike Hearn from the bitcoin project in which 30 media outlets seized on his claims the still-operating network had 'failed'.  Today also saw claims from embattled digital currency exchange Cryptsy that it has been insolvent since 2014 after a hack resulted in the theft of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin, adding to a negative media outlook.  Chinese markets fell as well, though not as precipitously, declining by 11%, according to the CoinDesk CNY BPI to hit a low of ¥2,532.73.  At press time, CNY markets are reporting an average price of ¥2,511.7.

42378516,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXMN,1452895639,Former ATM Maker Robocoin Ends Bitcoin Services,"Romit, the remittance service that began as bitcoin ATM developer Robocoin, has said that it is shutting down its bitcoin services.  The company told customers today that it was suspending its bitcoin-related services and encouraged customers to begin withdrawing their funds. Romit, which offers a wallet service aimed at global remittance payments, plans to formally end its bitcoin services on 15th February, according to text messages sent to users.  When reached for comment, Romit provided CoinDesk with an email announcing the move, stating:  ""We are discontinuing bitcoin services from our product offering. Please withdraw your bitcoin immediately by logging into your wallet.""  The email said that withdrawals ""may take some time"" due to elevated website traffic.  The service suspension comes months after Romit shifted away from a bitcoin ATM hardware business model to software and remittances. Romit’s website suggests that the company is moving toward traditional payments, offering card storage services for mobile payments users.  As Robocoin, the firm was one of the first entrants in the bitcoin ATM space, a position that eroded amid criticism from operators about hardware and software issues, as well as allegations that refunds were being purposefully withheld. The controversy ultimately prompted some Robocoin operators to shift to other hardware and software providers.  Romit did not immediately respond to queries regarding the motivation behind the service shutdown or why the move is taking place at this time.

42378523,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXXh,1452885496,Bitcoin Branded a Failure as Media Erupts Over Mike Hearn Exit,"Long-time bitcoin enthusiast and developer Mike Hearn officially “left” the open-source project this week, making clear a previously quiet departure by slamming the door in the form of an impassioned if highly contentious open letter to the community.  The former Google employee, whose contributions to the open-source transaction network include the widely used library BitcoinJ, and crowdfunding application Lighthouse, went so far as to proclaim the bitcoin project had “failed”, a narrative that was seized by global press.  At press time, Hearn’s exit had been profiled by news outlets as diverse and far-reaching as The New York Times, The Guardian, Fusion, PC World and Fortune, all of which emphasized his declaration that the project should be considered dead despite its position as the longest-running blockchain and digital currency with the highest market capitalization.  Adding fuel to the fire were damning comments that sought to paint Blockstream co-founder and bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell as a villain in the ongoing debate over whether the open-source project should be scaled to accommodate more users or prioritize its emphasis on decentralization.  Hearn wrote:  ""Why has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked ‘systemically important institutions’ and ‘too big to fail’ has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people.""  Perhaps most damning were statements that aimed to paint the network as ""on the brink of technical collapse"" and no better than ""the existing financial system"".  But, while publicizing an important technical debate, the media’s emphasis on using Hearn’s post as a primary reference did much to color the conversation in terms of his highly unique categorization of the drama.  Of the aforementioned reports, only the Times included comments from members of the development community outside of Hearn, a move that further ensured that his viewpoint on a complex issue was given the majority of the spotlight.  Passionate response  Reactions to the flood of media attention were particularly barbed, though much of the ire focused on Hearn and the way in which he chose to highlight his departure from the industry.  Some of Hearn’s worst critics at the moment point to the fact that the event felt like a veiled publicity stunt for his latest project R3CEV, the consortium that has so far signed up more than 40 major banks that describes itself as “part investor, part market facilitator and part product developer in the cryptocurrency and blockchain marketplace”.  Lending evidence to the idea is the fact that the release of Hearn’s post coincided with the publication of a profile in The New York Times that appeared largely sympathetic to the developer’s version of the events and debates ongoing in the community.  Across major media outlets, outside of the Times, there was little mention that Hearn is now employed by R3, and that the market strategy of his new employer is largely a response to the idea that the bitcoin network is ill-suited to the needs of major banks.  Perhaps the most pointed responses came from bitcoin developers, with consultant Peter Todd going so far as to question Hearn’s technical understanding of his criticisms of the bitcoin network, calling him a ""blatant liar"".  The criticism was echoed by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen. The developer, who has recently begun speaking at bitcoin industry events but is not a member of any project, questioned Hearn’s technical prowess, while calling his post “whiny”.    @SwiftOnSecurity @nytimes That was one whiny ragequit. He's epically wrong on almost all technical points.        — Bram Cohen (@bramcohen) January 14, 2016      Mike Komaransky, of the normally quiet bitcoin firm Cumberland Mining, was compelled to issue a response, suggesting consensus on key matters highlighted by Hearn would be easier without his presence in the community.    Bitcoin Hearn Paradox- With him, consensus is hard to reach, btc suffers. w/o him, consensus is easy to reach, bitcoin prospers.he can't win      — Mike Komaransky (@mkomaransky) January 14, 2016          Speculation that the event was a media stunt has persisted into Friday, with popular posts on the subreddit r/Bitcoin attesting evidence to the minority view.  ""The timing of the New York Times article, this policy panel, Mike Hearn's Medium blog post, fits all too well,"" one user wrote.  Popper’s piece  Of all the articles, perhaps the one given the most scrutiny was penned by Times reporter and “Digital Gold” author Nathaniel Popper.  Though a target for criticism by community members like Cody Wilson, Popper’s piece is perhaps one of the more balanced that emerged.  Despite flourishes, including a softly lit image, that are sympathetic to Hearn, the piece includes the most exposition on the block size debate, elaborating on Maxwell’s own difficulties as a leading figure in the bitcoin community and detailing former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen’s thoughts on the debate.  The report did give odd impressions using language that suggests, despite a global development community, the open-source project is only backed by “a handful of developers”, and interestingly did not include any commentary from members of Bitcoin Core or Blockstream, groups that have argued for approaches that stand in contrast to Hearn’s views on the project's future.  Popper largely stayed away from Hearn’s technical analysis of the bitcoin protocol and mining network, as well as his selected quotes that aimed to portray still-anonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto as in favor of scaling the network for competition with more traditional payment networks like Visa.  In statements, bitcoin developer Eric Lombrozo said that evidence could be equally found that Nakamoto believed having multiple implementations of the bitcoin software would present challenges for developers given the network’s reliance on Consensus.  Still, he suggested the article perhaps did not do enough to portray the project as one that was responding to concerns, albeit slower than observers may want.  “Bitcoin Core has been working on this issue a lot…and we now have a way of deploying bigger blocks in a way that is backwards compatible and is practical and safe and can be rolled out soon,” Lombrozo told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This will hopefully reduce hostilities in the future and allow for more implementations to enter the space peacefully.""  Continued impact  To many observers, coverage of the story also had a measurable impact on the price of bitcoin, which, as profiled by Newsweek, sank by as much as $50 before recovering in the wake of the news.  At press time, many smaller news outlets had seized on the story, with as many as 30 news outlets covering the blog post or its impact on the price.  As a sign of the story’s impact Financial Times reporter Izabella Kaminska issued her take, painting Hearn’s departure as evidence that a ""rare voice of reason"" had left the community.  Kaminska used the event to discuss her views on how bitcoin remains a system that will be unable to solve problems for the financial industry, or offer much outside of evidence of how social theory and economics can yield academically interesting results.  On Twitter, more tenured bitcoin community members offered a sympathetic take on Hearn’s post and its resulting publicity, seeking to highlight the project’s continued perseverance in the face of declarations that it will not succeed.    Best way to respond to all the drama in bitcoin is to focus. Buckle down, work, don't get distracted. Engineering solves problems. Code On!        — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) January 15, 2016      Still others thanked him for his work on the project and were amicable about what will surely be recorded as the community’s most high-profile and contentious departure to date.

42378533,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXgV,1452879334,British Isle Alderney Sponsors Distributed Ledger Project,"The island of Alderney, a self-governing British Crown Dependency, has sponsored an experimental open-source timestamping service based on distributed ledger technology.  Created by the Z/Yen Group, the MetroGnomo project uses the startup's mutual distributed ledger (MDL) tech to provide a service that facilitates commerce by providing 'proof of existence' for data.  The company cites use cases for MetroGnomo that include the dating of contracts; proving authorship of books, images and music; authenticating closed-circuit TV footage; and facilitating information exchange between organisations.  Marc Morris, a researcher at Z/Yen told CoinDesk that MetroGnomo can be employed for ""any application"" in which a third-party proof that a given piece of information was in existence is needed.  For example, Morris said content creators could prove ownership using the platform:  ""In the same way that scientists have previously concealed their theorems in anagrams, an author can use MetroGnomo to prove that he had access to the book’s content at a given time whilst concealing the content itself. To achieve this, the user simply timestamps the hash of the book using his registration, which is linked to his email address.""  He cited security guards timestamping site checks and care workers proving a patient has been visited as examples of how it could be implemented.  Bob McDowall  , chairman of the finance committee of the States of Alderney, told CoinDesk that the island is seeking to establish itself as a centre for standards setting and accreditation in the blockchain technology sectors.  Regarding its involvement with MetroGnomo, he explained that Alderney is lending its name to the project, adding that the self-governing island embarked on the initiative as a way to showcase how it is has created an environment open to innovation.  CoinDesk asked Morris about the legitimacy of using an MDL timestamp for legal purposes, say, as evidence in court.  ""At the moment we don’t know,"" he said. ""We are discussing with lawyers how this might be admissible. We expect it is likely to be, but first we have to experiment with a variety of applications to ensure robustness.""  Uniting blockchains  MetroGnomo also provides a mechanism for coordinating other distributed ledgers and blockchains, such as bitcoin, Ethereum or Ripple, which normally act as separate networks.  ""MetroGnomo provides the global inter-ledger time ticks we need to enable multitudes of ledgers to work together smoothly,"" Z/Yen Executive Chairman Professor Michael Mainelli said.  Morris explained that MetroGnomo timestamps provide the 'MetroTime' (the time the timestamp was issued) and unique universal identifiers (UUIDs). The MetroTime is guaranteed to be unique, so it can also act as an identifier.  ""In a world where there are multitudes of MDLs in existence, MetroGnomo’s third-party validated time and unique identifiers can provide trusted connections between entries on different ledgers,"" he explained.  Following registration, users are able to generate a timestamp for their file – composed of the MetroTime, a UUID and an optional description and file hash. Users can choose whether to make the item publicly available (to a maximum size of 10MB), with the file being saved in MetroGnomo’s publicly accessible central storage.  The firm notes that care should be taken with uploading files, as every timestamp is entered onto MetroGnomo’s transparent and immutable ledger – that is to say, it cannot be removed at a later point.  Should the original creator of the file wish to prove its provenance or date, they can point others to the record, using either the MetroTime, the UUID, the file hash, or the file itself.  CoinDesk tested MetroGnomo, which after a quick sign-up process, allowed us to register a JPEG file on the MDL.  We found the process to be relatively simple and produced a search return based on the UUID within seconds of creating the timestamp (see image below):  Strength in numbers  Rather than distributed miners, MetroGnomo is supported by a network of independently operated receivers. Morris explained that, by becoming a receiver, or node on the network, cooperating organisations are able to hold a copy of the ledger.  ""This allows them to not only to add their own hashing information, but to retrieve this information at a later point independently – for example, if they are worried about the service ceasing,"" he said.  The firm further explained that higher node numbers are important for the network, saying: ""As with all mutual distributed ledgers, the addition of new nodes to the community incrementally increases robustness – making the ledger yet more persistent and pervasive.""  Even though the MetroGnomo MDL is similar in some aspects to other types of blockchains, Z/Yen has worked to produce ""the most 'stripped down' MDL system possible"" and that it has key differences from, say, bitcoin's blockchain.  Z/Yen indicated that MetroGnomo's experimental stage will be deemed a success if it demonstrates that it can can deliver something useful and work well with other distributed ledgers.  ""Because it is so stripped-down, it is also very inexpensive for Z/Yen and Alderney to run almost indefinitely,"" said Morris, concluding:  ""If other participants decide, over time, to provide transmitters and receivers, MetroGnomo may run forever in a mode analogous to bitcoin but without the large-scale costs.""

42378521,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXTv,1452835789,"Cryptsy Threatens Bankruptcy, Claims Millions Lost in Bitcoin Heist","UPDATE 2 (15th January 19:32 BST): The website for Cryptsy has been taken offline.      Embattled digital currency exchange Cryptsy is now claiming that it is insolvent.  The exchange alleges in a newly released blog post that it was the target of a hack in July 2014, an incident that it said cost it approximately 13,000 BTC ($7.5m at the time) and approximately 300,000 LTC (then $2.08m).  Unless the funds are recovered or a buyer is able to cover the losses, the post continued, the site will be shut down and bankruptcy declared.  The acknowledgement of insolvency and the hack claims come after months of customer withdrawal delays, comparisons to the now-defunct Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, and the filing of a class action lawsuit against the exchange.  Cryptsy said that it has outstanding liabilities of approximately 10,000 BTC, or roughly $4.15m at press time. The site, which previously said that it would suspend trading and withdrawals indefinitely, has been taken offline as of press time.  Cryptsy said that did not disclose these losses at the time and continued operating, meeting its funding obligations with trade income.  The post reads:  ""This of course was a critical event for Cryptsy, however at the time the website was earning more than it was spending and we still have some reserves of those cryptocurrencies on hand. The decision was made to pull from our profits to fill these wallets back up over time, thus attempting to avert complete closure of the website at that time.""  Further claims pointed to the developer of an altcoin called Lucky7Coin as the person behind the attacks.  Mixed messages  Prior to today's post, Cryptsy had claimed technical problems as the source for the withdrawal problems, but the new revelations point to an extended period of insolvency. Cryptsy now says that its ability to make payouts from exchange profits deteriorated amid declining trading volumes.  Cryptsy suspended trading last week and again this week, the latter incident allegedly tied to a phishing attack that targeted customer email addresses and phone numbers. Yesterday, two Florida law firms filed suit in federal court on behalf of affected customers.  The exchange said that it did not report the incident because it ""didn’t want to cause panic"", and claimed that recent efforts to contact the authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), were not immediately successful.  The post also claimed that the company had a prior relationship with former Secret Service Agent Shaun Bridges tied to ""an unrelated matter"". Bridges was sentenced to five years and eleven months in federal prison in December following his conviction on obstruction of justice and money laundering charges.  Cryptsy also blamed an article published on 4th October that reported that an investigation by US authorities was underway. In response, CEO Paul Vernon called the article ""libelous"" and denied any existence of an investigation at the time.  ""It wasn’t until an article from Coin Fire came out that contained many false accusations that things began to crumble. The article basically caused a bank-run, and since we only had so much in reserves for those currencies problems began,"" the new post states.  Former Coin Fire editor Mike Johnson has said that he has been the target of death threats since the blog post was published.  CoinDesk will continue to follow this developing story.
