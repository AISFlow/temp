42414746,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBJfon,1670974121,Bankman-Fried Lawsuits Expose FTX's 'Special Treatment' of Alameda Research,"Court filings against alleged crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried are shedding more light on the cozy relationship that burned down his empire: the one between crypto exchange FTX and its sister hedge fund Alameda Research.  “There was no meaningful distinction between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s own,” the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged Tuesday. Alameda is said to have improperly siphoned $8 billion from customers of the now-bankrupt FTX.  In its own suit, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Alameda enjoyed special access to FTX’s trading backend. It could execute trades faster than other customers and was exempt from auto-liquidation, both “unfair advantages,” the suit said. And it could borrow as much money as it liked.  Alameda Research was the giant crypto hedge fund and market making firm that Sam Bankman-Fried launched in 2017, well before FTX. It started as a bitcoin arbitrage trader but quickly grew into one of the industry's most influential names, both for its perceived trading prowess and its billions of dollars in capital. Alameda's stature rose in tandem with FTX's; Bankman-Fried ran both until October 2021, when he declared he was leaving the fund.  Publicly, the firms claimed to be two different companies that operated ""at an arm's length,"" Alameda's former CEO Caroline Ellison has previously said. But in reality Bankman-Fried ran FTX and Alameda in lockstep, the suits allege. And Alameda was playing with FTX customers' funds.  Bankman-Fried, who owns 90% of Alameda, was arrested in the Bahamas Monday and faces criminal money laundering, conspiracy and fraud charges in the U.S. His stunning fall from CEO at the top of the crypto industry to international defendant took just over one month.  In that time, the 30-year-old former billionaire had embarked on an aggressive apology tour to cast his role in FTX’s implosion as stupid and reckless but hardly criminal. At times he jumped around questions that probed Alameda’s relationship with FTX and has repeatedly denied knowing of any back doors.  Hardcoded loopholes  The new suits take direct aim at Bankman-Fried’s assertions. He “directed” FTX to let Alameda do things its other customers could not, such as fall below margin requirements on risky bets and execute trades when its accounts were empty, the suits allege. They went on to say these loopholes were baked into FTX’s code at Bankman-Fried’s direction.  When institutional customers like Alameda placed trades on FTX they used an API, which is by design more streamlined – and thus faster – than the website retail traders use. But Alameda’s access was faster still. According to the CFTC, it “was able to bypass certain portions” of the FTX API to move “several milliseconds faster” than other big spenders.  Part of Alameda’s speed boost was due to its other special privileges. Because it didn’t need to have enough money to place trades, it wholly sidestepped the automatic balance check that other accounts had to clear. This gave Alameda “another significant speed advantage.”  Once, when Alameda maxed out its borrowing limit on FTX, Bankman-Fried told staffers to set a ceiling so high it would never be reached, the CFTC alleged. Alameda could theoretically withdraw tens of billions of dollars from FTX.  Alameda’s infinite money glitch led to the hedge fund repaying “billions of dollars of loans” using customer deposits, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. It unsealed criminal charges against Sam Bankman-Fried Tuesday after the former FTX CEO’s arrest in the Bahamas.  Bankman-Fried tried to hide the relationship between his “personal piggy bank” and FTX by routing money to seemingly unaffiliated bank accounts that Alameda controlled, according to the SEC. FTX used the unassuming account name “fiat@ftx.com” to track its sister company’s multi-billion-dollar debts without raising eyebrows. And Alameda never told third parties that its “loan” was from FTX.  Even when FTX tried to untangle its liabilities in 2022 it gave special treatment to Alameda. Bankman-Fried stopped the exchange’s accounting systems from charging interest on the hedge fund’s $8 billion liability (it had done so automatically, per the SEC).  'We can’t really shut it down.'  Bankman-Fried “drafted and shared a document that questioned whether Alameda should be permanently shut down” in September 2022, months before it imploded, according to the CFTC.  His reasoning: Alameda was taking on more risk than it was worth.  “I think it might be time for Alameda Research to shut down. Honestly, it was probably time to do that a year ago,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a document titled “We came, we saw, we researched.”  At the same time, Bankman-Fried acknowledged that Alameda played such a large role in FTX’s operations that it might be impossible to pull the plug. As FTX's primary market maker, ensured trades went smoothly for all FTX customers, not just itself. Disappearing Alameda would create a shortfall in liquidity that might undermine FTX's value as an exchange.  “Given the amount that Alameda is doing, we can’t really shut it down,” he wrote, according to the CFTC.  The fall  The SEC and CFTC chart Nov. 2 as the day Alameda and FTX began to unravel. On that day, the regulators said CoinDesk published an article that probed Alameda’s extensive FTT token holdings. FTT is a token issued by FTX, and Alameda had billions of dollars of FTT and other FTX-linked tokens on its balance sheet.  “On November 6, 2022, in response to this article, the CEO of [rival exchange] Binance tweeted that, “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came (sic) to light,” he would be selling the remainder of his significant FTT holdings, which he acquired during the buyout from FTX seed investment,” the CFTC said, referring to CEO Changpeng Zhao.  Binance’s call-to-liquidate tanked the price of FTT and triggered a run on deposits at FTX. One day later, it became clear to the exchange that it didn’t have enough cash to cover for customers, the CFTC said.  At the same time, Alameda traders were directed to “sell everything that could be sold” in a mad dash to “generally do anything possible to quickly obtain billions of dollars in capital to send to FTX,” the CFTC said, noting Bankman-Fried played a key role in that effort.  Bankman-Fried also planned to use Alameda’s fire sale to fill a hole at FTX US, which was also getting pummeled by withdrawals. Executives there had found “a shortfall they did not understand and were unable to quantify,” per the CFTC. (During his apology tour Bankman-Fried insisted that the U.S. exchange was never insolvent.)  “On November 8, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda traders to prioritize meeting FTX US capital requirements and to send excess capital to FTX US. On information and belief, Alameda sent in excess of $185 million to FTX US to fill its shortfall,” the CFTC said.  It was just one more criss-cross in the sprawling, unspoken ties between Alameda and all aspects of the FTX empire.",NEGATIVE,FTT,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH | FTT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/13/bankman-fried-lawsuits-expose-ftxs-special-treatment-of-alameda-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bdc8f331aac2a1f7745bb6758078c1c840d956b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank’s research note comes at a time when the entirety of the crypto market is facing adversity and the price of bitcoin is down more than 70% from its all-time high price at current levels. According to Goldman Sachs, gold actually presents the opportunity that investors seem to be looking for in bitcoin. Gold Is A Better Inflation Hedge In the research note, Goldman Sachs says it expects gold to perform better than bitcoin in the long run given its already established use cases. For one, gold remains a hedge against inflation and dollar debasement, as well as being a better portfolio diversifier compared to bitcoin. Related Reading: Why The GBTC Discount Could Lead To A Bitcoin Sell-Off Additionally, Goldman Sachs explained that gold is not as affected by tighter liquidity as BTC. Since there is more demand for gold, it tends to do better in situations such as these whereas digital assets such as bitcoin tend to succumb to such liquidity crunches. The research note also compares bitcoin to a “risk-on high-growth tech company stock.” As well as the digital asset’s value is based on future use cases instead of established use cases like in the case of gold. It explained that since bitcoin is “a solution looking for a problem,” it is more prone to volatility and is a more speculative asset compared to gold. BTC trending at $17,400 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Can Bitcoin Close The Gap? Bitcoin is often referred to as the ‘digital gold’ due to its performance over the years. It has been utilized as an inflation hedge by many at various stages, but the bull and bear cycles can see BTC fall short as a hedge during times such as these. Add in the collapse of major players in the space and the digital asset has taken massive hits in the past year.

Goldman Sachs points to the recent implosion of the FTX crypto exchange in bitcoin’s recent high volatility, noting such collapses as the cause of the decline. “Bitcoin’s volatility to the downside was also enhanced by systemic concerns as several large players filed for bankruptcy,” the research note said. Given these, the investment bank believes that gold is set to outperform bitcoin in the long run. “Moreover, gold may benefit from structurally higher macro volatility and a need to diversify equity exposure,” it added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | TRADING | RESEARCH | BTG,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-goldman-sachs-expects-this-asset-class-to-outperform-bitcoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/5550386.jpeg

Earlier, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors and customers . Still, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) saw some solid upside momentum, climbing 3.4% to $17.75K at 5:03 p.m. ET, after the highly-anticipated November CPI report showed that headline and core consumer prices moderated more than expected. Those cooler than expected inflation prints potentially paves the way for a less aggressive interest-rate increase at the Fed's meeting on Wednesday. It's relatively unusual to see MARA slide and BTC rise, or vice versa, given their strong historical relationship . The Quant system flagged MARA at high risk of performing badly in mid-November due to inferior profitability and decelerating momentum. SA contributor Leo Imasuen also sees MARA as a Sell , as the company's ""debt burden presents a long-term headwind to a balance sheet now under siege by what looks set to be structural unprofitability for most of 2023.""

42414739,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBJfOG,1670968616,FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Denied Bail in the Bahamas,"NASSAU, The Bahamas – FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried will be remanded into custody after a Bahamas judge ruled he should be denied bail on Tuesday.  Magistrate Judge Joyann Ferguson-Pratt ordered that there be an extradition hearing next year, on Feb. 8, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. ET. Bankman-Fried's attorneys initally asked the judge to consider that he be released on a $250,000 bail, arguing he needed to be able to regularly take medication, including Zyrtec, an over-the-counter allergy medication, and keep to his vegan diet. Earlier in the day, police escorted Bankman-Fried's parents to his home in Albany in the Bahamas to pick up Adderall, another medication.  Bankman-Fried testified on Tuesday that he uses Emsam patches for depression, as well as 10 mg of Adderall every four hours.  Prosecutors in the Bahamas argued that granting Bankman-Fried bail would go against a treaty with the U.S., which required defendants to be held in custody pending extradition proceedings. Bankman-Fried told the judge he would not waive his right to fight the extradition effort, suggesting he may seek to remain in the Bahamas.  Read more: Inside Sam Bankman-Fried's First Bahamas Court Hearing After His Arrest  Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday evening after prosecutors in the U.S. alerted the Royal Bahamas Police Force of a sealed indictment. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed the indictment earlier on Tuesday, announcing that officials were charging the former FTX CEO with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and campaign violation allegations, among others.  ""One month ago FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, collapsed, destroying billions of dollars in customer value, and for every day of the past month, the dedicated prosecutors of this office and our partners [in the] FBI, [Securities and Exchange Commission] and [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] have been working around the clock to figure out what happened and to begin the process of seeking justice,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. ""This morning, we unsealed an eight-count indictment charging Samuel Bankman-Fried, FTX's founder, with a series of interrelated fraud schemes that contributed to FTX's collapse.""  A grand jury in the U.S. indicted Bankman-Fried last Friday and an arrest warrant was executed Monday, Williams said.  In addition to the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC and CFTC sued Bankman-Fried Tuesday on various securities and commodities fraud charges.  Government officials in the Bahamas are pursuing their own civil and criminal investigations into Bankman-Fried and FTX.  Flight risk  His lawyer, Jerome Roberts, argued that Bankman-Fried was not a flight risk, citing his ownership of real estate in the Bahamas, as well as the fact that he had been in possession of his passport for at least three weeks before his arrest on Monday, and could have left the country at any time (Roberts told the court on Tuesday that ""when it became clear that local police had no interest in Mr. Bankman-Fried, they released his passport to me""). Roberts also added that electronic monitoring and other methods could be used to keep him in the country, and that if he tried to take a flight or boat out of the country, police could be there in ""minutes"" to arrest him.  Judge Ferguson-Pratt pushed back, telling Roberts that a determined individual could find a way to flee the country.  ""If you sat where I sit, with the number of bail violations that come before me, you would understand [my concerns],"" she said.  Roberts asked her if Bankman-Fried was not traveling via ""air or by sea"" how he could leave the country.  Ferguson-Pratt smiled coyly: ""I do not wish to put that into the public domain.""  The judge asked Roberts what he thought an appropriate figure for cash bail would be.  ""You have opened the door and I don't see why I shouldn't walk in,"" she said. ""When you say cash bail, what number comes to your mind?""  ""I hope Mr. Bankman-Fried doesn't crucify me for saying this,"" Roberts said. ""But given the circumstances, perhaps $250,000? But your honor doesn't have to agree with me. If $50,000 is a good figure, then $50,000 is a good figure.""  Bankman-Fried's parents began talking audibly and smiling widely at the mention of $50,000 bail.  But prosecutors pushed back, and reminded the judge that Bankman-Fried's Bahamian real estate wasn't a sufficient tie to the country because, if found guilty of the crimes he has been accused of, the property could potentially be clawed back to repay investors. They also reminded the judge that Bankman-Fried has ""extensive ties"" to foreign countries and cities, including Hong Kong, China, where he initially set up Alameda Research, and had told at least one witness that he was ""ready to relocate"" to a country in the Middle East.  Bail denied  Judge Ferguson-Pratt ultimately decided to deny Bankman-Fried's bail application, telling the court that she did not believe that Bankman-Fried's apartment or the prospect of forfeiting a cash bond would keep him from fleeing.  ""It's a subjective test, and it depends on how much one is willing to lose,"" Ferguson-Pratt said.  ""I am of the view that the risk of flight is so great that Mr. Bankman-Fried ought to be remanded to custody,"" she said.  Bankman-Fried, sitting alone in the first row of benches, slumped over at the news and held his head in his hands.  Until his extradition hearing on Feb. 8, Bankman-Fried will be held at the Bahamas' notorious Fox Hill prison, where conditions are known to be dangerous and cramped. Locals told CoinDesk that the prison is overcrowded, with as many as six people to a cell, and often has issues with potable water.

42407229,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJs9F,1670968041,Why Hong Kong Is Pushing for Its Own Central Bank Digital Currency,"With Hong Kong likely to issue its electronic Hong Kong Dollar (e-HKD), this month, U.S. policymakers need to anticipate what a successful issuance of Hong Kong’s digital fiat means for the existing global financial order. An examination of why Hong Kong may want its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), its fintech development strategy and its diminishing political openness leaves plenty of room for U.S. national security concerns.  The e-HKD is Hong Kong’s bid amid a Cambrian explosion of central bank digital currency projects around the globe. Hong Kong started exploring a CBDC in 2017. U.S. policymakers may applaud the HKMA’s care in designing its CBDC. The e-HKD’s Bank for International Settlements (BIS) paper discussing different CBDC issuance models is thoughtful, covering the design trade-offs between operational division of labor and data security. If the “safety, privacy and flexibility” principles of the pilot actually manifest in the e-HKD, it would be wonderful news to U.S. policymakers. However, it is important to consider why Hong Kong wants to issue the e-HKD in the first place.  Emily Jin is a research assistant at the Center for a New American Security. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.  Typical drivers for issuing digital central bank money, such as enhanced financial inclusion and reduced credit risk, seem good on paper, but are not convincing when considered in Hong Kong’s financial context. Since the under-banked population is negligible in Hong Kong, financial inclusion alone is not a compelling rationale to promote the e-HKD (and even the HKMA policy paper agrees). The second motivation of mitigating credit risk during financial instability has more mileage. Introducing CBDC like the e-HKD to the public means they can hold central bank money in electronic form. Because the e-HKD is the liability of the central bank it is not tied to the failure of commercial entities, which then reduces credit risk. Granted, Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center is on shaky ground given mainland China’s firm grasp on Hong Kong’s political liberty and democratic governance. Nevertheless, there does not seem to be a systemic credit event on the horizon that would warrant issuing a CBDC as a preemptive response.  I believe Hong Kong’s real motivation for issuing its own CBDC is it wants to determine how tomorrow’s alternative financial pipelines are built. There are potential network effects as more central banks adopt CBDCs. Academics have argued that a multi-CBDC future would likely be decentralized. In contrast to the current global financial network, which is centralized around the U.S. dollar and U.S. financial leadership, the future CBDC network might have many central banks, or “nodes,” connecting to each other via CBDC-to-CBDC platforms. In a CBDC future, many central banks could ostensibly tip the financial power imbalance away from the U.S. and other developed economies by adopting CBDCs early and influencing CBDC standards. It is to no one’s surprise that a financial hub like Hong Kong would not want to miss out on this CBDC “Sputnik moment.” In October Eddie Yue, the chief executive of the HKMA, remarked that “more is more” when it comes to adopting new platforms for payments and cultivating network effects.  HKMA is one of the first monetary authorities to test out CBDC-to-CBDC interoperability. The mBridge project, the most extensive cross-central bank effort to date to test out a blockchain-based CBDC-to-CBDC platform, bloomed out of a collaborative project between the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand in 2019. The project then morphed into Project mBridge in 2021, with the addition of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the BIS Innovation Hub in Hong Kong. A multi-CBDC platform would naturally entail CBDCs from other jurisdictions to participate. The mBridge allows banks to move wholesale CBDCs across borders, as long as flows are verified by each of the participating central banks’ mBridge ledger (mBL). While the HKMA and other central banks are preoccupied in testing potential future financial pipes, central banks from the developed economies such as the United States and Europe are notably absent from this effort.  This brings us to the geopolitical elephant in the room.  As a financial hub that previously thrived under democratic processes, Hong Kong today looms in the shadow of mainland China. The HKMA released a Fintech 2025 vision document, outlining five ambitious goals spanning financial technology innovation, labor force supply, regulatory environment, data infrastructure and developing cross-border capabilities. There is no smoking gun evidence that the PBOC had any direct influence over the HKMA’s fintech development trajectories. Nevertheless, the HKMA’s goals strive to digitize and leverage the productivity of Hong Kong’s economy, which resonate with the two fintech development plans out of the mainland in the last few years. The Fintech 2025 plan’s goal of “creating next-gen data infrastructure” mirrors similar sections in the PRC’s 2022-2025 Fintech Development Plan. Though the HKMA claims these data infrastructures will be distributed ledger technology-based, it is unclear whether and exactly how the central authority would build in sufficient data security and privacy safeguards.  Though Hong Kong is rolling out its broader e-HKD pilot imminently, it is unclear when the e-HKD will be fully implemented. But lack of an official delivery date should not justify inaction. The instructive takeaway from Hong Kong and other financial hubs’ move to explore CBDCs (such as Singapore’s Project Orchid) should be that the U.S. government needs to monitor collaborative CBDC efforts. In addition to monitoring, the U.S. Federal Reserve should be present at these significant efforts in building alternative pipelines. This does not necessarily mean the United States must develop its own CBDC, but it certainly puts a premium on U.S. participation in standard setting activities. On top of proactive engagement from the U.S. government, government agencies such as the Department of Commerce should set up information-sharing processes with private sector participants in Hong Kong, which may include financial institutions and private-sector firms that may be required to transact in e-HKD. For example, financial institutions that operate under correspondent banking models are likely paying close attention to the developments out of Hong Kong. The U.S. government would be well-advised to get on-the-ground intelligence from them.  Looking more broadly beyond the e-HKD, mBridge may over time shape the contours of alternative financial plumbing. Yes, proliferating CBDCs across borders could just be a pipedream of many central banks. But should the U.S. leadership really sit around to find out, or should it preemptively engage other central banks in an emerging alternative financial ecosystem? BIS has extended the invitation for other central banks to join the effort, so the Federal Reserve should be there influencing the ground rules. The mBridge consortium of central banks have already agreed on the principles of “do no harm, compliance, and interoperability.” However, depending on how CBDC-to-CBDC projects such as mBridge pan out, the principles may change.  To safeguard U.S. leadership in the global financial order, the U.S. government should be monitoring CBDC developments, and proactively shape the agenda of the meetings taking place in the nine international organizations under the Bank for International Settlements, along with discussions happening at other standard-shaping institutions, including the Financial Stability Board, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, the International Organization for Standardization, the Group of Seven, Group of 20 and other bodies.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | WALLET | RESEARCH,Emily Jin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/13/hong-kong-e-hkd-cbdc-crypto-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dad384f84b26b0451ad848e72b4c8caba9ab631d-1792x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411685,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfFCM,1670967087,The Different Types of NFTs: A Simple Guide,"Non-fungible tokens (NFT) have gone from a relatively obscure section of crypto to one of the most well-known in just a few years. If you asked an average person they’d probably explain that an NFT is a token that represents ownership of a unique digital artwork, and that’s certainly one kind of NFT.  As the NFT market has exploded into a multi-billion-dollar industry, the variety of NFTs has grown as well. In addition to proving ownership of physical or digital assets such as art, music, images and collectibles, NFTs are now popping up across an array of industries from fashion to play-to-earn (P2E) gaming that are forging real-world utility and building robust online communities.  Here are the different types of NFTs to be aware of and how they’re being used.  PFP NFTs  Profile picture NFTs (PFP for short), are exactly what it sounds like: An NFT that is often used as a digital avatar for a person’s profile picture on social media sites, primarily on Twitter. The first PFP NFTs were CryptoPunks, which were created in 2017 by Larva Labs, which created a set of 10,000 algorithmically generated punks with different attributes. The most famous NFTs in this genre to date are the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) PFPs, created by Yuga Labs in April 2021. The highest-priced droopy-eyed primate is Bored Ape #8817, which sold for $3.4 million dollars. The BAYC NFT collection is also notable for giving owners the intellectual property rights (IP) of their Bored Apes, thereby allowing holders to have commercial usage rights and monetize their NFTs.  Other than bragging rights, the main draw for owning one of these NFTs is often about access to exclusive NFT communities and future perks such as airdrops or other rewards. Owning a Bored Ape, for example, makes you a member of a club that includes celebrities such as Jimmy Fallon, Madonna and Paris Hilton, as well as attend real-life parties like ApeFest and other NFT-gated parties. As the metaverse continues to grow, there will likely be more use of PFPs as avatars within those platforms as well.  Read More: What Are PFP NFTs  Generative art NFTs  Generative art NFTs trace their roots all the way to a 1960s computer-controlled abstract style of art that was created with the help of robots. Using a range of software and artificial intelligence tools, a specified aesthetic is generated using a set of artist’s requirements and an algorithm that has randomness baked in to create unique pieces that share a common look and feel.  Projects including Autoglyphs by Larva Labs, Lost Poets and Ringers, along with artists Tyler Hobbs, Robbie Barret and Matt Kane have been leaders in the space. While you can find generative NFTs on digital marketplaces including OpenSea and Rarible, the auction platform, Art Blocks, is a dedicated platform created by a big generative artist himself, Erick Calderon aka Snowfro. Art Blocks shepherds generative art creators and their work through the entire process from creation to sale.  Read more: What Are Generative Art NFTs?  Music NFTs  Music NFTs can seem counterintuitive; why buy a music clip when I can stream or download the song from a music platform like Spotify or iTunes? The difference is purchasing a music NFT grants ownership of the file versus buying a license that allows you to listen. Music NFTs can also forge a new relationship between artists and their fans. Fans can follow and invest in their favorite artist’s work by owning a piece of a song or album. Think of it this way: What if you were the first to buy a music NFT by a promising new artist who later rose to fame? You would have a unique form of proof of your early fandom that could also be uniquely valuable. On the other side of the equation, artists have the opportunity to engage with their fans and can offer rewards like new music, exclusive merch, experiences and concert tickets.  There are also specific projects with parameters that give NFT owners royalties on streaming rights, or owning a piece of the song, called Limited Digital Assets or LDAs. Introduced by Royal, a service that mints royalty-bearing NFTs, this first LDA on the platform was artist 3LAU’s song ""Worst Case.""  Read More: What Are Music NFTs  Soulbound Tokens  The concept behind soulbound tokens (SBT) was inspired by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s observation of the online fantasy game World of Warcraft’s “soulbound items,” digital items that cannot be bought or sold. Cited in a May 2022 report Buterin and colleagues, soulbound tokens are described as “non-transferable digital tokens that represent social identity in a decentralized society.” The paper outlines how accounts called “Souls” would issue individual, self-certified tokens that would function like items on a resume, identifying specific accomplishments, credentials and previous affiliations.  As of December, the use cases for SBTs are still being fleshed out. Potential uses could be, beyond functioning like a blockchain resume, managing medical records, holding digital ID or membership cards, verifying attendance and recovering lost private keys.  Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced plans by the end of 2022 to issue a SBT on the BNB blockchain to all users who complete the know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.  See Also: What Are Soulbound Tokens? The Non-Transferrable NFT Explained  Sports collectible NFTs  Sports collectible NFTs, with a reported current market valuation around $1.4 billion, have reimagined how fans buy, sell and trade sports memorabilia. This type of NFT includes transforming the traditional sports collectibles such as trading cards into NFTs, including NBA Top Shot Moments, videos that capture memorable plays during NBA games.  Autograph, an NFT trading platform co-founded by National Football League quarterback Tom Brady, offers NFTs of celebrity-signed assets, with rare-tiered items that connect fans with their idols in innovative ways like real-life experiences and other rewards.  Collectible NFTs have also invaded the digital comic book industry with projects including DC Comics’ NFT collectible release with Funko. Collectible NFT trading and ownership, for most, is about future liquidity, though nostalgia and true fandom are also a major draw to buy into a collection.  There is also a variety of sports NFTs that tap into fantasy sports leagues on platforms such as SoRare, which use NFTs to power the virtual football or baseball teams that then compete. SoRare NFTs cross over into our next entry, around play-to-earn NFTs.  Play-to-earn gaming NFTs  Play-to-earn (P2E) gaming NFTs is also known as GameFi. Online gaming has historically offered in-game assets to enhance the experience like weapons and armor to be purchased from the game developer or platform. The difference with P2E is that the equivalent cosmetic items like skins or shoes are NFTs, and most play-to-earn games require an initial purchase of one of the game’s NFTs to actually earn crypto for playing. These NFTs are usually available for purchase within the games or on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea.  Popular examples such as Axie Infinity and Gods Unchained, give players ownership over their rewards and the ability to sell and trade their in-game asset earnings. This includes in-game crypto currency rewards as well as the NFTs themselves, such as the “Axies” that are the in-game virtual pets central to gameplay on Axie Infinity, or the metaverse platform Star Atlas’ structure NFTs. Star Atlas in-game tokens, ATLAS and POLIS, can be earned by completing missions. In addition, a range of NFTs can be purchased and traded on the games NFT marketplace.  There is also a sub-category of NFTs that involve real-world involvement such as Stepn, which categorizes itself as a “move to earn” game.  Fashion NFTs  Linking real-world fashion with embedded chips to NFTs offers an enticing, unique designer experience for consumers to engage in new ways with brands they love. This innovation in fashion also includes using virtual reality headsets to try on items in augmented reality settings. Major designers including Tommy Hilfiger and Dolce & Gabbana have released digital-garment-only collections sold as NFTs that could be worn by your avatar within the metaverse platform Decentraland. Similarly, The Dematerialised (DMAT), a Web3 wearable marketplace, lets users buy, sell and virtually try-on NFTs styles on the platform.  Some fashion brands and retailers such as Nike x RTFKT’s Cryptokicks, the shoe giant’s metaverse sneaker line, intend to pair physical clothing with online items to create a “phygital” experience, an emerging Web3 trend.  Read More: A Guide to Digital Fashion and the Metaverse  Utility NFTs  Some NFTs are being used to link digital tokens to real-world rewards and experiences, aka Utility NFTs. There are NFTs that fall into one of the prior categories and also add utility, adding value like membership to a club, access to IRL experiences or attachment to physical goods. There are also NFTs that are solely meant to offer access to a real-life club, tickets to an event, nightclub or other experience.  This type of NFT is influencing almost every type of existing NFTs, including the previously mentioned Bored Ape Yacht Club, which now offers exclusive access to parties and events. Projects such as PROOF collective offer benefits to future drops including the Moonbirds PFP Project.  Retailers are adding real-world utility to their NFTs. For example, Dolce & Gabbana and UNXD’s Collezione Genesi was one of the first luxury NFT collections to include digital and physical items and future experiential benefits.

Manning, now a security consultant for privacy startup Nym, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program on Tuesday that the fall of FTX and now the arrest of former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried opens the door to a wider discussion about privacy and transparency.  “There is a chance now, given this discussion, to innovate in a way to ensure that you know where your assets are,” Manning said. She added that it would also mean users would be able to “verify that this is in fact coming from a person who is authenticated, who is valid [and] who has reputation.”  Read more: FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Formally Charged With Conspiracy, Fraud in US Court  The former Army intelligence analyst is known for leaking roughly half a million documents related to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, bringing to light what the military really knew about civilian casualties. Now a self-proclaimed “skeptic of digital assets,” Manning noted that people may have taken crypto’s inherently transparent nature at face value and drummed up “assumptions” about the technology.  “The truth is people have been jumping to the gun on some of the expectations,” Manning said, adding that participants in crypto are only now beginning to understand the technology and the underlying problems it has as it relates to privacy.  According to Manning, FTX’s implosion will likely stir Congress to act with new rules.  “Regulation is coming,” she said. “Whether it’s the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] or Congress or the European Union, regulation is coming. This is a reality. The crypto space is going to have regulation coming.”  However, said Manning, it is necessary that crypto-based platforms have a way of verifying information for users on their own, “outside of the regulatory space,” in an effort to avoid ""just replicating what the [Federal Reserve] is or replicating what FTX was.”  “There are some fundamental aspects of the technology that are interesting,” she said. She added that the “technical aspects of cryptography and being able to verify information in order to be able to provide for your privacy in the future” are under development.

42420845,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVdd,1670963220,Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin Holds Initial Move Higher Following Unexpectedly Strong Inflation Report,"Bitcoin's price pushed higher following better-than-expected inflation data on Tuesday. The report showed U.S. inflation rising 7.1% versus the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey. Core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and fuel costs, increased 6% versus expectations of 6.2%.  November marks the second consecutive month that inflation has risen at a slower pace than expected. The positive report strengthens the perception that the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate increases are having the desired impact of taming inflation.  The probability the FOMC will increase rates by a 50 basis points (bps) during its next meeting this week increased to 82%, from 73.5% a day prior. The FOMC raised rates by 75 bps at its last four meetings. Market participants are hoping that the central bank will soon end its monetary hawkishness altogether.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) prices jumped immediately after Tuesday’s CPI announcement and were recently up 3.9% and 4.7%, respectively.  A screen for high trading activity shows BTC and ETH appearing on a list of more than 10 cryptocurrencies whose trading volume exceeded its 20-day moving average by more than 50%.  Traditional assets rallied initially before paring gains midday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) recently declined 0.12%, while the S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite increased a paltry 0.4% and 0.25%, respectively.  Bond yields declined across the maturity curve, with shorter-term Treasurys decreasing more sharply than longer-term Treasurys. Many investors will likely deem this significant because it shows that currently inverted yield curves are becoming less inverted.  An inverted yield curve occurs when shorter-term debt has a higher yield than longer-term debt. Inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic recessions and imply declining confidence in short-term economic prospects.  In combating inflation, the securities holdings on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet declined to $8.6 trillion for the week, ending Dec 7, down $76.7 billion from this time last year.  Trading activity over the next several days will show whether today’s push higher results in short-term profit taking or represents a sustained increase in prices.  BTC has ground to cover before it reaches psychologically important $20,000 support when viewing the asset’s moving averages. On a positive note, its current price is approaching its 50-day moving average of $17,895.  The 50-day moving average is now within 15% of the 200-day moving average of $20,852. The $20,000 mark for BTC also represents the on-chain realized price for market participants. Recapturing this level would push BTC past a significant technical resistance and key price point.  Ether’s price is a bit further on.

42407245,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJwZg,1670962583,2023: The Year Blockchain Becomes a Sustainability Solution,"There has never been a time in the world’s history where environmental sustainability for major businesses has been more critical. The planet is showing signs of dramatic change, and the public is calling for greater accountability from all industries. Often, the blockchain community is portrayed as part of the problem, but this is largely a misrepresentation. This technology may actually assist in the global transition necessary for a sustainable future.  The possibilities afforded by sustainable blockchains are massive, and the upsides for the environment are too important to ignore. Of course, there are still challenges to address as is true of any industry, but they are recognized and are being actively worked on. What other industry has had its second-largest operator reduce its energy consumption and emissions by more than 99% in less than 10 years since inception?  Stefan Renton is the sustainability lead at Polygon, a blockchain development platform. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.  Sustainability in 2022  Today, the importance of ecologically sustainable business practices has become a central part of the popular narrative. Prominent companies rush to declare that they are launching various programs to address sustainability, and in many cases they do just what they say. However, it is also common for some of these businesses to hide behind opaque metrics and somewhat more interpretive goals. A lack of transparent oversight or explicit standards exacerbates this. Some companies have been caught fudging the truth about their efforts to be greener in an effort to merely improve their image (also known as “greenwashing”). This serves nobody but company executives and has sown mistrust amongst the broader public.  Sustainable blockchains?  Blockchains are often stigmatized for their burden on the environment. While it is true that Bitcoin itself and similar proof-of-work (PoW) chains have a considerable ecological impact, proof-of-stake (PoS) chains are vastly more energy efficient. For example, the Ethereum network recently upgraded to PoS, which saw Ethereum’s energy usage drop by 99.9%.  Moreover, efforts are already underway to address and rectify Ethereum's historical carbon consumption via the newly formed Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) – a collective of industry luminaries, including Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, ConsenSys, Microsoft, Aave and Polygon, which launched at COP27’s U.N. Climate Change Global Innovation Hub.  With new green credentials, blockchain networks can be put to good use by improving tracking and verifiably proving emissions of a given organization or supply chain. Due to their inherent immutability, accountability and transparency, blockchain can track carbon balances and other environmental measures, holding to account companies that proclaim to be sustainable.  For example, implementing smart contracts can automate the process of tracking how much carbon is produced at every step of a business's operations. This information could then be reported to various monitoring services and relayed to the public. The verifiable, cryptographically enforced nature of this data will guarantee that it cannot be falsified or obfuscated in any way.  Incidentally, that same cryptography will also protect the privacy of the company’s reporting. Thanks to zero-knowledge (ZK) technology, unfalsifiable proofs can be generated that confirm the underlying information without revealing it. In basic terms, a company could provide evidence that it met various energy usage or carbon emission standards without disclosing the underlying data – a current blocker to company transparency when reporting details on emissions producing activities.  Another way environmentally friendly blockchains can become a sustainability solution is through the tokenization and digital distribution of digital environmental assets. A recent example is the accelerated development of the carbon credit market, which has attracted the attention of leading organizations across the globe, from the largest registries that provide accreditation including Verra and Gold Standard, to international bodies such as the World Economic Forum.  Projects including KlimaDAO and Toucan deliver tokenization of carbon credits, bringing about important discussion on the future of carbon markets and if and how they should be using blockchain technology.  There are even blockchain-native iterations focused on solving the scaling problem and the limited supply of current carbon markets such as Nori, whose novel approach recognizes the need for measurable drawdown alongside carbon avoidance. Nori’s future-forward focus, which was not widely recognized in earlier years, has recently secured a partnership and integration with Bayer, which has the potential to deliver immense scale.  Even the United Nations is inviting the applications of blockchain in climate action and supporting initiatives driven by the Web3 community.  Taking the next steps  Blockchain's role in helping the environment can go far beyond energy footprints and carbon credits as well. We expect to see an increasing number of sustainability-focused systems launching in 2023, where things like water usage or plastic creation could similarly be tracked and reported. Governments and regulators could create clear standards for what levels of environmental impact are acceptable across various industries and utilize these blockchain systems to monitor them. This would not only benefit the planet itself, but it would also streamline business processes via clear expectations for emissions.  Even electrical grids can be managed via blockchains and smart contracts. Where power is routed can be largely automated while also being tracked, and this development stands to make energy use far more equitable. Applications that improve energy demand management can become easier, providing incentives for grid users. Increased access to investment in renewable energy infrastructure is a real possibility enabled by blockchain.  The aforementioned ECP is a prime example of the sentiment within Web3 to tackle this monumental challenge. Beyond efforts to mitigate Ethereum's previous carbon footprint, the ECP aims to create a positive impact via investment in scaling carbon-reducing technologies that leverage blockchain.  Another important possibility of blockchain and its applications such as DeFi (decentralized finance) is its ability to provide tools to empower communities most affected by climate change and business generated consumption, such as those in the global south. In other applications such as supply chain, it can bring more transparency and provability to equitable distribution of revenue and improved treatment; the next generation of fair trade.  Clearly, this technology is nascent, and nobody is saying that blockchain on its own is a panacea for dealing with climate change. Nonetheless, more industries must consider what this technology can offer. Perhaps the most important initial component is accountability for companies claiming to be engaging in sustainable practices. That said, there is so much more that is possible. The world should begin paying attention and get past the notion that blockchain is part of the problem because, in truth, it could form part of the solution.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Stefan Renton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/13/sustainable-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52140a3651a175fe66b2ddff1069f1dd8e13eae1-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407241,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJwMS,1670961675,"Starlink, Verizon 5G and Crypto: What the New ‘War of the Currents’ Means for Decentralization","Whether it’s Verizon courting government contracts for its 5G upgrade, blockchain startups deploying routers with crypto mining incentives, or Elon Musk making Starlink available to the Ukrainian resistance, broadband and internet of things (IoT) are the new battleground for companies, ideologies and visionaries.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  While it is still too early to tell whether there will be a singular or divergent solution, the new technological framework for interoperability will have ideology embedded in its code. Crypto and freedom advocates should ensure decentralization as a principle is enshrined, and cooperate to realize and expand on Nikola Tesla’s vision of a decentralized, ubiquitous network.  In the late 1800s, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse found themselves in an ideological battle over the future of electricity. Threatened by Tesla and Westinghouse’s widely adopted alternating currents (AC) power system, Edison built out his direct-current (DC) stations, while deploying ruthless public relations campaigns to undermine his rivals’ credibility. As the three men urgently took their products to market and built out supporting infrastructure, corporations on the periphery also competed for market share, including Brush Electricity Company – which installed its arc lighting solutions in key regions including New York City.  Tim Kravchunovsky is the Founder and CEO of Chirp. A graduate of Columbia University’s Masters Program, he has over 20 years experience as a network engineer and previously consulted for the World Bank.  The AC system won out and became the gold standard underlying all electrification. An important lesson remains for those developing new architecture: The best technology can triumph only when it is also widely adopted.  After developing the AC system, Tesla devoted much of his life to revolutionizing wireless electricity. The inventor envisioned infinite energy via a global network of towers that would electrify the world without wires. While investors including J.P. Morgan initially backed Tesla’s venture based on his past success with AC electricity, they later cut funding – a system handing such power over to end users, independent of the large companies who clashed during the “War of the Currents,” was too radical for many to handle at the time, and the technology wasn’t in place yet.  Tesla died penniless in New York City, but his vision of ubiquitous energy run across a decentralized wireless system has served as inspiration for scientists, entrepreneurs and world leaders. Founders need to think carefully about the incentive structures that go into building such a system, while resisting centralized parties looking to co-opt its mechanisms under their own infrastructures – the blockchain sector in particular is in a unique position to guard against these attempts.  While there is heroism in Elon Musk – an heir to Tesla’s legacy – stepping in to provide Starlink to Ukrainian citizens, there are also warnings that founders should note. Following Starlink’s deployment, Musk walked back his initial support for the cause and threatened to withdraw the program unless the U.S. Defense Department footed the bill. Although Musk also walked back these comments and kept Starlink operational in the region, the reversal revealed an incentive structure based on geopolitics, profit margins, and a billionaire’s impulses – which millions of innocent people suddenly found themselves tethered to. Musk is hardly an outlier when it comes to the murky relationship between centralized vested interests and state power. Telecom companies provide troves of data on millions of users daily to government entities.  As the original use case of blockchain technology, Bitcoin allows any individual – no matter their socioeconomic class or country of origin – to take custody of their money. When applied to IoT devices, broadband and telecommunications infrastructure, blockchain technology can bestow more universe digital rights, including the ability to access modern internet and phone services without being surveilled.  In the current “builder’s market,” blockchain developers and founders need to pay closer attention to the developments unfolding across telecommunications, broadband and IoT, rather than speculative digital asset bubbles that, unfortunately, defined the space over the past few years. Whether it’s setting up routers to power decentralized wireless networks (following in the tradition of Satoshi Nakamoto sending himself test amounts of bitcoin), or writing interoperable code, the crypto community should apply the principles of decentralization to this next frontier, and work together to ensure the ubiquitous network as envisioned by Tesla can take hold on the same scale as the inventor’s AC gold standard.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Tim Kravchunovsky,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/13/starlink-verizon-5g-and-crypto-what-the-new-war-of-the-currents-means-for-decentralization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98d12640e34ad0559295b6cc25bb1b0f88bc1de6-1999x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although I disagree with how she got there, I can also make an argument to support this price target. $1 million is possible, but there will be many ups and downs before that. Thesis Summary Recently, Cathie Wood reiterated her belief that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could reach $1 million by 2030 . She made these remarks in a Bloomberg interview, but this thesis is actually based on a report by ARK Invest from a few months back. ARK looks at Bitcoin’s potential market cap in 2030 based on various use cases. I analyzed these numbers in a previous article, reaching the conclusion that, from a fundamental perspective, it seemed like an ambitious target. However, in this article, I’d like to present an alternative methodology based on the stock-to-flow model and technical analysis, which does indeed support the claims that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030 The numbers don’t add up The image below shows how ARK invests believes Bitcoin could reach a value of over $1 million. ARK Invest Report (ARK Invest) The ARK report forecasts a market cap for the Bitcoin market of $21.5 trillion, and amongst other things, assumes Bitcoin will take market share from gold, become a common holding for companies, and projects 25% of US banking transactions will be settled in Bitcoin. In a previous article , I went in-depth into each of these segments, making my own calculations and reaching a slightly less bullish projection. I forecasted a potential market cap of $12.85 trillion, which would mean a Bitcoin price of $613,000. However, a $1 million price target is supported by the stock-2-flow model, and we can also reach this target using Elliott Waves. The S2F model The stock-to-flow model (S2F model) is a popular pricing model for Bitcoin. We can see it below. S2F model (S2Fmultiple) The Stock-to-flow ratio is obtained by calculating how long it would take at the current rate of production (flow) to produce an equal amount to the current stock. For example, it is estimated that 3,000 metric tonnes of gold are extracted every year and that there are 185,000 metric tonnes of gold already mined in the world. This means gold has an S2F ratio of 62. Now, if we calculate the S2F value for Bitcoin and apply this mathematical formula shown in the box, we get a projection of the price of Bitcoin which is shown in the red line in the chart. Notice how the value of Bitcoin using this model goes up over time as more Bitcoin halvings take place. This is because halving events reduce the production capacity of Bitcoin, which increases the S2F ratio. Since its inception, Bitcoin’s price has oscillated around the projected price of the S2F model, though the current price is quite far from the model’s target price for today, which should be around $112,000. In any case, if this model is accurate, then following the next halving, Bitcoin should reach a price of $1.285 million, and this would happen sometime around 2025. The Technicals Line Up We can also reach a target price for Bitcoin using Elliott Wave Theory. However, I must say that there are different ways of calculating price targets, and these projections aren’t completely reliable. Bitcoin Price Analysis (Author's work) The chart above shows a potential long-term count for Bitcoin. We have an initial five-wave move up into 2014 which is a large degree wave 1. The bear market in 2015 was our wave 2. The following rally, which led to the 2018 peak was the wave 1 of a five-wave structure of our large-degree wave 3. Now, we are currently completing yet another five-wave structure shown in the smaller roman numerals, within a wave 3 inside the larger 3. Last year's bear market was part of a wave iv, which may still be ongoing. However, let’s assume that Bitcoin has found a bottom around the $15K mark. We can now project the length of wave v of 3, and then from there, making some further assumptions, we could project the following waves 4 and final wave 5 of 3. So, firstly, there are three ways of calculating a wave 5/v in EWT. Wave 5 is equal to wave 1 Wave 5 is equal to 61.8% of waves 1+3 Wave 5 is equal to the inverse 1.618 ext of wave 4 In this chart, if wave v were equal to wave i, we would not even rally above the previous high, so let’s discard that option. If we measure the length of i+iii from the bottom of wave iv, the 61.8% ext lands at a price of $94,000. This is shown on the chart above. Finally, we could also have the inverse 1.618 ext of wave iv, leading us to a more bullish target of around $150,000. So, let’s assume that Bitcoin reaches $94,000 in wave 3. Then where would wave 4 land? The most likely outcome according to EWT would be a 50% retracement of the wave 3, which lands us at $17,246. Bitcoin Price Analysis (Author's work) In EWT, it’s also usual for higher degree wave 4s to overlap with smaller degree wave 4s, so this price area makes a lot of sense. If we, once again, measure waves 1+3, (the length of the black line), from the bottom of wave 4, ($17,246) the 0.618 ext should be where wave 5 lands, which is at $1.09 million. If we took the length of wave 1 instead, we’d reach a target of $1.7, and if instead, we use the inverse 1.618 of wave 4, we’d get a much less bullish price target of around $200,000. Now, to calculate this precisely, we’d need to know where exactly the next wave 3 and 4 are going to end, but this gives us a decent idea of where we should be heading in the coming years. I would expect wave 3 to take place in 2025 following the next halving. We’d then enter a bear market as is usual, which would be wave 4 during 2026-2028, and then we would rally again following the subsequent halving, which would mean that wave 3 could top around 2030, which is when ARK Invest believes Bitcoin could be worth $1 million. Final Thoughts ARK’s theory that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030 is supported by the stock-to-flow model and Elliott Wave projections. However, we must understand that there are limitations to what technical analysis can do in such long time frames. Personally, I have my eyes set on the next bull phase, which will see Bitcoin reach new all-time highs, but I don’t think it will land us anywhere near $1 million.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564241-cathie-wood-says-1m-dollar-bitcoin-again-why-might-be-right?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5523353.jpeg

42414756,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBJgVF,1670960022,Crypto Market’s Near-Apocalypse in 2022 Turns Zombie Tokens Into Dead Coins,"When the decentralized marketplace Storeum debuted its own freshly minted cryptocurrency in July 2019, the STO token soon grabbed traders’ attention: The STO price jumped from a few cents to an all-time high around $35 for a few days in March 2020 before quickly settling back to less than $1.  But Storeum has since gone mostly quiet. Its website no longer works and social media accounts are inactive. The token technically still exists, in zombie form, as a contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This year, the STO has taken another step toward oblivion: It has vanished from the pricing site CoinGecko, which lists nearly 13,000 cryptocurrencies that are still considered viable in some form.  CoinGecko officials would not confirm when exactly Storeum was deactivated from its website. But a cursory search using the Wayback Machine, which archives websites from prior dates, shows that a Storeum token page was still active as of early 2022. Now, typing Storeum into CoinGecko’s search bar turns up no results.  Call it a dead coin.  During the crypto bull market of recent years, the number of cryptocurrencies seemed to be ever-increasing, roughly quadrupling from 2019 through early 2022, based on data from the website Statista. Since peaking at 10,397 in February 2022, the number has dropped by about 1,000, the biggest-ever decline in the 13-year-old crypto industry’s volatile history.  “It’s relatively simple for someone to create a token,” said Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko. “But these tokens can obviously lose interest extremely quickly.”  Just as STO arrived during an earlier crypto bull-market hype cycle, a bevy of tokens appeared last year as bitcoin (BTC) – the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market value, often viewed as an industry bellwether – shot to a record $69,000.  According to CoinGecko, which uses a different methodology from Statista’s, over 8,000 cryptocurrencies were newly listed in 2021, but some 3,300 of them, or roughly 41%, ended up being deactivated and delisted.  “During this period, many cryptocurrency projects, tokens and coins with little to no value or any immediate or discernible purpose were launched by various anonymous developers,” Julia Ng, growth marketing at CoinGecko, wrote in a recent analysis. “Few were actually committed to their projects, which resulted in a high rate of failure, and thus their ultimate demise.”  Tokens might be removed from the site due to a lack of any discernible trading activity within the last two months, based on CoinGecko's methodology. A coin might also be taken off CoinGecko if it's deemed to be a ""rug pull"" or other scams, or if the project team requests a deactivation.  ""This might occur when the team disbands, rebrands, shutters the project, or undergo major token overhauls where old tokens become sufficiently illiquid or dead, according to CoinGecko standards,"" Ng wrote.  The overall crypto market’s capitalization has shrunk from an all-time high of $3 trillion in November 2021 to about $850 billion now. Bitcoin’s price has fallen 66% over the past year and ether (ETH) is down 71%.  Kaiko’s Carey estimated that the number of failed tokens could be “significantly higher in the past two years” because of the explosion in 2017 in the number of ERC-20 tokens – a type that’s easy to mint and runs atop the Ethereum blockchain.  “It’s relatively simple for someone to create a token and an associated decentralized exchanges [DEX] liquidity pool,” Carey told CoinDesk. “If no one is providing liquidity, there will be little or no trading volume.”.  Rug pull  Besides losing buyers’ interests, some token failures could be associated with scams, according to Chainalysis Director of Research Kim Grauer.  One of the more common schemes, referred to in the gallows-humor jargon of crypto traders as the “rug pull,” involves “creating a token, funding the liquidity pool, and then removing all the liquidity after an initial rush of people buy the token,” as Carey describes it.  As is the case with Storeum, the contract behind the token remains on the blockchain; the data is still there, for posterity, even when the token has gone dormant and is long forgotten. Etherscan, a data explorer for the Ethereum blockchain, shows no transactions have occurred for 231 days.  A warning notice on the Etherscan page reads, ""Warning! There are reports that this token used a fake team profile on their website. Please exercise caution when interacting with this token.""  At one point, back in 2019, there was chatter on the forum bitcointalk.org that the Storeum project might be a ""scam hitting on all cylinders,"" including speculation that team members were ginned up using artificial intelligence.  Chainalysis’s Grauer told CoinDesk that “it is difficult for a token to totally ‘die’ because the code keeps the project running even without buyers.”  The existence of dead coins points up a key paradox of the crypto industry, according to Kaiko's Carey: Decentralization, often portrayed as a pillar of virtue, can proves to be little more than an illusion. Just like the fast growth.  It's “decentralization, in that the bar to creating tokens has been dramatically lowered in recent years,” Carey said. It's “centralization, in that many of these tokens or projects relied on one or a few individuals to provide liquidity and keep the project alive. Centralized exchanges are well within their right to remove tokens with little or no trading volume, as they won’t contribute to revenue and likely entail some cost to upkeep.”  Some tokens might be better off dead.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/13/crypto-markets-near-apocalypse-in-2022-turns-zombie-tokens-into-dead-coins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48dcc696b02cec0b8eb3ec274234f7da27ec9641-3936x2214.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42389631,6F4ZR09tPAWQmeXaoSbQJk,1670959902,Inside Sam Bankman-Fried’s First Bahamas Court Hearing After His Arrest,"NASSAU, The Bahamas — Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told a Bahamas judge on Tuesday that he was not waiving his right to fight extradition to the U.S.  The former titan of industry appeared in a Nassau, Bahamas courtroom on Tuesday morning to face an extradition order from the U.S. on federal charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and other allegations.  Bankman-Fried was arrested in Nassau on Monday evening after a magistrate judge signed an emergency warrant for his arrest at the request of prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York.  He arrived to the courthouse at approximately 10:30 a.m. ET wearing a blue suit. Bankman-Fried was not handcuffed as he sat alone in the front row of the court, directly facing Magistrate Judge Joyann Ferguson-Pratt, who signed the warrant for his arrest Monday.  Before the proceedings could begin, Bankman-Fried’s attorney asked the judge for permission to allow his client to take a prescription medication.  Bankman-Fried told the judge that the medication was in his possession when he was arrested but he had not had access to it since Monday. A police officer brought a ziploc bag of Bankman-Fried’s belongings into the court, which contained his medication, and the judge asked if he needed water to take it.  “I don’t need water but I do need to take my shirt off to take them,” Bankman-Fried, who is known to take Emsam patches as an antidepressant, told the court.  “Well, you certainly can’t take your shirt off in court,” the judge said before allowing him to leave the room for several minutes to take his medication.  Bankman-Fried, who was characteristically jittery before taking his medication, was no longer jittery upon his return to court.  Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, were seated in the third row behind members of the press.  They appeared to oscillate between dejection and defiance, at times holding their heads in their hands and clasping their hands. Bankman-Fried’s mother audibly laughed several times when her son was referred to as a “fugitive” and his father occasionally put his fingers in his ears as if to drown out the sound of the proceedings.  A long shot at bail  Bankman-Fried’s Bahamian counsel pushed the judge to consider allowing the now-disgraced former CEO to post a cash bail, arguing that his client was not a flight risk.  The lawyer told the court that Bankman-Fried had been a permanent resident of the Bahamas for “many years” (Bankman-Fried is reported to have lived in Albany since 2021) and owns “real property” here.  Prosecutors pushed back, arguing that the extradition treaty with the United States required the defendant to be held in custody.  “Custody, My Lady, custody,” the prosecutor told Judge Ferguson-Pratt, “which has one meaning whether it’s Webster’s [dictionary] or Oxford or otherwise. Custody is inconsistent with the act of bail.”  The judge told the courtroom that she had been “wrestling” with whether or not to grant him bail since signing the warrant for his arrest.  “On a good day, I don’t drink. Ask anybody,” she said. “But yesterday, I was sure gonna drink.”  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued that he has had opportunities to run “up from the moment the FTX issues became public” and did not take them.  His lawyer added that the flight risk can be “mitigated” by “electronic monitoring systems” and a large cash bail.  The judge seemed unconvinced, and told the attorneys that she had had several cases in which defendants forfeited cash bail and went on the lam.  “The creole expression is ‘allez,’” Judge Ferguson-Pratt said. “They never came back.”  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have requested bail, according to Reuters.

Currently, DOGE is still standing at a good short-term level but $0.1 remains the level to beat for the digital asset. Dogecoin Gains Momentum The last 24 hours have seen Dogecoin establish some much-needed momentum in the market. It saw an increase in its price in the early hours of Tuesday, which pushed the digital asset right above the $0.099 price level. DOGE has now continued to trend along this line for the better part of the morning, although the increased momentum shows that it may be able to maintain it for much longer. During this time, the trading volume of Dogecoin had also risen to a peak above $600 million for the 24-hour period. This showed where the uptick in price had been generated from as well. It represented a 48% increase in trading volume, which was largely driven by whale transactions. Related Reading: Cardano Community Expects ADA To Jump 50% By End Of Year, Is This Possible?

This makes DOGE’s recovery above $0.09 all the more important since it puts it one step closer to testing this critical level. If DOGE were to successfully break above $0.1, it would put it comfortably above its 50-day moving average.

The company might face a bank run as crypto investors’ confidence continues to decline following the collapse of trading venue FTX and a U.S. investigation into major crypto exchanges. Related Reading: PancakeSwap (CAKE) Slides Below Range, Is This An Entry Point For Buyers? At the same time, positive economic data from the U.S. is positively impacting the market. Bitcoin is back above its previous yearly lows. As of this writing, BTC’s price trades at $17,750 with a 4% and 5% profit in the last 24 hours and the previous week, respectively. Bitcoin Rally In Danger, Binance Makes A Stand Data from on-chain analytic firm Glassnode, shared by Dylan LeClair, indicates that Binance has seen a massive withdrawal of 40,000 BTC in the last 24 hours. The outflows are almost double those seen in July 2021. At that time, the crypto market was experiencing a second capitulation event after hitting an all-time high north of $60,000. The cryptocurrency lost over 50% of its value from May to late July. In early November, the crypto exchange saw a significant outflow as FTX went belly up. However, the market seems more bearish on crypto exchanges now that at two of its worst sentiments, during the 2021 capitulation and the FTX collapse. In addition, the crypto exchange has experienced its worst stablecoin outflow since its inception. Additional data from LeClair indicates that Binance has seen $2.1 billion in outflows in the last 24 hours. There are $20 billion in stablecoin reserves. Overall, the exchange has enough funds to cover ten times its withdrawals, but the market sentiment is negative, and crypto investors’ confidence continues to dip. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, CEO of Binance, welcomed the withdrawals and classified them as “stress testing”: We saw some withdrawals today (net $1.14b ish). We have seen this before. Some days we have net withdrawals; some days, we have net deposits. Business as usual for us. I actually think it is a good idea to “stress test withdrawals” on each CEX on a rotating basis. Bitcoin exchange outflows are often a bullish indicator. In the current context, with inflation declining and a potential U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) pivot, the perception around outflows changed.

42407242,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJwPl,1670957647,Blockchain vs. Crypto: Not What It Seems,"Déjà vu. You know that feeling, when you momentarily are not sure of where you are in the timeline and you wonder what you’ve missed. We’re there now.  The “blockchain not bitcoin” chorus seems to be re-emerging, taking us back to the 2016-18 heyday of thematic and platform consortia convinced that the benefits of greater efficiency would overcome corporate competition. Bitcoin was an asset with no backing or clear utility, the implied argument seemed to go, whereas blockchain, well that was a technology.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Last week, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled “Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto,” in which he reminded us of the potentially far-reaching impact of tokenization and peer-to-peer payments and drilled down on the benefits of risk reduction and settlement speed. Last month, Citi published the results of a survey showing that 92% of participating institutions see value in tokenization while 88% are either exploring distributed ledger use cases or actively participating in blockchain projects. Over the past few days, the Red Cross talked about ongoing work on a blockchain-based aid distribution prototype, and Japanese banking conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group announced plans to work on soulbound tokens for digital identity.  What’s going on? Is this part of a post-FTX “reset,” a cathartic back-to-basics? Or is something else in play?  Both. Yes, we are likely to see more public discussion about distributed ledger efficiencies and less about crypto asset trading and investment. This is a natural reflex after the damage done by layered leverage, flimsy tokenomics and trading fraud, and some high-profile reminders that crypto is not just about greed are more than welcome.  Read more: BTC Dominance Is Behaving Weirdly, and That’s Sort of Good | Opinion  It is also an acknowledgement that there is a constant battle for attention, and the “X not Y” model assumes that only one variable is worthy. “Blockchain not bitcoin” emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market’s performance woes – the new version does the same but swaps in “crypto” to reflect the ecosystem’s spread.  So, a large part of this is a cyclical narrative shift. But there’s something else going on as well. This shift comes on top of a longer-term tale of technological evolution and shiny things.  The last wave of blockchain hype may not seem to have produced much value. Pilots and proofs of concept involving lettuce, plastics, even (alarmingly) nuclear weapons seemed to deliver no practical utility. Groups working on blockchain use cases for trade finance, healthcare, telecoms, insurance and more have either gone quiet or been wound down.  And we have seen some recent high-profile distributed ledger failures. A couple of weeks ago, IBM and Maersk announced the closure of their blockchain-based supply chain joint venture TradeLens. Last month, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) canceled its much-hyped blockchain project after years of delays and cost overruns. This summer blockchain-based trade finance initiative we.trade, backed by IBM and 12 major European banks, went into liquidation and B3i – a blockchain insurance venture backed by more than 20 insurers and reinsurers – ceased operation.  So, the “please, not again” discomfort at the renewed protagonism of “blockchain” potential is understandable and even healthy (inflated expectations of any sort should be kept in check) – but not necessarily correct.  Both hype and failure are a natural part of a new technology’s evolution. Remember the dot-com bubble? That wasn’t just about crazy stock valuations – it was as much about the promise of rapid societal change, with business models rewiring their engagement models and individuals flourishing in their new-found creative independence. In the early days of any radical innovation, manifesto and prophecy often get confused, and experimentation – of which failure is an integral part – is the only way to test the bounds of reality.  See also: Central Banks and Bitcoin: Closer Than You Think | Opinion  You’re probably wondering where the successes are, and that’s fair because they don’t get much attention. They’re hidden in the persistence of some projects that could have given up ages ago, in new use cases under trial, and in a changing participant profile. Distributed ledger work has been ongoing all along, but given the rapid growth of crypto markets, the “flashiness” of some participants and the gripping drama of the year so far, it has been largely overlooked. Things that move fast get more attention. Enterprise experimentation does not move fast.  Some examples: A few years ago, we got excited when a commercial bank successfully issued blockchain-based assets in pilot tests. This week a state-owned bank did the same but for real, and at least one government is almost there, while other governments and banks are testing the process with some intriguing innovations. We also have trials where the main participants are central banks. That is definitely progress.  Large traditional asset managers such as KKR, Apollo and Hamilton Lane are issuing blockchain-based tokens representing funds. Not as a proof-of-concept but for real. Just this week we learned that Vanguard Australia is using a distributed ledger for back-office settlement, Starbucks (one of the largest unregulated “banks” in the world) has launched a non-fungible token (NFT) experience in beta for its Rewards users, and Goldman Sachs as well as Germany’s music rights management society have carried out separate distributed ledger tests. Recent initiatives seem to have learned from the failures to date: start small, iterate up the ladder and never overlook human incentives.  ​There’s also an ideological battle afoot. Many in the crypto industry hate the idea of anything being “permissioned” and accuse all gated experimentation of being “useless” while overlooking regulatory restrictions and client preferences. The assumption seems to be that everyone prefers open networks, permissioned blockchains can never be based on public ones and that the potential to integrate with stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) is irrelevant.  Read more: After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto’s Founding Mission | Opinion  There’s also a strong cohort who thinks we should focus on more innovative applications since traditional markets work fine, in spite of settlement risk, gated access and a dangerous lack of transparency. More efficient and lower cost debt markets, for example, open up opportunities for a much broader demographic than big banks, possibly facilitating the development of sophisticated markets in regions currently underserved. They also make new types of products possible, such as intraday repo, enhancing liquidity in tight markets. Could this be done on traditional databases? Some of it, sure, but would that be future-proofing market evolution? Determining the answer to that is precisely what the experimentation is for.  As the dust settles on the FTX fallout, and as the crypto ecosystem takes stock of the damage and starts to heal, we can expect more prominence for enterprise blockchain milestones. This doesn’t at all mean that crypto is losing its sparkle or that asset innovation is done. Last week we saw the emergence of an intriguing new derivative that lets traders bet on the Ethereum staking yield, potentially coalescing market acceptance of a benchmark interest rate. We are also still seeing glimmers of institutional interest in crypto assets as investment. None of that will disappear.  But a time in the sun for the less-glamorous side of blockchain evolution will be good for the industry as a whole. We could well still see some ideas that strike us as fanciful, because people are people and creativity should never cease to surprise – who knows, some might even stick. But we can certainly expect more solid experimentation at senior levels.  Perhaps even more important: we have to push back on the “X not Y” mentality. The crypto ecosystem is certainly big enough by now for any number of approaches, and this industry grew on the back of permissionless innovation – it’s incongruous to see crypto enthusiasts argue that only one approach is worth any time or attention. For those who care about distributed ledger utility, there’s plenty to get excited about. For those who think there’s greater societal value in trading and saving, markets will continue to evolve and some prices will eventually recover. Many of us may be frustrated by the amount of pixels given to what we personally see as useless ideas – but we should think about what our industry would look like were one reduced group to have the power to decide what is “valid” and what isn’t.  Meanwhile, the narrative shift will act as a refreshing reminder that this industry is about much more than profits and portfolio allocations, and that the potential goes way beyond sentiment recovery, regulatory clarity and deeper understanding. “Blockchain and crypto” – there’s plenty of room for both.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | WALLET,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/13/blockchain-vs-crypto-not-what-it-seems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29543141fd0fb25389077a25347d453ac08549a3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But just before noon ET (17:00 UTC), Binance tweeted that the ""$USDC withdrawals are back online.""  The exchange had characterized the withdrawal pause as resulting from a swap transfer between the Paxos-issued Binance USD stablecoin and USDC that needed U.S. banks to be open.  Popular crypto analyst John Paul Koning speculated in a tweet that surging user withdrawals in USDC might have depleted Binance’s USDC reserves, and that it may have decided to halt withdrawals to wait for new supplies.  At press time, there are some $1.2 billion of USDC in Binance’s exchange reserves, according to blockchain data intelligence platform Nansen.  Binance delisted USDC with other stablecoins from its trading platform in September in a controversial move to consolidate trading pairs to USDT and Binance USD, the exchange’s own stablecoin issued by Paxos.  Withdrawals from Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, surged Monday amid growing concerns about its reserves at a time when investors are extremely wary about centralized exchanges given the swift collapse of rival exchange FTX. At one point Tuesday, net outflows – the difference of assets leaving and arriving to the exchange – reached $2.5 billion, Nansen data showed.

Smith added that the FTX failure is a separate event. ""FTX is a failure of a centralized institution and the management of that institution not having proper values and care for customer funds,"" she said. ""It has nothing to do with crypto networks and cryptocurrencies that fuel that network."" In the wake of the FTX ( FTT-USD ) collapse, Smith argued that the U.S. needed ""a comprehensive federal regulatory framework over the crypto markets"" because ""trust in the system is the important driver for the investors looking to invest in the crypto market."" Smith expressed hope that crypto space will receive a stronger regulatory framework once the new Congress gets sworn in on Jan. 3.

Ray III testifies before the House Financial Services Committee.  Silvergate was deeply involved with FTX before its collapse. Earlier this month, the San-Diego-based bank issued a statement saying it was the “victim of FTX’s and Alameda Research’s apparent misuse of customer assets and other lapses of judgment.”  Deposits by the crypto exchange made up nearly 10% of Silvergate’s $11.9 billion in deposits from digital asset customers, the bank disclosed in November.  Because of its relationship to the now-failed exchange, traders are looking for more answers about just how significant the collapse of FTX is for Silvergate and hope that maybe during Tuesday’s hearing, they will get more information.  “Traders don't want to hold Silvergate Capital this week as fears that any testimony from FTX could be damning,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst of the Americas at Oanda. “Lawmakers are trying to find out everything that went wrong with FTX and some of that could spill over to Silvergate. Everyone wants to know if and how Silvergate played a pivotal role in the transferring of customer funds from FTX to Alameda. Any companies with ties to FTX will likely come under tremendous scrutiny.”  Shares of Silvergate dropped to a fresh two-year low of $18.03 on Tuesday, down nearly 90% year to date and over 30% in the past month. The last time SI was trading at this price was in October 2020.  The bank recently received a letter from Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), John Kennedy (R-La.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) demanding answers over its supposed role in facilitating transfers between bankrupt exchange FTX and its sister firm, Alameda Research.

42393933,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brcSEf,1670952692,How to Become a Web3 Developer,"Whether you’re new to crypto or have been in this space for a while, you’ve inevitably run into the phrase “still early.” The phrase is reiterated by traders and builders alike, reflecting that the crypto and Web3 space is still very new.  It’s especially true for Web3 developers. At the start of 2022, a report from Electric Capital found that the majority of developers building Web3 have only been in the space for around a year. What’s even more striking is that less than 1,000 full-time developers were responsible for $100B in total value locked in smart contracts.  Nearly a year after Electric Capital’s report, those who are making the move to Web3 are still very much early. Even despite a crypto bear market, Web3 developers are continuing to build on existing architecture and develop new products. A recent report from Alchemy found that Ethereum smart contract deployment is up 40% since Q1 2022, despite ETH falling 60% in the same time period.  Whether you’re looking to take the next step in your crypto journey, inspired by Web2 to Web3 stories from the likes of Shiv Sakhuja or Varsha Mahadevan, or just looking to gain experience in an emerging field, there’s plenty of opportunity to break into Web3. In this article, we’ll take a look at the tools and steps you need to take to become a Web3 developer.  Understand the fundamentals of Web3  The first step in your journey to becoming a Web3 developer is to gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Web3. Beyond getting a grasp of what blockchain technology is and how it works, it’s important to understand the evolution of the internet and the fundamentals of Web3.  In the first iteration of the internet, also known as Web1 or the “read” era of the internet, developers built static collections of links and homepages. They could adjust pages or add new links, but the entire experience wasn’t very interactive.  Then came Web2, considered to be the “read/write” version of the internet. Web2 can be best characterized by the emergence of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. This new version of the internet was designed to be interactive, where developers create profiles and storage mechanisms for users to engage with one another.  In the Web2 world, developers are primarily focused on three main components: front end, back end and data storage. Web3 development has similar main components, but with one key difference: data ownership.  Web3 is best understood as the “read/write/own” phase of the internet. With a focus on ownership, data storage and data management is fundamentally different. Instead of focusing on storing data for a specific website or platform, Web3 developers store data on a blockchain that can be used across all connected platforms.  Web3 also emphasizes decentralization, with the goal of creating an internet that is not owned or controlled by any one individual or entity. This means that data can be accessed and shared more easily, allowing for greater collaboration and transparency. Additionally, Web3 technology allows developers to create applications and tools that can be used to build a more secure and trustless digital infrastructure. With Web3, users have much greater control over their own data, giving them more control over the way it is used.  Develop your Web3 specific skill set  As in traditional developer roles, it’s important to understand the specific skill set and languages you need to build projects. Fortunately, some Web3 projects have created instances where you can program in Web2 native languages. Near protocol, for example, has created tools to program in common languages such as Javascript. Additionally, front end development for Web3 provides a similar Web2 building experience, utilizing other familiar languages including HTML and CSS.  However, not all blockchains have built out code libraries using traditional languages. Due to the specific nature of blockchains, you’ll likely use Web3-specific languages to develop protocols and smart contracts.  One of the best languages to start learning for Web3 is Solidity, a commonly used programming language developed by the Ethereum team. Solidity is a Turing complete, object-oriented programming language that can provide you the best access to building on different chains. Beyond Ethereum, Solidity allows you to develop for any project that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that you’ll be able to build on layer 2 blockchains including Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum, as well as EVM-compatible blockchains such as Avalanche, Solana and Aurora.  The second-most popular Web3 programming language is Rust. Known for its agile design and high performance, Rust serves as the native programming language for projects like Solana, Polkadot and more. Rust is not only popular in the Web3 space, but has become increasingly popular among developers as well. Last year, a survey of Stack Overflow users found that Rust was the most favored programming language by developers.  Get involved with the community  When it comes to working in Web3, learning about developer trends and getting a developer position doesn’t always happen on places like LinkedIn or Indeed. Instead, the best way to secure a job in Web3 is to get involved in the community and stay up to date on the latest developer trends. Places such as Discord, Reddit and Telegram have active developer communities. Because the majority of Web3 technologies are open source, being active in a community will connect you with builders and users alike who are collaborating on the future of the internet.

5516401,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512315,1670950839,"PancakeSwap (CAKE) Slides Below Range, Is This An Entry Point For Buyers?","PancakeSwap (CAKE) has been trading against the broad market, especially when major market movers have rallied. The coin has lost 0.8% over the last 24 hours and still depicts no decisive price action on the chart. Despite the CPI data release, the coin has remained unaffected by that development. CAKE traders are still wary of the asset’s next price movement. The technical outlook for the coin has painted a bearish picture on the chart. Although that seems to be the case, there could be a scenario in which CAKE makes a comeback. After rangebound trading for weeks, the coin has finally broken below its lower band, indicating a chance of a price appreciation. This could prove beneficial for traders who are planning to log gains from the crypto. Risk-averse traders, however, should be careful about investing as the coin still continues to signify a further potential loss over the immediate trading sessions. The asset is still hovering around pockets of high liquidity, which could prove to be a negative point for traders. For CAKE to register further gains, the coin has to breach some vital trading levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Climbs 2.58% In 24 Hours, Can It Reach $0.1 Before The Week Runs Out? PancakeSwap Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At press time, CAKE was exchanging hands for $3.80. The coin just fell below the lower band of the restricted price zone. CAKE was sandwiched between the $4.20 and $3.90 price bands, which represented increased selling. The coin’s immediate price ceiling was $4.08; a move above that could cause the coin to revisit $4.30. Breaching the $4.30 mark will clear the path for the altcoin to reach $4.90. Over the immediate trading sessions, however, the coin is expected to fall to $3.40 before it bounces back. The aforementioned level could act as an entry point for buyers. The amount of CAKE traded in the last session remained red, signifying bearish strength. CAKE Technical Analysis The coin has remained under the power of sellers for most of this month. The recent drop in price has pushed CAKE further into the selling zone. The Relative Strength Index was below 40, indicating a strong selling force. Further selling pressure could cause CAKE to fall below $3.40 and then to $4.30, resulting in a 26% rally. CAKE fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average line due to low buyer demand, indicating that sellers were driving the price momentum at press time. Corroborating that CAKE might start to register gains, the Parabolic SAR sided with the same observation. Parabolic SAR determines the price direction, and the dotted lines below the candlesticks reflect incoming bullishness for the coin. On the contrary, though, the Awesome Oscillator that exhibits price momentum turned red, marking a sell signal for the coin. The signal was, however, declining in strength.

5514319,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564202-bitcoin-stay-away-in-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1670950166,Bitcoin: Stay Away From It In 2023,"Summary Bitcoin is different and sufficiently inferior to other investment assets in my view since I believe it neither generates any income nor has any intrinsic value behind it. It is also highly volatile and unpredictable. It might go up, given its limited supply and the likelihood central banks would eventually get dovish. It is trading sufficiently off its all-time highs. But I would still recommend conservative investors to stay away from it even if it falls further in 2023. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has no intrinsic value, in my view. That is the main point why I would not recommend buying it as a long-term investment. Although it is an interesting speculative instrument, I believe its real value is zero and it is therefore not worth buying for conservative investors. It can go up tenfold but then fall down to Earth. If you are considering buying BTC at a discount thanks to a massive correction, I would not personally recommend it. But let me explain my thesis in some more detail. Bitcoin as an investment - difference from other asset classes You might argue, indeed, that Bitcoin is not different from other asset classes. After all, everyone is buying BTC, even conservative pension funds do. The worse it is for them since they risk their clients' money. But after all, there is a risk to every investment and it is sometimes impossible to accurately predict what return a particular investment will generate. Let me consider other asset classes. Take the housing market. You are about to buy an apartment and you do not know exactly where the housing market will go next year. You take a loan to finance at least a part of your apartment buy. But you can use that apartment to live in or you can buy it to let. In the first case, it will serve yourself or your family. In the second case, you will end up getting a fixed income. An apartment is also tangible. In other words, you see what you buy, which is not the case with Bitcoin. Moreover, the housing market may collapse, and occasionally there are bubbles. Just think of the 2008-2009 collapse. However, unless there is a war or a natural disaster, your apartment's value won't fall to zero, regardless of how bad the crisis is. The value of Bitcoin, in contrast, can fall to zero. Last month, for example, the second-largest crypto exchange FTX (FTT-USD) filed for bankruptcy last month. Many cryptocurrencies fall to zero. For example, Luna's (LUNC-USD) value fell to zero and was therefore delisted from Binance (BNB-USD). You might argue that it won't happen to Bitcoin since it is a highly liquid cryptocurrency. It may not happen, of course. But there are enough risks BTC may fail the way some of its fellow cryptocurrencies did. An investment should also have intrinsic value. There is a market value to any asset, in other words, the price the buyer is willing to pay and the seller is willing to sell their asset for. However, besides that, an asset also has a true value it is really worth. Let us also take a construction company. It generates net cash flows and has some net assets (asset - liabilities) on its balance sheet. You can determine the company's intrinsic value by estimating its NPV (Net Present Value of its future net cash flows) or simply taking its net asset or book value. The company also does business, and has a reputation and a future. True, there is a possibility its financial reports may turn out to be inaccurate. Remember the Enron case. Something also can go wrong, for example, a recession might happen. But normally you know what you pay for. Bitcoin in turn has no financials at all. It does not own any assets. When you buy it, you buy unaudited and unverifiable electronic entries. Not to mention that, unlike bonds and stocks, cryptocurrencies don't generate any passive income whatsoever. You might also like to compare Bitcoin to gold, at least many media persons do. But, in my opinion, this is incorrect. I agree with the thesis that fiat money keeps losing value at a fast enough pace. Most of this actually happened due to central banks' attempts to support their economies during the COVID-19 lockdowns. But gold has been existing for thousands of years as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Crypto technologies in turn are very new. Gold can also be used as a commodity. It is still used in producing appliances but most importantly jewelry. Central banks also hold physical gold bars as their strategic reserves. Holding Bitcoins instead would have been easier and less costly but they don't do this. Instead, they have recently been buying more gold . So, gold and cryptocurrencies are different stories. Now let us consider the future of Bitcoin as money. BTC and functions of money Many analysts say that Bitcoin can effectively be used as money. But here are the functions of money : It is a medium of exchange - in other words, it has to be accepted in exchange for goods and services. It is a store of value - we save it to use later. Unit of account - we use it to measure value in economic transactions. Very well. But which one of these functions does Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency perform? To start with, we cannot use Bitcoin as a proper store of value. Why is that? Because its price is highly volatile. Let us have a look at the diagram below. It shows BTC's three-year price history. Data by YCharts In the spring of this year, Bitcoin's price was lingering around the $45,000 mark. Now it is somewhat more than $15,000. It took just about 6 months for this cryptocurrency to lose two-thirds of its value. So, it is very unreliable to keep your savings in BTC to later buy, a car or a house, for example. For this very reason I believe BTC cannot be used as a unit of account. It is very hard to put a price tag of 3 BTC on your car, for instance. It is possible, of course, but in that case your car would be worth $45,000 ($15,000 per BTC) today but $15,000 or, say, $150,000 tomorrow since Bitcoin is quite volatile unlike fiat money. It could, in fact, be used as a medium of exchange but not everyone would accept BTC as a payment for goods or services due to Bitcoin's very high volatility. Also, in some countries there are rigid rules and regulations aimed at controlling cryptocurrencies. That is because cryptocurrencies are sometimes used in shadowy transactions. Bank transfers are very easy to monitor unlike crypto payments. But I will touch this subject later on. Risks You might be thinking that I am absolutely sure the BTC would collapse in value in 2023. I do in fact accept the possibility it may not happen. One of the possible reasons for Bitcoin's COVID-19 price surge was the Fed's and many other central banks' endless money printing. Many financial institutions and private individuals were therefore left with plenty of idle cash they wanted to invest. Some of them decided to buy cryptocurrencies in order to ""hedge"" money from inflation. So, if the Fed eases its monetary policies, BTC might surge again. There is a feature of BTC that is somewhat in favor of it: namely its limited supply. Technically, only 21 million Bitcoins can be mined. However, in my view, this on its own does not make BTC a valuable investment with high intrinsic value. Another factor that can make the BTC appreciate is its legalization. For example, earlier on there were rumors a new cryptocurrency would be created in Ecuador and backed by gold to facilitate transactions across the country. The idea was not realized, however. But there is a possibility some countries might issue more lenient laws regulating Bitcoin. Some developing countries, especially the ones struggling with hyperinflation, might even legalize BTC as an alternative currency. If that happens, Bitcoin will be here to gain. However, this is highly uncertain and even unlikely. After all, many governments worry about the anonymity characteristic of BTC transactions. So, in fact it is likely many new stricter regulations will be passed in the field. Valuation As I have mentioned before, I believe Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. So, it is hard to estimate its real value the way we can do it for stocks and even ETFs. However, we can have a closer look at this cryptocurrency's price history. Data by YCharts Here is Bitcoin's 10-year price history graph above. It is, indeed, very volatile. It surged tremendously in 2020 but now it is trading down substantially. Data by YCharts As the diagram above suggests, Bitcoin is down 75% from its all-time highs. Data by YCharts Concurrently, if one had invested $10,000 10 years ago, one would have ended up with almost $294,000 now. I know how attractive this sounds. But it could well be that the bubble is bursting right now. In 2020 I wrote an article about investing in Bitcoin when the price of that cryptocurrency was surging and said it was not a good idea. But we can actually compare the ""cryptomania"" to other historical asset bubbles. I am sure everyone heard of the tulipmania happening in the Netherlands in the 17th century, the South Sea bubble and of course the Dot.com bubble in the 2000s. There are many more examples of this. But they all show that a ""trendy"" asset class is only worth as much as the market is willing to pay for it. Trendy assets are not normally worth much at all but due to many investors' enthusiasm, their prices kept surging. Asset bubbles end quite bad. A similar situation seems to be happening now. Conclusion Don't get me wrong. I appreciate crypto technologies have a future. But I do not like the idea of buying any cryptocurrency, Bitcoin included. There is a possibility it would soar to all-time highs. But eventually, in my view, it should reach its intrinsic value, zero. There is too much volatility and too much uncertainty. But it is an interesting speculative asset, by all means. If you hold Bitcoins and they have lost some of their value, you might be lucky next year if they surge. This could happen if the Fed gets more dovish. But I do not recommend buying BTC to conservative investors just because it is off its highs.

42414758,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBJgA1,1670949855,FTX CEO Warned Not to ‘Obstruct’ Bahamas Probe as He Gives Testimony,"The Bahamas securities regulator has reacted angrily to what it says are ""misstatements"" made by the chief executive of FTX, accusing John J. Ray III of obstructing an investigation into the collapsed crypto firm.  In a statement circulated as Ray gave evidence to the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, the Bahamas Securities Commission said Ray was interested in headline grabbing rather than cooperating as a dispute over rival bankruptcy proceedings deepens.  “Key misstatements made by John J Ray III … do not appear to be concerned with facts but rather, appear intended only to make headlines and advance questionable agendas,” the regulator said in a statement.  Filings “were designed to create a false impression” of communications between former FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried and the Commission, the statement added.  A court filing made on Monday by FTX says that “Bankman-Fried and [co-founder Gary] Wang were in close and frequent contact with the Commission and the Attorney General throughout the week” of the crypto company’s collapse in early November. The filing by FTX cites an email sent to Attorney General Ryan Pinder in which Bankman-Fried said he would allow Bahamians to withdraw assets.  Ray’s filings “continue to wrongfully confuse” the Bahamas government, Commission and court-approved liquidators, the Commission’s media statement said.  “The Securities Commission continues to conduct a comprehensive and diligent investigation into the causes of FTX’s failure,” it added. “Unfortunately, it has been necessary for the Securities Commission to make a request to Mr. Ray’s representatives to not obstruct that investigation. Mr. Ray has not once reached out to the Securities Commission to discuss any of his concerns before airing them publicly.”  Lawyers are locked in a dispute over how to wind down Bankman-Fried’s sprawling empire, with Bahamian officials and former staffers demanding access to FTX IT systems, and saying that Bahamas villas purchased for FTX staff had been wrongfully included in Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearings begun in Delaware on Nov. 11.  On Monday, Pinder confirmed he had ordered Bankman-Fried’s arrest at the request of the U.S. authorities. On Tuesday, parallel charges were laid against the former chief executive by the U.S. Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

42414742,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBJfTZ,1670949477,"With Founder Facing Charges, New CEO Says FTX Embezzled Customer Cash","John Ray III, FTX's replacement CEO now steering the company through bankruptcy, told lawmakers on Tuesday that misdeeds inside the crypto giant weren't like the sophisticated, highly orchestrated crimes he encountered when taking apart Enron two decades ago.  ""This is really old-fashioned embezzlement,"" he said in testimony before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. ""This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose. Not sophisticated at all.""  If there was complexity, he said, it was in the way the senior managers ""were able to sort of hide it from people, frankly right in front of their eyes.""  When pressed about whether founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had committed crimes, he hesitated.  ""We're trying not to lay judgment or put labels on actions,"" he said, adding that his primary job was finding money for those who were harmed. ""Obviously there's been failure here of massive proportion. Ultimately I think others will judge him by his actions.""  As Ray picks through the wreckage of the company Bankman-Fried drove spectacularly into the ground, the former CEO was arrested in the Bahamas and is facing U.S. criminal charges as well as enforcement actions from regulators. Against that backdrop, Ray testified in the hearing that was supposed to include Bankman-Fried, telling the panel that a group of untrained executives with no interest in safe corporate practices was responsible for gathering billions of dollars from customers and investors.  Despite repeated public assurances from Bankman-Fried, the distinctions between crypto exchange FTX US and its international sibling were no more than superficial, Ray said.  “What we’re seeing now is that the crypto assets for both FTX.com and for FTX US were housed in the same database,"" Ray said in his testimony. He indicated the assets were “all housed in the same web format” at Amazon Web Services.  Ray, who performed the same task when Enron fell into ruin, said the dysfunction at FTX was longstanding. There was no independent board and no coherent record keeping, he said.  “This is not something that happened overnight or within the course of a week,” he said, describing “absolutely no internal controls, whatsoever.”  “Employees would communicate invoicing and expenses on Slack,"" he said, referring to the communications app. And he said the team used the off-the-shelf accounting software QuickBooks. ""Nothing against Quickbooks. It's a very nice tool – just not for a multi-billion-dollar company.”  Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) exhibited frustration against the law enforcement authorities’ timing, which robbed her of a chance to question Bankman-Fried at the hearing. He’d planned to testify remotely from his island home, until news emerged late Monday that local authorities had taken him into custody to face U.S. charges of conspiracy and fraud revealed early Tuesday.  “Unfortunately, the timing of his arrest denies the public the opportunity to get the answers they deserve,” Waters said.  With testimony from Ray, the formal actions from regulators detailing wrongdoing inside FTX’s “house of cards” and the U.S. criminal case, Tuesday marks the first full view into what happened inside of FTX, without the filter of its fallen leader, Bankman-Fried.  Up to hours before his arrest, the former CEO has barely stopped talking publicly with journalists and other industry figures, even after resigning from the company. Among his arguments was that the U.S. arm of the company was separate from global exchange, FTX.com.  Ray said some pieces of the company in Japan and the U.S.-regulated derivatives-trading subsidiary known as LedgerX were ""sort of distinct"" from the rest of the company.  ""Ultimately, we will look to sell LedgerX and put it in the hands of a good steward,"" he said.  But he confirmed that money, including customer funds, flowed freely between FTX and Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research. And he's investigating the massive loans made to FTX insiders including Bankman-Fried.  ""In one instance he signed as both the issuer of the loan as well as the recipient of the loan,"" Ray said.  Ray said the recent efforts have recovered more than a billion in crypto assets so far for creditors, though the company may have lost more than $7 billion. He also suggested that it may not be easy to isolate the former management from the company's assets.  ""Are there wallets that we don't know about? Certainly that is the potential,"" he said. ""What we don't know is whether or not the founders could have taken crypto and put it in a cold wallet that we just don't have awareness of. And if they did, hopefully we can trace that.""  He agreed with lawmaker suggestions that Bankman-Fried and others had already undermined the U.S. bankruptcy process when they aided authorities in The Bahamas to grab a considerable share of remaining FTX assets.  “I'm so deeply troubled to learn how common it was for Bankman-Fried and FTX employees to steal from the cookie jar of customer funds to finance their lavish lifestyles,” Waters said.  The panel’s ranking Republican, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who will lead the committee in the next congressional session, hewed to his party’s common argument on the FTX case:  ""We have to separate out the bad actions of an individual from the good created by an industry and an innovation,"" McHenry said.  Ray characterized the mess at FTX as ""really unprecedented.""  ""Even in the most failed companies, you have a fair road map of what happened,"" he said. ""We're dealing with literally sort of a paperless bankruptcy in terms of how they created this company. It makes it very difficult to trace and track assets, particularly as I've said, in the crypto world.""  The chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission had said at another recent congressional hearing that as many as 2% of the global company's customers were from the U.S., though the platform wasn't supposed to allow U.S. users.  ""We found that there's a small number of U.S. customers that engaged,"" Ray confirmed on Tuesday. He said it seems ""less than a couple hundred"" individuals, though he hasn't yet identified the scale of their holdings.  Read More: 10 Questions for FTX CEO John J.

42388446,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRGSeZ,1670948658,$1.6B FTX International Customers Group Hires Law Firm to Create Official Bankruptcy Committee,"A growing group of non-U.S. customers of FTX.com, which currently counts up to around $1.6 billion in lost funds, has lawyered up and is looking to create an official customer committee in order to protect their rights of ownership over their assets on the exchange.  The non-U.S. FTX customers, led by Eversheds Sutherland attorneys Sarah Paul and Erin Broderick, had already formed the first FTX ad hoc group. As an official committee it would be granted additional consultation and approval rights within the Chapter 11 case,including beingentitled to payment of professional fees by the bankruptcy estates.  After FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a widely reported shortfall of as much as $8 billion, a primary task for non-U.S. customers of the exchange is to establish that funds removed from customer accounts and transferred to other FTX-affiliated entities, such as Alameda Research, are not the property of FTX’s bankruptcy estate.  Establishing this would mean the money from these customer accounts should not be distributed to all creditors, as per the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but rather belong to the account-holding customers, explained Broderick, a cross-border restructuring attorney with experience in crypto bankruptcy cases, including failed exchange Mt. Gox.  “The rights of the non-U.S. customers and why they’re differently situated is really important,” said Paul, a former federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. “First, there is an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the non-U.S. customers and the creditors of the other silos. The starkest example of that is the transfer of the $10 billion to Alameda from FTX.com. The terms of service situate the assets differently, as customer funds, as opposed to property of the estate.”  Despite the confusion over the collapse of FTX and the actions of its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who was arrested on Monday in the Bahamas, there are certain aspects of the bankruptcy that are more straightforward than, say, Celsius Network, the bankrupt lending platform that has spawned a number of ad hoc customer groups.  “In comparison with Celsius, which had an Earn program where customers transferred the rights and title of their crypto assets to Celsius, here for the non-U.S. customers, there were just the terms and service that are governed by English law,” Paul added.  Certain FTX customers did enter into margin trading or other arrangements that gave the FTX debtors a “legal or equitable” interest in such property, noted Broderick. However, it has been reported that the customer assets subject to these arrangements made up a small portion of the total $16 billion in volume trading at the time, she said.  Those specific customer assets may be the property of the estate, although there are arguments to the contrary, but this misses the point and confuses two separate issues, Broderick added.  “It is undisputed that $10 billion of the $16 billion in customer funds on the FTX.com exchange was transferred to Alameda,” Broderick said via email. “Whether the customer assets were fraudulently transferred to satisfy Alameda’s liabilities or whether the transfers are just one piece of a Ponzi scheme remains to be seen, but it doesn’t change the fact the FTX.com customers have a greater legal and equitable right to the return of their own property or the value thereof before it is distributed out to other creditors or used or sold by the debtors without the protection of their interests.”  Read more: The FTX Downfall: Full Coverage",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/13/16b-ftx-international-customers-group-hires-law-firm-to-create-official-bankruptcy-committee,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a3584340d8d93b4e9ae132a13f86ecb241f618a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chiliz operates Socios.com where fans can buy Fan Tokens to interact with their favorite teams. Fan Tokens have done over $100 billion in sales volume. Produced in collaboration with Avi Gilburt and Ryan Wilday This past summer, we published a series entitled “3 Alts With Setups for Higher Highs In the Next Bull Cycle in Crypto,” linked below: 3 Alts With Setups For Higher Highs (Binance Coin) (Cryptocurrency:BNB-USD) 3 Alts With Setups For Higher Highs (Part 2, Matic/Polygon) (Private:MATIC) 3 Alts With Setups For The Next Crypto Bull Cycle (Part 3, Aave) (Cryptocurrency:AAVE-USD) While crypto has yet to take off clearly in the next bull cycle, Binance and Matic have held up particularly well amidst the deeper declines and collapse of FTX that has rocked the crypto world. Specifically (as of writing), BNB is down 1.67% from the respective aforementioned article’s publication and MATIC is up a whopping 74.4%. AAVE, on the other hand, has not held up so well (down 36% from publication), and the larger thesis presented in the August article has certainly become questionable. In this article today, we will present Chiliz (CHZ-USD). Among all of the cryptos we have tracked in 2022, this coin has been one of the top performers and it appears to be one of the best prospects for 2022. CHZ has strongly outperformed BTC (BTC-USED) and ETH since its 2022 low struck in June. As of writing, CHZ is up roughly 70% as compared to BTC which is down about 3% and ETH up 42% over the same period. Chiliz describes itself as “The world’s leading blockchain fintech provider for sports and entertainment.” CHZ is a utility token for use in the Socios.com ecosystem to connect sports fans with their favorite teams. CHZ can be used for the acquisition of Fan Tokens that have a range of use, from accessing VIP rewards and exclusive promotions, to participation in games and chat forums. Socios and Chiliz offer a whole new means for sports teams, leagues, and entertainment companies to monetize a variety of novel offerings. The adoption to Chiliz has been large, as Socios has partnership deals with several dozen professional sports teams globally. And regarding fan participation, Fan Tokens have done over $100Billion in sales volume. source: Fan Token Global Sales Volume Index / CryptoSlam! “Socios has made fan tokens for some of the world’s biggest soccer teams, including FC Barcelona, Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, and Juventus, in which token owners get exclusive access to rewards and in-person experiences.” ( here ) From a technical perspective CHZ Daily Chart CHZ Daily Chart (Jason Appel (Crypto Waves)) CHZ has a potential large degree Impulse forming from its 2019 low. As per Elliott Wave Theory, an Impulse is a 5 wave trending move in which waves 1, 3, and 5 advance price in the direction of the trend, and are themselves composed of their own smaller-degree 5 wave moves. Waves 2 and 4 correct or consolidate a portion of the previous wave’s advance. Wave 3 is typically the longest wave, and if not the longest, it must not be the shortest of waves 1, 3, and 5. Also, the wave 4 retrace of wave 3 cannot overlap into wave 1 territory. In practical application of Elliott Wave, it’s quite important that wave 4 does not make a sustained retracement of more than 50% of wave 3. While a prolonged break beneath the 50% retrace does not constitute an invalidation of the impulsive potential, it often is early warning as once the 50% retrace is broken, upside follow through loses reasonable reliability. Let’s review the price action and wave structures for CHZ from the 2019 low: CHZ 2019-2021 Chart (Jason Appel (Crypto Waves)) CHZ 2019-2021 There’s an initial 5 wave Impulse as a very vertical rally (when viewed on the daily candlestick timeframe) into the November 2019 high, wave (1). This was followed by a very protracted and deep pullback into the March 2020 low, wave (2). And while the March low came very close to the 2019 low, CHZ did manage to hold a higher low in price for a valid (2). From the March 2020 low, a huge rally developed with a very vertical final portion in the last week of the rally into all time highs during early March 2021. Regarding the subwave count of wave (3) shown in the 2019-2021 chart: One important aspect of Elliott Wave to note is that, as an analysis tool, if properly applied, it provides probabilistic predictions for movements in price. It does not, however, provide reliable timing perspectives. This is particularly salient on this chart’s wave (3), in which CHZ developed very sufficient extensions in the subwaves of (3) with regard to price, but with such vertical moves that did not offer any pullbacks, the individual subwave structures are quite condensed in time. As mentioned before, a wave (4) within an impulse ideally needs to maintain above the 50% retrace of wave (3). The 2022 low, struck in June, certainly satisfied that condition, bottoming just a bit beneath the 38.2% standard wave (4) retrace. However, this is insufficient for a confident perspective that price will recover and turn up once more for a higher high in wave (5). In order for additional confidence that the selloff is in hindsight, price needs an initial 5 waves up sufficient in size for wave 1 of (5). Unlike many cryptos which just have spiraled down from their 2021 all-time highs, CHZ has struck a bottom (at least an interim bottom) above the 50% retrace of (3) and has subsequently produced a clear 5 wave rally. After an initial 5 up for a wave 1, expectations are for wave 2 to produce a corrective pullback to retrace between 38.2%-61.8% of the preceding rally. This range, known as our standard wave 2 support region, is between $0.13-$0.175 on CHZ. CHZ June-Dec 2022 (Jason Appel (Crypto Waves)) CHZ June-December 2022 The standard wave 2 support region is an attractive region for long entries to accumulate positions, as it offers a clearly defined setup with maximal risk/reward within an overall sound technical thesis. At the micro level, this pullback appears to be very full within its smaller degree wave structure, which suggests that the downside is nearing potential completion. So long as price is maintaining above the .618 retrace, $0.13 the upside potential as displayed remains a confident setup. While technically valid, a sustained break below the .618 retrace starts to raise questions about the primary thesis, and below the .764 retrace, roughly $0.10 will start to favor the potential of invalidation of the thesis. Official invalidation comes with a break beneath the June low, roughly $0.08. Initial resistance to the upside is $0.175, and exceeding that level provides initial evidence of a potential low in place for wave 2. Larger resistance to the upside is $0.33 (the March 2022 high), and once that is resoundingly cleared (assuming that occurs), we will have strong confidence of price heading up to the larger Fibonacci target region for wave (5), which is $1.30+. Considering price currently in wave 2 standard Fibonacci support (at $0.1495 as of writing), the overall setup and risk/reward offers an attractive entry opportunity here for those inclined towards the upside thesis.",POSITIVE,BTC | BNB | CHZ,BTC | ICO | TRADING | BNB | CHZ,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564188-chiliz-setting-up-for-bullish-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5512374.jpeg

Ray III, the newly appointed CEO of the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ), testified Tuesday in front of the House Financial Services Committee saying the implosion of the once-mighty firm ""stems from greatly inexperienced individuals,"" namely pointing to founder and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. When asked whether FTX had adequate risk management systems and controls, Ray said ""there were virtually no internal controls [or record keeping] and no separateness whatsoever"" in terms of how funds across SBF's empire were linked. FTX and Alameda, the trading firm that was around 90% owned by SBF, ""operated as one company"" despite the fact that they're entirely different businesses, Ray said. FTX reportedly loaned out over half of its customer assets to Alameda to fund risky financial bets. He also touched on SBF's previously disclosed $1B loan he personally received from Alameda. The former CEO was said to have received a number of loans, having signed as both the issuer and recipient of one loan, in particular. Ray noted he's still examining how the loans were used. Ray, who oversaw the liquidation of Enron, said his team has so far secured more than $1B in digital assets in an ongoing process that ""will take weeks if not months to secure all the assets"" to cold wallets in secure places. Nevertheless, the commingling of funds across SBF's empire as well as the lack of documentation (including a full list of staffers and bank accounts) is making it difficult to track and trace assets, he said. ""We're dealing with literally a paperless bankruptcy."" He suggested records and controls are needed and ""you need to segregate people's money,"" Ray said when asked what he thinks needs to be done to safeguard customers of crypto trading platforms. Updated at 2:00 p.m. ET: Hearing ended. Update at 12:48 p.m. ET: Ray raised prospects that U.S. customers might eventually get repaid, while international customers are expected to lose their money for good. Update at 12:28 p.m. ET: FTX US, the American division of FTX, is clearly not ""solvent,"" Ray said. But SBF still claims that ""FTX US has been and remains solvent, and could pay off all of its customers in full tomorrow,"" according to his prepared testimony to Congress. Update at 12:04 p.m. ET: FTX was ""uniquely positioned to fail,"" Ray said in describing the firm's failure of implementing basic security controls. The ""lack of discipline on control of the wallets, the storage of passwords, allowing multiple users to set up accounts, almost created an environment where there's not a complete inventory of wallets."" Update at 11:41 a.m. ET: With $8B of customer money lost, ""by definition, I don't trust a single piece of paper within this organization,"" Ray said. This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

Despite share price plunge, investors still quite negative. Crypto collapse may result in capital raise next year. About a month ago, I detailed how new lows seemed possible for shares of cryptocurrency platform Coinbase ( COIN ). With peer in the space FTX (FTT-USD) seeing its main token crash eventually resulting in FTX filing for bankruptcy, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other coins saw their prices drop considerably. While one might expect that bears might have taken a victory lap and cashed in their profits when it came to Coinbase, recent data shows that the naysayers are still looking for more downside. I covered the initial surge for short interest in Coinbase back in late June, as in just a month and half the number of shares short had surged from 9.5 million to over 31.4 million. 2022 started at just over 3.5 million shares short, but one might have expected to see some rise in short interest as the share price started to fall. Well, as we get ready to finish out the year, a new wave of bears joined the party, as the chart below shows the end of November update. Coinbase Shares Short (NASDAQ) At the end of last month, a little under 37.5 million shares were short, which itself is a new high, and is up about 969% for the year. Even though the stock's float has risen in the low double digits percentage wise since late June, the percentage of float short has ticked up a couple of percentage points to over 25.3%. According to finviz data, of the 832 stocks with a market cap of at least $9 billion at the end of last week, Coinbase was in the top 10 names in terms of percentage of float short. The interesting part here is that the dollar value of shares short hasn't changed that much in the last month. At the end of October, that figure was $1.745 billion, but it was only down to $1.714 billion at the end of November. That's despite a more than $20 decline in the stock, which if short interest had remained constant, would have meant a large drop in the dollar value of short bets. As a point of reference, there's about $80 million more being bet against the stock now than at my June update on short interest, which tells you that investors are still looking for more downside despite the name being close to new lows at the end of last month. The drama at FTX certainly added a new chapter to the cryptocurrency story. Earlier this year, Coinbase revenue estimates were coming down as many coins dropped in price. This was because investors were trading less and were holding less assets on the platform. At that point, there was still a lot of faith in the crypto story overall, but recent events have shaken that confidence quite a bit. It will be interesting to see how Coinbase's asset base finishes the year, and to see how much trading volumes fell after the FTX fiasco. In the table below, I've detailed how Coinbase revenue estimates have dropped since late June. Coinbase Revenue Estimates (Seeking Alpha) As we were set to finish Q2 this year, analysts thought that Q4 would be the last quarter to see revenues lower than they were in the prior year period. Now, analysts think we'll see revenue declines through the first half of 2023. These Street averages may still have room to go down, as some of the high estimates seem pretty optimistic currently. That might just be a case of a certain analyst not yet updating their numbers, especially when it comes to the back half of next year. In my previous article, I thought that new lows for Coinbase shares were possible, and we have definitely gotten to that point. Shares fell below $40 for the first time on Monday before rebounding a little. Still, I've kept talking about the street remaining quite positive, as the average price target is still over $72 a share. Of course, that average is down about $20 since the company's Q3 report, and well off its spring 2021 all-time high of more than $500. This is certainly one of the names this year where analysts have been quite late, only cutting their targets after the stock takes another leg down. With revenues dropping a bit in recent quarters, Coinbase has started to rack up some large net losses. This has resulted in quite a bit of cash burn, which has weakened the balance sheet. At the end of last year, the company had over $7.1 billion of cash, or more than $3.7 billion when excluding debt. When the September quarter came to a close, the cash balance was down to just $5 billion, or about $1.6 billion net of debt. A few more bad quarters like this could easily result in a capital raise to bring in some fresh funds to solidify the financial situation here. In the end, Coinbase shares have fallen to lows, and short sellers as a whole are not exactly rushing to take large profits just yet. At the end of November, the number of shares short was at a new high for the stock, with the dollar value of these negative bets being close to its peak as well. With the FTX collapse hurting the entire crypto space, Coinbase revenue estimates are dropping considerably, and a capital raise might be needed if large losses and cash burn continue.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564181-coinbase-short-interest-hits-new-high?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5511430.jpeg

Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas Monday, just hours before he was scheduled to testify virtually before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in Washington, D.C.  Smith said on CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” program on Monday that the industry can “get beyond this current crisis.” What is needed is to work with a “bipartisan set of policymakers who are interested in finding the right regulatory framework” for crypto, not only to protect consumers but to drive innovation.  Read more: FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Arrested in the Bahamas  “We're going to see a number of bipartisan legislative proposals that are put forth that are going to be very much vetted and debated by multiple committees in Congress, and that we really could see some momentum around getting some legislation done,” Smith said.  “What we don’t want them doing is rushing through legislation that hasn’t been vetted or that nobody understands,” Smith said. She said now is the time for lawmakers to ask questions to get to the bottom of what happened at FTX, especially what happened to the customer funds that were lost in the shuffle.

As the broader market secures upward price movement, most altcoins have followed suit. The release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is an important measure of inflation, showed that U.S. inflation had slowed to 7.1%, down from 7.7% in the past month, as depicted by the numbers released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data has revealed that consumer inflation has fallen, pushing stock futures to rise. Owing to this report, the crypto market has also shown signs of recovery. Solana, for instance, had been consolidating for the past few weeks; at press time, however, it has been eyeing a breakout on the upside. The technical outlook for the coin has begun to favor the bulls, indicating accumulation on the chart. As demand for the altcoin is making a recovery, buyers have started to show interest in the chart. Over the last week, the coin lost 1.6%, and the daily gains have managed to undo most of the coin’s loss. The market capitalization of Solana has also noted an increase, denoting bullish power in the market. It is, however, important for SOL to cross a couple of price barriers in order to continue its upward price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Reclaims ATH, Return Of Conviction? Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was changing hands at $13.80 at the time of writing. The coin has been making intra-day gains after the U.S. CPI data release. The overhead resistance for Solana now awaits at $15, breaching which the coin could move over the $20 mark. Although buying strength needs to remain consistent in the market, a price pullback scenario is unlikely but not impossible, in which SOL would slip to $12 and then to $10. The amount of Solana traded in the last session demonstrated bullish strength, indicating increased buyers on the chart. Technical Analysis The price of the asset has depicted congestion for several weeks now. It has been trading along a descending trendline, but Solana price awaits a breakout now. If that happens, SOL will rise above the $23 price zone. This would mean a 64% price appreciation for the coin. The Relative Strength Index shot past the 40-mark and inched closer to the half-line, which depicted a considerable rise in buying strength. The indicator even formed a bullish divergence which usually reflects a rise in buying strength. In regards to the increase in accumulation, SOL moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, meaning that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Solana depicted buy signal on the one-day chart | Source: SOLUSD on TradingView In correspondence with more buyers, SOL logged buy signals on the chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which measures price momentum, underwent a bullish crossover. This is good news for buyers, as it acts as an entry point for them to secure gains.

42388452,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRGT6d,1670944955,Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Discount Reaches Record 50%,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares hit a record-high discount rate relative to the price of bitcoin (BTC), pushing past 50% for the first time after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reiterated its reasons for denying an application to convert the world’s largest bitcoin fund into an exchange-traded fund.  Crypto analysts have said that the discount would likely close if the conversion went through, since the redemption process available for ETF market makers would likely cause the shares to trade back toward the price of the underlying bitcoin.  In the past couple hours, the discount has since pulled back slightly to around 48.66%.  GBTC, which is managed by Grayscale Investments, was designed as a way to let investors in traditional markets gain exposure to bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency. The fund currently has about $10.7 billion of assets under management, a figure that’s down 65% over the past 12 months thanks largely to this year’s steep decline in crypto prices.  The fund is trading at a discount partly because investors, while free to sell GBTC shares in the market, have no way to redeem their holdings in exchange for the bitcoin in the trust. And in the meantime they’re being charged a 2% fee.  Negative sentiment surrounding the trust has swelled over the last few weeks as fears surfaced that crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), might file for bankruptcy.  Grayscale says it’s operating as business as usual, but analysts and Twitter posters have suggested that any financial ramifications for DCG might somehow, at some point, affect GBTC. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of DCG.)  Pablo Jodar, a crypto analyst at GenTwo, a financial service provider, said that some “investors do not trust the information that Grayscale discloses about the quantity of bitcoin that they’re holding, which contributes to selling pressure.”  He also said that a recent spate of deposit withdrawals from the big crypto exchange Binance may have dampened market sentiment. “The market is not trusting intermediaries anymore, and that is why you see investors moving money out of exchanges and financial instruments like GBTC,” he added.  Grayscale is currently being sued by hedge fund Fir Tree to obtain details about GBTC in order to investigate potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest. The firm said it wants Grayscale to resume redemptions and cut its 2% fees for the trust.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/13/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-reaches-record-50,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73e12f60ad314f48814bc4381f03074011d8cf63-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407246,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJwcz,1670944646,Japan Was the Safest Place to Be an FTX Customer,"FTX was a massive hydra with subsidiaries across the globe. Amid FTX’s failure and entrance into bankruptcy court, one of these subsidiaries appears to be relatively unscathed: FTX Japan. Assuming FTX Japan makes it through, here are some things that other nations can learn from Japan’s experience.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.  FTX Japan is a Japanese-based crypto exchange, formerly known as Liquid, that Bahamas-based FTX purchased in early 2022. Whereas the customers of most FTX entities are in limbo, FTX Japan says that it is close to paying out its customers in full:  ""We have put together a plan for the resumption of withdrawal service, which has been shared with and approved by the new FTX Trading management team. Development work for this plan has already started and our engineering teams are working to allow FTX Japan users to withdraw their funds.""  Japanese customers' cash and crypto will not be bogged down in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings given ""how these assets are held and property interests under Japanese law,"" the exchange says. Meanwhile, the funds of customers of the flagship Bahamas-based exchange, FTX International; Chicago-based FTX US; and FTX Australia remain stuck in bankruptcy limbo.  What is it about Japan that may end up allowing Japanese customers of FTX to get their money before anyone else?  In brief, careful regulation of crypto exchanges.  Spurred by the failure of Mt. Gox in 2014 and the 2017 hacking of Coincheck, both Tokyo-based exchanges, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) established a broad set of standards for crypto exchanges, or what it defines as Crypto Asset Exchange Service Providers (CAESP). The FSA is also responsible for overseeing banking, securities and exchanges, and insurance sectors.  Read more: JP Koning – Let's Stop Regulating Crypto Exchanges Like Western Union  Here are six key elements of the FSA's framework for overseeing crypto exchanges:  1. Japanese crypto exchanges must segregate customer fiat and crypto from the exchange's own crypto. That is, they can't deposit the exchange's own operating funds into the same account, or wallet, as their customers' funds.  A separation of funds reduces the scope for fraud. For example, it would have been easier for FTX executives based in the Bahamas to raid customer funds held at their Japanese subsidiary if those funds were mingled together with FTX's corporate money.  2. Going beyond segregation, Japanese exchanges must entrust customers' fiat money balances to a third-party Japanese institution – a trust company or bank trust – where they are managed by a trustee with customers designated as the beneficiaries.  By interposing a third-party trustee between FTX Japan and its customers, regulators would have reduced the latitude for FTX insiders to tamper with Japanese customers' cash.  Another advantage of a trust requirement is that it adds a layer of protection in the event of bankruptcy. Storing customers' funds with a third-party trustee prevents them from being diverted into a general pot where they can be claimed by an exchange's other competing creditors.  Other countries are less stringent. Take the U.S., for instance. U.S. exchanges, including FTX US, operate under state money transmitter law. While some states do require money transmitters to keep customer funds in a trust but many don't, including Florida, Pennsylvania and Georgia. This lack of a trust company layer may be one reason why FTX US customers haven’t heard a peep about getting their money back.  FTX Japan claims to be holding 6.03 billion yen worth of customer fiat in trust, or US$44 million.  3. A more explicit bankruptcy protection stipulates that customers of Japanese exchanges are entitled to receive payment in priority to general creditors in the case of bankruptcy.  Customers are creditors of an exchange. They own an exchange-issued IOU. But a crypto exchange may have other creditors including bond holders, bank lenders, suppliers or other subsidiaries holding inter-company debts. When an exchange goes under, all of these IOU owners are desperate to get some of the remaining crumbs. Putting customers at the very front of the line of creditors is a way to protect them.  Compare the luxury of being a Japanese customer of FTX to the plight of Australian customers of FTX. To their horror, they recently found themselves competing with the parent company, FTX Trading, for part of the Australian bankruptcy estate.  4. The FSA requires Japanese exchanges to keep at least 95% of customers' crypto in cold wallets. Because cold wallets are not connected to the internet, they are more secure against hacking and internal fraudsters.  FTX Japan claims it currently holds 3,194 bitcoin (BTC) in cold wallets, as well as 16,418 in ether (ETH), 64.1 million XRP and a handful of other assets.  Many exchanges in unregulated jurisdictions already use cold wallets (although probably not for 95% of their customers' funds). However, smaller exchanges may use other exchanges such as FTX to store customer funds rather than their own cold wallets.  Australian exchange Digital Surge, with around 30,000 customers, recently entered into voluntary administration because it kept a significant amount of money on FTX. Huobi lost $13.2 million worth of customer funds that it had stored on FTX, while Crypto.com had $10 million in exposure.  Japan’s 95% cold wallet rule helps protect against such losses, as does the following 5% rule:  5. For the 5% of customer's crypto that can be kept in a less-secure hot [internet connected] wallet, Japanese exchanges must ""back"" each unit of hot-walleted crypto with exchange-owned crypto held in a segregated cold wallet. So, for example, if an exchange holds 5 BTC of customer funds in a hot wallet, it must hold another 5 BTC of its own personal coins in reserve, for a total of 10 BTC.  The FSA refers to these reserves as an exchange's performance-guarantee assets. If there are any inappropriate leakages from hot wallets, the exchange's reserve must be used to make customers whole.  6. Lastly, all of these rigid requirements must be verified by an external watchdog.  Each Japanese exchange must undergo a yearly ""audit of separate management"" whereby a public accountant examines that each of the above requirements for holding assets are abided by. That is, the auditor verifies that all customer fiat money is being held in trust, that customer funds are segregated from exchange funds, that at least 95% of all crypto is held in a cold wallet and that the exchange is holding an appropriate amount of performance guarantee assets.  FTX Japan customers haven't received their funds back yet. So we don't know for sure if they’ll be made whole. But initial indications suggest they will be. If so, credit goes to the six preceding protections afforded to customers of Japanese exchanges.  In response to FTX's failure, many jurisdictions are already scrambling to fashion their own regulations for crypto exchanges. They should be watching Japan closely.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/13/japan-was-the-safest-place-to-be-an-ftx-customer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b215aa8c0ab767f69a7af5ddca776b32cb130249-5911x3941.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407239,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJwFq,1670944458,How Crypto Can Avoid the Next FTX,"The sudden implosion of FTX was a dark moment for crypto. But it’s also an opportunity to shine a light on some of the crypto industry’s worst practices. What we know about Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire is startling, and the situation gets bleaker with every new disclosure.  FTX is likely an outlier in terms of mismanagement and apparent fraud within the industry. But the exchange, ​​once a paragon of trust in this industry, is also emblematic of what can go wrong when crypto strays too far from its founding principles. Its downfall is thus an act of creative destruction – and a path forward is becoming clear.  Shlomit Azgad-Tromer and renowned cryptographer Matthew D. Green are co-founders of Sealance, a blockchain-based trust platform for cryptocurrencies. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.  Crypto’s untamed reputation has limited its ability to grow (perhaps seen by the fact that this year’s contagion event didn't affect the wider financial system). For better or worse, the collapse of some of crypto’s most august institutions make it all but inevitable that new consumer protection and financial stability legislation will soon be coming down the pipeline.  Rather than waiting for regulators to write rules that may not be effective, the industry should harness existing cryptographic tools to enforce compliance and demonstrate good faith. These technologies can ensure that users and regulators can continuously audit the health of various financial entities to prevent trouble before it manifests.  Were controls like these adopted earlier, as they were in many decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols, the recent plague of illiquidity among centralized cryptocurrency firms could have been avoided.  Read more: Ethereum Scaling Platform zkSync v2 Goes Live Amid Controversy  Just look at FTX. At the most basic level, the company collapsed because of a mismatch between its assets and liabilities. The assets it had were mostly the FTT tokens it created. Blockchain technology could be configured to impose limits on such self-dealing by enforcing and maintaining programmable policies that prevent the overreliance on any one token. Yet instead of using the tools already in their toolbox, industry participants were allowed to cut backroom deals, rehypothecate funds and hide worrying information from their balance sheets.  Blockchains, being fully auditable, can offer a window into a company's or project’s economic health. But this alone is not enough. Perhaps attempting to allay investor concerns, several exchanges have published so-called ""proof-of-reserves."" This is a step in the right direction, but also a false sense of security. Unfortunately, asset transparency offers no information about liabilities, thus falling short of true financial stability enforcement. And that doesn’t even get into the security concerns revealing information like this may present.  Blockchain-based technology could solve this, too, by mathematically ensuring that appropriate funds are locked up and that asset/debt ratios remain within acceptable limits. Zero-knowledge proofs, a tried-and-true method by which one individual can prove to a counterparty that a given statement is true without relaying unnecessary information, completes the picture. Privacy-preserving audits can enable outsiders to monitor exchange assets and their resilience in the face of adverse scenarios.  There is urgency for the industry to get this right and do so quickly. After all, using blockchain technology for financial compliance would be more efficient and much less costly than comparable compliance costs in banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), for one, has reported in the past that one in six of its employees works on regulatory compliance.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollup Race: What is a ‘True’ zkEVM?  Regulation isn't only costly and potentially harmful for innovation, but also limited in its effectiveness. For example, in 2017, we learned that over the course of 15 years, thousands of Wells Fargo (WFC) employees had falsified bank records, forged customer signatures and illegally transferred depositor funds. Yet during this period, Wells Fargo was subject to an increasingly intense regulatory regime.  While what regulation looks like is ultimately up to policymakers, they could consider using blockchain technology to create a certification standard that meets these lawmakers’ criteria. Crypto firms in compliance with this tech-forward standard would be able to declare and prove it to their users and investors. Those entities that ignore this standard would also be known, and their users would be aware of their heightened risk.  Crypto’s recent crises are disappointing, but they were also avoidable. We can use blockchain technology to prevent similar issues down the road, while at the same time enforcing compliance and inspiring market confidence. But without a course correction, the next domino to fall could be the one that cements perceptions and keeps crypto from fulfilling its promise of creating a more just, resilient and accountable economic system.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,"Shlomit  Azgad-Tromer, Matthew Green",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/13/ftx-collapse-cryptocurrency-failures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31722630d3d2eb271cf2a69ee9c4c46f0e4f8f81-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407240,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJwJ9,1670944330,Cryptocurrencies: A Necessary Scam?,"For a few years, I’ve been thinking about why social movements like crypto and bitcoin have so much momentum. I often get emails from proponents of crypto as an anti-monopoly tool, and a lot of smart people I respect believe that it is based on a groundbreaking technology that will sweep the world. I don’t see it that way. I think it’s a social movement based on a dangerous get-rich-quick scam. But there’s a tremendous amount of goodwill involved, and as with GameStop, the underlying driver of the energy in this movement is mass and legitimate disillusionment with liberal institutions who have failed to deliver.  Matt Stoller is the author of the BIG newsletter, where a version of this article first appeared in 2021, and former policymaker who focuses on the politics of market power and antitrust. This article is part of ""Crypto 2023.""  This weekend, I held a forum for paid subscribers on whether crypto is a useful anti-monopoly tool, and the debate got heated. I learned a lot, and after reading the comments I decided to write an essay, because it seems like there’s a lot of confusion about what crypto is and what it’s for. Dec. 8, for instance, there’s a hearing in the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on the crypto, with lots of talk about innovation along with warnings about risks and regulation. While useful, such traditional financial reform chatter obscures the far more interesting political debate that crypto has brought to the surface of our society about finance, monopoly and the state itself.  To explain what is going on, I think it helps to start with a historical analogy, the state that always seems to be a critical ingredient of every financial crisis: Florida. In particular, Florida in the 1920s.  In the early 1920s, just after a horrific war and decades of reform that ended in cynicism, a wave of speculation occurred around land in Florida. Thousands of disillusioned Americans in the Northeast sought to get rich quick, like the ""mushroom millionaires"" who had profited in the Great War that killed so many. These speculators used financial instruments and easy money, the equivalent of deregulation, to gamble massively across the economy. The mania became so insane that there was speculation over land lots in the city of Nettie, Florida, a city which later turned out not to exist. Eventually, the bubble popped. First, multiple hurricanes hit the state. The stock market did the rest by crashing in 1929. The result was tears, losses and decades of litigation.  See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | Opinion  And with that, let’s talk crypto. Cryptocurrencies are a social movement based on the belief that markings in a ledger on the internet have intrinsic value. The organizers of these ledgers call these markings bitcoin or dogecoin or offer other names based on the specific ledger. That’s really all a cryptocurrency is. There’s no magic. It’s not money, though it has money-like properties. It’s not anything except a set of markings. Sure, the technology behind the ledgers and how to create more of these markings is kind of neat.  But crypto is a movement based on energetic storytellers who spin fables about the utopian future to come. In a lot of ways, cryptocurrencies are like Florida land that no one ever intends to use. It has value in the moment it is traded, but only because there’s a collective belief that it has some intrinsic worth. (There is a wide variety of ""tools"" in the crypto world, like [non-fungible tokens], smart contracts, and global computing systems, but they don’t work, and none of them have any use cases except speculation and money laundering, and even in their idealized form they have no use cases aside from doing stuff you can already do far more easily through existing technology, with a different permissioning model.)  That said, the crypto narrative is one that anti-monopolists in general find deeply compelling, since both the anti-monopoly movement and the cryptocurrency movement emerged out of the financial crisis. Elizabeth Warren became a U.S. senator out of the crisis, and eventually pivoted to making the first call to break up big tech. Bitcoin was created on Jan. 3, 2009, a few weeks before Barack Obama was inaugurated as president. Inscribed in the code of Bitcoin is the following phrase, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” Both crypto and the anti-monopoly movement are reactions to the destruction wrought by neoliberalism.  Both financial crisis reformers and Bitcoin proponents believe that the existing financial order is a collusive arrangement between large banks who are supported by government power. Money laundering, tax evasion, criminal activity and fraud are fine as long as you are an insider in this system, and the Federal Reserve and various other government institutions will not only not stop corrupt insiders, but will subsidize and bail them out if necessary. Meanwhile, the rest of us have to live with foreclosures, high interest rates on credit cards and high fees for middlemen in every aspect of the economy.  Indeed, it’s hard to see how our social contract is legitimate or fair. No one went to jail for the financial crisis, and the ongoing parade of scandals is nonstop. Just to take a random story that came out last week, several groups published a finding that the $11 trillion private investment industry is a haven for money laundering. We all know there will be no state reaction to fix this.  So what is to be done? The traditional populist view is that we should reform our social order through politics, things like mass education, elections, and civic engagement. That’s how Elizabeth Warren sees the world. She wants to strengthen the state so it can restore the social order, one that will tolerate less cheating and will involve the rule of law applied to the powerful.  The crypto response is different. The crypto response is to reject the social contract itself as irredeemably corrupt. Their goal is put pressure on the state itself by creating a money-like instrument outside of the public rule-setting capacity of the government. This is framed in the name of consumer choice, as in the state shouldn’t be able to boss you around and tell you what you can do with your money. After all, it’s yours. And anyone who doesn’t buy into this idea is inherently defending a set of collusive bailout-friendly institutions that we sometimes call liberal democracy.  But core to having a state, even a democratic one, is the ability to ban things and use coercion to enforce such a ban. Societies and social contracts are built on cooperative mechanisms, but also barriers and enforceable rules. In this framework, the argument of crypto proponents makes no sense. It is basically, ""You can’t tell me not to have access to a money-like mechanism, even if the point of this instrument is to defraud people or engage in ransomware attacks, and even if we know that the ultimate endpoint is a giant collapse when people trapped in a liquidity crisis find out that there is no lender of last resort for Bitcoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies. If you do, that’s tyranny.""  In other words, skeptics of cryptocurrencies generally believe that cryptocurrencies are easily manipulated mechanisms to launder money, commit fraud, evade sanctions, empower dictators, engage in heavily leveraged speculation prone to collapse, and ultimately break the state itself. The response to this concern is easy – exactly how is this accusation any different than the existing order? Surely if insiders are allowed to cheat in our regulated banking system, then why should we treat it as legitimate? Why not build our own financial channels? Yeah, maybe it’s bad, but at least we’re not Goldman Sachs or AIG.  That’s why I don’t think this movement can be dismissed as merely get-rich-quick mania. There’s goodwill and energy behind this movement, as well as a lot of wealthy cynics and scam artists. But the lack of legitimacy of liberal democracies is real. Increasingly, though, the arguments from cryptocurrency proponents are changing. They are saying they want to be regulated, they are not opposed to the state, they are just into technological innovation, and so forth. That’s why every witness in today’s hearing said they want regulation by the state. I don’t buy it.  We’re in new stage, where some very scary people are taking over monetary politics. If crypto boosters sought aggressive reform of the existing financial order, democratizing the Fed, clamping down on big banks, and so forth, and said that until that happens, they will pursue alternative currencies, that would be one thing. But that’s not at all how the politics of crypto works. In Washington, D.C., those who opposed the bailouts and sought to break up the banks – the reformers – are the most skeptical of cryptocurrencies.  See also: 'Probably Nothing': Why People Still Hate Crypto | Opinion  Meanwhile, the pro-crypto lobby includes men like Pat Toomey, the most pro-bailout and pro-Fed politician in D.C., and is financed by libertarian billionaire Marc Andreessen, a key force behind the rise of Facebook. Led by the leaders of Miami and New York City, a wave of mayors are actively trying to fuse cryptocurrencies to local governments, with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez asserting that these are ""natural resources"" and telling voters they may never have to pay taxes.  The amount of utopian [crap] and fake promises on a technology that doesn’t really work as anything but a speculative bubble and money laundering device should be a big red flag. Crypto is a movement based on the theory that the existing nation-state is a system rigged by billionaires, and the right response is to create a different and more corrupt order rigged by different billionaires, money launderers and dictators. It will, of course, all end in tears, ironically when the Fed ends its monetary stimulus, creating bubbles across the economy. That much we know. But how much ruin this movement engenders will depend on whether and how quickly we can restore the legitimacy of our existing governing systems.

Pessimism towards crypto is at an all-time high, with famous investors like Warren Buffet seemingly right about the risks involved. Investigations into the exchange uncovered gross financial misappropriation and abuse of users’ funds. The disastrous event left many investors seething and funds lost. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops Below $17,000 Pre-CPI And FOMC – Scenarios To Prepare For This Week According to reports, FTX had allegedly acted unprofessionally and blurred corporate lines between FTX and sister corporation Alameda. The firm supposedly had borrowed funds illicitly from the exchange and sparked an outcry for regulating crypto exchanges. The revelation led to a negative trend in the cryptocurrency market, with exchanges treading cautiously. In recent events, Sam Bankman-Fried has been arrested in the Bahamas and is facing the possibility of prosecution for fraud. SBF Arrest And Charges According to CNN reports, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and ex-CEO of FTX, was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday at his apartment. This arrest comes on the heels of criminal charges against him. According to U.S. attorney Damian Williams, Samuel Bankman-Fried was arrested at the request of the U.S. Government. This arrest resulted from a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY. His arrests occurred around 6 pm ET on Monday, and he will likely face a Nassau court today, as detailed by the Royal Bahamas Police force. The Security and Exchange Commission also stated it had created separate charges for SBF for violating securities laws. Charges against SBF include wire fraud, security fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering.

ALGO was trading at around $0.223 at the time of writing, according to CoinDesk data.  Algorand joined the Bank of Italy and the Italian insurance authority IVASS at an event hosted by the Research Center for Technologies Innovations and Finance (CETIF) in Milan on Tuesday to demonstrate how bank and insurance guarantees can be issued on blockchains, according to a statement. A bank guarantee is a type of financial backstop that's offered by a lending institution where the lender ensures that the liabilities of the debtor will be met.  The new platform is expected to come into force in early 2023 and will be the first time a European Union (EU) member state enables the use of blockchain technology for bank and insurance guarantees, according to the statement.  ""We selected Algorand because of its unparalleled level of innovation and security among permissionless [distributed ledger technologies], as well as because of its leadership in sustainability,"" said Federico Rajola, professor at the CETIF, in the statement.  The move is part of a wider initiative rolled out by the EU, dubbed ""EU Recovery Plan"" where the EU allocated roughly 200 billion euros to Italy. The program was launched to boost economic recovery following the COVID-19 crisis. Italy gained the largest allocation made to any country and was made to be used for co-grants and co-loans.

Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday evening in the Bahamas, at the U.S.'s request, and is scheduled to appear before a local magistrate court on Tuesday. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced late Monday it would move to unseal an indictment and seek his extradition to the U.S. A federal judge unsealed the indictment Tuesday morning.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) wants Bankman-Fried to forfeit any property derived from these alleged crimes.  According to the DOJ indictment, Bankman-Fried ""agreed with others to defraud customers of FTX.com by misappropriating those customers' deposits and using those deposits to pay expenses and debts of Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's proprietary crypto hedge fund, and to make investments.""  Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Future Trading Commission also announced various charges against Bankman-Fried.  In total, Bankman-Fried faces eight charges:  Conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers;  Wire fraud on customers;  Conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders;  Wire fraud on lenders;  Conspiracy to commit commodities fraud;  Conspiracy to commit securities fraud;  Conspiracy to commit money laundering; and  Conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and violate campaign finance laws.  The document suggests that Bankman-Fried may have lied about FTX's financial health.  ""On or about September 18, 2022, Samuel Bankman-Fried, a/k/a 'SBF,' the defendant, caused an email to be sent to an FTX investor in New York, New York that contained materially false information about FTX's financial condition,"" the filing said.  This would have happened before the true issues with FTX's financial situation were publicly known.  Bankman-Fried allegedly violated campaign finance laws by donating well over federal limits to candidates for public office, fundraising committees and independent expenditure committees, the document said.  Bankman-Fried was supposed to testify before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, before his arrest.

The document repeats SEC allegations that Bankman-Fried had inappropriately mixed customer assets and blurred the line between Alameda and FTX, with money spent on private jets and “furtively” used to to pay for a Super Bowl ad and sports stadium sponsorship.  “The use of customer funds by Alameda was not authorized by FTX customers, and FTX customers were not made aware that their funds were being used by Alameda,” the filing said, adding that this contradicts both best practices for derivatives exchanges and contractual terms of service.  In mid-2022, after a crash in crypto markets that saw the likes of Terra and Celsius Network collapse, Bankman-Fried’s companies “portrayed that they remained highly profitable and liquid” in public, despite Alameda’s liability to FTX outstripping the latter’s total lifetime revenue, the document said.  But rosy public statements about profits contradicted what Bankman-Fried really knew, the CFTC alleged. In September, Bankman-Fried drafted a never-published document saying Alameda should be shut down permanently because it didn’t make enough money from trading, the filing said.  The CFTC was not immediately available for comment.  Bloomberg initially reported on news of the lawsuit.

While the CPI release was today at 8:30 ET, the last FOMC meeting of the year is scheduled to take place tomorrow featuring a new dot plot. CPI and FOMC coincide this week for the first time in a while, making it blockbuster week for Bitcoin. And drum roll! The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the November figures for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Core CPI a few minutes ago. The expectation for CPI was 7.3% CPI (0.3% MoM), up from 7.7% (0.4% MoM) in October. Core CPI was expected at 6.1% (0.3% MoM), and was 6.3% (0.3% MoM) the previous month. Related Reading: JPMorgan Says S&P 500 Can Soar Over 10% Today – Will Bitcoin Follow? The new numbers for November read as follows: CPI fell 0.6% and was 7.1% in November.

The price stood at around $17,550 before the announcement. After the release, the price reacted extremely bullish to the news along with the S&P 500. The latter is currently breaking out of a year-long downtrend. S&P breaking out of its year-long downtrend? pic.twitter.com/tWUKtCQlhg — Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) December 13, 2022 At press time, BTC was up almost 6% within the last 24 hours and was trading at $17,907. With a local high of $18,209, the price was rejected at the 2-month high of November 11 for the moment being. What Will The Federal Reserve Do With The Data? Prior to the CPI data release, the market was forecasting a rate hike of 50 bps with a 72% probability, according to the CME FedWatch tool. This is compared to a 28% probability of a 75 bps hike. Within the next few hours, it remains to be seen how this rate will shift due to the CPI print. At press time, however, the probability of a 50 basis point jumped significantly to 79.4%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Today’s CPI print has thus further increased the probability for 50 bps tomorrow. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Key Indicators Suggest Strengthening Case For Upside Break As NewsBTC reported, JP Morgan published an analysis before releasing the CPI data, according to which it gave the highest probability (50%) of a CPI print of 7.2% to 7.4%. As it turns out, JP Morgan was almost spot on with this assessment. JP Morgan assigned only a 15% chance to the 7.1% outcome and predicted that this could mean increases of 4% to 5% for the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs forecasts that today’s CPI print could mean a 2% to 3% increase for the S&P 500. However, ultimately the FED will decide tomorrow what to do with the CPI data. As NewsBTC reported, it will also publish the dot plot, which reflects the central bank’s long-term expectations and outlook.

The report pushed up prices for cryptocurrencies, based on the expectation that less-worrisome consumer-price increases might give the Fed more cover to ease up on interest-rate hikes.  On an annual basis, the CPI rose 7.1%, the U.S. Labor Department reported Tuesday, below the 7.3% projected by economists in a FactSet survey.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, which has been relatively steady so far in December, jumped 1.6% in the minutes after the report was released, to about $17,930; it's up 5.2% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second overall, is up 6.9% over 24 hours to $1,335. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) rose 3.8%.  Traders have been monitoring the data for signs of whether the Fed’s rate hikes this year are helping to bring down the pace of consumer-price increases, which earlier this year hit a four-decade high. In general, tighter monetary policy puts downward pressure on prices of risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  The U.S. central bank's monetary-policy setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is meeting this week behind closed doors, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday along with fresh projections by officials on the future path of economic indicators.  Core CPI – which excludes food and energy because they tend to be more volatile – rose 0.2% in November, also a slowdown from October, the Labor Department reported.  The weaker-than-expected inflation figure comes a day after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents see one-year inflation running at a 5.2% pace.  The November CPI release is the final major economic report of 2022 and the last key input the FOMC will see before as this week's meeting kicks off Tuesday. The two-day session is set to conclude on Wednesday with a statement due out at 2 p.m. ET and a fresh ""Summary of Economic Projections"" from top Fed officials, known colloquially as the ""dot plot.""  “Tuesday's CPI release along with Wednesday's FOMC meeting will undoubtedly set the tone for financial markets as we head into next year,” analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note, expecting another 50 basis point (0.5 percentage point) rate hike by the Fed on Wednesday.  Terminal rate will likely be higher in new projections  Fed Chair Jerome Powell has previously said that he and his colleagues project the interest rate to peak – probably sometime next year – at a level that's higher than officials' previous telegraphed 4.9%. According to Deutsche Bank, the rate could reach 5.1% before the Fed pauses its campaign.  “We expect the dot plot to lean hawkish … reinforcing the committee’s view that policy will need to remain restrictive for longer to guide inflation back to target,” the note said.  Analysts at the French bank BNP Paribas see the terminal rate reaching 5.25% by March and holding that level until the end of the year.  “Communications will emphasize the likelihood of holding rates at restrictive levels over a longer time horizon – possibly even challenging current market pricing,” they wrote in a note.  Powell will speak following the FOMC’s rate hike decision, at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

Chainlink’s new “staking” program – where participants can earn crypto rewards for helping to secure the network – was intended to be broad-based: The price-feed provider imposed a limit of 7,000 LINK tokens per wallet to “promote greater inclusion and reduce the risk of a few participants dominating the pool in the early stages,” according to the project team. But blockchain data reveals how one large holder – a “whale” in crypto parlance – was able to get around the limits by creating more than 150 addresses – and then staking the full 7,000 LINK allotment from each of them. The elaborate effort allowed the whale, nicknamed “Oldwhite” by the OpenSea platform, to stake some 1.06 million LINK ($7 million worth).  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of bitcoin held in miner wallets going back to January 2021.  The balance held by miners or those responsible for making coins has now dropped to 1.818 million BTC, the lowest since October 2021, extending the slide from the July high of 1.84 million.  Miners' balance sheets have deteriorated this year as bitcoin prices have slumped, denting revenues.  – Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Goldman Sachs Sees Gold Outperforming Bitcoin in the Longer Term  Binance Withdrawals Surge as Concerns About Its Reserve Report Spook Traders  Citi Downgrades Robinhood, Says FTX Fallout Will Weigh on Crypto Trading Revenue",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/13/first-mover-americas-bankman-fried-arrested-in-bahamas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/689350ddef5accb0b23920067b6867f36c689454-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Without it, blockchain initiatives in South Korea could see the emergence of numerous competing ecosystems, ""content in their isolation, seldom fully interacting with one another,"" according to Sooho.io.

The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey on Dec. 7 and withdrawn on Dec. 8, court documents show.  The suit had alleged that Iris Energy repeatedly gave out materially false information and misled investors, starting with the documentation for the firm's 2021 initial public offering. Those documents were negligently prepared and failed to disclose certain of the mining machines, ""owned through its Non-Recourse SPVs [non-recourse special purpose vehicles], were unlikely to produce sufficient cash flow to service their respective debt financing obligations,"" the suit said.  Iris Energy continued to mislead investors throughout 2022 as its shares were traded on the Nasdaq, the claimant had alleged. The miner downplayed the severity of its debt and sought to assure investors by playing up its strategy of ""operational efficiency and securing additional financing,"" the suit said.  However, some of the company's procured hardware was unlikely to produce enough cash to service the associated debt, so Iris Energy's debt was not as sustainable as presented, which would in turn have a material effect on the company's operations and financials, the withdrawn lawsuit alleged.  On Nov. 2, Iris Energy revealed that it was in discussions to restructure over $100 million of equipment loans because the machines in question did not produce enough cash to service the debt. The firm later received default notices on that debt, and said the mining machines will likely be seized by the lender.  On Nov. 18, Iris had to unplug the related equipment. That took out 3.6 EH/s of computing power offline, cutting IREN's average hashrate to 1.4 EH/s in November.  Because the debt was held by Non-recourse SPVs, Iris Energy's co-founder and co-CEO Dan Roberts has reportedly argued that it is incorrect to say that the miner defaulted on its obligations.  In its latest monthly update released on Tuesday, Iris Energy said it is considering selling 0.4 EH/s of machines.

42388457,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRGTBJ,1670933516,Bitcoin Hits One-Month High Ahead of US Inflation Data,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose on Tuesday as investors braced for crucial U.S. data likely to show that the consumer price index (CPI) growth is slowing in response to Federal Reserve's (Fed) aggressive liquidity tightening.  The leading cryptocurrency neared $17,500 for the first time since Nov. 1, shrugging off concerns about the health of dominant digital assets exchange Binance.  Other cryptocurrencies including ETH, XRP, DOT, MATIC and LTC rose, albeit by less than bitcoin's 24-hour gain of 2.4%, CoinDesk data showed.  Bitcoin probably benefited from haven flows stemming from the unease about the health of the dominant cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The cryptocurrency's dominance rate, or the share in the crypto market, rose to 41.4%, the highest since Oct. 29. Historically, traders have piled into bitcoin, lifting its dominance rate during times of stress in the broader market.  ""Bitcoin's dominance has finally broken above 41%. Its a textbook de-risking market signal,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, said in a daily market note.  In addition, the pre-U.S. CPI gain of 0.5% in the futures tied to the S&P 500, the benchmark for risk assets worldwide, likely helped bitcoin.  The CPI inflation is forecast to have slowed to an annual pace of 7.3% in November, reaching the lowest since December 2021 and down from October's 7.7% increase, according to a consensus estimate by Refinitiv.  Meanwhile, the growth in core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is expected to have slowed to 6.1% from October's 6.3%.  A soft inflation print will likely bolster hopes for a so-called Fed pivot in favor of easing, bringing cheer to risk assets. The Federal Reserve has raised rates by 375 basis points since March to control rampant inflation and the liquidity tightening has ruined risk assets, including bitcoin.  Bitcoin traders, however, are playing it safe, and perhaps rightfully so, as a hotter-than-expected CPI could dash the already elevated Fed pivot hopes, triggering broad-based risk aversion and flight to safety.  ""BTC futures open interest remains flat at $8.25 billion while funding rates skew negative. Traders are taking a predominantly bearish stance,"" Harland said.  Open interest refers to the dollar value locked in the number of active futures contracts. The funding rate, charged every eight hours by exchanges, refers to the cost of holding bullish/bearish positions in the perpetual futures market. A negative rate implies bears are paying the bulls to keep their positions open and leverage is skewed on the bearish side.  Griffin Ardern, a trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said traders are trying to go long on volatility.  Traders typically go long on volatility by purchasing both bullish call and bearish put options. The strategy makes money if the underlying asset either surges or tanks enough to recover more than what was paid to purchase calls and puts.  Bitcoin may see heightened price volatility, as too may market-moving events are lined up in the next 72 hours.  ""The central banks of the four countries – the U.S., Japan, European Union and the U.K. – will announce interest rate decisions this week. Plus, we have Powell's speech and the U.S. CPI release.

This bold DeFi lending protocol requires no deposit of extra crypto tokens as collateral for borrowing. In the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, cryptocurrency lending came as a means that allows investors access to their preferred tokens. However, they must deposit other crypto coins as collateral before borrowing the given assets. This will help curtail risks and losses for the DeFi lending platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops Below $17,000 Pre-CPI And FOMC – Scenarios To Prepare For This Week Instead, it all lies in the hand of the lending pools to decide on granting the crypto loans or not. They would have to evaluate the borrower’s ability to repay based on his creditworthiness. Maple Finance Suffers Bad Debts Due To Risks of Uncollateralized Loans However, the prevailing crisis in the crypto market has given a massive blow to Maple in terms of stress tests since its launch in 2021. The protocol has witnessed a cumulative $36 million of defaulted loans and $18 million distressed in the past fortnight. Maple’s bad debts represent about 66% of the total outstanding in its four active lending pools. Also, most of the vast borrowers have revealed losses due to their investments in the collapsed FTX exchange. The outplaying events are creating negative waves for Maple. Already, its native token, MPL, has plummeted to an all-time low as it lost 50% of its value. Most participants and analysts are trying to highlight the wrong footing with the DeFi lending platform. They intend to x-ray the rules and operations of the protocol for a possible amendment that could sustain the project again. The focus is on the risks associated with uncollateralized crypto lending. Also, a combination of fraudulent decisions and poor protocol design heightened the project’s condition. Shortfalls For Maple Lending Procedures Maple faces a severe crisis with its crypto credit formalities. The protocol grew its lending book to $900 million within a year. Its popularity spiked among market makers that seek liquidity for borrowing and crypto trading companies. However, its range of depositors comes from institutional and average retail investors that want huge yields.

Its level of future adoption, therefore, is more sensitive to changes in interest rates – or has a longer duration – than gold, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a research report Monday looking at the benefits of both assets in a diversified portfolio.  In the last year came the “end of a decade of easy money” as central banks raised interest rates saw a sharp reduction in speculative positions in gold and bitcoin, the report said. However, gold is roughly unchanged year on year, whereas bitcoin is down 75%, in line with high-growth tech companies.  Tight financial conditions are expected to be a drag on bitcoin’s user adoption, the report said, and this makes a repeat of the cryptocurrency’s strong returns of the last decade less likely. Volatility will likely remain elevated until it develops more use cases.  “The development of real use cases is also crucial to reducing bitcoin’s volatility, but is by no means guaranteed and may take a long time to play out,” analysts Mikhail Sprogis and Jeffrey Currie wrote.  Goldman says such conditions will be a smaller drag on the price of gold as it is a “shorter duration real asset with developed user cases,” adding that the metal “may benefit from structurally higher macro volatility and a need to diversify equity exposure.”  The cryptocurrency’s adoption has been boosted by easy financial conditions, the bank said, with some investors more willing to “explore low liquidity, high risk/return options like bitcoin.” With tighter financial conditions expected moving forward, speculative interest in bitcoin is likely to decline.  Bitcoin is more levered to financial conditions than gold because the metal has “developed non-investment cases today while bitcoin is still looking for one,” the note said, adding that BTC is a “solution looking for a problem.” The majority of bitcoin supply has not moved for over a year, which suggests that it is being held for investment purposes, the note added.

Legal filings posted on Tuesday claims that Bankman-Fried inappropriately used customer funds to bail out the supposedly separate trading arm Alameda Research, and fund both Bankman-Fried's personal lifestyle and political donations.  “We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement.  Court documents filed by the SEC said Bankman-Fried “was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire.”  The document further alleges that Alameda was secretly granted special status with lines of credit and an exemption from liquidation protocols on the FTX exchange, in effect giving it the right to access customer funds.  Around May 2022, as crypto prices dropped, “Bankman-Fried directed Alameda to draw on its 'line of credit' from FTX. Billions of dollars of FTX customer funds were thus diverted to Alameda and used by Alameda to re-pay its third-party loan obligations,” the SEC document said.  ""Bankman-Fried improperly diverted customer assets to his privately held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC (“Alameda”), and then used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations,"" it added.  Bankman-Fried continued to reassure investors of sound governance and a good financial condition as markets dropped, and has “knowingly or recklessly … employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud,” the SEC filing said.  FTX customers were directed to send billions in funds to an account actually controlled by Alameda, the SEC said. That created an extra $8 billion liability that was detailed, in a leaked balance sheet circulated to investors as part of a now infamous last-chance fundraise, as a “hidden, poorly labelled fiat@ account.”  It also meant that, rather than making an individually segregated deposit, clients may have been unwittingly contributing to what the SEC called the chief executive’s “personal piggy bank.” Two of the $1.338 billion in loans made from Alameda over a two-and-a-half year period had Bankman-Fried as both lender and borrower, the latter in his personal capacity.  Bankman-Fried has previously said he did not ""knowingly commingle"" customer funds. His lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.  The charges come a day after Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas. The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee is due to probe the failure of FTX later Tuesday.

42388450,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRGSsb,1670928127,Cumberland Favors Bitcoin Option Trades to Profit From US CPI,"The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the all-important Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for November at 8:30 a.m. ET (13:30 UTC) on Tuesday.  If the inflation report comes hot, risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC), may face selling pressure. On the contrary, bitcoin could rally if data shows inflation showing signs of responding to the Federal Reserve's rate hike cycle.  In other words, the CPI release could wake up bitcoin from its recent slumber. Trading giant Cumberland recommends an options strategy to profit from the post-data price action.  ""Sell BTC June calls and hedge with December options,"" Cumberland said in the CPI preview published on dominant crypto options exchange Deribit's market insights blog.  The CPI is likely to show the cost of living rose by 7.3% in November on an annual basis, slowing from the 7.7% rise in the previous month. The core inflation, which excludes food and energy, likely rose 6.1% following October's 6.3% increase.  To the uninitiated, bullish call options give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Meanwhile, put options give the right to sell.  A call buyer compensates the call seller for offering protection against bullish moves by paying a premium when the contract is purchased. The premium received is the call seller's maximum profit, while the maximum loss is unlimited, as, in theory, the market can rise to infinity.  Calls gain value when the market rises and bleed when the market drops. Seasoned traders sell higher strike or above-spot price call options when the market is expected to fall or stay flat.  In the trade suggested by Cumberland, the June expiry calls will lose premium, making money for the call seller, if the data shows inflation remained elevated in November. A hotter-than-expected print would dash hopes for a Fed pivot in favor of rate cuts, pushing bitcoin lower and eroding the value of calls.  ""There is reason to believe that a high CPI print on Tuesday could be a tipping point, giving risk assets a strong reason to move back towards the downside and thus generating delta P&L through call selling,"" Cumberland noted.  What if CPI brings risk-on rally?  At this point, the obvious question that comes to mind is, what if the CPI misses estimates, bolstering hopes for the Federal Reserve pivot and lifting bitcoin? In that case, wouldn't the June call options gain value, yielding a big loss for the seller?  While call options stand to gain value in case of a bitcoin rally, the rate of gain is likely to be tepid.  That's because the implied volatility, or the market's forecast of a potential movement in the underlying asset, is expected to drop following Tuesday's CPI and Wednesday's Fed rate decision. A drop in implied volatility, which can be equated with lesser uncertainty, benefits options sellers.  ""A low CPI should reassert the market’s confidence in inflation coming down, causing a rally in risk assets but bringing vols [implied volatility] down again (generating vega P&L through call selling) as this narrative is already somewhat priced in,"" Cumberland said.  Options vega measures the amount of increase or decrease in premium based on a 1% (100 basis points) change in the implied volatility (IV) assumption. A call buyer is long vega and stands to benefit from a rise in implied volatility, which can be equated with the degree of uncertainty. On the contrary, a call seller is short vega and will benefit from a drop in implied volatility.  Besides, Cumberland favors buying short-dated options as a hedge against the risk of a potential blowup in volatility in the aftermath of the CPI report.  ""One can hedge this trade by buying some gamma (short-dated options expiring in December). The low levels of realized volatility have made the weekly straddle prices reasonably cheap compared to historical levels during data week,"" Cumberland noted.  ""This Friday’s BTC and ETH straddles are priced at 0.0453 and 0.0642, respectively, implying approximate moves of 4.5% and 6.4%,"" Cumberland added, referring to bitcoin and ether.  Straddles is an options strategy that involves buying both call and put options when they are cheap relative to historical standards and implied volatility is expected to rise. Buying a straddle is akin to taking a bullish bet on volatility.  Readers, however, should note that employing complex options strategies requires active management of position and ample capital supply. That's probably the reason why options market is dominated by institutions and sophisticated traders.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/13/cumberland-favors-bitcoin-option-trades-to-profit-from-us-cpi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/177293196d1f1a2e6bdf7bb9984e72e3943ef8a6-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, lawyers for FTX’s new boss, John Ray III, are attempting to fight off attempts by what they say are “reckless” attempts by Bahamas-based administrators to secure access to the defunct exchange's IT systems, in legal proceedings that have rapidly become as messy as the crypto exchange’s own governance.  Unsuccessful attempts by former FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried to get back his password for company systems, apparently at the urging of Bahamas joint provisional liquidators (JPL), “highlight the recklessness with which the JPLs and the Bahamian authorities are approaching the security of the Debtors’ assets and systems,” a filing on behalf of FTX’s new U.S. management said.  “The last time these individuals had access to the Debtors’ systems, they used such access to transfer assets belonging to the Debtors,” the filing added.  A brief reopening of FTX exchange between Nov. 10 and Nov. 11, the day Bankman-Fried resigned and the company filed for bankruptcy protection, led to $100 million in crypto being withdrawn by 1,500 customers who were, or purported to be, Bahamian, the filing said.  Bankman-Fried had on Nov. 10 promised Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder that he would segregate funds for local customers and allow them to withdraw, according to an email filed with the court.  In a Dec. 7 letter, lawyers for Bahamas liquidators warned of ""potentially severe adverse impacts"" and the risk of dissipation of assets if they aren't immediately granted access to FTX systems, such as Amazon Cloud and Google Drive.  Luxury villas  Meanwhile, in a separate court filing, Bahamian liquidators say the holding company of a series of 35 luxury Bahamas villas, the most expensive of which costs $30 million, was unlawfully transferred into U.S. hands, as lawyers squabble over which country has jurisdiction.  The portfolio was supposedly under control of both FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and co-Chief Executive Ryan Salame – but Salame may never have approved the real estate holding company to be included in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, Brian Simms, a liquidator appointed in the Bahamas, told the Delaware court.  “An action of one director is a nullity under Bahamian law when the consent of two directors is required,” Simms said. “Bahamian law does not allow for recognition for a foreign insolvency proceeding of a Bahamian corporation"" such as that which owned the properties.  After taking over as chief executive on Nov. 11, Ray told the court that FTX was one of the biggest governance failures he had seen in his 40-year restructuring career. Ray cited a failure to document the structure of the 100-plus entities in Bankman-Fried’s empire, the staff on his payroll or the status of Bahamas properties given to staff.  Bankman-Fried had been due to testify before a U.S. House of Representatives committee on Tuesday, but this has been thrown into doubt after news that Pinder has ordered Bankman-Fried’s arrest pending extradition to the U.S.  Read more: Top US Lawmaker Says FTX Hearing Will Continue Without Sam Bankman-Fried",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/13/ftxs-bahamas-liquidators-seek-to-exclude-over-200m-worth-of-luxury-properties-from-liquidation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/352f1b0593a05f826e60c13f2764e1769dcdc6e2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Today’s release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will possibly be the key for the coming weeks and months. At 8:30 ET, the CPI for November will be released. Tomorrow, Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its interest rate decision for December. Following that, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will address the press at 2:30 p.m. and provide the rationale for the decision and the updated forecast for inflation and interest rates (dot plot). Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops Below $17,000 Pre-CPI And FOMC – Scenarios To Prepare For This Week If CPI comes in better than expected today, there will likely be a rally for risk assets like Bitcoin. If the CPI falls short of expectations or even rises, it could mean a rude awakening for BTC investors – at least this seems to be the market consensus. Expectations for today’s CPI are 0.4% lower than the previous month, when it came in at 7.7%. As a result, the projected CPI is at 7.3%. JPMorgan Draws Possible Scenarios Meanwhile, banking giant JPMorgan published an analysis that CPI inflation below 6.9% could trigger a massive rally in traditional trading markets. Given Bitcoin’s correlation with USD markets and the S&P 500 in particular, this could likely have a beneficial impact on the BCT price. In total, JPMorgan has mentioned six possible scenarios. The most likely and expected outcome with a 50% chance is a Y/Y CPI between 7.2% and 7.4%. This would lead to a modest rally in the traditional markets, according to JPMorgan, and would likely have a positive impact on the Bitcoin and crypto markets. However, as the market heavily hinges on expectations, it remains to be seen whether the majority of market participants have not already priced this in. Related Reading: Upcoming FOMC Meeting Is The Most Important Ever For Bitcoin – Watch Out For The Dot Plot As the second most likely scenario with a probability of 25%, JPMorgan considers a CPI between 7.5% and 7.7%, which would mean only a slight drop or stagnation of inflation.

The Bullish Scenarios For Bitcoin Furthermore, JPMorgan assigns a 15% probability to the bullish scenario of CPI landing at 7.0% to 7.2%, which could mean a 4% to 5% rally for the S&P 500.

Data from Nansen shows that Paxos and Huobi were the recipients of some of this inflow, with around $162 million of net flow between the two exchanges.  Coinbase saw a sharp rise in inflow, specifically during the Asian trading hours, with around $124 million coming into the exchange during the day.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Recovers From FTX Panic Selling According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, BTC long-term holders now hold around 72.3% of the total circulating supply. The “long-term holder” (LTH) group is one of the two major cohorts in the Bitcoin market and includes all investors who have been holding onto their coins for at least 155 days ago, without having moved or sold them from their wallet. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Still In “Overbought” Region, Volatility To Follow? “Short-term holders” (STHs) make up the other side of the market. Statistically, the longer investors hold their coins, the less probable they become to sell at any point. Therefore, LTHs are the more resolute group of the two and are sometimes dubbed the “diamond hands” of the market. The “LTH supply” is an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC that these HODLers as a whole are currently carrying in their wallets. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric over the last few years: Looks like the value of this metric has seen an increase in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 50, 2022 As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin LTHs displayed a strong accumulation trend between July and early November, causing their supply to reach a new height. However, the crash due to the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX completely reversed the trend as these holders quickly started shedding off their holdings instead. This decline in the indicator suggests that the crash made even these resolute holders panic and sell off their coins. But in the last few weeks, tides have once again seemed to have shifted. As the market has traded sideways, the LTH supply has observed a constant rise, implying that these investors are back at accumulating. The metric has now fully retraced the drawdown due to the FTX debacle and has set a new all-time high of 13.9 million BTC, corresponding to about 72.3% of the total circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Or More Pain? Here’s What BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes Thinks The 155-day threshold would put the source of this new streak of accumulation back in June and July of this year, which is when the deleveraging event due to the 3AC collapse took place. This new rise in the LTH supply means the conviction is returning among these Bitcoin HODLers, something that has historically been bullish for the price in the long term.

Bankman-Fried was taken into custody by Bahamas police late on Monday. As soon as the island nation got word that the U.S. had charged the former CEO, reportedly for fraud and money laundering, the Bahamas arrested him, expecting a request for extradition.  Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chair of the U.S. committee holding the hearing, said she was ""surprised"" to hear of Bankman-Fried's arrest and ""disappointed"" that he would not be testifying before the committee.  ""Although Mr. Bankman-Fried must be held accountable, the American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that’ve harmed over one million people, and wiped out the hard-earned life savings of so many,"" Waters said of the FTX failure.  Bankman-Fried, who has given numerous media interviews since the implosion of his empire despite being under criminal investigation, agreed to participate in the hearing on Dec. 9.  FTX, once a darling of Wall Street, Washington, D.C., and the media , filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, days after a CoinDesk article revealed that much of its sister firm Alameda Research's balance sheet was made up of FTT tokens, which are issued by FTX. That triggered a bank run on FTX deposits, which eventually led to the exchange's insolvency.

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Continues To Be At A High Value As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC long-term holders have been moving their coins recently. The “NVT ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the transaction volume on the chain (both in USD). What this metric tells us is whether the value of the cryptocurrency (the market cap) is comparable to the ability to transact coins or not (the volume). When the value of the metric is high, it means BTC is overvalued right now as transaction volumes are low compared to the market cap. On the other hand, low values imply the crypto may be undervalued currently. Related Reading: Quant Explains How This Nasdaq Support Retest Could Also Help Reverse Bitcoin The “NVT Golden Cross” is an indicator that compares the long-term (30-day MA) and the short-term (10-day MA) trends of the NVT ratio to identify tops and bottoms in the metric. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the NVT Golden Cross over the last couple of years: Looks like the value of the metric seems to have been high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the quant has marked the “overbought” and “oversold” regions in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. Whenever this metric has a value of more than 2.2, it means the crypto might be overpriced right now. The coin has usually observed a bearish effect when the indicator has been in this region, as the chart displays.

It seems like the LTHs have been possibly participating in a large degree of selling recently. This metric has an influence on the NVT Golden Cross, which has also risen in the last few weeks. The indicator is now in the overbought region, which suggests Bitcoin may soon be seeing some bearish volatility.

BTC climbed higher and might soon aim an upside break above the $17,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin found a strong buying interest near the $16,920 and $16,900 levels. The price is trading above $17,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a major contracting triangle forming with resistance near $17,220 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $17,250 and $17,450 resistance levels. Bitcoin Price Eyes Upside Break Bitcoin price corrected lower from the $17,292 swing high. BTC declined below the $17,000 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. However, the bulls were active near the $16,920 and $16,900 levels. A low was formed near $16,880 and the price started a fresh increase. There was a clear move above the $17,000 resistance zone and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Bitcoin price is now consolidating gains near the $17,150 level. There was a minor decline below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $16,880 low to $17,247 high. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $17,150 level. There is also a major contracting triangle forming with resistance near $17,220 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

The next major resistance is near $17,500, above which the price start a steady increase and rise towards the $18,000 zone in the near term. Dips Limited in BTC? If bitcoin fails to clear the $17,150 resistance, there could be a fresh decline. An immediate support on the downside is near the $17,120 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The next major support is near the $17,000 zone. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $16,880 low to $17,247 high. A downside break below the $17,000 support might call a drop towards $16,880. Any more losses might push the price towards the $16,500 zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.

The Singapore-based company, backed by the crypto investment firms Polychain and Dragonfly, said the upgrade could meet growing interest among retail traders in decentralized finance, or DeFi. The trend accelerated after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange and Three Arrows Capital added a “sense of urgency to the need for transparency and retail user protections,” SynFutures said in a press release.  With the upgrade, ”traders can permissionlessly list any futures trading pairs, leading to a wider array of choices,” according to the company.  SynFutures said its v2 upgrade has also introduced the Synthetic Automated Market Maker (sAMM) technology, which allows liquidity providers to supply just one asset of a trading pair like a stablecoin, as opposed to an equal amount of both tokens, as is common with most AMMs.  Other upgraded features include improving the user interface with a one-click design and strengthening risk-management features, according to SynFutures.  SynFutures is the largest decentralized exchange for crypto derivatives on Polygon, with $1.4 billion in monthly trading volume, according to the company.

Bean and Kistner are the founders of bZeroX, a company that allowed its users to trade crypto derivatives products in the U.S. Bean and Kistner converted the company into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which eventually rebranded to Ooki DAO.  While the CFTC settled charges with Bean and Kistner, the agency also brought separate charges against Ooki DAO, alleging it conducted similar illegal conduct to bZeroX. Members of the crypto industry tried to push back against the CFTC's approach, however. While the regulator wanted to serve its lawsuit to the entire DAO at once by posting the suit in a Help chat bot and on a web forum, industry participants argued the CFTC should identify actual members of the DAO and serve them directly instead.  The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California held a hearing on the matter last week. While District Judge William Orrick did not make a ruling on that day, on Monday he ordered the CFTC to serve the same suit to Bean and Kistner.  ""At the hearing, the CFTC asserted it knew that some of Ooki DAO’s Token Holders reside and conduct business in the United States because the two founders of Ooki DAO’s predecessor entity, bZeroX LLC, are Token Holders who reside in the United States.

""Neither the complaint nor the CFTC’s Motion for Alternative Service mention that the former founders, Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner, are or have been Token Holders.""  One of the issues at question is whether the DAO is aware that it has been served with a lawsuit. Orrick, both in comments during last week's hearing and in Monday's order, said he believed the DAO is aware, though he did not explicitly say whether he would rule that the CFTC has satisfied all of the arguments it needs to in order to serve the DAO.  ""To provide the best practicable notice, the CFTC should serve at least one identifiable Token Holder if that is possible.

Net outflows, the difference between the value of assets arriving and leaving the exchange, hit $902 million in the past 24 hours, according to data by blockchain intelligence platform Nansen.  Binance’s net outflow has surpassed those of all other centralized exchanges’ in the last 24 hours, and is almost nine times larger than the second largest outflow.  The outflow was the highest for Binance since Nov. 13, two days after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, according to data provided by blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence.  However, the outflow “doesn’t seem notably anomalous,” an Arkham analyst wrote in a Telegram chat, given that there are ostensibly $64 billions of assets on Binance.  Withdrawals rose following a string of concerning news reports about Binance, and as investors have become increasingly cautious about their funds on centralized exchanges. The swift collapse of rival exchange FTX, piled on other industry debacles, has prompted other exchanges to prove that they are safeguarding customers’ assets.  Criminal charges against Binance?  Binance released a report by auditing firm Mazars last week claiming that its bitcoin (BTC) reserves are overcollateralized. Industry experts and recent reports flayed the document for its narrow scope, and on Monday, Reuters reported that U.S. prosecutors are mulling criminal charges for possible money laundering against Binance and its executives, including CEO Changpeng Zhao.  Binance didn’t reply to a request for comment. Zhao urged his followers on Twitter to “ignore the FUD” – crypto slang for spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt – in a tweet.

Jump Trading appears to be the largest entity withdrawing from Binance, Nansen analyst Andrew Thurman wrote in a tweet.  Net withdrawals from the exchange by crypto wallets associated with Jump reached $146 million of digital assets through the past seven days, data compiled by Nansen shows.  Jump’s net withdrawals include $102 million in Binance USD (BUSD), the exchange’s stablecoin issued by Paxos; $14 million of Tether’s USDT; and $10 million of ether (ETH).  Jump redeemed some $30 million of Binance USD (BUSD) from Paxos a few hours ago, per blockchain data from Arkham.

5462488,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512111,1670889633,This Bitcoin Metric Suggests Selling Pressure May Be Reaching Exhaustion,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin binary CDD has been going down recently, a sign that selling pressure may be getting exhausted in the market. Bitcoin 21-Day MA Binary CDD Has Been Observing Downtrend Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there was some heavy distribution going on in the market just a while ago. The relevant indicator here is “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD). A coin day is the amount that 1 BTC accumulates after sitting still in a single address for 1 day. When a coin that was previously dormant (and was thus carrying some coin days) makes some movement on the chain, its coin days counter resets back to zero, and the coin days it had accumulated are said to be “destroyed.” The CDD metric measures the total amount of such coin days being destroyed across the network on any given day. When this indicator has a large value, it means long-term holders are possibly moving or selling their coins as this cohort tends to stack up huge numbers of coin days. “Binary CDD,” the version of the metric being used here, tells us whether the supply-adjusted CDD is more or less than the average supply-adjusted CDD.

It’s 0 when the Bitcoin CDD is less than the average, while it’s 1 when it’s more. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the 21-day moving average value of this metric over the last few months: Looks like the 21-day MA value of the metric has been on the way down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the 21-day MA Bitcoin binary CDD had been climbing up between mid-October and late November, suggesting that the long-term holders were dumping. The BTC price took a large hit while this trend was taking place. However, in the last couple of weeks or so, the indicator has been rapidly going down instead.
