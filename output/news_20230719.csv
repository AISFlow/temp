15083598,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543431,1689807733,"Bitcoin, XRP, & Ethereum: Three Top Coins On Brink Of Golden Cross","Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum — three of the cryptocurrency market’s most dominant coins — are about to simultaneously form a 3-day golden cross. This signal is rare, happening only a handful of times in the past in each individual asset. However, never have all three of these major cryptocurrencies triggered this signal all at the same time. What exactly does this mean, and what are the results of the 3-day golden cross? Bitcoin, XRP, & Ethereum Lead Market Recovery The crypto market outlook is a lot less bleak than it was just weeks ago, between BlackRock and other institutions seeking to launch Bitcoin ETFs and the massive win for XRP and Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin & Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery Even the technical environment is starting to show signs of a possible uptrend brewing. Notably, several top cryptocurrencies are inching closer to a golden cross on the 3-day timeframe, which has only occurred a handful of times in the past. This is about to happen in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, simultaneously, for the first time in their history. Previously, these signals arrived at different phases of previous bull markets. It wasn’t until all three coins golden crossed that a stronger rally began. Three top crypto assets — #Bitcoin, Ethereum, and #XRP — are on the brink of a golden cross on the 3-day timeframe All three firing at the same time has never happened before It will also be the third in history for BTC and XRP, second ever for Ether pic.twitter.com/bzVfK3ZpBp — Tony “The Bull” (@tonythebullBTC) July 19, 2023 What Is A Golden Cross In Crypto? A golden cross occurs when a higher timeframe moving average, typically a 200-period MA, crosses above a lower timeframe moving average, usually a 50-period MA, from below. In contrast, a death cross happens when the two cross down from from above. These crossovers generate a buy or sell signal in a moving average-based trading system. Such systems are designed to capture the majority of a trend, but tend to miss much of the early part of a rally as it awaits confirmation. The 3-day golden cross throughout the years | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Moving Average Crossover: How Does The Signal Stack Up? The only time the signal suffered a drawdown was in Bitcoin in 2019. In all other instances, the buy signal using nothing more than a simple moving average crossover, was wildly profitable with limited downside. In 2015, the BTCUSD 3-day golden cross yielded over 2,000% ROI before crossing back down and giving the corresponding sell signal. XRP’s golden cross to death cross kept more than 9,000% of the uptrend’s gains. Ethereum never fired a signal back then, however, due to insufficient price history. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead Come 2019, Bitcoin had its misfire where the buy signal then sat through a long drawdown. Neither XRP nor Ethereum triggered a signal until 2020, when the entire crypto market began to rally together. The 2020 ETHUSD golden cross held onto over 1100% ROI before the death cross closed out the position. XRP failed to set a new all-time high, but the golden cross still clocked in 200% ROI. Even though Bitcoin fired early in 2019 and sat through a drawdown, the buy signal was still ultimately effective and retained 550% ROI by the time a death cross caused the position to close. Across the five historic buy signals, there was an average of 2,570% ROI when a golden cross occurred. While such returns aren’t likely in the future, this does suggest the signal is effective.

15083555,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543370,1689807630,Back In The Game: Ripple Joins $54 Million Funding Round For Metaverse Startup,"Ripple has been mostly preoccupied with its lawsuit with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, with a partially favorable ruling from Judge Analisa Torres last week stating that XRP tokens sold on the secondary market are not securities, the crypto firm has turned its attention to other things. This time around, Ripple has dipped its toes into the metaverse sector, joining a massive funding round for Futureverse. Ripple Joins $54 Million Funding Round For Futureverse On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Futureverse, a metaverse startup, had raised a total of $54 million. The company completed the Series A funding round, although at an undisclosed valuation. But the interesting part of the raise was the parties involved. Related Reading: Why This Upcoming Event Is Bearish For Axie Infinity (AXS) The raise was led by 10T Holdings, a crypto investment firm. However, the funding round seems to have managed to draw the attention of Ripple Labs as well. The raise is also significant in the fact that it took place at a time when crypto-related companies are seeing a decline in funding. Interestingly, the Futureverse startup is a combination of other startups. According to the Bloomberg report, Futureverse is actually a combination of 11 startups that span across different industries. These include metaverse, gaming, and artificial intelligence (AI), among others. XRP price sitting at $0.79 | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com Nevertheless, most of Futureverse’s products so far seem to be combining metaverse, gaming, and AI. The startup currently has a football (soccer) game that can be played on mobile called ‘AI League’ that has also been licensed by FIFA. Its next gamin product is said to be a boxing game leveraging the power of AI. A Return Fueled By Positive Sentiment Ripple has regained its foothold in the crypto industry following the court’s ruling against the SEC last week. With this, both the company and its native token, XRP, have experienced renewed vigor in the market. One example is Ripple looking to leverage real-world assets which it expects to reach a $30 trillion market cap in the next decade. Related Reading: Bearish Signal: BNB Open Interest Skyrockets To New Highs Following the ruling as well, the price of XRP jumped by over 60%, bringing the digital asset to its highest level since December 2021. Since then, XRP has continued on a bullish streak, surpassing Bitcoin in terms of average weekly volume, and emerging as one of the top performers in the space. Presently, the price of XRP is sitting at $0.791, representing a 4.92% increase in the last 24 hours. On the 7-day chart, the cryptocurrency is seeing gains of 67% and is now the 4th-largest cryptocurrency with its market cap resting at $41.5 billion.

15081871,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/starknet-introduces-appchains-framework-strk,1689804000,Starknet Introduces Appchains Framework $STRK,"Starknet, an Ethereum Layer 2, has disclosed the initiation of ""appchains,"" a framework designed to enable developers to construct several application-specific blockchains within the Starknet ecosystem. The innovative project is in alignment with the growing trend of modular networks in the Layer 2 ecosystem, spearheaded by projects like Optimism, Polygon, zkSync, and Arbitrum. A New Era For Application-Specific Chains Developers can harness Starknet Stack, the native developer toolkit of Starknet's ecosystem, to create these appchains, using STARK proofs to boost security. Central to this toolkit is Cairo, a programming language developed by the StarkWare team, bearing similarities to Rust. In a recent blog post, Starknet revealed that the use of appchains could offer developers an enhanced performance, a claim further supported by Starknet's recent v0.12.0 upgrade on the mainnet, which reportedly amplified network performance. Advancing Customization For Devs A unique aspect of appchains lies in their capability to support features currently not present on Starknet's main network. This includes features like custom fee market logic and consernsus mechanisms, among others. This flexibility can potentially grant developers the ability to customize their application's configurations and functionalities, thus offering a greater degree of control over their projects. ""Starknet Appchains are the bespoke environment where applications can tailor an instance of Starknet to achieve better control over the specs, lower cost, greater scale, and opt-in privacy,"" the firm shared. The team underscored the escalating interest in application-specific blockchains, tailored to meet customized requirements. They stated: ""The need for appchains has been apparent for several years and is now getting renewed attention."" Starknet's introduction of appchains represents a significant milestone in the blockchain landscape, enhancing developers' capacity for customization, and making the ecosystem more versatile and adaptable to specific application requirements. Such a move signals a key step towards a more decerntralized, diversified, and performance-oriented blockchain environment. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The native token of the Ripple payment system recently soared some 10% in the past 24 hours, gaining the most among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  In an email to CoinDesk, Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, wrote that XRP continued to benefit from its partly favorable ruling in an ongoing Federal court feud with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The decision has spurred a number of exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp to relist XRP, leading to a jump in investments, trading volumes and open interest for futures contracts.  ""In short, we’re seeing a return of investors that had previously been spooked by recent regulatory measures,"" Levin said.  XRP was changing hands at around $0.84, not far off its recent high of $0.93 recorded shortly after last Thursday’s court decision.  Smaller cryptocurrencies also gained during the day. XLM, the Ripple-adjacent Stellar network’s token, surged 24%. Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL were up roughly 6%, while popular memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) rose 4% after Twitter owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted a dog-themed tweet.  Read More: XRP Blockchain Still Faces Centralization Caveats as Ripple Regulatory Threat Recedes  BTC, meanwhile, traded mostly flat around $30,000. Ether (ETH), the second largest digital asset by market value, also remained muted during the day at $1,900. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently up 0.7%.  “The general macro setup is looking more favorable for risk assets as a whole,"" Levin said, adding that ""the market expects there to be one more rate hike – and then no more – given that inflation is clearly falling.""  Crypto investors have visibly shifted their focus to smaller, riskier tokens, given the strong performance of so-called altcoins as BTC stalled.  Notably, the BTC dominance rate, which measures bitcoin's share of the total market capitalization of crypto assets, pulled back to 49.8% from a 52% high in late June, according to TradingView. This is close to its lowest level in a month.  “Despite a swath of positive news stories over the last month for the crypto industry – from the Blackrock ETF announcement, the XRP legal victory through to presidential candidate Kennedy stating he would back the US Dollar with BTC today – nothing has helped bitcoin sustain momentum above $31K,” Charles Edwards, founder of bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, noted in a market update.  “When good news like this, probably the best news for our industry in years, can’t transform into sustained inflows and price progression, there is cause for concern,” Edwards said.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,"Krisztian Sandor, James Rubin",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/19/xrp-soars-10-lifting-altcoins-as-bitcoin-dominance-teeters-at-1-month-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa48dcde9df0867e3016e2daed8b6fef39ded508-1690x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report shows that the company has had a record-breaking quarter, with the best-ever production and deliveries and revenue approaching $25 billion in a single quarter, despite the current macroeconomic environment. Tesla Stands Firm On BTC Investment One important aspect of the report is the section on Tesla’s balance sheet, which shows the company’s holdings in digital assets, specifically Bitcoin (BTC). As of June 30, 2023, Tesla’s digital assets holdings stood at $184 million, which is the same amount as the previous quarter. This indicates that the company has not sold any of its Bitcoin holdings, despite the recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market.

In the event of further price drops and a failure to consolidate above the $30,000 mark, Bitcoin has the advantage of its 50-day Moving Average, which could serve as a strong support level at $29,100. However, sudden price movements have become increasingly common in recent months, following the thaw of the crypto winter. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Spikes, Is This Bearish? Typically, when Bitcoin experiences a price drop, it is followed by a period of consolidation. As long as BTC does not drop below its 50-day and 200-day Moving Averages, it can be seen as a short-term victory for Bitcoin bulls who have weathered another round of selling pressure. It remains to be seen whether BTC’s nearest support level will be able to hold and prevent another decline attempt.

The dog-themed cryptocurrency saw a 4% jump just a few minutes after Musk’s post. Musk has previously supported DOGE on multiple occasions via his Twitter account, often posting memes and comments about the cryptocurrency. His tweets have been known to cause significant price movements in the market, with DOGE often surging by double-digit percentages following his endorsements. Musk’s Tweet Causes Another Dogecoin Surge, But Will It Be Short-Lived? Despite experiencing a surge in price following Elon Musk’s tweet, DOGE’s value remains considerably lower than its July high of $0.07518. At its peak, the cryptocurrency rose from $0.069 to $0.072 but soon lost some of its gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Broken This Open Interest Pattern, Quant Explains Currently, DOGE is trading around the $0.070 mark, at $0.0687 at the time of writing. Nonetheless, DOGE is still up by 3% in the 24-hour timeframe. It’s important to note that DOGE’s recent price movements have been encouraging. Despite being range-bound for the past two weeks, DOGE’s price has managed to maintain above its 200-day Moving Average (MA), which is a positive sign for the potential continuation of bullish momentum. In addition, DOGE’s average directional movement index (ADX) indicator is pointing towards another attempt to breach and regain its July high. The ADX is currently peaking to the upside, which indicates that the altcoin is gaining strength. Furthermore, DOGE’s Squeeze Momentum Indicator suggests that the cryptocurrency is entering another potential uptrend phase, which its ADX also supports. All these factors combined could help DOGE regain the $0.01 mark it reached in April. Nevertheless, despite its recent surge in price, DOGE may face challenges in maintaining its uptrend due to low trading volume. In addition, the cryptocurrency is expected to encounter significant resistance in the near term. If DOGE can sustain its uptrend, it will likely face challenges from the 50-day Moving Average (MA) currently at $0.07481. Furthermore, DOGE must overcome a resistance wall at $0.0752 to regain its July high. Related Reading: Ethereum Monthly Burn Surpasses 146,000 ETH As Total Clears $6.5 Billion According to Token Terminal data, DOGE’s market capitalization is $9.83 billion, with a circulating supply of tokens. Its fully diluted market capitalization is also $9.83 billion. However, DOGE’s price-to-fully-diluted ratio (P/F ratio) is currently at an extremely high level of 16,006.25x, indicating that the cryptocurrency is trading at a premium relative to its fully diluted market capitalization. The P/F ratio has increased by 226.7% over the past 24 hours, suggesting that there may be increased demand for DOGE in the market. In conclusion, while DOGE’s recent surge in price can be attributed to Musk’s tweet, it remains to be seen whether it will continue to experience significant price movements in response to social media mentions and other media attention.

42393031,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF3TR,1689797881,XRP Blockchain Still Faces Centralization Caveats as Ripple Regulatory Threat Recedes,"Last week’s news that Ripple Labs had scored a partial court victory in its battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lifted a regulatory cloud that had hung over the project for years.  What remains, however, is the persistent criticism historically lobbed at XRP Ledger, the project at the heart of the case, by blockchain purists: that it’s too centralized, in its technological design.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  A descendent of Bitcoin but built around concepts that date to the early 2000s, XRP Ledger, or “XRPL,” relies on a key tradeoff – allowing its central transaction-processing mechanism to be controlled by a much smaller handful of “validators” or key operators than found on many rival blockchains.  “Ripple basically said, ‘Hey, let's make Bitcoin adoptable by institutions,’ so they created their own version of a decentralized currency that was faster and more consistent and cheaper,” according to a former Ripple Labs employee who asked not to be identified so he could speak more freely without upsetting old colleagues. “But it did come with a trade-off of greater centralization compared to Bitcoin.”  Benefits come in the form of security, speed and throughput, but the downside is that more centralized networks are more susceptible to the influence of major players, or prone to single points of failure.  Read more: Understanding Ripple, XRP and the SEC Suit  That’s not to say that the XRPL isn’t, in and of itself, a fascinating project in its own right, having been an early mover in the blockchain industry and now commanding a market capitalization for its native token XRP of $42 billion, the fourth-largest among tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies – along the way attracting the likes of big banks like Bank of America as partners. NFTs are natively built into the blockchain’s underlying programming – something upstart competitors are only now accomplishing. Smart contract-like functionality is currently on the way, and third-party sidechains are beginning to proliferate.  Potential use cases like global remittances are obvious. Ripple just has very different ambitions from many rival blockchain projects where decentralization is, for better or worse, an organizing principle.  CoinDesk reached out to Ripple Labs for comment but did not hear back by press time.  ‘Bitcoin for Bankers’  Released in 2004 by a Canadian programmer named Ryan Fugger, Ripple wasn’t originally a blockchain project. Cryptocurrencies as we know them wouldn’t even exist for four more years. “RipplePay,” as it was originally called, was a peer-to-peer payment network focused on convenience and security.  In 2011, Fugger sold RipplePay to Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz. They were building a new payment system inspired by Bitcoin, which had come out a few years earlier and was still far from a household name.  The trio’s mission – which they eventually merged with RipplePay – involved bridging blockchains with traditional finance through faster transactions, cheaper fees and lower energy costs. Their new company, called “OpenCoin,” eventually re-branded to Ripple Labs – the organization we know today.  Ripple’s reputation in cryptocurrency circles was complicated from the start.  “When Ripple was just my project pre-2012, it had a limited, but generally good reputation in the alternative currency/nascent crypto community,” Fugger, who briefly stayed on with Ripple Labs as an advisor but no longer works at the company, said in an email to CoinDesk. “When Jed et al took it on, they were hoping to build on that reputation.”  Around the time of RipplePay’s OpenCoin takeover, the budding blockchain industry was completely dominated by Bitcoin, which gained steam in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a way to combat a corrupt financial system.  Bitcoin’s breakthrough was that it used cryptography to allow people to transact over the internet without the need for trusted intermediaries.  Powered by a “decentralized” community of miners, bitcoin’s novel approach to payment tech ensured that no one person or entity could tamper with transactions or slow them down.  Unlike Bitcoin, which set out to disrupt traditional banking, Ripple’s focus would be on making iterative improvements to the existing financial system.  Not everyone was on board. Fugger no longer works in the blockchain industry and believes XRP’s reputation has improved over the years, but he recalls that in the project’s early days “XRP was quite polarizing, and viewed negatively by many in the Bitcoin community -- mining purists, Bitcoin maximalists, etc.”  Ripple’s original use-case for XRP was quick and cheap cross-border payments – a feature called “On Demand Liquidity” (ODL) that uses XRP as a bridge asset for banks and financial institutions to transfer between currencies. Over time, Ripple Labs has expanded its focus to include additional use cases like central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs – essentially digital versions of government-issued money.  In the future, Ripple sees itself as a wholesale replacement for SWIFT – the messaging network that powers today’s global payments system.  Crypto purists and bitcoiners stick their noses up at Ripple’s many financial and central bank partnerships – arguing they’re anathema to what “decentralized” payment networks are all about. XRP’s enthusiastic fanbase, the XRP Army (whose mob-like antics can be worthy of standalone articles), espouse a different view.  “Bitcoin in its white paper is anti-bank, anti-establishment,” a prominent XRP Army member told CoinDesk’s Jeff Wilser earlier this year. “The libertarian in me loves it. The libertarian in me absolutely goes f#$king nuts for it. I’m like, ‘Hell yeah, down with the man!’”  “As an adult, I understand that the legacy firms, and systems, and governments, and central banks of the world aren’t going for any of that shit.”  Read more: Why the XRP Army Keeps Fighting  Centralization concerns  Ripple’s critics often take issue with XRP Ledger’s consensus mechanism – the method the chain uses to securely process transactions.  On Bitcoin, which uses the “proof-of-work” system, anyone can compete to “mine” blocks and earn rewards. On Ethereum, which uses “proof-of-stake,” anyone with enough ETH tokens can “stake” currency to help secure the network and earn interest.  Ripple’s system, called “proof of association,” or PoA, is more closed-off by comparison. Every XRPL server operator is required to manually compile a list of validators, called a “Unique Node List” (UNL), that it trusts to report on the state of the blockchain. Anyone can run a validator, but only “trusted” validators on UNLs can directly process transactions.  Ripple Labs and two closely-linked entities – the XRP Ledger Foundation and Coil – each publishes a recommended list of validators, and servers are encouraged to use one of these “default” UNLs rather than build their own list of validators.  PoA is ostensibly a way to keep the system cheaper and more energy efficient. By comparison, Bitcoin mining is famously energy-intensive, and Ethereum staking requires a heavy up-front capital investment. Both chains – particularly Ethereum – incur significantly higher transaction fees than XRPL.  However, XRPL is undeniably more centralized in terms of the raw number of validators that operate its network. There are around 100 validators on the XRP network – multiple orders of magnitude lower than on Bitcoin, which is powered by over 1 million miners (though Bitcoin’s system has its own issues with concentrated power).  Moreover, only around 35 validators are on XRPL’s most-used default UNL, meaning fewer than three dozen entities play an outsized role in keeping the chain alive and truthful (if enough of these operators collude to sabotage the network, they could, at the very least, disrupt the chain’s liveness).  PoA is also pitched as more secure for partner institutions since only “trusted” entities run the chain.  “You can't just come in with a billion dollars and say, ‘I have enough for 1,000 Ethereum validators, I'm gonna run them all; I just bought my way into owning part of Ethereum consensus,’ or ‘I'm gonna buy a bunch of mining hardware, and I have more money than you, so I can get a larger share of Bitcoin protocol consensus than you can,’” explained Red Sheehan, a research analyst at Messari who writes regular reports on XRPL commissioned by Ripple Labs. “That's just not possible with Proof of Association.”  However, decentralization purists hold that PoA systems undermine the whole point of distributed ledgers – the idea that trust should be removed from the equation.  XRP token  Ripple’s critics take particular aim at the initial distribution of the XRP token. Ripple Labs takes pains to distinguish “Ripple” from “XRP,"" asserting that the initial distribution of XRP tokens, which saw 80% go to Ripple Labs and 20% to its founders, was a ""gift"" from the open-source developers of XRPL. This is despite Ripple Labs' significant role in constructing the chain.  Over time, Ripple Labs has divested a large portion of its XRP holdings, sometimes selling over-the-counter to institutional investors, and at other times to retail investors through cryptocurrency exchanges via so-called programmatic sales.  Ripple Labs remains the largest holder of XRP tokens, which has led to concerns that it can hurt or manipulate the asset’s price. However, most of the firm’s remaining XRP is held in an escrow account, which restricts Ripple Labs from selling any more than 1 billion XRP in any given month.  Smart contracts and sidechains  Placing XRP’s initial distribution and XRPL’s consensus mechanism aside, the XRPL ecosystem has struggled to find much adoption outside of a limited set of use-cases.  On one hand, Ripple’s proprietary “RippleNet” product suite, which is based on XRPL, has begun to see increasing adoption from banks. According Sheehan, “Institutional tools – whether that be on-demand liquidity or whether that be CBDCs – seem ahead, I'd say, of other chains.”  On the other hand, says Sheehan, adoption of retail focused XRPL use-cases, like NFTs, have struggled to find the same footing.  Part of why XRP has struggled to attract users may be due to XRP Ledger’s lack of programmable smart contracts – the blockchain-based computer programs that most modern blockchains, like Ethereum, use to power their community-run NFT and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.  The former Ripple Labs employee that spoke to CoinDesk says criticisms of XRPL’s tech should consider the chain’s age: “It’s literally a decade old. It’s easy for the Ethereum community to look at it today and be like ‘Oh my god, you can't even do smart contracts, that's ridiculous.’ But it's older than Ethereum.”  XRP, to its credit, had one of the first decentralized exchanges (DEX). It was also home to some of the earliest NFTs. However, XRPL’s DEX and NFT ecosystem lack the richness and flexibility of those found on newer blockchains, and they’ve failed to achieve much adoption as a result.  Luckily, there’s a chance that XRP Ledger’s programmability may soon expand. Several third parties are building “sidechains” that write transactions to XRPL, but can extend upon its capabilities via more complex features like smart contracts. One sidechain currently in testing is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, meaning it could theoretically open up the XRP ecosystem to some of the same apps and smart contracts that live on Ethereum and similar blockchains.  There is also an official proposal to introduce “hooks” directly to the XRPL network. Almost like mini smart contracts, hooks – which are currently in testing – will allow people to add code that auto-executes on certain types of transactions.  Ripple’s future  When Ripple first came on the market in 2012, it was among the first blockchain projects to unabashedly embrace traditional banks. It was also one of the very first blockchains to depart from Bitcoin’s mining system. Both of these moves earned it scorn within the crypto community – a sentiment that pervades today.  Despite a checkered reputation in some corners of the crypto community, Ripple’s SEC lawsuit has won it new allies – some grudging, others more enthusiastic.  Many of the XRP about-faces are rooted in politics – eg. ‘the enemy of Gary Gensler is my friend’. Others, though, have signaled a willingness to re-assess Ripple as a whole.  For instance, Ryan Selkis, the Messari founder and former XRP critic, has called for the industry to rally behind the project.  “I've been critical of Ripple in the past (various reasons), but more aligned with them than ever before,” he said in March in a now-deleted tweet. “Ripple should win the overreaching XRP-SEC case, and the XRP Ledger should be afforded the opportunity to compete fairly on digital payments infra globally. Demand is there!” (Selkis appears to have deleted all of his tweets from before May 28, 2023 – not this one in particular.)  But it’s not just the SEC lawsuit that has won Ripple new friends.  Centralization is better understood in 2023 as a spectrum, and low-fee, “permissioned” blockchain projects are much more common now than they were in 2012. Ripple’s banker-friendly ambitions – a far cry from Bitcoin’s libertarian/anarchist roots – also look far more familiar today than they would have looked 10 years ago.  Ripple may have a hard time swaying Ethereum and Bitcoin maximalists to its side, but there’s a clear demand for institution-friendly blockchain products among investors and developers. If Ripple Labs manages to weather the SEC case – and if XRPL can make good on its progress towards improved programmability – the project may be well-positioned to seize on a new wave of hype.",NEUTRAL,ETH | XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | WALLET | XRP,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/19/xrp-blockchain-still-faces-centralization-caveats-as-ripple-regulatory-threat-recedes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc663d69b6a423135ed829fc74526b5608020cc7-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393029,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF3E3,1689797584,Tesla Didn’t Buy or Sell Any Bitcoin for Fourth Straight Quarter in Q2,"Electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) did not buy or sell any bitcoin for the fourth straight quarter in Q2 2023, the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday after the market close.  The net value of its digital assets at the end of the quarter was $184 million, the same as it's been for the past three quarters. At the end of the second quarter, the price of bitcoin was roughly $30,400, up from about $28,500 at the end of the first quarter. However, current accounting rules don’t allow the valuation of digital assets to be increased when prices rise unless the assets are sold, but they can be reduced when prices decline, even before a sale.  Tesla hasn’t bought or sold any bitcoin since last year’s second quarter, when it sold more than 30,000 bitcoins, or roughly 75% of its holdings, for $936 million. The company initially bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in early 2021, with CEO Elon Musk giving a boost to bitcoin prices by also saying Tesla would accept bitcoin as payment for its cars, which Musk eventually backtracked on.  For the second quarter, Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.91, versus the consensus analyst estimate of $0.80, according to FactSet. Revenue of $24.9 billion beat analyst estimates of $24.2 billion.  Shares were up 1% to $288.96 in after-hours trading. Shares are up more than 136% this year.  CORRECTION (July 19 20:28 UTC): A previous version of the story mistakenly stated that Tesla's adjusted Q2 earnings per share were $0.78, instead of $0.91.

15078604,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/crypto-market-analysis-for-h1-according-to-coinmarketcap,1689796813,Crypto Market Analysis for H1 According to CoinMarketCap,"CoinMarketCap has released a report on the global crypto market after H1. The report delves into a general market overview, recent key events, and what it expects H2’s key themes will be. Today, CoinMarketCap, the world’s leading price-tracking website for crypto assets, released its 2023 H1 Crypto Market Analysis Report. Crypto Market Kicks 2023 Off Strong The crypto market started this year with a bang witnessing the bitcoin price doubling, the rise of L2s such as Arbitrum and ZK, and the NFT market showing signs of improvement. By the end of Q2, the global crypto market capitalization reached an impressive $1.17 trillion, marking a 48% YTD increase. Q1 and Q2, however, concluded with similar total market caps, meaning Q2 showed much less growth. Q2 was instead characterized by trends such as the “memecoin” frenzy and the rise of BRC20 tokens, which, despite being noteworthy, did not garner the same excitement as the previous quarter’s developments. Market sentiment improved significantly by the end of Q1, with the CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index registering at a neutral 52 – a vast improvement over the start of the year, which registered a fearful 30. According to CMC’s report, the Total Spot Trade Volume of the Top 20 Crypto Exchanges peaked in March but declined by around 36% quarter-on-quarter. Top Growing Sectors Despite what can only be called challenging market conditions, certain industry sectors witnessed remarkable growth in market cap year-to-date. VR/AR (704%0 and AI & Big Data (323%) exceeded expectations, while blue-chip decentralized finance (DeFi) projects appear to be making a strong comeback. The “memecoin” frenzy saw the sector add over 260 new coins YTD, with AI & Big Data taking second place, adding 61 coins. DeFi ranked third, adding 47 new listings YTD. Bitcoin and Ethereum Developments The market’s top tokens, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experienced several events, resulting in noteworthy price fluctuations. CMC’s Top Views CoinMarketCap saw a surge in views from the memecoin sector as $PEPE took the industry by storm. PEPE’s explosive rally of over 3700x from April to May sparked particular interest in the sector, and it joined CMC’s “Most Added to Watchlist.” Memes also registered the most engagement in CMC Community. The DeFi sector registered sustained interest throughout the year’s first half to become the second most viewed. Sector interest largely focused on Terra Classic (LUNC) as Binance burned 2.65 billion LUNC tokens, worth approximately $236,000. AI and Big Data have undoubtedly marked 2023 following the launch of OpenAI’s revolutionary ChatGPT, and it is reflected in views. Best Performing Coins Arbitrum ecosystem tokens such as Pendle (PENDLE) and Radiant Capital (RDNT) appeared to be H1’s top gainers, along with Optimist ecosystem tokens such as Velodrome Finance (VELO). Other top gainers include layer-one blockchains, including Dione Protocol (DIONE), Conflux (CFX), and Injective (INJ). AI-related tokens such as SingularityNET (AGIX) and Render (RNDR) also performed well. Key Themes for H2 CoinMarketCap identified the key themes for the second half of 2023. Bitcoin ETFs The crypto news cycle has recently been dominated by talks of Bitcoin ETFs after BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the SEC. News of BlackRock’s application spurred a host of other firms, such as Valkyrie, Fidelity and 21 Shares, to announce they are also seeking ETF approval. The SEC has yet to approve any of the applications. Should the regulator grant these ETFs, they could unlock substantial investor demand by offering regulated products for asset allocation. Decentralized Public Infrastructure Networks One of H2’s key themes will be Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN). DePIN is still in its early stages of expansion and aims to provide solutions for access sharing of physical assets or services like warehousing and data networks. Real World Assets (RWAs) The tokenization of assets has become an increasing focus for the crypto asset industry. Projects focused on making RWAs tradeable on-chain largely consist of credit market protocols such as Maple Finance and Goldfinch allow businesses to use DeFi to secure financing and loans. Liquid Staking Derivative (LSDs) Liquid Staking Derivative witnessed a dramatic surge in activity in H1 owing largely to Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade. Market leaders such as Lido and Rocket Pool saw their TVLs rise 138% and 220%, respectively. By the end of June, LSD platforms secured over a third of Ethereum’s Total Value Staked. Restaking The introduction of EigenLayer – a middleware platform which allows staked ETH or liquid staked ETH tokens to be reused on the consensus layer, prompted restaking as an emerging theme in H1. Restaking was in demand after EigenLayer’s Restaking Smart Contracts were deployed and reached their maximum limits within a day of the mainnet launch. zkSync zkSync, a zero-knowledge roll-up solution, emerged as a popular Ethereum-based layer-2 solution and strong competitor against Ethereum optimistic roll-ups, including Optimism and Arbitrum. zkSync utilizes zero-knowledge technology to offload traffic from Ethereum to an efficient second layer, helping to increase Ethereum’s throughput while enabling an array of new applications. Modular Blockchains (Celestia) Most layer-1 blockchains are monolithic chains that result in issues surrounding efficiency, stemming from the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security and scalability. Modular blockchains like Celestia address these issues by separating blockchains into three layers: execution, settlement, consensus and data availability. In doing so, modular blockchains provide developers with modular data availability and consensus layers which dApps and sidechains can leverage to bootstrap development. FTX Bankruptcy Developments After FTX collapsed, its depositors could not determine how much of the almost $9 billion shortfall could be collected during the liquidation process. In January, it emerged that more than $5 billion in liquid assets were collected, and this number subsequently increased to $7 billion. The firm overseeing FTX’s restructuring recently contacted creditors, giving them a “Customer Bar Date” of September 29, 2023. Debtors are, however, unlikely to receive a payout until at least H2 2024. Bitcoin Remains Most-Viewed Crypto Across All Regions Regional differences in interest in various crypto sectors were insignificant. Bitcoin continues as the most-viewed crypto across all regions in H1 2023, similar to data from Q4 2022. Bitcoin’s dominance over altcoins increased by 25% from 40.09% at the beginning of the year to 50.39% at the end of H1. As expected, the US continues to dominate the distribution of crypto users worldwide. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42393060,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF3yD,1689794938,SEC Chair Gensler Cites 'Wild West' of Crypto in Case to Increase Agency's Budget,"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler made a pitch for tens of millions of dollars in additional funding for his agency’s multi-billion budget at the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations on Wednesday, telling lawmakers the agency must expand to, among other things, protect investors against a crypto industry “rife with noncompliance.”  “We’ve seen the Wild West of the crypto markets, rife with noncompliance, where investors have put hard-earned assets at risk in a highly speculative asset class,” Gensler said in his prepared remarks.  “With funding to meet the scale of our mission, we can be an even stronger advocate for the American public—investors and issuers alike,” he said.  The SEC, which has undertaken wide-ranging efforts to crack down on crypto crimes, is seeking an additional $72 million to add dozens of additional full-time staff members to its roster, Gensler said. A bipartisan bill the committee approved last week to bankroll the SEC $2.364 billion for fiscal year 2024 is just enough to “support currently authorized staffing levels given inflation,” the chairman argued.  The SEC employed 4,685 people in 2023, with roughly half focusing on enforcement and examinations duties, according to data Gensler shared in his remarks. The additional funding would help the agency add 170 positions to its teams, in addition to providing full-year funding for staff members hired in 2023, potentially bringing the SEC’s total full-time equivalent to 5,139 employees.  “With funding to meet the scale of our mission, we can be an even stronger advocate for the American public—investors and issuers alike,” Gensler said. “Stamping out fraud, manipulation, and abuse lowers risk in the system.”  'Where was the SEC?'  Lawmakers' questions during the hearing signaled a range of attitudes toward crypto and toward the SEC's approach to regulating it.  Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) grilled Gensler on why the SEC did not nip the alleged fraud at failed crypto exchange FTX in the bud.  ""Here's [former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried] who did everything but buy Mount Rushmore and you weren't curious where this guy’s getting this money?” Kennedy asked. “Where was the SEC?” (Gensler noted FTX was headquartered in the Bahamas and that bringing enforcement actions takes time.)  Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) sounded suspicious of crypto generally and asked Gensler if the SEC had enough funds to police the industry.  On the other end of the spectrum, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) rattled off metrics that may be familiar to CoinDesk readers but not the general public – stablecoin market share, the number of blockchain developers in the U.S. – to underscore his concern that the SEC's ""regulation by enforcement"" and unclear rules are driving business and innovation offshore.

42393028,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgF38v,1689794906,The GBTC Discount Is Narrowing; Here's Why It Matters,"The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is an almost $14 billion market cap product that’s a giant in crypto investing. For more than two years, the fund traded at an increasingly widening discount to the value of the bitcoin it holds, but that’s turned around significantly in recent weeks, rewarding investors.  “When the discount narrows, it suggests that investors are becoming more confident in the trust or that demand for the shares is increasing. If the discount narrows significantly or disappears completely, it could lead to a substantial return for investors,” said Martin Leinweber, a digital asset product strategist at MarketVector Index, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Why has there been a discount in the first place, why does that matter and why is it shrinking?  The structure of the trust matters a lot when answering these questions. It’s a closed-end fund (CEF), which is a different product than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have exploded in popularity in recent years. Both are effectively vaults that hold a pile of assets, be it stocks or, in the case of the Grayscale trust, billions of dollars worth of bitcoin (BTC).  But ETFs have a feature that ensures specialized trading firms known as authorized participants can help keep their value closely in line with the value of the assets they hold. If an ETF owns $10 billion worth of stocks, but fetches $12 billion in market capitalization, these traders can create new shares of the ETF. Doing this allows them to make money due to the premium and also drives the ETF’s price down toward the value of the ETF’s holdings; they’re rewarded for making the ETF more efficient.  Conversely, if the ETF’s price drops to a discount – say its market cap falters to $8 billion, versus $10 billion in assets – those traders can redeem shares, again making money from the discrepancy and pushing prices and assets back toward parity.  Grayscale wants to turn GBTC into an ETF, though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected that. Grayscale has sued to overturn that decision. In the meantime, as a CEF, it lacks the arbitrage mechanism ETFs use to keep prices from getting out of whack.  GBTC has traded at a discount to its bitcoin holdings since February 2021. The situation dramatically worsened last year in the aftermath of FTX blowing up. In November, the lending arm of Genesis halted customer withdrawals, and the GBTC discount increased to 43%. Both Genesis and Grayscale are owned by Digital Currency Group (which also owns CoinDesk). Why Genesis’ woes hurt GBTC isn’t exactly clear, though theories include the fact that many trading firms were Genesis customers, and some of them could have been betting on a narrowing discount. Losing access to their money could’ve thwarted those trading strategies.  The GBTC discount deepened to a record 50% in December after the SEC reiterated its reasons for denying Grayscale’s application to convert the trust into an ETF.  So why has the discount narrowed so much in recent weeks, reaching about 25%, the smallest discount since early 2022?  There are few questions in crypto hotter at the moment than whether or not U.S. regulators will finally allow for the creation of ETFs that hold bitcoin (as opposed to the current landscape where the closest thing regulators have allowed are ETFs that hold bitcoin futures contracts). Traditional finance giant BlackRock recently put its enormous muscle behind the push, applying to create one of its own. Given its sway in Washington, D.C., as the world’s largest asset manager, this has generated a massive amount of optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF may not be far from reach. And others like Fidelity, the large mutual-fund manager, have also applied for bitcoin ETFs.  Read more: Deadlines for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals Come Into Sight  The possibility the SEC will approve the conversion of GBTC into an ETF is playing a role in the discount narrowing, according to analysts. Grayscale said in April it expects to learn by the end of the third quarter whether it will be allowed to turn GBTC into an ETF.  “The catalyst for the current narrowing of the GBTC discount could be the ongoing legal discussions around the possibility of GBTC converting to an ETF,” said Leinbewer. “The market appears to be responding to these discussions and the anticipation of a potential legal victory for GBTC could be driving increased demand for the shares. Think of the discount to [net asset value] as an implicit probability of getting converted to an ETF. The lower the discount, the higher the probability the market prices in.”  Referring to Grayscale’s lawsuit against the SEC, James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that he expects the decision to likely be favorable for Grayscale. “But this would simply send GBTC's ETF conversion request back to the SEC to either approve GBTC's conversion *OR* to deny for different reasons. This hope of conversion is likely what is driving the discount lower.”  Seyffart added: “We don't know how long it will take the SEC to approve these products.

The recent flurry of applications from large institutions for bitcoin spot ETF approvals in the U.S., has generated a lot of hope for Grayscale’s potential to convert GBTC into an ETF, Seyffart said.

42393061,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFGDJ,1689793372,Can Bitcoin Break Out of Its Funk? The Answer Appears to Be No,"Bitcoin’s and ether’s flat trading ranges appear poised to continue  With two weeks remaining in July, bitcoin is on track for its second losing month of 2023  The CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin Trend Indicator is still signaling an uptrend  While July has traditionally delivered solid returns for bitcoin (BTC), 2023 has left much to be desired, with the month’s malaise continuing on Wednesday.  The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has declined to 50 from 64 a week prior, indicating neutral sentiment among traders – perfectly reflecting the relative lack of action of late.  Though nearly two weeks remain in the month, BTC’s daily average returns this July of negative 0.096% have been its second lowest of 2023, behind only May. Similar price action applies to ether (ETH) at negative 0.07%, with that crypto now on track to post its first losing month of the year.  Historically, average daily performance in July for bitcoin and ether are a positive 0.105% and 0.46%, respectively.  In some ways, it’s difficult to take issue with the relative lack of performance. Bitcoin and ether have essentially decoupled from everything, including once strong correlations to traditional equity indexes that have essentially disappeared.  There’s also the dissipation of a previously strong inverse relationship between bitcoin and the U.S. dollar index, which runs counter to the narrative of BTC serving as an inflation hedge.  One relationship that remains strong is that between BTC and ETH, but even that correlation has declined to 70% in 2023 vs. ""normal readings in the 90% area.  Absent January and March this year, daily performance for bitcoin and ether have been relatively pedestrian, with the cryptos’ outperformance in 2023 for now being solely a first quarter story.  While there was a 20% advance for bitcoin in mid-June on the heels of BlackRock’s filing for a spot bitcoin ETF, there’s been a lack of new catalysts since, and a check of the docket doesn’t show any new catalysts immediately on the horizon.  It’s possible Thursday’s initial jobless claims figures may provide some additional context to the overall macroeconomic picture, with a read above consensus forecasts for 242,000 suggesting possible further easing in inflation and Federal Reserve rate hike forecasts.  Investors looking for a glimmer of bullish sentiment may find it in the CoinDesk Indices Trend Indicator (BTI) for both BTC and ETH. Currently, the BTI is signaling “uptrend” for both assets. Still, given the usage of short term moving averages in calculating the indices’ signals, both could fall into neutral territory in short order.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/19/can-bitcoin-break-out-of-its-funk-the-answer-appears-to-be-no,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a31411a75a414d4d48aac73a6ee6732c658bbcf8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
15076967,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543376,1689793249,"Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Spikes, Is This Bearish?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange inflow towards Binance has spiked during the past day, which may be bearish for the price. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Has Registered A Large Spike As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, a whale has made a large deposit to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The relevant indicator here is the “exchange inflow,” which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that investors send to a specific centralized exchange (which, in this case, is Binance). When the value of this metric is high, it means that the holders are depositing large amounts to the platform right now. The investors may have made these transfers for selling-related purposes, depending on which type of exchange these inflows are for. Naturally, if that is the case, the price could feel a bearish effect from the inflows. On the other hand, low values imply the exchange in question isn’t receiving that many coins currently. Such a trend would imply that the market’s selling pressure may be low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Broken This Open Interest Pattern, Quant Explains Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow for the cryptocurrency exchange Binance over the past day: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent hours | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflow for Binance has observed a rather large spike in the past day. With this deposit, around 4,451 BTC (approximately worth $133 million at the current exchange rate) has entered the platform’s wallets. Interestingly, this deposit has come from a whale that has bought 20,000 BTC over the last eight months, meaning that the investor still has over 15,000 BTC left in their wallet after the transaction. The whale may have made this transfer to take some profit at the current prices. Since the scale of the deposit is quite sizeable, it could potentially cause bearish ripples in the market. However, as another quant has explained, the deposits have been towards the derivatives side of the exchange and not the spot platform. Looks like the spot exchanges inflow hasn't moved today | Source: CryptoQuant It would appear likely that the transfer hasn’t been made to sell the coins (at least not directly) but rather for opening positions on the derivatives market. Related Reading: Signal With Perfect Track Record Predicts Bitcoin Bull Market Parabola: Analyst “This category of large wallets rarely moves directly to derivative exchanges,” notes the analyst, given that the size of the wallet in question is in the 10,000+ BTC range, the class of the largest whales on the network. Such a large position can lead to volatility in the Bitcoin price, but unlike selling from spot deposits, this price action may not necessarily be bearish for the asset.

15077152,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/polygon-eyes-governance-restructure-for-2-0-roadmap-pol-matic,1689793200,Polygon Eyes Governance Restructure For 2.0 Roadmap $POL $MATIC,"The developers behind Polygon Labs have proposed changes to their governance system, with proposed changes that are integral to their forthcoming Polygon 2.0 roadmap, which aims to establish multiple layer-2 networks on the Polygon platform. The new proposed governance structure will be comprised of ""three main pillars"", each catering to a distinct function. A New Approach to Governance The first pillar involves the expansion of the Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) framework, currently limited to the Polygon PoS chain, to all applications and blockchains that run on the Polygon network. This adjustment will allow community members to propose and research upgrades that could potentially become part of the protocols. The second pillar, termed ""System Smart Contracts Governance,"" is designed to facilitate upgrades for software implemented as smart contracts. The developers propose the creation of an Ecosystem Council, a body elected by the community, to oversee these changes. The third pillar, the ""Community Treasury"", aims to support the growth of the Polygon ecosystem and fund projects. Initially, the Treasury will be managed by an independent Community Treasury Board before transitioning to community governance. Community input will play a crucial role in determining the final shape of the governance plans. Therefore, Polygon Labs has encouraged developers, network validators, and other stakeholders to engage in discussions regarding the proposals. Community Deliberation and the Three Governance Pillars Polygon 2.0 is a reimagination of the current Polygon ecosystem. The proposal for the new governance structure seeks to address the complexities of blockchain governance and proposes a decentralized framework for decision-making over all Polygon protocols and the ecosystem. The proposal borrows elements from existing successful blockchain governance models, including Ethereum's open, inclusive governance ethos. The ""Three Governance Pillars"" are designed to provide governance over the entire Polygon ecosystem and define suitable decision makers for each pillar. Protocol Governance and System Smart Contracts Governance The first pillar, Protocol Governance, involves the expansion of the PIP framework to cover all of Polygon's permissionless stack. The goal is to give the community a formal way to propose upgrades that could potentially become part of the protocols. The second pillar, System Smart Contracts Governance, proposes the creation of an Ecosystem Council to upgrade system smart contracts. The Council will ensure the ongoing upgradeability of the protocol components implemented as smart contracts. Community Treasury Governance The third pillar, Community Treasury Governance, proposes the creation of a self-sustainable ecosystem fund, the Community Treasury. The fund will support the growth of the Polygon ecosystem and fund projects and initiatives. The potential transformation outlined in the Polygon 2.0 governance proposal reflects the platform's commitment to decentralization and community empowerment. In this sense, ommunity-driven governance models are increasingly becoming as critical components of key platforms such as Polygon. This governance restructure, if adopted, may effectively position Polygon as a forerunner in this new phase of blockchain development. However, it is the community's acceptance and participation that will ultimately determine the realization of this vision. With this plan, Polygon could potentially pave the way for a future where the community holds the reins of blockchain protocols, fostering a truly decentralized ecosystem.

Today, we explore two notable developments: PancakeSwap price rise following its partnership with Google Cloud and Tradecurve's anticipation of a listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. PancakeSwap (CAKE): A Boost From Google Cloud Partnership PancakeSwap has witnessed a surge in price following its recent partnership with Google Cloud. Collaborating with Google Cloud, a leading cloud computing service provider, brings enhanced security, scalability, and reliability to the PancakeSwap ecosystem. This partnership enables Google Cloud to provide users with access to BNB endpoints. Additionally, it offers platform scalability, which can handle high traffic. This partnership has instilled confidence among investors and traders, leading to increased demand and a subsequent rise in the PancakeSwap coin price. Currently, the PancakeSwap coin value sits at $1.51 with a market cap of $315M, a rise of 1.05% in the last 24 hours. Not only that, the PancakeSwap trading volume increased by 37.56% in that same period, reaching $30,248,679. All signs for the PancakeSwap coin are bullish, so experts predict a rise to $1.66 soon. Tradecurve (TCRV): Awaiting Listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko Tradecurve, the unique trading platform that brings forth the best features of CEX and DEX, has set its sights on securing listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Tradecurve's visibility and trustworthiness would be significantly increased by being listed on these platforms, bringing in more users and perhaps increasing trading volume. Supporting Worldwide Traders Tradecurve will be a borderless trading platform that any trader can sign up for with a working email only. As it requires no sign-up KYC checks, traders will remain completely anonymous as they access all derivatives on one account. Not only that, Tradecurve also offers high leverage, starting at 500:1, and the ability to subscribe to AI-driven trading bots. Tradecurve could become a fan-favorite for millions of worldwide traders. This is with regulation often limiting access to such advanced trading tools and highly leveraged products based on geographical location. This is now slowly becoming a reality as over 12,500 users have registered for Tradecurve, and the number is rising daily. Providing an Excellent Return on Investment (ROI) The platform's native token, TCRV, is now worth $0.018 in Stage 4 of its presale. Those who purchased it during Stage 1 now enjoy an 80% ROI. It has significant long-term potential, and as it moves through the presale phases, the price of each token will rise. The price increase is expected when Stage 5 begins by the end of July, pushing the value up by 40%. TCRV is well-positioned to experience a surge in value. It is expanding its reach into multiple financial markets. This includes the forex market, which saw a $7.5T daily turnaround in April 2022. Analysts now predict this emerging presale star will soar by 50x before its presale finishes. So sign up for it below and capitalize off of this projected growth.

This function is described as a token reward system for holders of Bitcoin and BRC-20 tokens. OKX Unveils Staking System On Multichain Wallet On Tuesday, OKX unveiled a new functionality on its multichain digital asset wallet, which enables users to stake Bitcoin (BTC) and BRC-20 tokens. According to the company’s media release, this token reward system is possible due to the integration of OKX’s open-source BRC20-S protocol. Related Reading: Pre-Mined Ethereum Worth $116M Moves After 8 Years: Is A Major Price Dip Imminent? This protocol is an extended version of the BRC-20 standard that integrates functionalities for staking operations, like depositing, minting, and withdrawing. It allows users to earn BRC20-S tokens through the OKX Web3 DeFi aggregator. Furthermore, the BRC20-S protocol enables decentralized finance (DeFi) developers and projects to create staking pools on OKX Wallet. With these staking pools, Bitcoin holders and BRC-20 token holders can receive BRC20-S tokens. Additionally, this will help DeFi projects drive up user engagement and community-building efforts, according to OKX’s press statement. Jason Lau, OKX’s Chief Innovation Officer, claims that the wallet is the first multichain digital asset storage to support Bitcoin and BRC-20 token staking. “We have heard from OKX Wallet users that they want more opportunities to participate in the ecosystem, and we are thrilled to deliver that for them,” the CIO said. This staking capability comes as an addition to an existing host of Web3 Earn products on the OKX wallet. In the announcement, the company also mentioned the future introduction of complementary features, like a marketplace for selling BRC20-S tokens. OKX Wallet Announces Integration With Kava Blockchain In a separate announcement, OKX Wallet disclosed its partnership with Kava, an EVM-compatible blockchain built with Cosmos’ SDK (Software Development Kit). This integration will reportedly enrich the users’ options for digital asset transfer and transactions on the wallet. This represents another positive move by OKX Wallet in pursuit of maximum customer satisfaction as only a few days ago, the multichain wallet unveiled a partnership with PulseChain, another blockchain platform.

Users now pay a base fee that is subsequently burned, effectively removing ether from circulation forever. This approach significantly impacted the token’s supply, resulting in a monthly burn rate of approximately 146,000 ETH. The London Hard Fork And Its Deflationary Impact Integrated into the Ethereum network on August 5, 2021, the London hard fork brought a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency’s transaction fee structure. Through the EIP-1559, the network introduced a unique mechanism that involved the burning of a significant portion of transaction fees, known as the “base fee.” This innovative approach aimed to counterbalance Ethereum’s inflation while providing block rewards and priority fees to miners. Related Reading: ARK Invest CEO Says Firm Is Still Bullish On Coinbase Despite Selling COIN Stocks As a result, the base fee is permanently removed from circulation, leading to a deflationary effect on the token’s supply. The scale of the burn has been enormous, with over 3.46 million ETH, worth $6.68 billion, annihilated since the London hard fork’s enforcement. This translates to an average monthly burn rate of more than 146,000 ETH over the 710-day period that followed the upgrade. 146,000 ETH burned per month | Source: Beaconcha.in Ethereum’s deflationary path effectively offset the issuance of new tokens, curbing its supply growth by approximately 0.1% annually. Leading Contributors To The Ethereum Burn The principal factors driving Ethereum’s burn phenomenon include regular ETH transfers, non-fungible token (NFT) transactions on Opensea, and activities on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. Regular ETH transfers accounted for the most substantial reduction in supply, leading to the incineration of nearly 300,000 ETH. Uniswap v2 follows closely, with $56.5 million worth of ETH burned since the hard fork, while transfers of Tether stablecoins contributed to the destruction of $50.5 million worth of ETH. ETH price struggles to hold $1,900 support | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Blockchain gaming platform Axie Infinity and Uniswap v3 each burned $32 million and $30 million worth of ETH, respectively. At the same time, the number of ETH staked in the Ethereum Beacon contract has also been on the rise. It is now sitting at over 26.87 million ETH, translating to a dollar value of $51.35 billion. Related Reading: USDC Market Cap Drops As Redemptions Climb To $1.4 Billion With the Ethereum supply sitting at 120.2 million, it means that over 11% of its supply is currently locked up while the burn continues to take coins out of circulation.

42393053,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFFT9,1689785669,UK FCA Chief Warns Against Judging Crypto Firms by Size for Approval Decisions,"The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is not swayed by the size of crypto companies when granting regulatory approval, its CEO Nikhil Rathi told lawmakers at a Treasury Select Committee hearing on Wednesday.  The FCA is in charge of registering and overseeing crypto companies that wish to operate in the country under existing anti-money laundering requirements. The financial regulator has received over 300 applications from crypto firms since opening its register two years ago but only 42 firms have managed to register with the regulator so far.  ""We went through a very tough period with the industry over the last 18 months or two years because we turned down applications from some of the largest crypto firms in the world,"" Rathi said during the hearing. In 2021, the FCA famously judged that Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, was not capable of being supervised.  ""And we did that not because we were anti-innovation but because we were given a job to make sure money laundering standards were met and they could not convince us that they were meeting them, so we turned the application[s] down because we want clean markets here,"" Rathi continued.  He also warned against regulators considering the size of the firm and market share when assessing applications for registration.  ""There are some people that will try and suggest we should have a metric for market share and I just encourage everybody to think really hard about whether you really want a regulator to be talking about metric because that would give a bias towards larger companies,"" Rathi said.  Instead, he wants regulators to make ""robust decisions"" when authorizing firms.  The U.K. could soon see a new authorization regime for crypto firms, which would require all companies wishing to operate in the country to apply for a FCA license – including oversees firms reaching out to local customers. The FCA was given more powers to regulate the crypto industry and ensure consumer protection when the country's new markets bill passed into law in June, and more crypto rules are expected to follow.

42393055,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFFdP,1689784697,‘Get a Horse!’: What Crypto Can Learn From Early Automakers' Struggle for Acceptance,"A fascinating time capsule came across my desktop this week. Originally published in 1930, this Saturday Evening Post essay by automotive pioneer Alexander Winton recounts his early efforts, beginning in the 1890s, to convince the public that the “horseless carriage” was the future.  Winton was a Columbus, Ohio-based bicycle manufacturer who turned to developing cars, and by 1898 completed one of the first commercial sales of an automobile in the United States. That vehicle is now in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Winton’s story is fascinating in itself, and also offers broader insights into how new technologies develop and spread. The parallels to challenges faced by crypto developers are particularly uncanny: Winton describes facing down endless mockery, fraudulent competitors, the hostility of banks – and a case of automotive “patent trolling” that calls to mind a particularly notorious crypto figure.  These common threads between the development of the automobile and of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology aren’t simply a cosmic coincidence. The same challenges have accompanied many modern innovations, thanks above all to the way capitalist investment and speculation shape human behavior.  ‘Dishonest practices did much harm when support was most needed.’  Most notable in Winton’s account is the difficulty he found separating his real (and ultimately very successful) auto company from both competitors with flawed ideas, and from outright frauds.  The well-intentioned bad ideas for cars are fascinating to look back on. One early automaker built a literal mechanical horse, which rode on a single wheel and attached to buggy shafts just like a real horse. It was guided not by a steering wheel, but with reins attached to the “mouth” of the motorized stallion. Other early experimental cars ran on compressed natural gas (yikes), steam, compressed air and even, yes, electricity.  These were honest efforts that failed thanks to technological flaws or market mismatches. They parallel a variety of early digital cash efforts, from Liberty Reserve through Colored Coins on Bitcoin – useful iterations that didn’t become long-term functional products.  (Winton also refers to a late 19th century technology magazine called “The Horseless Age.” These lunatics dared to start a publication about a transformative technology that barely existed, and … well, you can draw your own parallels.)  An even more intriguing and perhaps surprising parallel in Winton’s account, though, is the huge threat that fraudulent operators posed to legitimate early auto manufacturers. In autos, as in crypto, this often took the form of investment fraud by fly-by-night operators who capitalized on a speculative frenzy to fleece the naïve and unlucky.  See also: It's Not Just Fraud That Chilled Crypto Regulation | Opinion  “We had to … fight the wildcat automobile companies on the outside,” Winton wrote of those early days. “It was difficult for the public to distinguish between the genuine and the ephemeral, and there are towns that can still [in 1930] point to windowless factories that were built [in the 1890s] from the stock sold by glib promoters, but which never manufactured more than two or three cars.”  Winton claims that more than 500 automobile companies “came in and went out” in the early years of the industry. That incredible churn, too, sounds more than a little familiar.  ‘To advocate replacing the horse marked one as an imbecile.'  Aside from diverting investment capital from better projects, these frauds fed skepticism of the very idea of the automobile. Not unlike the way crypto critics will often point to PayPal or Venmo as perfectly acceptable digital payments tools (pro tip: they’re not), automobile skeptics were just fine with existing transportation technology: horses and trains.  Winton cites a reporter named E.P. Ingersol, who argued that the idea that automobiles would compete with trains for long-distance travel “is visionary to the point of lunacy.” That comment was made in response to the truly unhinged 1899 proposal of a bus line between Chicago and St. Louis.  Winton, already a successful bicycle manufacturer when he started tinkering with cars, also got heat from his own banker. The financier told him, “You’re crazy if you think this fool contraption you’ve been wasting your time on will ever displace the horse.”  To try and make his case, Winton cited inventor Thomas Edison’s opinion that automobiles would “add to the general wealth” by making commerce more efficient. The banker, displaying an all too familiar mindset, dismissed Edison’s comments as “just another inventor talking.”  ‘If we worked out a good idea, we loaned that.’  A final parallel will also be striking to those who follow the crypto industry closely. Winton describes a familiar environment of collaboration between very early automobile makers, including his own generous aid to the young Henry Ford in designing a steering wheel.  “Lawyers have tried to argue me into bringing suits for infringements,” Winton recounts, “But it so happened we pioneers always worked together. We loaned ideas. We loaned tools. We loaned patents.”  That ethos has since been formalized in the software world through open-source licensing. But as Winton and his contemporaries found out, not everyone is inclined to share and share alike. It seems those who fail to turn ideas into successful products are particularly inclined to get selfish with the ideas themselves, turning into parasitic “patent trolls.”  See also: Better Policy Can Turn NFTs Into an Intellectual Property Powerhouse | Opinion  Winton recounts the tale of one George Baldwin Selden, who was granted a patent covering “the essential principles of an automobile” in 1879. After failing for nearly two decades to actually create a product, Selden partnered with an investor in 1899 to begin a campaign of lawsuits against actual manufacturers, including Winton himself. Ultimately several manufacturers had to pay licensing fees to parties who contributed nothing meaningful to their creations.  Currently Craig Wright, whose claims to be the inventor of Bitcoin have been widely discredited, seems poised to undertake a similar campaign of patent enforcement against more successful blockchain projects. Thankfully, Wright’s abysmal track record in court may mean this is a minor threat.  In Winton’s case, the licensing payments lasted only a few years, as the real innovators moved away from the static ideas controlled by Selden and his partner.

In September 2022, the exchange operator made a major push into crypto, having announced plans to launch a service that would offer bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) custody services for institutional clients. The rollout was expected to take effect by the end of Q2. The pullback -- a blow to U.S. institutional adoption of crypto -- comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of the space. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, has filed a raft of lawsuits against some of crypto's biggest players, including Coinbase Global ( COIN ) and Binance. Nasdaq ( NDAQ ), nevertheless, will continue to develop its technology to handle crypto for clients. “We remain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital asset ecosystem in a variety of ways,” Friedman said. She added that now is ""not the right time"" to enter the crypto custodian business as ""the fundamental business opportunity changed over the last several months.” Earlier, the operator of the Nasdaq stock exchange turned in stronger than expected top and bottom lines.

Bitfarms said on Wednesday that one deal, worth up to 50 MW, is located in Villarrica, close to where Bitfarms already has operations, while the second deal, worth up to 100MW, is located in Yguazu, close to the Itaipu hydroelectric power plant.  “Paraguay has access to an abundance of surplus renewable power, and these acquisitions secure valuable, yet limited, sustainable energy contracts while broadening our foothold in a resource-rich country,” Geoff Morphy, CEO of Bitfarms, said in a statement.  Bitfarms plans to start the construction in Villarica in the first quarter of 2023, with the construction of a substation first and a mining facility later. In Yguazu, on the other hand, the company has the opportunity to build a new farm of up to 100 MW, although the starting date has yet to be determined.  In both locations, Bitfarms said the price per kilowatt hour (kWh) will be $0.039 before value-added tax and wouldn’t be adjusted for inflation.  In May, Bitfarms announced that it accelerated its stated timeframe for reaching 6 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power by the end of the third quarter, and its per-share loss narrowed significantly on a quarter-by-quarter basis.

DOGE's price spiked to as high as $0.072 from $0.069 late Wednesday morning after Musk's post. The token just as quickly pared some of its gains and was trading at just under $0.070 at press time, still ahead about 2% over the past 24 hours.  Shiba inu coin (SHIB), the second largest dog-themed crypto by market value after DOGE, also experienced a bump in price but has since mostly retraced that move.  Elon Musk has a long history of making public comments about crypto in general and dogecoin in particular, and markets have just as long of a history in quickly reacting to those comments. Last week, artificial intelligence-related tokens surged on the news about Musk unveiling an AI-focused venture to take on popular chatbot ChatGPT.  There is speculation in crypto circles that Musk might be a large DOGE holder given his particular interest in the token. Notably, he dedicated a segment to it on his appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" show in 2021 May, which coincided with DOGE hitting its all-time high price of 73 cents, according to CoinGecko. The token has lost some 90% of its market value since then.  Interestingly, Musk's comments today come ahead of Tesla (TSLA) second quarter earnings report later Wednesday afternoon.

Societe Generale has its own cryptocurrency division, SG Forge, which is now licenced to offer the buying, selling, and custody of digital assets. According to the press release on the SG Forge website, being in possession of a DASP (Digital Asset Service Provider) licence means that Societe Generale has demonstrated: “a comprehensive level of security and reliability of compliance, internal control and cybersecurity processes and systems, as well as the maintenance of sufficient regulatory capital” Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of Societe Generale Forge said of the licence acquisition: “With the DASP license approval, Societe Generale – FORGE confirms its pioneering role in the crypto assets ecosystem. This step will allow us to continue supporting our institutional clients wishing to benefit from services on digital assets that meet the highest standards of compliance and banking security.” Opinion With such an important French bank entering into the race to offer crypto services, this is an important feather in the cap of France’s ambitions to become the premier crypto hub in Europe. The UK will no doubt be following this move carefully. Being outside of the European Union, but still in Europe as it were, it has some advantages over its European competitors in being free to set its own agenda and plans for crypto supremacy in this part of the world. Other parts of the world that are hoping to take advantage of crypto technology, such as Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong etc., will also be watching these events closely. However, the US, the biggest economy in the world, is forced to sit on the sidelines, impotently watching as the rest of the world starts to divide up the technological spoils. As this happens, its watchdog financial agencies, the SEC, and the CFTC, are engaged in trying to erase the crypto industry from its shores, possibly under the assumption that crypto might be a threat to the dollar. It’s not just the US financial agencies either. So-called global financial agencies such as the IMF, the FATF, and others, with the addition of all central banks, are aligned in the same endeavour. Be that as it may, no technology in history has ever been successfully repressed for any length of time.

The announcement of ""Starknet Stacks"" is consistent with a growing trend in Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem, with key projects Polygon, Optimism, zkSync and Arbitrum now allowing developers to essentially clone their own software to spin up their own layer 2s. Potential benefits include the build-out of broader, interoperable blockchain ecosystems.  Under the new plan, described in a blog post published Wednesday from the main company behind the project, StarkWare, developers can build their appchains supposedly benefit from less congestion than on Starknet mainnet. The goal is to provide an easier user experience and more transaction throughput. In addition, the appchains could potentially allow developers to implement features that are not yet available on Starknet’s mainnet.  “The need for appchains, application-specific blockchains that are designed to service the needs of one specific application, has been apparent for several years and is now getting renewed attention,” the StarkWare team said in the blog post.  Starknet recently also went through a major upgrade, known as ‘Quantum Leap,’ which increased the number of transactions per second (TPS) as well as reduced confirmation times. Quantum Leap is also supposed to help make Starknet’s appchains easier to build on.

At its peak, the market cap of BNB went over $90 billion, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, the cryptocurrency has been ranging between $300 and $200 since the beginning of the year, bringing its market cap to $37.1 billion. With its current market cap, the coin is now the 5th-largest cryptocurrency after XRP overtook it to claim the fourth position. With less BNB floating around, the remaining tokens should become more scarce and valuable. However, scheduled or routine coin burns tend to have a negligible impact on price over the long run, as evidenced by BNB’s performance over the last day.

Considering the price of BNB is affected by various market conditions, past burns have had different outcomes on BNB. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $241.84 and is down by 2.39% over a 7-day timeframe. Trading volume in the past 24 hours is also down by 17.91% to $585 million.

42393045,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFEtF,1689782400,Professor Gary Gensler vs. SEC Chair Gary Gensler: Crypto Long & Short,"If you made a list of people whom the crypto community has taken issue with this year, you’d likely find U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s name near the top.  A quick search for his name via social media will deliver a sense of the sentiment currently held towards him. I do not recommend this by the way.  I actually started out as a supporter, for lack of a better term. Even today, I don’t hold any ill will towards him. I don’t know him personally and have no desire to be insulting. I think commentary specific to past statements and present actions are in bounds, however.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  My introduction to Gensler came years ago via the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) “Blockchain and Money” course. Now, keep in mind, I did not attend MIT. Outside of one trip to Fenway Park, I haven’t been within 100 miles of it.  But, in general, I’m very close to my laptop. And MIT did, and still does, offer the “Blockchain and Money” course online for the extremely affordable price of $0.  So, I sat through most of it because, why not? I was interested in blockchain technology, and I loved the price.  I found the course to be measured, informative and detailed. I would recommend that anyone interested in cryptocurrencies take it, to be honest. So, personally, I was pleased when Gensler was named SEC chair in April 2021, as I think many were.  Two years later, I think it’s safe to say that this has changed. As such, I decided to take a second look at the course. Given the current environment, I chose to focus on Lecture 8, which focused on Public Policy.  Granted we have the benefit of hindsight, but perhaps I would find that my disappointment is unfounded. Perhaps present actions are in line with past statements. At the very least I’d get to brush up on policy issues. I started with the assigned readings themselves:  “Cryptocurrencies: Oversight of New Assets in the Digital Age,” Gary Gensler (July 18, 2018)  “The Future of Money,” Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England (March 2, 2018)  “Nobel-winning economist: Authorities will bring down ‘hammer’ on bitcoin,” CNBC (July 9, 2018)  The first, from Gensler himself, was the longest and provided good context.  His opening salvo, “Blockchain technology has real potential to transform the world of finance,” is one that I initially viewed positively. The same applies to his follow-up: “I’m an optimist and want to see this new technology succeed.”  Yet, that stands in stark contrast to what he said last month from his perch atop one of the most powerful regulators: “Look, we don’t need more digital currency.”  Anyway, here are some other takeaways from Lecture 8:  Illicit activity has been a concern from day one  Gensler’s past statements seem consistent with what he says today. The need to guard against illicit activities and to ensure financial stability and that investors are protected appeared to be at the core of what was discussed in the lecture.  My interpretation is that Gensler believed that broad agreement existed around the need to curtail illicit activity, but that implementation of policies to do so was inconsistent.  This is where I think the SEC is attempting to make waves (some would say too many): by working to establish a framework of implementation that will be emulated on a global scale.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were referred to as crypto cash commodities, not securities  For all of the discussion around what is and what is not a security today, the course made little mention of BTC or ETH being securities. To the contrary, it was acknowledged that “in terms of market value, probably three-quarters of the space has already been determined by the SEC not to be a security.”  His recent commentary doesn’t seem opposite of this, but seems less definitive, especially specific to ether.  Crypto intermediaries were presented as a viable regulatory target  This is something that maybe I should’ve seen coming. While not discussed at length, approximately six minutes in, the topic of crypto intermediaries was broached and how they serve as viable regulatory targets. A question of why laws historically have been attached to intermediaries was raised as well.  The answer seemed to revolve around systemic risk, and the relative ease in regulating intermediaries chasing smaller entities.  This has been most evident in the recent SEC enforcement actions versus Coinbase and Binance. Allegations of operating as an unregistered securities exchange and broker were levied towards Coinbase. Binance was accused of the same, along with misrepresentation of trading controls.  Public policy strategy does more harm than good  One of the most salient revelations came near the end of the class, when the discussion of public policy development was raised. And I think this is at the heart of the contentious relationship between crypto advocates and Gensler’s SEC.  It was stated, in no uncertain terms, that in the crafting of public policy, “messaging” and “coalition building” are front and center. “Analysis” by comparison was almost an afterthought.  So, while crypto purists argue on the merits of digital asset efficiencies, consensus mechanisms and supply dynamics, crafters of public policy are simply attempting to drive a message home. Because of that mismatch, the two groups are horrible dance partners.  Read more: GOP Lawmakers Suggest Gensler’s SEC Is Gaming News Cycle to Thwart Crypto Legislation  Candidly, that was one of the more disheartening takeaways that I had. It leads me to believe that crypto’s primary critics are more than aware of the benefits of digital assets but are willing to completely ignore them for the benefit of their own messaging, biases … and possibly self-interests.  All told, I enjoyed taking a walk back through Lecture 8. I’ll probably go through others. I do question how the tone of the class would be if taught today, however.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  DOLLAR BILLS: One of the surprises when you dive deep into covering crypto as a journalist is just how much you have to know about things other than crypto. Knowing about corporate restructuring is often important these days. Some accounting chops can be very useful. And understanding the biggest market of all, foreign exchange, is crucial. Take this story about the relationship between crypto and the U.S. dollar. It’s full of talk of global liquidity, risk appetite, correlations and the like. Not crypto degen stuff!  XRP TIME?: For its adherents, the XRP token and its associated blockchain have long typified a core goal of crypto: removing friction in the global financial system. A main proposed use case: cross-border remittances, something that’s not exactly super cheap or easy via conventional banks. Yet, XRP has languished after U.S. regulators said in 2020 that it’s a security. Major exchanges delisted it. But Ripple, the company behind the token, fought that ruling and last week got some qualified good news: XRP sometimes isn’t a security. Major exchanges changed their tune and agreed to list it again. So now the question becomes: Can XRP, whose price shot up after the court ruling, start achieving that goal?  DIGITAL BONDS: For years, there’s been talk about the allures of moving conventional financial stuff onto blockchains: stocks, bonds, whatever. There is truly very little to show for all the hype, and many Wall Street blockchain initiatives are dead and buried. And yet! Hope is not lost. Take U.S. Treasuries, as an example. There are some promising signs that digital versions of the oldest of old school financial products are gaining traction. Lest you think I’m adding to the hype: This is still nascent. But digital bonds do seem increasingly to be becoming a thing.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/19/professor-gary-gensler-vs-sec-chair-gary-gensler-crypto-long-short,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a83e32facafa47cb7bec6b310d7960c46cef324-2048x1338.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393058,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFFnf,1689782400,Not All Crypto Custody Is Created Equal: Crypto Long & Short,"In the last year, the failures of crypto companies like FTX, Celsius and BlockFi, as well as recent bank collapses, eroded belief in financial systems. A flight to safety has begun as investors of all sizes worldwide seek reliable and secure crypto storage. When investors approach custodians, their primary concerns are the safety of their funds and the ability to access them.  Regulated custodians play a vital role in ensuring the security of assets. They offer services such as segregated accounts, protection from financial instability, cold storage of keys, advanced security technology and insurance against theft, loss or misuse.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Recently several institutions unveiled their plans for crypto, bringing new interest, capital and participants. Notably, we saw BlackRock file for permission to create a bitcoin ETF, which fired a bright signal flare to the rest of the financial world. As one of the world’s largest financial entities, dipping their toe into the waters of bitcoin is no small matter. It is a symbolic move that tells the rest of the market, “Bitcoin is here to stay.” Institutions such as this will ultimately have a need for regulated custody to secure the assets for these new market instruments. However, it is not easy to gloss over what has happened in the past 18 months.  What have crypto failures taught us?  Not all custody is the same: Just because someone is holding your assets doesn’t mean they are a regulated custodian. In traditional finance, custodians must meet specific regulatory standards to protect client assets. In the crypto space, custodial services range from software solutions to fully licensed and regulated cold-storage solutions. The same controls that exist in other financial institutions are not yet global standards in crypto.  Investors need the underlying systems to work together to protect their assets from misuse, theft or fraud: Trading and custody should be done by separate entities. Traditional finance market infrastructure involves a carefully organized network of exchanges, broker-dealers, clearinghouses, transfer agents, banks and custodians. Each entity has a specific, well-defined role and rules they must abide by.  Do you really know who your custodian is? Does your custodian have a long history of caretaking assets? What is their security model? Many sought to withdraw their assets in 2022 and were greeted by disappointment.  If your custodian can’t reconcile these points with your own personal risks analysis, you may need to look elsewhere. Over time I believe that custodial practices will become much stronger out of necessity. No custodian wants to become the next news story about losing customer assets. The lessons we’ve learned together as an industry over the last 18 months have only shown the need for strong safeguards to protect investor assets. The future is getting brighter for the custodial space, and we all must rise to meet the challenges. Digital assets continue to be the most novel asset class on the planet and reliable infrastructure is crucial for the industry to grow.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Chen Fang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/19/not-all-crypto-custody-is-created-equal-crypto-long-short,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b3277532ea0c2b48f0343dd02742a9560ae5d1b-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393046,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFEo7,1689780583,Code Wallet Aims for Fresh Start on Solana After Messy Tale of Kik and KIN,"Code Inc., started by the team behind the Kik messaging app, is introducing its Solana-based ""Code"" crypto wallet today.  The minimalist payment app is built around the cryptocurrency KIN, which started out as a token on the Ethereum blockchain but is now on Solana.  Code’s CEO is Ted Livingston, the former CEO of messaging app Kik. Before leaving Kik, he launched KIN as a way to help monetize the platform – raising $100 million in a high-profile 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) before the token was labeled a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Kik Interactive Inc. paid out a $5 million fine to the SEC, and the Kik messaging app – now under new ownership – is no longer associated with the KIN project.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Livington spun KIN’s regulatory baggage as a positive: ""KIN is the only token that's on Solana that has no inflation that's been through the SEC gauntlet."" The idea is that it has been given a green-light for trading in the U.S., and is, in Livingston’s view, better suited for adoption as a payment method than similar virtual currencies that have yet to get regulatory clearance. (The SEC’s case against KIN wasn’t all that dissimilar from the one currently underway with Ripple, albeit at a much smaller scale.)  Code likens its wallet app to an ""iPhone moment” for crypto.  “We want to deliver an app to the crypto industry that they for the first time ever can show their non-crypto family and friends and actually have them go, ‘Hm, that actually is sort of interesting,’” Livingston told CoinDesk.  The core feature of Code is the ability to instantly send crypto from one wallet to another by scanning another user’s QR code. The feature is based on a concept the team calls “digital paper cash” – the idea that digital payments should be immediate and final, as simple as handing a dollar bill from one person to another.  According to Code’s team, its QR feature works more quickly than similar functionality on Venmo or more traditional crypto wallets – many of which charge fees for transfers, unlike Code.  Solana boasts cheaper and faster transactions than many other blockchains, but it has historically faced problems with occasional network outages.  To ensure transactions continue to work even when the blockchain goes down, Code has built a layer 2 on top of Solana that will continue to process transactions even when the chain is offline – eventually settling them permanently once the chain comes back. According to Livingston, the layer 2 network has been engineered to provide an additional layer of privacy for transactions.  KIN  Code’s success may ultimately rest on people’s willingness to adopt KIN as a payment method.  Like many other cryptocurrencies, the coin is extremely volatile; in the past month the token has shot up in price by 82%, and its relatively tiny market cap of $24 million means that small trades on exchanges can have a big impact on its price.  Asked whether he is concerned that kin is too volatile for users to adopt it for payments, Livingston responded, “When we look at other crypto apps, there's a bunch of things that we think are wrong with them, one of which is volatility. The question we ask ourselves is, well, if we eliminate all the other challenges, except volatility, could it work?”  Livingston didn't count out the idea of eventually incorporating other assets, like stablecoins, into Code.  “The narrative that only stablecoins could work – I think it’s still a hypothesis,” he said. Stablecoins might eventually face regulatory issues, which could be a non-starter in terms of preserving the app’s “digital paper cash” design ethos, according to Livingston.  Volatility Within Kin  KIN has a deep history but has not followed a straightforward trajectory. The token was created in 2017 by Kik Interactive as a way to monetize the once-massive instant messaging app, but the token has had a bumpy history even setting aside the SEC issues – moving from Ethereum to Stellar, to a fork of Stellar, to Solana – where it resides today.  This year, a leadership dispute within the Kin Foundation – the non-profit responsible for managing KIN’s community reserves – led the token to suddenly (and confusingly) splinter into two currencies: KIN and Bits. All of the Kin Foundation’s board members resigned except for Livingston, who was initially behind Bits plan but ultimately backtracked and expressed regret.  Later, Livingston recommended that the KIN community vote to dissolve the Kin Foundation along with the remainder of its reserves – around 50% of all KIN in circulation. Livingston says this makes KIN the only non-inflationary currency without a centralized organization.  The Code wallet will launch this week on iOS, and an Android version is still in the works.

15070206,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543320,1689778841,"Bitcoin Has Broken This Open Interest Pattern, Quant Explains","A quant has explained how a pattern in the Bitcoin open interest that held during the past month now appears to be broken. Bitcoin Open Interest Is Now Moving Against The Price As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC price had earlier been rising along with increases in the open interest. The “open interest” here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts that are currently open on all derivative exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means that users are opening up more positions on the futures market right now. As leverage generally increases when this happens, the price of the asset may become more volatile following this trend. On the other hand, the value of the indicator decreasing suggests the users are either closing up their contracts of their own volition or are being liquidated by their platforms currently. Such a trend may lead to the cryptocurrency’s price becoming more stable. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin open interest over the past few weeks: Looks like the value of the metric has been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin open interest has been steadily rising during the past few days. This suggests that investors have been slowly opening up more contracts on derivative exchanges. Related Reading: Signal With Perfect Track Record Predicts Bitcoin Bull Market Parabola: Analyst During the last month or so, whenever the open interest had risen, the price of the cryptocurrency had also registered an increase. The quant notes that this would imply that the bulls had been dominating the futures market in this period, as the open interest going up alongside the price implies that the increase in contracts had been coming from long contract holders. This pattern had held up until the surge BTC had observed a few days back. This sharp increase in the price had ended up only being temporary, and as the price had plunged down, the longs had seen liquidation. As the longs had previously dominated the Bitcoin market, this decrease in the open interest was quite sharp, as is visible in the chart. The indicator didn’t take too long to rebound, however, as it initially sharply rose and then fell back to a trend of gradual growth. which has continued until today. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Deposit Big To Exchanges, Bearish Sign? But as the price has in fact been going down in this same period, it would appear that the increase in the open interest is now being driven by the shorts. This would imply that a shift in the market may have occurred, as the open interest pattern that had previously held up now seems to be invalid. “Have the bears returned once again? In any case, it is advisable to exercise caution in the current area,” warns the quant. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,000, down 2% in the last week.

PlayWay, the global gaming giant, has teamed up with GameSwift to introduce and launch OuterLife as their entry into the web3 gaming world on Polygon network OuterLife is an innovative Web3 gaming accelerator and incubator, and it will allow PlayWay to integrate blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into its famous simulator titles such as Animal Shelter, Farming Life, Cafe Owner Simulator and more.. PlayWay commented that it will port some of its existing catalogue of games, providing new, engaging and fresh experiences for its gamers with constantly evolving storylines and added productions. OuterLife also gives opportunity to other gaming studios producing simulators to join the incubator and using a zk-powered Polygon Supernet, to also build their own blockchains. Paweł Łaskarzewski, COO at OuterLife expressed that the gaming industry is “ripe for disruption,” in this case led by blockchain and NFT based initiatives. He said, “Blockchain technology has the ability to provide new and engaging enhancements to tried and tested gaming models that have worked over the years, allowing players to get close to the game more than ever.” Marek Parzyński, PlayWay, conveyed his delight in being part of the OuterLife launch and looks forward to a promising future in collaboration with both Polygon Labs and GameSwift. What does this mean for players and developers? Through the collaboration, existing and new developers within PlayWay’s ecosystem and beyond will be able to connect their games to a world of interconnected digital reality, simply by an SDK, creating a truly open world. For players, OuterLife will offer an all new gaming experience where players can enhance statistics, acquire in-game items as non-fungible tokens and establish interconnected gaming simulations. CEO of GameSwift Wojciech Gruszka known also under his Twitter handle as Pan Paragraf comments, “With OuterLife, character developments and upgrades in one game simulator will also have an impact in another - creating a truly interconnected digital reality with the power of blockchain.” Healthy Supply and Demand Major strides are being made to bring blockchain technology to mainstream gaming, with over $739M invested in Q1 2023 alone, according to a DappRadar report. Driving forces for mass adoption are games that are fun, and not complicated for user onboarding, regardless of its usage of blockchain technology. In addition to fun, trends suggest healthy supply and demand for ownership, privacy, creator empowerment and ecosystem growth. OuterLife will use a zk-powered Polygon Supernet integration, which will address those to create a winning economic formula, while ensuring a seamless, scalable, easy to onboard and privacy-focused ecosystem for players, developers and gaming studios alike. Not Far Off PlayWay, the leading company behind gaming boom, was listed as the third-largest games company—trailing only CD Projekt Red, developers of The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077, and Techland with Dying Light. It is worth to highlight that PlayWay has around 4 times bigger capitalization than Ten Square Games, the mobile giant behind Let’s Fish and Fishing Clash. The Global Giant has been home to some of the most successful gaming titles on Steam marketplace, with more than 100 titles in development, having partnered with more than 120 studios worldwide. While it's unclear on when the watershed mass-adoption moment will arrive, it's clear to see it having a major push with one of the biggest game studios in the world making heaps with the technology. Gaming continues to be one of the major vectors of mainstream adoption for Web3,” said Urvit Goel, Vice President, Head of Global Business Development at Polygon Labs. “When leading game companies like PlayWay and GameSwift join forces to establish the groundwork for Web3 gaming infrastructure, and with the market leading advancements in zero knowledge technology being developed at Polygon Labs, the future of gaming holds tremendous potential. PlayWay’s simulator games have frequently been on Steam’s global bestseller list, and the partnership with GameSwift only means it is not a question of if, but when blockchain technology will enhance games in a way that drives mass adoption. About PlayWay: PlayWay is one of the biggest group of gaming simulator studios in the world. Created in 2011, it has produced and released over 100 games that are sold and downloaded worldwide. With over 200 more still to come, PlayWay is listed at the Stock Exchange, with over 10 companies from PlayWay Group now on the stock exchange.

42393062,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFG33,1689775324,New U.S. Senate Bill Wants to Regulate DeFi Like a Bank,"The U.S. Senate is poised to take another crack at regulating the crypto industry with a new bill that would place stringent anti-money laundering (AML) requirements on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  The bipartisan bill, the Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement Act of 2023, would require DeFi protocols to impose bank-like controls on their user base, according to a description of the bill reviewed by CoinDesk.  The bill intends “to fight the rise in crypto-facilitated crime and close off avenues for the evasion of money laundering and sanctions measures that are critical to our national security,” the briefing doc read.  DeFi protocols are financial applications that allow anyone with a crypto wallet to borrow, lend and trade cryptocurrency via smart contracts. They’re harder to regulate than, say centralized companies such as Coinbase, because they operate directly on permissionless blockchains.  The bill envisions sidestepping these issues by placing requirements on “anyone who ‘controls’ a DeFi protocol or makes available an application to use the protocol,” likely a reference to groups who build user-friendly frontends for protocols’ otherwise cumbersome smart contracts, as Uniswap Labs does for Ethereum’s top decentralized exchange.  “If nobody controls a DeFi protocol, then—as a backstop—anyone who invests more than $25 million in developing the protocol will be responsible for these obligations,” according to the briefing document.  These controlling entities would need to vet and collect information on their customers, maintain anti money laundering programs, report suspicious activity to the government, and block sanctioned individuals from using their protocol.  The bill would place identity verification requirements on crypto kiosks.  It would also expand the Treasury Department’s authority to police alleged money launderers in non-traditional financial settings, including crypto.  The bill was introduced Wednesday by Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) a member of the Senate Banking Committee. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Mark Warner (D-VA) are co-sponsors.

The IMFs policy suggestion comes amid a global push for clear guidelines for crypto assets under the Indian G20 Presidency. Global Crypto Regulation on G20’s Agenda The collapse of some of the biggest crypto platforms in 2022 highlighted the dire need for establishing clear guidelines and policies for the industry to protect investors against the implications of a mostly unregulated industry. The sheer loss and impact of the implosion of the crypto trading platform FTX and the Terra Luna stablecoin made it clear that the risk of fraud and misconduct could be disastrous for investors without comprehensive safeguards. As such, the Group of 20 Nations (G20) directed its efforts to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place. Regulatory bodies such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) have issued recommendations to develop a global framework for crypto-assets, with further guidance expected from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The IMF subsequently made its contribution to establishing such a regulatory framework. Three-Pillared Approach The reality of an evolving financial system is that digitization of currencies and assets is inevitable, and the likelihood of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoins replacing official currencies is increasing. To address the impact of such financial changes on countries’ monetary and fiscal policies, a comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated policy approach to crypto is needed. The IMF assessed the potential macro-financial implications of the widespread adoption of CBDCs and relies on three aspects in its approach to a global regulatory framework. The IMF developed its approach on three key aspects: “a sound macro-policy foundation, clear legal treatment and granular rules, and effective implementation.” The bank developed a few key policy recommendations based on these three pillars. First, protecting against substituting sovereign currencies will depend on maintaining robust, trusted, credible domestic institutions. To address crypto assets’ challenges effectively, “transparent, consistent, and coherent monetary policy frameworks” are imperative. The IMF suggests to protect national sovereignty; crypto assets should not be granted the status of official currency or legal tender. The IMF’s third recommendation addresses the volatility of capital flows associated with crypto. The bank believes policymakers should integrate crypto within their existing regimes and rules for managing capital flows. Doing so will help ensure stability and minimize potential disruptions. The IMF’s final recommendation is tax policies “should ensure unambiguous treatment of crypto assets, and administrators should strengthen compliance efforts.” The IMF argues specific regulations to clarify the tax treatment of crypto are necessary.

Determined to break all barriers to the $0.2 target, XLM painted all charts green, with a whopping 43.29% gain in value on the week. The cross-border payment facilitator has added over 8.79% to its valuation over the past 24-hour trading session. XLM Rides On Bullish Momentum From Impressive Ecosystem Developments Following ecosystem developments, XLM continues to soar as interest in its innovative payment and remittance solution increase. In a recent development, Stellar partnered with MoneyGram and HoneyCoin app to support global digital assets cash out with USDC across Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and the UK. Related Reading: Pre-Mined Ethereum Worth $116M Moves After 8 Years: Is A Major Price Dip Imminent? In another announcement, Stellar partnered with Fonbnk to provide payment solutions to the unbanked in Africa. Considering that millions of Africans lack access to banking services, Stellar’s partnership with MoneyGram and Fonbnk could bring more users to the digital finance landscape, further expanding the crypto industry. Moreover, Stellar is now available on multiple chains, including Ethereum, Solana, Celo, and Polygon, through Allbridge’s interoperability and bridge solution. Announced on July 11, the integration marks a significant milestone for Stellar, demonstrating its utility for innovative opportunities in decentralized finance. This feat could be among the factors pushing XLM’s price over the past seven days. Again, the token still enjoys the bullish wave of its close relative, XRP’s victory in the SEC/Ripple lawsuit. Stellar (XLM) Price Movement In The Last Seven Days Over the past seven days, XLM witnessed a significant shoot-up. On July 13, when news of Ripple (XRP)’s victory broke out, XLM’s price went from $0.096 to $0.153, a 60% boost within 24 hours. Though it experienced a minute correction as the buzz subsided, XLM remains bullish, fighting for more gains to surpass $0.1 and claim $0.2. CoinMarketCap data shows XLM has surged more than 42% in the last seven days, bringing its value over 73% higher than it was 30 days ago. As of 6:19 AM EST on July 19, XLM’s price had added more than 21% to its past year’s value. The token’s growth in value is reflected in its over 11,173% rise from its November 18, 2014, all-time low of $0.001227. Stellar’s spree of cross-border payment partnerships has undoubtedly improved XLM’s trading activity. The coin’s trading volume currently surpasses $321 million, with a 130% increase in 24-hour trading volume, according to CoinMarketcap. Related Reading: XRP Price Resumes Rally – Here’s Why It Could Surpass $1 This Time An increase in trading volume often points toward two factors: large selloffs and high demand or buying pressure.

Manta Network is a modular ecosystem for zero-knowledge (ZK) applications, which utilize a cryptographic method of mathematically verifying that a transaction is valid without compromising its privacy.  The company previously launched the ZK-focused layer 1 blockchain Manta Atlantic to offer programmable privacy. The newly rolled out Manta Pacific, now in testnet, aims to serve as a layer 2 ecosystem to make it easier for developers to deploy Ethereum Virtual Machine-native ZK applications.  The new capital, valuing the project at $500 million, will help scale the network, user base and use cases for Manta Pacific and fuel the expansion in key Asia markets, according to a statement.

Coinfund Raises $152M New York-based venture capital firm, Coinfund, has successfully raised $152 million in its latest funding round, showcasing confidence in the crypto space despite the recent pullback by many investors. The firm, known for its portfolio of 105 companies, prioritizes projects that contribute to the development of crypto infrastructure, with a specific focus on enabling greater decentralization. Polychain Raises $200M Of $400M Goal In a similar chain of events, another blockchain-based venture capital firm, Polychain Capital, has also completed its initial close, amassing approximately $200 million for its fourth crypto venture capital fund. The total goal for the fund is set at $400 million, in line with the amount specified in an April filing with the SEC for the Polychain Ventures IV (Parallel) LP fund. With just under $2.6 billion of assets under management, the VC firm struggled during the crypto winter, having to lay off staff, much like many other crypto-focused organizations. Crypto investments took a major hit last year, with funding for crypto projects shrinking from $9.1 billion a year earlier to only $1.7 billion. However, the recent crypto-positive ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple case has renewed interest in crypto, with Coinbase shares hitting their yearly high. Coinfund Continues Crypto Bet Coinfund has already made significant investments in companies such as Giza, an AI-focused venture that raised about $3 million in seed funding, and infrastructure projects like Cosmos, where it helped raise $10 million to advance the development of its Neutron smart contract platform in collaboration with Binance Labs and others. This latest move by Coinfund comes amidst a broader retreat from crypto investments after a challenging year marked by multiple failures, including the collapse of the TerraLuna stablecoin and FTX exchange. Additionally, higher interest rates have made borrowing more expensive, complicating the fundraising landscape. Focusing On Scalability, Interoperability Coinfund's co-founder and chief investment officer, Alex Felix, explained that the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX last year had led developers to double down on completing the roadmap to a decentralized application developer stack. As a result, scalability, interoperability, and user experience have become renewed areas of focus. While previous rounds of fundraising centered on established categories like NFT gaming and DeFi, this latest round will shift the spotlight towards emerging sectors, particularly early-stage crypto start-ups, especially those involving artificial intelligence.

In September 2022, the operator of the Nasdaq stock exchange had said that it was putting together the infrastructure and regulatory approval needed for a crypto custody service. The firm had applied to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for a limited-purpose trust company, which would oversee the custody business.  Now Nasdaq has opted to halt these plans and its effort to pursue the necessary license ""considering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the U.S.,"" Friedman said.  The firm will however aim to continue supporting the digital asset industry in several ways, including partnerships with potential ETF issuers as well as providing technology for crypto custody, she added. (Nasdaq , notably, is the would-be listing exchange partner in BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF application, whose filing last month lifted the market's spirits.)  Nasdaq's move is a blow to institutional adoption of crypto in the U.S., where regulators appear to be targeting crypto firms and related services, prompting concerns that there will be an exodus of such firms to more hospitable jurisdictions.  For crypto custody in particular, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has set up a high hurdle for publicly traded firms to get involved. In an April 2022 accounting directive, known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, the SEC staff advised firms holding customers’ digital assets that they’d need to record their obligations as liabilities on the companies’ own balance sheets.

According to @ali_charts, Litecoin whales holding 100,000-1,000,000 LTC have acquired over 590,000 LTC, worth $59 million, in the last two days. #Litecoin whales have bought over 590,000 $LTC in the last 48 hours, worth around $59 million! pic.twitter.com/RtHpuzSkFt — Ali (@ali_charts) July 18, 2023 LTC Price Shows No Reaction To Whale Movement As earlier stated, these recent whale transactions spell a positive undertone for the Litecoin network, as it indicates growing confidence in the LTC asset. However, it is worth noting that LTC’s market price has shown minimal reaction to this massive buying spree. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Deposit Big To Exchanges, Bearish Sign? For context, LTC is up by only 1.44% in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, the token is down by 4.37% on the weekly chart and is marked as one of the top weekly losers. LTC’s price movement has been quite bearish since the start of July. The “Digital Silver” – as it is called – ended last month on a high note, gaining over 26% on June 30 to trade above $100 for the first time since April. This positive price movement was followed by some little extra gains before LTC’s value started falling, declining by over 17% between July 3 and now. At the time of writing, LTC is exchanging hands at $92.98, with a 0.27% gain in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s trading volume is down 17.08% and is now valued at $482 million. With a market cap of $6.82 billion, LTC ranks as the 12th biggest cryptocurrency in the market.

On July 15, the network reached a historic milestone, having processed over 170 million transactions since its inception, with over 10 million transactions added in the last 7 weeks. Furthermore, on July 18, the blockchain announced that LTC ranked as the leading crypto for payment on the BitPay platform. According to a chart shared by BitPay, LTC accounted for 34.9% of all crypto payments on its platform in June. Related Reading: Litecoin Becomes 10th-Largest Cryptocurrency, But Is There Still Room To Run? That said, Litecoin’s recent growth in engagement is likely driven by its upcoming halving event, which is scheduled for August 2, 2023. Litecoin’s halving represents a programmed blockchain event in which mining rewards are reduced by half. It serves as a deflationary tool that helps maintain the scarcity of LTC in circulation, thereby increasing demand, which could potentially drive up the token’s price. The halving event occurs every four years, with the first two being in 2015 and 2019. Currently, LTC mining rewards stand at 12.5 LTC and will reduce to 6.25 LTC post-halving.

The funds will help RISC Zero bring its Bonsai computing platform to market. Other investors in the round included Galaxy Digital, IOSG, RockawayX, Maven 11, Fenbushi Capital, Delphi Digital, Algaé Ventures, IOBC, Tribute Labs’ Zero Dao, and Alchemy, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  The Series A is yet another example that infrastructure projects continue to raise capital despite the extended crypto winter.  Zero-knowledge proofs use cryptography to mathematically validate a transaction while preserving the privacy of that transaction. In March 2022, RISC Zero released an open-source, zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that allowed developers to build zk proofs that could be executed on any computer using standard traditional or blockchain-focused programming languages.  The forthcoming Bonsai computing platform is a decentralized proving engine that allows developers to easily integrate zk proofs into their applications and chains for improved security and complex computations.  “For developers who are new to crypto, RISC Zero’s technology will allow them to build applications using tools and languages they are more familiar with while imposing many fewer restrictions on the complexity of the code,” RISC Zero CEO Brian Retford told CoinDesk in an email.

Developers said the new governance structure would consist of “three main pillars,” each pertaining to a specific function.  First would be the expansion of the Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) framework – which allows users to propose and research upgrades for Polygon protocols – to all blockchains and applications that run on the Polygon network. This would allow community members to research and propose upgrades that may eventually become part of protocols.  Second, a “System Smart Contracts Governance” pillar that facilitates upgrades for protocol changes or software that is implemented as a smart contract. Such changes would be overseen by an Ecosystem Council, elected and governed by the community, made up of reputed members.  Third, a “Community Treasury” governance mechanism that supports the Polygon ecosystem's growth and funds projects. It will be managed by an independent Community Treasury Board, eventually transitioning to community-driven governance.  As such, Polygon Labs has urged the ecosystem’s stakeholders, such as developers and network validators, to discuss the governance plans as these are subject to community approval.

42393065,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFGIR,1689768060,First Mover Americas: Investors Pile Into Bitcoin ETPs Following BlackRock ETF Filing,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto investors have poured money into bitcoin exchange-traded products at a record pace ever since BlackRock filed for a spot-based ETF on June 15. New data from K33 Research shows the BTC-equivalent exposure of ETPs listed worldwide increased by 25,202 BTC ($757 million) to 196,824 BTC in the four weeks to July 16. That's the second-highest monthly net inflow, surpassed only by inflows seen following the launch of ProShares’ futures-based ETF and other futures-based ETFs in October 2021, according to K33 Research’s Vetle Lunde.  Societe Generale's (GLE) cryptocurrency division, SG Forge, has become the first company to receive a license to offer crypto services in France from the country's financial regulator. SG Forge is licensed to provide buying and selling, exchange and custody of digital assets as of July 18, according to the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF)'s website. While dozens of crypto firms, including the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, are registered with the AMF, SocGen's crypto division is the first to receive a license.  Messaging platform Telegram issued $270 million in bonds this week to fund its growth until ""we reach the break-even point,"" CEO Pavel Durov announced Tuesday. The platform is not yet profitable and has rising expenses due to its ""massive growth,"" Durov said. It’s onboarding 2.5 million new users a day and earlier this year hit 800 million monthly active users. ""I personally bought about a quarter of the new Telegram bonds, investing tens of millions into Telegram's growth. This comes in addition to the hundreds of millions I spent over the last 10 years to keep Telegram operational,"" Durov said. The alternative messaging platform has long been a favorite among crypto enthusiasts. That's partly attributable to the company's defunct efforts to launch its own crypto token, GRAM.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows DeFi lender Aave's algorithmic dollar-pegged stablecoin GHO has crossed $3 million in market capitalization within four days from the launch.  The stablecoin can be minted by locking AAVE, ETH, USDT, USDC and DAO as collateral on Aave V3.

EtherFi Open Letter Slams OpenSea Founder and CEO at EtherFi, Mike Silagadze, penned a reproachful letter addressing the OpenSea marketplace and its decision to halt the trading of the EtherFan NFT collection. Silagadze wrote that even though the collection launch was a success, it was short-lived. He wrote that even though the collection’s all 3000 NFTs were minted within a day, the listings were removed from the OpenSea platform without any warning. The creators attempted to contact OpenSea through multiple channels but received no response for several days. “OpenSea - An Unlicensed Casino” Silagadze wrote that after days of attempted contact, the NFT marketplace finally responded in the form of a letter from its generic support email. The communication claimed that NFT collections involved in financial activities subject to registration or licensing are not allowed on the OpenSea platform. Since EtherFan NFTs are wrapped staked ETH with a PFP (Profile Picture), they fall under the category devised by the platform’s conservative interpretation. Saligadze also claimed that the NFT creators had previously communicated with the marketplace team prior to the launch to ensure compatibility and had received the green signal from them. He wrote, “OpenSea has been running a de facto unlicensed casino where people engage in ruinous gambling and spend millions on pictures of monkeys and such. This is all great and ok apparently, but listing a collection that actually has utility is disallowed because it has utility.” OpenSea Too Big To Take Risks He did state that he did not believe there were any malicious intentions behind the actions, but just that the scope of the platform has become too big for operational clarity. He believes OpenSea's growth into a large organization might have led to increased caution and risk aversion. He wrote, “Having the EtherFan NFT listed on a marketplace was a fairly important part of our marketing strategy because we expected there would be a resale market…Unequivocally, we did not get any indication whatsoever from OpenSea that any of what we were doing was potentially in violation of their Terms of Service,” The incident has sparked discussions within the crypto community about the importance of companies taking principled stands, with some pointing to Coinbase as an example. For now, EtherFan NFTs remain unavailable on OpenSea, leaving its creators and users seeking alternative solutions for trading and engagement.

This transaction raises questions about potential market implications and whether it could trigger a notable price dip for Ethereum. Eight years ago, during Ethereum’s pre-mine period, the wallet accumulated a total of 61,216 ETH. Back then, the value of the tokens was around $18,976, but due to Ethereum’s exponential growth, the value has now escalated over a thousandfold. Stirring From Dormancy The ETH in question, stashed in a single wallet address, has remained untouched since it was pre-mined. But in an unexpected move, all 61,216 ETH were transferred to an address associated with the Kraken crypto exchange. This transfer marks the end of an eight-year-long dormancy. 💤 💤 💤 💤 💤 💤 💤 💤 💤 💤 A dormant pre-mine address containing 61,216 #ETH (116,396,127 USD) has just been activated after 8.0 years!https://t.co/f79T0fYa7b — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 18, 2023 Rewinding to June 2014, the Ethereum network staged a unique sale event. As the network was yet to begin generating tokens autonomously, this event served as an opportunity for early team members and co-founders to accumulate pre-mined ETH. Related Reading: Ethereum Four Straight Days Down: Bullish Or Bearish? At this point in time, ETH was trading at the price of $0.31, thus valuing this particular collection of 61,216 ETH at an estimated $18,976. Fast forward to the present day, and the value of these same tokens has skyrocketed to approximately $116.9 million. This dramatic surge in ETH’s price over the years underscores the substantial growth and adoption of Ethereum’s network. Consequently, the recent movement of this significant ETH stash has piqued the interest of the crypto community, eager to understand the potential implications of this action. Major Ethereum Dip Imminent? Typically, large transfers of a cryptocurrency to an exchange can indicate an intent to sell, and this can potentially put downward pressure on the price if the amount being sold is significant compared to the overall trading volume. However, it is worth noting that not all large deposit into the exchange means a potential fall for the crypto being transferred as the person or entity transferring the ETH might not sell immediately or might decide to sell gradually to minimize market impact. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Is Showing Early Signs of Fresh Increase, But This Resistance Is Key Also, it is worth analyzing how the whale ended up depositing its pre-mined ETH into the exchange. Etherscan data verifies the transaction, which occurred on July 18. The operation of moving is $116.9 million in ETH and required a negligible fee of $1.68 and 25.475673161 Gwei in gas price. The identity of the wallet owner remains a mystery and their cautious approach is noteworthy, as they ensured to avoid human errors that could result in substantial loss. They did this by first sending a small test transaction of 0.05 ETH to the Kraken address before moving the entire lot. The transaction has also highlighted the value of HODL-ling, a strategy that emphasizes the long-term accumulation of crypto tokens. It underscores how patience can lead to significant gains in the volatile world of crypto. Nonetheless, Ethereum price is up 0.7% in the past 24 hours, indicating that the whale might be yet to make any move with its deposited ETH.

42393044,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFEiz,1689764400,"Solana’s Largest Protocol, Marinade, Bets Growth on ‘Native’ SOL Staking Product","Top Solana protocol Marinade Finance will support direct-to-validator staking of SOL tokens alongside its popular mechanisms for issuing mSOL, the liquid staking token (LST).  The new service, called Marinade Native, eliminates the smart contract risk of swapping SOL for mSOL while preserving the expected yield of around 7%, developers say. That’s because users retain custody of their SOL as opposed to receiving what amounts to a yield-infused depository receipt.  Marinade is already responsible for $167 million in crypto assets – just a touch over half of the total value locked (TVL) on Solana. But its liquid staking solution seems to have hit a ceiling at 2% of the network’s SOL, protocol insiders say. They’re convinced Marinade’s further growth will come only from appealing to institutional investors too weary to handle LSTs.  “Marinade Native is basically targeting the 50-times bigger market and hoping to see more decentralization within staking on Solana,” said Michael Repetny, a core contributor to Marinade.  Staking SOL directly to validators is not new. It’s the original method investors used to capture the upside of Solana’s proof-of-stake blockchain, which pays interest to those who financially vouch for the validators powering the network.  What is new is that it spreads the staked SOL across an index of top validators rather than just one. The technique, called automated staking, is one of the two main benefits of its LST mechanism, alongside the part where it issues mSOL.  “It’s not staking to one, but to about 130 validators that are ranked based on their performance, based on some decentralization aspects and so on,” Repetny said. “We’re introducing a product that relies on this automated staking and avoids completely the smart contract risk.”  The risk of locking SOL into a liquid staking contract was demonstrated last November, when the collapse of FTX prompted a flight to safety across the Solana ecosystem, including in Marinade. Spooked mSOL holders began trading their liquid staking tokens at a discount rather than wait the few days it would take to reclaim their SOL from the protocol.  Although Marinade’s mechanics worked just fine throughout the process and none of the staked SOL was lost, the event underscored the limitations of liquid staking. The protocol is still recovering from the TVL rout it suffered during the incident.  Solana’s adoption of liquid staking remains far below Ethereum’s, the largest blockchain for DeFi and staking protocols. Repetny chalked the difference up to tech differences between the two chains and how they handle unlock periods.  There’s also about 60 million SOL locked in vesting contracts that Repetny said cannot be put to work through liquid staking solutions but can nonetheless earn yield using Marinade Native.  “Unless DeFi picks back up – which we’re starting to see hints of – the liquid value proposition on Solana to me is a bit small,” Repetny said.

Turkish prosecutors had initially sought a jail sentence of up to five years on smuggling charges under the country’s Tax Procedure Law. A Protracted Court Case Thodex was one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Turkey. However, the exchange abruptly shut down, with Faruk Fatih Ozer, the CEO of the exchange, fleeing to Albania. After Interpol issued a Red Notice, Ozer was deported back to Turkey and faced fraud charges for pocketing over $2 billion in client funds when Thodex shut down. The CEO and 21 other defendants face charges that include alleged fraud, money laundering, and operating a complex criminal network using Thodex. Ozer could face a significantly longer and more severe punishment if found guilty. Ozer Maintains Innocence The case was heard at the Anatolian 17th Criminal Court of First Instance, with magistrates initially sentencing Ozer to one and a half years in prison. However, this sentence was reduced after the court considered his social relations, behavior, and potential impact on his future. Ozer has maintained his innocence throughout the duration of the trial, which began in October 2021. Turkish authorities had asked the former CEO to submit documents related to his activities at Thodex to the Tax Inspection Board. However, Ozer was unable to present the required documents within the stipulated time frame. Instead, he denied the charges, claiming that he had been framed and stating that the company was hacked. He also denied being a Thodex official at the time, claiming that a trustee had been appointed to oversee the exchange and business in his absence, preventing him from sharing the requested records. Ozer has also maintained that former employees, including his brother and sister, who were arrested in 2021, were unlawfully imprisoned. Problems Continue To Mount Ozer faces a number of other accusations, which could see the former CEO spend the rest of his life in prison. Prosecutors and investors have insisted that he had a key role in the collapse of the Thodex exchange. Thodex collapsed in 2021 when the platform abruptly stopped all services. As a result, over 400,000 customers were unable to withdraw their funds, with prosecutors alleging that Ozer made off with over $2 billion in customer funds. However, after being on the run for over a year, he was detained in Albania, with Albanian and Turkish officials negotiating his deportation. Officials had initially sought a five year prison sentence for Ozer under the country’s stringent Tax Procedure Law. Tax Evasion A Major Issue According to a study by Swedish crypto tax firm Divly, 99.5% of crypto investors did not end up paying taxes in 2022. The report states that Finland had the highest number of investors that paid the requisite taxes on their crypto investments, with the number just over 4%. Australia and Austria followed close behind with 3.65% and 2.75%, respectively, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, Japan, Sweden, Canada, and the United States. Countries at the lower end of the table, such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, have only 0.07%, 0.04%, and 0.03% of crypto investors that paid taxes in 2022. However, the report has also received considerable criticism, with many questioning the methodology used to arrive at the estimates mentioned in the report. The report itself notes that search volume data may not accurately reflect the actual number of taxpayers from the crypto ecosystem.

U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiled a plan to exempt bitcoin (BTC) from capital gains tax when it is converted into U.S. dollars and to begin to back the greenback with ""real finite assets"" such as gold, silver, platinum and bitcoin.  ""Backing dollars and U.S. debt obligations with hard assets could help restore strength back to the dollar, rein in inflation and usher in a new era of American financial stability, peace and prosperity,"" said Kennedy. He would start the process, he said, ""very, very small, perhaps 1% of issued T-bills"" would be backed by hard currencies like gold, silver platinum or bitcoin.  Speaking at a Heal-the-Divide PAC event Tuesday evening, he also echoed commitments he made at a conference in May defending the right to self-custody bitcoin, run blockchain nodes at home and promising industry-neutral energy regulation.  The story was first reported by TheStreet.  ""The benefits include facilitating innovation and spurring investment, ensuring citizen privacy, incentivizing ventures to grow their business and tech jobs in the United States rather than in Singapore, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal,” said Kennedy.  The Internal Revenue Service treats bitcoin as property and investment rather than currency, which means it is subject to tax on capital gains. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also been cracking down on the industry. Crypto companies have been calling for more regulatory clarity for months, and are looking to see if a ruling against the SEC in its lawsuit with Ripple will lead to a change in approach.  “It is a mistake for the U.S. government to hobble the industry and drive innovation elsewhere,” Kennedy wrote in a Twitter post in May. “Biden’s proposed 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining is a bad idea,” he wrote referring to incumbent President Joe Biden, also a Democrat.

15062369,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543309,1689762025,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Prediction: 24% Price Rally Impending By Month End,"The Shiba Inu price has established a promising uptrend in the 1-day chart since June 10, which could catapult the price 24% higher. However, SHIB investors should remain cautious, as NewsBTC reported a few days ago. A downward break of the said uptrend could push the SHIB price back into the longer-term downtrend, which has been in place since early February. A decision is likely to be forthcoming by the end of the month! Shiba Inu Price Prediction From a technical perspective, Shiba Inu has established a new uptrend over the last month which has pushed the price up 29% from the local low at $0.00000597. As can be seen in the 1-day chart, SHIB has so far defended this trend with flying colors. The expectations for the launch of Shibarium at the ETHToronto conference in mid-August could certainly play a role in this. In the meantime, however, SHIB is currently struggling with support at the 20-day EMA line. Over the last two days, SHIB has always managed to close above the support at the end of the trading session. In case the altcoin closes above the technical indicator today as well, the uptrend (black line) would be defended once again. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Encounters Familiar Resistance, Prompting Concerns About Bull Run A new bounce towards the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level could be possible. So far, SHIB has failed to close above the $0.00000832 resistance on a daily basis in three attempts. But, as explained at the beginning, a decision could be forthcoming by the end of the month. At that time, the resistance line of the 23.6% Fibonacci level and the rising trend line meet. Both lines form an ascending triangle formation, which signals a weakening resistance and an imminent breakout to the upside. The higher lows indicate that bulls are gaining the upper hand in the market. If confirmed, SHIB could rise towards the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which currently sits at $0.00000953, close to the psychologically important resistance level of $0.00001. At that point, greater selling pressure should be expected. Based on the current price level, SHIB might have a 24% rally. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shows Strength With 5% Rally, Reversal Confirmed? If the breakout above the $0.00000832 resistance fails in another attempt, the bulls would have time until around the end of July / beginning of August to validate the ascending triangle formation. Otherwise, a plunge towards support at $0.00007, where the upper line of the longer-term downtrend channel is located, could be imminent. Defending this price level would be crucial. Otherwise, the yearly low at $0.00000597 could be once again on the table. However, with the imminent launch of Shibarium in less than a month, this seems to be the less likely scenario.

42410169,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUF0r,1689760800,GOP Lawmakers Suggest Gensler's SEC Is Gaming News Cycle to Thwart Crypto Legislation,"Two Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approach to regulating cryptocurrency and suggested the regulator's actions were timed to overshadow and undermine efforts to write comprehensive legislation.  ""While Congress works to close regulatory gaps, the SEC has opted to regulate by enforcement,"" Reps. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to the commission's chairman, Gary Gensler.  ""This approach does not result in compliance and customer protection,"" they continued, ""but instead creates further confusion, as demonstrated by the recent summary judgement"" — a reference to Ripple's partial victory in its court fight with the SEC.  Making matters worse, Hill and Johnson wrote, were ""certain Commission actions, seemingly timed to coincide with related Congressional activity, which appears calculated for maximum publicity and political impact.""  The lawmakers' insinuation comes at a fraught time for crypto in the U.S. following the collapse last year of the FTX exchange and other major crypto businesses, as aggressive regulatory moves have led surviving companies to seek more hospitable jurisdictions and startups to avoid setting up shop stateside.  Although they did not elaborate, the lawmakers appear to be referring to the timing of the SEC's suits last month against leading crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  Both cases came days after the Republican chairs of two House committees released a discussion draft proposing an overhaul of crypto regulation in the U.S.  (To be fair, Hill and Johnson engaged in a bit of media maneuvering themselves; they provided the letter to members of the press on the condition it not be published before a specified time, a common practice for businesses and government officials.)  Hill and Johnson mentioned that discussion draft in their letter, along with two bills introduced since 2021 and 15 hearings held in the last four years on the subject by their House committees (financial services and agriculture, respectively).  The SEC's approach ""does not protect the public,"" they argued. ""Legislation would do far more to prevent future collapses of digital asset firms than enforcement actions. A statutory framework would establish a process for firms to come into the regulatory parameter and comply with consumer protections, rather than relying on enforcement actions to punish a bad actor after the damage has already been done.""  They closed their letter with an invitation for ""productive engagement"" on such legislation from the SEC.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/19/gop-lawmakers-suggest-genslers-sec-is-gaming-news-cycle-to-thwart-crypto-legislation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe638310dafac2ca64e123894776489596b32bd0-4179x2351.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
15061721,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/its-only-a-matter-of-time-for-bitcoin,1689760700,It’s only a matter of time for bitcoin,"The writing is on the wall. Bitcoin ETFs are queued at the SEC and it is now just a matter of time before bitcoin explodes higher. SEC Gensler in a tough place The anti-crypto chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, is in between a rock and a hard place. He has the biggest asset management company in the world (Blackrock) as well as several other financial giants, awaiting his decision. To buy himself time Gensler could put his decision back as much as 240 days, but the chances of the environment changing as far as granting a Spot Bitcoin ETF would likely be very small. The SEC chair could continue to back himself and just turn the ETF applications down en masse. However, he is really running out of grounds for doing so, and the political pressure he must already be facing would ratchet up to insufferable levels. Poor SEC decisions Gensler would need to be a man of iron in order to continue steering his anti-crypto course, but his performances so far do not indicate that he has the backbone to do this. Under his leadership the SEC has changed from its role as cop on the beat, that makes sure markets run smoothly, and that investors have proper protections, into a vehicle that is carrying out a hostile crusade against the crypto industry. Gensler’s decision to attack Coinbase now seems to have been a very poorly judged move, especially in the light of the recent SEC/Ripple case court decision that ruled that secondary sales of XRP on exchanges did not constitute the transaction of a security. Therefore, continuing to spend millions of taxpayer dollars on trying to bring Coinbase down, a company that is seen to have made every effort to be compliant, looks to be folly, and might be regarded as the SEC making a perverse effort to destroy all the crypto exchanges in order to prevent retail investors from using them. A power that transcends government It might very well be argued that it’s not just Gensler using the SEC as an armament against crypto. The decision to bring crypto down may well have come from much higher up, and possibly from the very highest echelon. However, there is still one power in the US that continues to transcend politics and government, and that is the power of money, and this comes in the form of institutional companies that own a piece of just about everything. Blackrock is the company at the pinnacle of all of them, and it will have the inside contacts and the resources to get what it wants, and that is a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Whether it’s good that such a company should have its fingers inside the Bitcoin pie is another thing, but given that Bitcoin is for everyone, those who are able to fully understand it and invest in it first will be those who profit the most. Just a matter of time Therefore, it is just a matter of time now before an ETF is granted and bitcoin is shot skywards on a wave of institutional buying. And if the SEC wins the day and somehow comes up with a reason for not approving an ETF, the institutions will still find a way to eventually get the job done. That Bitcoin has begun its bull market there can be little doubt. Institutions or no institutions, if 75% of BTC holders are not selling, and with the halving approaching next year, bitcoin will still do its thing.

The majority of these positions, $443 million worth, are held on the crypto exchange Binance, followed by Bitget at $250 million.

42410167,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUExY,1689757194,1Inch Token Balance on Centralized Exchanges Surges to $65M,"The number of 1INCH tokens held in wallets tied to centralized exchange on Tuesday rose to a record high of over 184.28 million ($65 million), according to data tracked by analytics firm Glassnode.  The so-called exchange balance has increased by 50% in three days, with the tally representing 18.65% of the circulating supply of 987.6 million and 12.2% of the total supply of 1.5 billion. 1INCH is the native token of decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch, launched in December 2020.  Investors typically move coins to exchanges when intending to sell or deploy coins as margin for trading derivatives. Hence, a notable increase in balance held in exchange wallets is widely considered a precursor of price volatility.  1INCH fell by 10% to 36 cents on Tuesday, registering its biggest single-day (UTC) decline since June 10, data from charting platform TradingView show. The cryptocurrency changed hands at 35 cents at press time, down 18% for the week. The decline has reversed most of the token's surge from 30 cents to nearly 60 cents observed in seven days to July 16.  Per Prithvir Jhaveri, co-founder and CEO of Loch Research, profit taking by a whale is one of the factors responsible for the price drop.  ""The whale who initiated the pump decreased his holdings to 91m tokens, which is less than what he held before the pump,"" Jhaveri tweeted late Tuesday. ""The whale sold at the top in conjunction with Celsius selling.""  On Monday, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius moved more than a million worth of ZRX, 1INCH and Tether's gold-pegged stablecoin XAUT to institutional crypto exchange FalconX, potentially to liquidate them for bitcoin and ether.

15060023,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543301,1689756950,Signal With Perfect Track Record Predicts Bitcoin Bull Market Parabola: Analyst,"In a recent newsletter by renowned analyst CryptoCon, a groundbreaking indicator known as the “Bitcoin DXY correlation coefficient” has captured the attention of the community. This indicator, which measures the correlation between Bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), has shown remarkable accuracy in predicting Bitcoin’s price movements and signaling the beginning of bull market parabolas. According to CryptoCon, the Bitcoin DXY correlation coefficient is “one of the most interesting finds” he has come across in quite some time. In his newsletter, he explains the significance of this indicator and its implications for the future of Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Bitcoin At Onset Of A Bull Market Parabola? The analyst highlights the three distinct phases that the correlation coefficient enters during a market cycle. He states, “During a given market cycle, the correlation coefficient enters this zone in 3 phases.” These phases are represented by different colors: PURPLE: The first move into the low correlation zone, which occurs slightly before the bear market bottom. RED: The second move into the low correlation zone, marking the end of the bear market or the bottom of the cycle. GREEN: After some time, the metric returns to the low correlation zone, signaling the start of the true bull market parabola. CryptoCon emphasizes the significance of these findings, stating, “And…there are no false signals when viewed in this way, extremely interesting! I have reviewed some other observations that allude to this, but not to this level of preciseness and caliber.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Worst Performance Period Ever: Is the Bottom In Sight? Furthermore, the analyst brings attention to the influence of the U.S. dollar on Bitcoin’s parabola. He explains, “And this is from an outside factor, the Dollar. Meaning that the strength of the US dollar has great influence on when Bitcoin parabola takes place.” This correlation adds an additional layer of complexity and highlights the interplay between these two market forces. Drawing comparisons to the 2013 cycle, the analyst speculates on the potential future trajectory of Bitcoin. He suggests that the upcoming market cycle could resemble a two-curve pattern. CryptoCon states: I believe this could look something like a 2013 cycle. If we are indeed expecting an early powerful bull move, this could come in the form of two curves. He further elaborates on the timeframes for these curves, stating, “The first comes early and would probably end sometime in 2024. The second comes later and ends late 2025 according to my Nov 28th Cycles Theory.” Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead The analyst also shared his price projections for the upcoming bull market parabola. He states, “As for the price target of this parabola, I will speak to the first one. Personally, I would expect it to come just over or short of ATHs. The secondary later top at 90-130k which is my personal range and projection for the cycle.” Concluding the newsletter, he emphasizes the potential opportunity that lies ahead for Bitcoin investors. He states, “So regardless of the short term, big things are on the horizon for Bitcoin according to data. And maybe… just maybe… you might not have to be as patient as you expect for it.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $30,016.

The sale comprised a private placing that raised 5.134 million pounds and a public sale that raised 616,000 pounds, the London Stock Exchange-traded company said Wednesday. The funds will be used to reduce the company's outstanding debt. Argo said prior to the sale it had 59.1 million pounds of debt outstanding.

In April, the London-based company reported a full-year net loss of 194.2 million pounds compared with net income of 30.8 million pounds the year before, reflecting the sharp drop in the value of bitcoin (BTC) during the previous 12 months, as mining firms across the industry struggled to stay afloat.  Argo avoided the fate of bankruptcy that befell some of its peers by agreeing to sell its Helios mining facility in Dickens Country, Texas, to Galaxy Digital for $65 million.

New York Representative Ritchie Torres urged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its Chairman Gary Gensler after “crypto regulation by enforcement had a dreadful day in court.” Crypto regulation by enforcement had a dreadful day in court. In light of the SDNY’s landmark decision in the Ripple case, @SECGov must reassess its reckless regulatory assault on the crypto industry. My letter to Chair Gensler: pic.twitter.com/Mrk63N4KhH — Rep. Ritchie Torres (@RepRitchie) July 18, 2023 Rep. Torres is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. SEC Should Limit Enforcement Cases to “Bonafide Bad Actors” In a letter to Chairman Gensler on July 18, Torres asked the agency to limit its enforcement cases to “bonafide bad actors” rather than “indiscriminately” dealing with most crypto assets as securities under its supervision. Torres’s criticism and motivation to call the SEC out on its “reckless regulatory assault on the crypto industry” followed the landmark court ruling in the SEC’s case against Ripple Labs. The regulator suggested Ripple’s sale of its $XRP token on public exchanges was an offer of securities, leading numerous exchanges to delist the token and its value to plummet. However, a ruling by Judge Analise Torres stated the $XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” In his letter, Rep. Torres said: “I’m writing to inquire if the SEC intends to come to terms with the folly of the Commission’s crusade against crypto assets in light of the latest decision by Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York.” He added: “In a landmark legal opinion, Judge Torres resoundingly rejected the regulatory overreach of the SEC, which has been indiscriminately declaring all crypto assets, except bitcoin, to be securities.” The congressman concluded by saying: I hope that the SEC will find itself so chastened by the court’s decision that it will concentrate the Commission’s enforcement energies where it belongs: on the bonafide bad actors who perpetrate serious transgressions like fraud, market manipulation, and the misappropriation of customer funds. SEC Has Failed to Provide Clear Guidance for the Crypto Industry Rep. Torres, who coincidently shares a last name with the judge presiding over the SEC’s case against Ripple, said: “Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has not issued a single rule on crypto assets, nor has it given any clear guidance.” Adding, “All it has done is sent mixed messages, one after the [other], not only contradicting the CFTC but often contradicting itself.” Torres and other industry experts believe that an immediate appeal by the SEC seems unlikely. The precedent set by the $XRP ruling would jeopardize the agency’s case against Coinbase in particular. Rep. Torres suggested: [The SEC] must reassess its reckless regulatory assault on the crypto industry. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

XRP Dominates The Weekly Timeframe According to crypto market tracker Coingecko data, XRP was trading at $0.814, an increase of nearly 10% over the previous 24 hours. At the time of writing, however, it was in the weekly timeframe that the token proved its worth, skyrocketing by nearly 68%. Source: Coingecko Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, are currently trading below their psychologically significant price levels of $30,000 and $1,500, respectively. Although Bitcoin’s price has been fluctuating around the $30,000 mark recently, Jake Boyle, Chief Commercial Officer of Australian crypto exchange Caleb & Brown, has stated that significant price changes are unlikely unless certain crucial events transpire. For the past three years, Ripple has fought the SEC on claims that the company and two of its executives made an illicit $1.3 billion in sales of XRP. Ripple has refuted these allegations, maintaining that XRP is more akin to a commodity than a security. XRP price movement in the weekly chart. Source: Coingecko. A Watershed Moment For Ripple The SEC Ripple lawsuit’s ruling was a significant moment for cryptocurrencies. Although XRP was deemed not a security, certain token sales were classified as securities transactions. This decision sheds light on the regulatory status and classification of cryptocurrencies by the SEC, impacting the entire industry. It may trigger discussions and lead to clearer regulations for digital assets, boosting investor confidence and fostering a more stable market. The ruling’s ripple effects (no pun intended) may extend globally, influencing other countries’ regulatory approaches.

Regulatory Clarity A Must As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, regulatory clarity becomes crucial for striking a balance between innovation and consumer protection. Market participants will closely monitor how this ruling shapes the future of cryptocurrency regulation. Meanwhile, if the court had sided with the SEC, it might have established a negative precedent for treating other cryptocurrencies, opening the door to more stringent regulations and control. This would have repercussions for any venture with an initial coin offering (ICO) or token sale, including Ripple and XRP. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

They have already accepted BlackRock’s refiled application sparking speculation that approval could be granted. Deadline For Approvals On The Horizon The clock has started ticking for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve or reject BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund. According to the SEC’s official calendar, BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF will be published in the Federal Register and kickstart a 21-day comment period. The application has been added to the SEC docket as part of the rule change process. The development is a significant milestone for the application being considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The world’s largest asset manager had submitted its original application in June. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission knocked back the application, prompting BlackRock to amend it. The updated application included a “surveillance sharing” provision with Coinbase, addressing one of the SEC’s primary concerns with the initial application. More Bitcoin ETFs In The Pipeline BlackRock has over $9.4 trillion in assets under management and is known for obtaining ETF approvals. As a result, the asset manager’s initial application for a spot Bitcoin ETF sparked a rush of applications from other firms looking to do the same. If the ETF is approved, BlackRock customers will be able to invest in Bitcoin without having to hold the token. Instead, these assets can be traded on traditional stock markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already approved the first Bitcoin Futures ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission also has to decide on other applications apart from BlackRock’s for a spot Bitcoin ETF. These include Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETP Trust’s application which was included in the Federal Register on Tuesday. The other applications under consideration are WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. The Securities and Exchange Commission had published documents for public consultation on Bitcoin ETFs last week. However, the review process officially starts when the filings are included in the Federal Register. The initial deadline for approval or rejection is 45 days but can be extended to 240 days. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the SEC would approve any of the applications filed. However, BlackRock’s application has led to considerable optimism surrounding approval. Other applications have already hit the Federal Register, with the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF included in the register on the 15th of May. However, the SEC extended the approval deadline in June. Meanwhile, Valkyrie’s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund has not yet been listed on the Federal Register. Europe’s Spot Bitcoin ETF While American regulators are still considering approval, Europe has moved ahead, with its highly anticipated and long-delayed spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund set to debut later this year. The ETF was filed by London-based multi-asset investment platform Jacobi Asset Management and was originally set to debut on the Euronext Amsterdam Exchange in July 2022. However, the launch was delayed indefinitely thanks to unfavorable market conditions caused by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the FTX exchange.

Joining the Cronos blockchain ecosystem as a node validator, Ubisoft adds its experience and expertise to this expanding digital network. Ubisoft is set to join 27 other node operators contributing to the Cronos open-source blockchain. These node validators play a vital role in ensuring the stability and security of the network. As a validator, Ubisoft will participate in blockchain governance and network update approvals. The decision to join the Cronos ecosystem aligns with Ubisoft's ongoing exploration of blockchain technology, spearheaded by its Strategic Innovation Lab. The inclusion of Ubisoft in the ecosystem aligns with Cronos' strategy of collaboration with technical contributors, which include Crypto.com, Blockdaemon, Dora Factory, and Allnodes, among others. An Extension of Ubisoft-Cronos Relationship The partnership is a progression of the existing relationship between Ubisoft and Cronos. Ubisoft previously participated as a start-up mentor in the Cronos Accelerator program, marking their initial collaborative efforts. Ken Timsit, Managing Director of Cronos Labs, a blockchain startup accelerator, commented on the partnership as well, expressing optimism about Ubisoft's contributions, given their understanding of blockchain's potential and limitations in creating deeper engagement between game creators and gamers. Timsit also mentioned the open-source Cronos project, where Ubisoft is expected to participate as a validator. ""They have unparalleled understanding of the potential and the limitations of blockchain technology when it comes to creating deeper engagement between game creators and gamers,"" Timsit said. Cronos' ecosystem stands to benefit from Ubisoft's expertise, particularly in providing feedback on technology upgrades to support gaming use cases. Ubisoft's Strategic Innovation Lab, tasked with anticipating the future and integrating innovative technologies, will play a pivotal role in this endeavor. Cronos has been active in the gaming industry with Cronos Play, a suite of developer tools and integrations for blockchain-based games. The developer tools are now available as a plugin in the Unreal Engine Marketplace, with more than 15 Web3 games launched or in the pipeline for launch on the Cronos blockchain. Cronos (cronos.org) is an EVM-compatible layer 1 blockchain network built on the Cosmos SDK. It's supported by Crypto.com, Crypto.org, and more than 500 app developers and partners. The platform is adopted by over 1 million users and supports an ecosystem of more than 80 million users worldwide with the Cronos ($CRO) cryptocurrency. Ubisoft's venture into the Cronos ecosystem reinforces the growing interest of leading technology firms in blockchain technology and its myriad applications.

42410161,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUEaP,1689746107,Stride Blockchain Will Move to ATOM-Powered Security Model,"Stride, the Cosmos-based liquid staking protocol, is scheduled to transition to Cosmos' interchain security (ICS) system powered by ATOM tokens from the existing stride (STRD) token model.  ""The transition will likely happen on Wednesday between 17:00 UTC and 21:30 UTC at block height 4616678,"" Stride's contributor Ian Unsworth told CoinDesk.  ""While Stride has $35 million plus in total value locked, it only has $19 million of economic security via bonded network tokens. Following the ICS transition, block production/security will be passed to the ATOM validator set, providing roughly a 11,935.2% increase on the economic security of the network,"" Unsworth added.  Per the official blog, the shift to ICS will boost Stride's economic security from roughly $25 million to $2.3 billion, making the liquid staking protocol more resilient to hacks.  Cosmos' interchain security leases ATOM-backed validators to consumer chains, allowing them to share Cosmos' security using ATOMS instead of their native tokens. Cosmos Hub, a blockchain intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network, runs a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that involves ATOM tokens.  It means that post-transition, Stride will be secured by staked ATOM instead of STRD tokens and Cosmos' validator set will take over block production from the existing Stride validator set. Stride will essentially become a consumer chain, allowing Hub's validator to participate in its consensus. STRD will continue to have utility, generating staking rewards. At press time, the market capitalization of STRD tokens was $86.7 million, while ATOM boasted a market value of $2.73 billion, per data source Coingecko.  The transition will also impact STRD's tokenomics, given stakers have decided to reduce STRD distributed as staking rewards by 50%. Further, 15% of the STRD staking rewards will be shared with Cosmos Hub.  ""STRD has a hard cap of 100 million tokens. According to the original tokenomics, in the first year, 2,608,200 STRD is emitted as staking rewards. As part of Stride’s transition to ICS, that figure will be reduced by half, to 1,304,100 STRD annualized. This reduction will be implemented in a preparatory chain upgrade prior to the transition to ICS,"" the official blog said.",POSITIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/19/stride-blockchain-will-move-to-atom-powered-security-model,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/852d680647ec40c37386b9a78b5c0414d8bea50f-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The closed-door session will mainly revolve around digital-asset legislation, covering critical aspects like taxation, national security, privacy, and climate. A Step Toward Regulatory Clarity The upcoming meeting comes as Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, contends with a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Armstrong has bbeen spearheading a campaign in Washington aimed at establishing clearer regulations around digital assets. The U.S. firm has been urging lawmakers to consider two circulating bills that promise more definitive guidance on crypto exchange registration with regulators. The New Democrat Coalition, comprising of some 100 center-left members, is the group scheduled for the meeting with Armstrong. The coalition aims to collaborate across party lines to foster innovative, inclusive, and forward-thinking policies, as stated on their website. Navigating a Regulatory Maze The SEC accuses Coinbase of violating rules that necessitate it to register as a securities exchange. Coinbase rejects these allegations and has motioned for the lawsuit's dismissal. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler's leadership, has amplified its focus on the cryptocurrency industry, launching several enforcement actions in recent months. Armstrong has highlighted inconsistencies in statements by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), two separate US regulators, over which body has jurisdiction over segments of the crypto industry. ""This is why the US Congress is introducing new legislation to fix the situation,"" Armstrong stated. The meeting's outcome could potentially inform legislative direction for the US crypto industry, significantly affecting businesses and investors in the sector. Last week, Coinbase shares surged by 24% following a federal court ruling perceived as potentially restricting SEC oversight on what can be listed on cryptocurrency trading platforms. This gathering signals a significant development for the cryrptocurrency industry, providing a platform for open dialogue and potential consensus on the sector's regulatory landscape. In the face of an increasingly regulated and scrutinized industry, the meeting offers a chance for Armstrong and other crypto industry leaders to influence future legislation and seek clarity on existing regulatory expectations.

According to a recent report by Messari, the network’s daily average active addresses and transactions on the C-Chain was increased by 132.1% and 162.2%, respectively, primarily due to a rise in stablecoin liquidity and activity from LayerZero. Avalanche’s Unprecedented Growth Per the report, despite the challenging regulatory climate, Avalanche’s financial performance improved in Q2, with revenue in AVAX increasing by 173.1% Quarter-Over Quarter (QoQ) (up 150.3% in USD terms). The increased revenue was partly due to higher transaction fees but primarily due to the activity stemming from LayerZero. The difference between the change in revenue versus market cap suggests that the overall fundamental network utility was more significant than market behavior in Q2. Avalanche concluded the quarter as the 18th largest crypto asset by market capitalization, reaching $4.5 billion. Related Reading: Thodex CEO Sentenced To Prison For Tax Evasion Furthermore, the platform has been launching new subnets like Evergreen Subnets and Spruce, which have ushered in partners like T. Rowe Price, WisdomTree, Wellington Management, and Cumberland. Alibaba Cloud also launched Cloudverse, a launchpad for businesses to deploy metaverses on Avalanche, and SK, one of South Korea’s largest conglomerates, launched its dedicated Avalanche Subnet, UPTN. In Q4 2022, LayerZero, an Omnichain interoperability protocol enabling cross-chain applications, launched support for BTC.b, a token representing Bitcoin on Avalanche. Compared to other natively bridged Bitcoin assets, BTC.b allows users to freely transfer native Bitcoin without relying on custodians. BTC.b adoption on Avalanche quickly grew after LayerZero’s support in Q4 2022. Avalanche NFT Secondary Sales And Unique Buyers Decrease According to Messari, the Avalanche NFT sector experienced a decline in Q2 of 2023, with secondary sales volume and the number of unique NFT buyers decreasing by 38.3% and 49.8%, respectively. However, despite the decline, Avalanche’s developer ecosystem expanded the NFT sector through new initiatives and partnerships. One such initiative was the Avaissance program, launched in Q1 to accelerate artists’ careers and catalyze the Avalanche NFT ecosystem. The program comprised an Artist-in-Residence program and the Mona Lisa Initiative for digital art curation. During Q2, 70 artists were selected to participate in the 6-month Artist-in-Residence program, and the Mona Lisa Initiative announced the initial group of participating DAOs. Superchief Gallery NFT, Zeroone, and Peek NFT, three new marketplaces also announced partnerships with Avalanche and Ava Labs to launch unique NFT marketplaces. In the gaming sector, DeFi Kingdoms continued to dominate, generating the lion’s share of transaction activity on the Avalanche network. However, several developments are underway to usher in more gaming activity from other applications. Related Reading: XRP Overtakes Bitcoin In Highest Weekly Trading Volume Following Legal Triumph Avalanche introduced Avalanche Arcad3, a program to accelerate gaming development with partners like GREE, Loco, and TSM, and Merit Circle’s launch of Beam, a subnet catering to gamers and game developers.

Overall, Q2 was a positive quarter for Avalanche, and the platform’s plans for 2023 remain robust as it seeks to remain competitive throughout the rest of the year. Despite the challenges posed by the SEC, Avalanche’s renewed network activity and expansion plans suggest that the platform is well-equipped to navigate the evolving landscape of the blockchain industry.

Although many parts of the altcoin market are beginning the day as a sea of red, XRP is continuing its upwards trajectory, rising 5% to hit $0.77.  The current Bitcoin movements indicate that the market is range-bound and stagnant, Jake Boyle, the Chief Commercial Officer at Australian crypto exchange Caleb & Brown said on CoinDesk TV.  While Bitcoin is experiencing some ups and downs around the $30,000 mark, Boyle argues that no major movements are expected until certain key events take place.  Stellar, Solana, and Optimism have shown explosive growth following last week's XRP news, each for different reasons.  ""Stellar is regularly associated with XRP... Optimism provides something new, it hasn't experienced a dramatic bull market, and it hasn't come down 99% from its all-time high,"" Boyle said.  Right now, Boyle is interested in Ethereum as he’s observed a “noticeable increase in buying power against bitcoin.”  “Ethereum is prone to upgrades. It’s prone to community changes,” he said, explaining how it's more receptive to news announcements and updates while bitcoin stays relatively constant.  “Bitcoin is just bitcoin,” he said.

Ripple's partial win last week in its long-running Federal court feud with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely benefit Coinbase by clarifying a nettlesome aspect of crypto regulation and enabling the exchange to re-list certain tokens, John Todaro, a senior research analyst at broker Needham & Company, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program Tuesday.  Todaro noted that industry observers had feared a decision favoring the SEC would have required Coinbase to delist tokens, potentially costing it more than a third of its revenue.  ""It does remove some those concerns that along the way, Coinbase might have to delist a lot of assets, which is going to be a big deterrent to their exchange business, which is where they get most of their revenue,"" Todaro said, adding that the ruling would also ""give institutional investors more clarity.""  ""Now you can start digging into Coinbase fundamentals a bit more versus the stock only moving just on regulatory concerns or positive regulatory announcements.""  Last Thursday, a U.S. district court ruled that Ripple’s XRP token should not be considered a security if sold via an exchange or through programmatic sales. In a research report the following day, Todaro and another analyst, Daniel Lehmann wrote that the decision could boost Coinbase shares by establishing that token sales through exchanges, at least in the case of XRP, did not violate securities laws.  Read More: Ripple’s XRP Summary Judgment Positive for Coinbase, Price Target Raised to $120: Needham  ""This outcome should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock,” the analysts wrote.  The broker maintained a buy rating on Coinbase shares and raised its price target to $120 from $70. Coinbase shares closed at $104.59, down 0.9% but are up more than 23% since last Thursday.  Coinbase has faced its own regulatory issues, including an SEC lawsuit last month accusing the exchange of violating securities law, and it also still addressing the fall-out from a lengthy bear market that has spooked investors.  In the ""First Mover"" interview, Todaro predicted that Coinbase trading volumes for its second quarter (ending June 30) should be the poorest second quarter since the exchange started trading publicly in 2021. But he said July volumes ""are okay,"" and that investors should already have priced in the company's Q2 issues. ""Folks should start looking at what's coming up,"" including next year's bitcoin halving, ""which is historically coinciding with higher crypto prices, ETF applications and a little bit more of a positive view on regulation,"" he said, and described the exchange as ""the only kind of adult left in the room at the exchange level.

15046850,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543252,1689728415,Bitcoin’s Worst Performance Period Ever: Is the Bottom In Sight?,"The ongoing bear market in Bitcoin is the longest in the network’s history, Glassnode data shows. According to trackers, the winter started on November 10, 2021, after prices peaked at over $69,000. As of July 18, 2023, BTC is trading at around the $30,000 level, down by almost 55% from its all-time high. However, despite the crash and bears persistence, recent developments suggest that the bottom might be in. Bitcoin Bear Run Over? Trackers reveal that this is the second largest phase when the coin’s prices have remained under water for this extended period. Between 2015 and 2016, which was still the formative stages of the coin when its liquidity was building up, the coin remained depressed for 386 days. BTC investors were also under pressure between 2018 and 2019 when prices drastically fell from 2017 peaks, crashing to as low as $4,000 at the depth of the crypto winter of 2018. The extended bear run from 2021 has been influenced by several fundamental factors, including the U.S. Federal Reserve’s intervention which saw the central bank take measures to tame inflation by raising interest rates in eight consecutive sessions. There have been fear factors relating to the collapse of major crypto firms, including 3AC, FTX, Voyager, and the spectacular depegging and crash of UST and LUNA. Following the collapse of FTX in November, Bitcoin prices fell to all low as $15,800 before expanding, roughly doubling in the first half of 2023. Hash Rate And BlackRock ETF Application Despite relatively low Bitcoin prices and the continuation of the bear run, the network’s hash rate is trending at a near-all-time high. As of July 18, Bitcoin’s hash rate stood at over 385 EH/s, retracing from all-time highs of 465 EH/s recorded in late June 2021. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Deposit Big To Exchanges, Bearish Sign? Historically, prices and hash rate are directly correlated but falling coin prices didn’t dissuade miners from buying new gear and plugging into the network, fortifying it against attacks. The hash rate measures processing power channeled to a proof-of-work network like Bitcoin. The higher it is, the more secure the blockchain is against potential attackers. Reports on July 16 indicated that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had accepted BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This is a significant milestone for the Bitcoin-related proposal and may strengthen prices if the regulator eventually approves the derivative, allowing institutions to have exposure. Presently, Bitcoin is teetering close to $30,000 and looks weak. Bulls have been unable to close above $32,000 despite BlackRock’s reapplication of the spot Bitcoin ETF.

The firm filed for its first spot Bitcoin ETF in June, only for changes to the made and the application to be updated before being resubmitted. It remains to be seen if the approval of an ETF marks the bottom for Bitcoin and the nascent asset class.

It experienced a significant rebound from its $5 support level and has since continued on an upward trajectory. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Deposit Big To Exchanges, Bearish Sign? Over the past week, LINK has surged more than 12%, although its daily chart indicates a slowdown in gains. The coin formed a bullish reversal pattern, driving a substantial price surge. The technical outlook for LINK reflects bullish strength, albeit with a slight decline in demand and accumulation on the chart. In recent trading sessions, LINK has formed a pattern that suggests a potential reversal in price direction. To prevent this reversal, it is crucial for LINK to maintain its upward movement and surpass immediate resistance levels. Additionally, a slight decline in market capitalization indicates a decrease in buying strength. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Chainlink (LINK) was trading at $6.90. The coin has demonstrated significant bullish strength following its recent reversal from the $5 level, driven by the formation of an inverted head and shoulders pattern in the last week. However, despite the upward surge, LINK may encounter resistance around the $7.30 mark, which has historically acted as a strong ceiling for the coin. This resistance is further supported by the formation of a double-top pattern (marked in red), which is considered a bearish signal. As a result, there is a possibility that LINK may experience a decline towards the local support level of $6.60 and potentially even further to $5.80 before attempting a recovery once again. Technical Analysis During the formation of the double-top pattern, there was a notable decline in buying strength, suggesting an impending bearish price movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated a bearish divergence, indicating a decrease in demand. Although the RSI remained above the half-line, readings indicated a fading buying strength. Despite this, LINK has managed to stay above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers still have control over price momentum. However, if there is a drop from the current price level, it could lead to LINK falling below the 20-SMA (red), which could bring sellers back into the market. On the one-day chart, the altcoin has exhibited buy signals, although these signals have been experiencing a slight decline. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which reflects price momentum and trend reversals, has formed declining green histograms, suggesting a potential decrease in buy signals.
