42397997,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8dq,1413652877,Hedgy Hopes to Tackle Bitcoin Volatility Using Multi-Signature Technology,"A new startup named Hedgy is looking to tackle one of bitcoin’s biggest problems – volatility.  While an entire industry including payment processors, wallets and data-driven tools has been built around bitcoin, the thorny issue of how to reduce its volatility against more familiar fiat currencies still remains.  The team at Hedgy thinks that the ability to use multi-signature addresses to execute derivative contracts might be a way for bitcoin companies to “hedge,” or mitigate, the risk inherent in bitcoin’s fluctuating value.  Matt Slater, CEO of Hedgy, told CoinDesk he believes his startup is important to the industry because it tries to solve bitcoin’s biggest problem for merchants and others interested in bitcoin:  “Bitcoin is a very new market. Volatility is the number one barrier to entry for a lot of businesses.""  Hedgy’s beginnings  Websites like btcvol.info track the ongoing volatility of bitcoin, but it doesn’t take a market analyst to look at a historic price chart and recognize that the digital currency doesn’t exactly behave like a stable currency.  Hedgy first began attacking the problem in April, when Slater and his early team competed in Boost VC’s bitcoin hackathon and took second place under the project name Coindash.  One of the judges in the competition was Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, who seemed impressed by the team's approach to reduce volatility risk.  Slater recalls:  “We came out of the hackathon with guns blazing and some early validation from Brian Armstrong.”  Hedgy has spent the past several months working on its backend as part of the most recent batch of Boost VC startups, and has solidified its technology and product offering for potential customers.  A simple agreement  Minimizing currency volatility is nothing new to many businesses, which need to hedge accounts receivable for multiple currencies. But, bringing the concept to cryptocurrencies is a more recent idea.  Hedgy uses a derivative called an over the counter non-deliverable forward contract to accomplish this.  It sounds complicated, but essentially, it's an agreement between two parties to buy or sell something in the future. The novel aspect of this agreement is that it puts in place a stipulation to exchange only price variation.  “All it means is that instead of exchanging bitcoin at the end you just exchange the price difference,” said Slater.  It works like this: to lock into this type of agreement, one party would sell, for example, bitcoin for the price of $500 in three month's time to another party.  Both parties would put up a percentage of the agreed-upon amount in bitcoin, indicated in the contract. The value at the end of the three months will be based on the price movement of bitcoin to date.  Slater described a scenario that highlights why this is important for bitcoin-accepting merchants, since it retains the value of the digital currency:  ""Imagine I have 1,000 BTC and want to enter into a forward contract to sell 1,000 BTC in three months for $500. At the end of that three months, my 1,000 BTC at $500, or $500,000, will still be worth $500,000.”  A smart contract  What might be most interesting about Hedgy is how they plan to enforce these forward contracts in a programmable way.  By building its own smart contracts powered by multi-signature, Hedgy takes the third party risk directly out of its derivative offerings.  Slater explained the smart contract multi-signature technology:  “When two people enter into a contract, the collateral is always held in a multi-signature wallet. And the only authorization we have is to determine which party gets what with our signing key at the end of the contract. We don’t hold any of the funds.”  Essentially, the agreement between the two parties is executed programmatically at the predetermined date; a product offering Hedgy says is the first of its kind in the bitcoin industry.  “We feel like we’re really the first ones to apply this to derivatives,” Slater said.  Slater said that these types of automated executable contracts – rather than the current available solutions – are what's needed to propel bitcoin forward.  “If you look at the current derivative marketplaces, you have to send them your bitcoin. We just think that is a very bitcoin 1.0 solution,” he said.  With Hedgy, the funds are kept client side in a locked multi-signature wallet until the execution date. By utilizing the block chain, the process is safer for everyone involved.  Slater added:  “We’re not holding the funds, we’re not taking custody. Our vision and what we’re building here is a smart contract that executes itself. Once it’s released, it’s released into the block chain.“  Customers need hedging  Hedgy sees a number of use cases for limiting volatility risk in digital currencies such as bitcoin, and as a result, the company is building several products.  The first one is a merchant product for organizations that need to hold on to bitcoin for a period of time but don’t want to bite their nails watching the price bounce up and down.  Slater described the offering:  “[The] merchant product is called the BitLock. Enter in an amount of bitcoin you want to hedge, and we take care of everything else.”  Another product is called BitForward and is focused more on investors. BitForward will likely be linked up with existing companies in the bitcoin ecosystem.  “Our distribution strategy is that we’re building a Coinbase app, as well as plugging into different exchanges. Sort of like how E*Trade plugs in to an OTC market,” Slater said.  Hedgy has four full-time employees on its team: two full stack engineers, a designer and Slater, who is the self-described “finance guy”.  By focusing on technology that diminishes the issues related to bitcoin volatility, the company expects to develop other products and services along the way.  Commercial ideas for Hedgy's smart contract multi-signature technology have probably not yet been imagined, according to Slater:  “We’re not limiting the use cases. We’re planning a suite of different products down the road.""  Hedgy is currently in private beta, accepting users on a case-by-case basis, according to the company. Prospective users can sign up for updates on the company's offerings on its website.

42397995,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8Zu,1413645786,Why Brazil's Bitcoin Market is Struggling to Ignite,"For better or worse, the story of bitcoin in Brazil begins with Leandro César Marciano.  An IT consultant from Belo Horizonte, Marciano founded and later sold the country's largest bitcoin exchange Mercado Bitcoin following an alleged security breach, and launched Bitcoin Rain, an investment scheme suspended by the government and later likened to the infamous US ponzi scheme, Bitcoin Savings & Trust. Informal estimates suggest the ventures resulted in the loss of 4,000 BTC in consumer funds.  Harder to calculate is the effect that Marciano's services had on early tech adopters who, unlike their peers internationally, may not have been able to enjoy bitcoin's meteoric rise in value to more than $1,000 at the end of 2013.  The idea that the events have hindered bitcoin adoption in Latin America's largest market lingers, and is just one theory as to why Brazil, despite being the regional leader in bitcoin users by some metrics, hasn't been as visible or as vocal as Argentina.  Members of Brazil's bitcoin community told CoinDesk that, while past issues have contributed to the current weak market, more important hurdles remain. A lingering regulatory uncertainty, a relative lack of merchant adoption and the limited availability of Portuguese-language bitcoin resources, they said, are all reasons why Brazil's market has yet to ignite.  Local entrepreneurs like Andre Horta, CEO of bitcoin and litecoin exchange BitcoinToYou, are unsurprisingly eager to put the shadow of Marciano and Bitcoin Rain behind them as they look to alter this narrative and tackle more pressing issues.  ""I prefer not to talk about this, because I prefer to look to the future,"" Horta told CoinDesk.  High adoption, low visibility  While Argentina has seen a host of bitcoin startups and organisations that have received international investor and media attention, Brazil arguably hasn't risen to prominence within the bitcoin community. This is despite that fact that publically available data on Bitcoin-QT wallet downloads suggests Brazil may have twice as many bitcoin users as Argentina and the most in South America.  Rafael Olaio, co-founder of Brazil-based Ripple gateway provider Rippex, told CoinDesk he believes adoption figures are high due to this international hype surrounding bitcoin as an investment opportunity and technology, but that to date, entrepreneurs have done little to translate this initial interest into a dedicated user base.  ""There has been a lack of innovation and everyday use cases for bitcoin to make an impact on local lives,"" Olaio said.  Further, domestic news interest in bitcoin remains focused largely on international markets, suggesting awareness of domestic products and services is low.  Época NEGÓCIOS editor Pedro Carvalho indicated he has hardly covered any bitcoin stories for his business publication, outside from a failed attempt to interview Marciano, while major tech publications focus on larger, international announcements.  BitInvest  CEO Flavio Pripas, whose company operates a bitcoin exchange and newly launched merchant processing service, believes that the country's business environment has impeded the ability to startups to capitalize on interest in digital currency.  Pripas told CoinDesk:  ""Brazilians in general are very open to new technologies and are heavy users of [the] Internet. The problem is that unfortunately we still lack a better environment for doing business and innovating, which can delay the launch of local services despite the great talent and innovative drive of its people.""  Attacking foreign exchange  Yet another reason bitcoin has generated less interest in Brazil is that the country's native currency, the real, has proven to be more reliable than the government-backed options available in its neighboring states.  Olaio suggested that bitcoin is far more useful as a store of value in countries like Argentina and Venezuela, where consumers are able to use bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. However, he believes that there are powerful and unique use cases for digital currency that can appeal to the local market, and that attacking foreign exchange controls is the most prudent first step for the domestic market.  ""Bitcoin can provide a way for consumers to invest money in new ways because it releases some of the controls applied on fiat currencies and precious metals by putting something very convertible and mobile in your hand, that can be traded for other assets or arbitraged,"" Olaio explained.  Olaio believes arbitrage, the act of buying bitcoin at a lower price on one exchange then selling it at more favorable prices, has so far been the main driver of the domestic market.  ""I believe the market right now has been driven by arbitrage and traders, and they are profiting from buying abroad and selling here,” he said.  Olaio noted that while the price of bitcoin on Bistamp may be $400, the price on a local Brazilian exchange could be $50 higher due to forex costs.  New Mercado Bitcoin CEO Rodrigo Batista has already seen success with this customer base. After purchasing Mercado Bitcoin in 2013 from Marciano, the order book exchange has remained the largest in Brazil by volume despite increasing competition and the early negative perception of his company.  Batista told CoinDesk that he first took an interest to bitcoin as an arbitrage trader, and that Mercado Bitcoin provides consumers with an attractive way to play the markets.  ""We are in a very good position now, we have been talking to international VCs and the guys get surprised about our numbers, what we have been doing here, about the number of clients we have, about the volumes and the revenues we have,"" Batista said. ""We don't enter fights for 0% fees like what happened in Asia.""  Long term, Batista said, the market will shift as bitcoin and its related technologies become more widely used in remittances, which he suggested would drive greater mainstream adoption.  Boosting merchant adoption  Another reason cited for Brazil's somewhat stagnant bitcoin market is the relative lack of high-profile merchants who are accepting bitcoin, although just last week, homebuilding firm Tecnisa became the country's largest business to accept bitcoin through a partnership with BitInvest, with revenues of R$1.8bn in 2013 (roughly $720,000).  However, for more mainstream merchants to begin to adopt bitcoin, local market observers indicated there must first be quality solutions for the market.  Batista, for example, cited the relative weakness of existing local solutions, though he suggested the lack of payment processors isn't the fault of entrepreneurs.  ""The bitcoin gateway business requires a good amount of capital for development of the technology itself and for sales,"" Batista said. ""Raising money in Brazil for this type of business, that requires a lot of capital and involves high risk is very hard.""  He went on to cite the fundraising power of BitPay and Coinbase as evidence of the needs of this business sector.  Pripas agreed, though his company is intent on making progress toward addressing this market need, and that there is interest from the country's merchant base.  ""We need better products for a seamless integration with the merchant's existing systems,"" he said. ""I have been talking to the main online payment gateways and big e-commerce companies and they have been very receptive to this innovation.""  Regulatory uncertainty remains  As in most countries, regulation is still cited as a major roadblock for the local market.  To date, Banco Central do Brasil has issued a warning to consumers, while Receita Federal (RF), the country's tax authority, has ruled that bitcoin sales are subject to capital gains. However, for local bitcoin startups, communication has been in short supply.  BitInvest reported it has reached out to Banco Central do Brasil, RF and Comissão de Valores Mobiliários, the country's securities regulator, and that it intends to make its services available to regulators. Further, BitInvest said it plans to work together with the Brazilian Bitcoin Foundation to promote dialogue.  Marcelo Godke Viega, a partner at law firm Godke, Silva & Rocha told CoinDesk that such conversations are needed. Bitcoin, he said, is currently considered an asset under federal law, but the country's foreign exchange rules are cause for concern, as they may prevent bitcoin from being used in what may be its most compelling domestic use case.  ""Foreign exchange transactions must be strictly done in accordance with the regulations. Any transaction that should have been undertaken as a foreign exchange transaction that took a different shape and is not in accordance with the regulation could be considered a crime,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Thus, I have several concerns that, until duly regulated, there could be a bunch of illegal bitcoin transactions.""  Viega, who provides legal services to bitcoin clients, argues that this in turn could hold back local businesses and overall adoption.  ""I believe that [there is a] sheer lack of regulation or any rules that would allow people to transact in bitcoins but not get in trouble,"" he said. ""People are truly afraid of doing deals in bitcoins, as they have no idea about their rights and obligations under this type of asset.""  Perhaps more troubling, he said the country's regulators may not provide clarity to these issues for some time.  Leandro César Marciano declined to contribute to this report.

42398002,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8hm,1413636156,Review: Bitcoin 'Vault' Trezor Lives Up to its Name,"Although most bitcoin users rely on freely-available web and mobile wallets, recent security scares clearly illustrate the need for safer alternatives. Here, we take a closer look at one device designed to address the problem.  The Trezor hardware wallet is targeted at bitcoiners who wish to maintain a substantial stash of coins, but do not want to rely on third-party bitcoin storage services or impractical forms of cold storage.  Developed by Czech startup SatoshiLabs, the $99 device is essentially a USB dongle designed to add an extra authentication layer to all outbound bitcoin transactions.  By virtue of its design, Trezor can be used to sign transactions on 'unsafe' computers and is impervious to keyloggers and many other vectors of attack, so even if your host PC is compromised, the attacker has no way of getting your private key.  That's also where the device gets its name, as 'trezor' translates into 'vault' in most Slavic languages, including Czech. A kind of 'vault' for your private bitcoin key, Trezor claims to use a number of clever tricks to maintain security even on compromised and unsafe machines.  Here, we take a closer look at these failsafes one at a time, from setup to transaction.  SatoshiLabs TrezorTREZOR™ Grey$99BUY NOW  Unboxing and specs  The device is roughly the size of an average USB stick, albeit somewhat wider, and ships in a very small package.  The box features a holographic sticker on top and a warning urging users to get in touch with support in case they suspect the package was opened.  The sticker feels redundant however, as there is so much glue holding the box together that it is practically impossible to open without causing an obvious amount of damage in the process.  The box includes the Trezor device, a USB to micro-USB cable, an installation manual and a (very) small lanyard.  As for the device itself, we got a white, plastic sample. It also comes in grey and black.  Although the company developed and marketed metal units, they are no longer on offer and the first batches went out to early Trezor backers earlier this year.  The CE and RoHS-certified device measures 60 x 30 x 6mm (2.4 x 1.2 x 0.2 inches) and weighs in at 12g (0.42oz).  While not certified as fully waterproof, the company says the device is at least water resistant.  In terms of hardware, Trezor is based on an ARM Cortex M3 processor clocked at 120MHz. It has a 128 x 64 pixel OLED screen that is both legible and crisp.  The second component of the user interface comes in the form of two hardware buttons, used to perform a number of actions necessary to set up the device and sign transactions.  A standard micro-USB port is located at the bottom. The micro-USB port is the device's only communication with the outside world and only source of power, as there is no battery on board.  As far as build quality goes, things could have been better.  The top of the device and the edges feel very robust, but the same cannot be said of the centre, between the buttons and micro USB port. This part of the device exhibits a bit of flex and it squeaks when pressure is applied.  However, the white plastic has a matte anti-scratch finish and it should be able to stand up to a fair bit of abuse.  The plastic lanyard pin is surrounded by sharp edges and the opening is poorly shaped, so inserting a lanyard can be frustrating.  This may sound like a case of nitpicking, so let's be clear: for a USB dongle, the build quality and design are excellent, but consumers spoiled by bulletproof high-end smartphones may find these minor issues annoying.  Trezor installation  Installing the device is straightforward, but it involves a bit of work.  There is no way of getting around this, as you must jump through a number of hoops since you are dealing with a secure device.  After connecting the device, the first step is to head over to myTREZOR and download a browser plugin. The process is automated, although the user needs to allow the plugin to install.  Once the plugin is activated, myTREZOR will prompt you to enter a PIN.  This is where the keylogger protection kicks in. You don't actually type the PIN, you have to click on an obscured numerical pad displayed in the browser.  The position of each number changes randomly, so every time you enter the PIN you will have to check your Trezor device for the layout.  An attacker using a simple keylogger, or even an attacker with complete remote access to the desktop, would not be able to determine the numbers, as they are displayed only on the Trezor device.  The next order of business is to write down a randomly generated 24-word seed. This seed will allow you to reconstruct your Trezor wallet in case you lose the device.  This is the only backup that can be used to recover your wallet in case of loss or theft. Trezor uses BIP39 and BIP44 standards for creating new wallets, so the generated seed can be recovered and used by other compatible wallets.  SatoshiLabs confirmed that users can use Mycelium 2.0, Wallet32 or Multibit HD to load Trezor's recovery seed to their computer.  Technically, the device does not use standard random algorithms, as they would make it prone to random generator attacks.  Instead, it uses deterministic signatures and external random entropy sources, which means it uses multiple different sources to generate the 'random' seed.  The whole setup should take no more than 10-15 minutes.  Convenience and everyday use  The Trezor wallet tries to reconcile two opposite extremes.  On one hand it adds a new layer of security, but at the same time tries to make the user experience as simple as possible.  The device tackles the problem admirably, since there is not a lot of work left after the initial setup.  Using Trezor is not time consuming and a transaction can be approved in a matter of clicks, with minimal interaction with the device.  You have to punch in the PIN to access the wallet and each transaction must be approved on the device.  While the default myTrezor wallet offers a sleek design and works quite well, it still relies on a single service.  For this reason, users wanting to avoid any form of centralisation can opt for either third-party wallet. The device currently supports Multibit HD (beta) and Electrum 2.0 wallets.  You don't need the device to receive bitcoins, only to send them. Even then, the process is rather straightforward, but Trezor isn't intended for every bitcoin transaction you make.  Ideally it should be used to secure a substantial cache of bitcoins, transferring them to more convenient mobile wallet platforms for smaller transactions.  One potential issue for the device is its lack of mobile support.  For the time being, the Trezor device can only work with desktop operating systems such as Windows, OS X and Linux. This means you cannot pair it with your mobile phone or tablet, unless you happen to use a Windows 8.1 tablet.  However, Satoshi Labs is working on enabling USB On-The-Go (OTG) functionality, which would enable its use on Android devices.  This is planned for future releases and an open-source library for Android OTG support is already available on GitHub. Another update will enable support for BIP70, the latest bitcoin payment protocol designed to offer additional security-oriented features.  Conclusions  The Trezor hardware wallet works as advertised. It offers a number of advantages over traditional wallets and renders your private key impervious to many forms of attack.  The downside is that it is simply not an on-the-go device that can be used to make everyday transactions.  Rather, it is a niche product for people looking to secure their bitcoins and top up mobile wallets from time to time.  In other words, if you do not have a bitcoin stash at all times, Trezor (and other hardware wallets) are simply not designed for you.  Crypto enthusiasts, BTC hoarders and small businesses are the target audience. It lives up to its name, as it is more of a crypto vault than a wallet.  Since Trezor has no battery and relies on external power, it could work as a mobile solution, provided Android support is implemented.  It is compact enough to carry around on a keychain and connect to a phone when necessary, so we expect Satoshi Labs to tackle OTG support soon.  The Trezor can be purchased direct from Satoshilabs for $99.
