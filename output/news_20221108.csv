3972543,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=509933,1667950766,"Dogecoin Co-Founder Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $100,000","The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has suffered a 5% decline from its $20,000 level, which it has maintained for a couple of weeks. However, during the short rally a few weeks back, Bitcoin’s valuation recovered from its three-month low, shooting above $21,000. Related Reading: Can Solana (SOL) Sustain Its Google-Triggered Price Rally? These gains brought hope to the crypto market and boosted investors’ confidence that the crypto winter is about to end. However, the November 7 market record has shattered their hopes, with many cryptocurrencies falling back to their decline, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. But Billy Markus, the co-creator of Dogecoin, believes that Bitcoin may reach $100,000 one day. He said this in response to Madam Doge, a Twitter user who lamented BTC’s current price while citing Michael Saylor’s Bullish Bitcoin predictions. Markus added that Bitcoin price would reach that much in a future where $100k would only buy a sandwich due to inflation or when the current users might have already died. The conversation began with Madam Doge complaining and enquiring why the Bitcoin price fell, while Markus said it was due to massive sellouts. Possible Reasons Behind Bitcoin Decline In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin dropped below $20,000 and currently trading around the $19,500 level. The asset was trading at $20,400 24 hours ago, the level it managed to maintain for two weeks. The performance got the market thinking that BTC is retracing its way upwards. According to a Coinglass report, $112.83 million in cryptocurrency was liquidated, while 95% of long positions got wiped out. More data on the massive sell-off also followed, revealing liquidations worth $300 million. The market volatility often depends on Bitcoin’s performance. However, the present one is different. The liquidation data shows that Ethereum and FTT were probably the cause of Bitcoin’s massive sell-off. The feud between Binance and FTX resulted in a 19% drop in FTT value. Furthermore, due to potential insolvency issues, FTX decided to raise funds by selling off its Ethereum holdings. Santiment’s report confirmed the increase in selling pressure. The blockchain analytics firm also confirmed the offload of ETH from FTX’s ETH wallets. Within a few days, FTX withdrew 300,000 ETH from its wallets, resulting in high selling pressure on Ethereum markets. As a result, Ethereum and XRP are down by 6%, with ETH dropping below its $1,500 psychological level. Dogecoin And Other Memecoins Fall back Meanwhile, the memecoins which have been in the limelight following Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition are also down. For example, Dogecoin is faring much worse than Bitcoin and Ethereum, with approximately a 15% loss in valuation, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped 8%.

42415049,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWHPJ,1667949240,"Market Wrap: Binance/FTX Deal Sends Bitcoin, Other Cryptos Spiraling","Price Action  Crypto investors couldn’t make up their minds on Tuesday whether they liked Binance’s proposed purchase of rival FTX.  In the immediate aftermath of the announced deal, they sent bitcoin’s price tumbling well below $20,000, its support of the last two weeks. Hours later, prices were bounding above the threshold. But by the afternoon, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had plummeted under $19,000 for the first time since mid September. BTC was recently trading at about $18,500, down more than 10% over the previous 24 hours and its first time under $19,000 since mid October.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Ether and most major altcoins whipsawed similarly. The second largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands just above $1,300, a more than 15% drop from Monday, same time, and its lowest level in more than two weeks.  The carnage swept up tokens from all parts of the crypto spectrum. FTX’s FTT was trading at just over $5, a more than 75% decline during the past 24 hours. Solana's SOL, which had tumbled Monday on speculation that Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research, might have to dump some of its holdings in a bid to raise liquidity, was off over 20%. Binance’s BNB token outperformed the market, but was still down about 4%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was down a whopping 10%.  “The FTT token will find it very hard if not impossible to recover while SOL and ecosystem tokens are likely to suffer losses too as trust appears to be eroded entirely,” wrote Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, in an email to CoinDesk, although he noted optimistically that “we don’t “expect bitcoin to face an extreme scenario. In fact, it could see increased inflows as market participants withdraw from riskier assets.”  “Either way, the sooner this gets resolved the better it is for the space, especially as it is likely to draw more attention from regulators,” DiPasquale wrote.  As U.S. voters went to the polls for midterm elections, stocks continued their momentum from Monday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose a few fractions of a percentage point, while the the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was up 1%.  Safe haven gold also had another upbeat day, climbing 2.2%.  In an email, Marieke Fament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation, called said that ""consolidation is inevitable in crypto's current bear market,” but also saw FTX’s problems and the proposed acquisition as a potential learning experience.  “There's nowhere to hide during crypto winter – and developments such as the acquisition of FTX by Binance underscores the challenges and lack of transparency behind the scenes of some key players –which undermine the reputation of crypto,” Fament said. “Moving forward, the ecosystem is going to learn from these mistakes and hopefully create a stronger sector that puts honesty, transparency and consumer protection at the heart of their businesses.""

Technical Take  Crypto Markets Take a Wild Ride Following Surprise Binance/FTX Deal  By Glenn Williams Jr  Binance’s mega-deal to buy rival FTX has raised lots of questions among investors, few of them with easy answers. Price fluctuations have been difficult to pinpoint on calm news days, and the blockbuster deal announced Tuesday threatens to roil markets well beyond the volatility of the last few hours.  In a surprising turn of events, Binance is fully acquiring FTX. The two entities entered a non-bonding letter of intent (LOI), to help FTX weather an apparent liquidity crunch.  Because the LOI is non-binding, Binance can withdraw from the deal at any time. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume will be conducting due diligence on FTX over the coming days.  Crypto prices sank, soared and then sank again.

42415050,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWHUc,1667949131,"Yuga Labs, Circle, SkyBridge Among Investments FTX Ventures Made Prior to Liquidity Issues","The venture capital arm of cryptocurrency exchange FTX has been a prominent investor in some of the biggest names in the crypto ecosystem. With Binance's possible acquisition of its rival FTX, questions swirl around what will happen to these investments.  Among the biggest names in which FTX Ventures invested were Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs, USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, layer 1 blockchains Near Protocol and Sui, crypto lender BlockFi and two different funding rounds for the Aptos blockchain, according to crypto data analytics firm Cryptorank. The exact number of investments by FTX Ventures are unknown.  FTX has been linked closely with the embattled BlockFi. The U.S. arm of FTX gave the strained lender a $400 million credit line with FTX getting the option to acquire BlockFi for up to $240 million.  SkyBridge stake  In September, FTX Ventures agreed to buy 30% of SkyBridge Capital for an undisclosed amount after the investment firm was dinged by the bear market. SkyBridge – founded by Anthony Scaramucci, a one-time aide to former U.S. President Donald Trump – planned to use some of the infusion to buy $40 million in cryptocurrencies to put on its balance sheet as a long-term investment.  Tiger Global, SoftBank headaches  The FTX turmoil could also cause more headaches for investors in the cryptocurrency exchange, particularly the already weakened Tiger Global Management and SoftBank Vision Fund.  Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global hedge fund participated in a $420 million round for FTX in October 2021 at a $25 billion valuation and returned for a January funding round at a $32 billion valuation. Amid those investments, Tiger Global entered the year with too much exposure to both equities and China and worked to rebalance its portfolio. The fund still lost 5.4% last month despite in increase in global equity markets, according to Bloomberg.  SoftBank Vision Fund was another returning investor for FTX’s January 2022 funding round. The Japanese conglomerate is one of the world’s largest backers of technology companies through its investment arm, which includes two Vision Fund vehicles and a Latin America fund. However, the investing arm reported $50 billion in losses during the first six months of this year, largely attributed to bear market losses for publicly-traded investments such as Uber and Opendoor.

This has translated into a mix of inflows and outflows into various digital assets, alternating with each passing week even through the bear market. However, current net flow records show that these large investors are beginning to find their chosen position in the market and it is in the camp of the bears. Bitcoin Sees Outflows Bitcoin had been recording minor inflows in the last month-and-a-half which had been good for the digital asset despite not having much of an impact. This has now changed completely as the figures for last week show $13 million in outflows for the digital asset. This bearish sentiment has been more prominent in the short bitcoin that is now on to its third consecutive week of outflows. The $7.1 million brought the total outflows from short bitcoin to $28 million. These outflows show that large investors are pulling out of the market more instead of taking one side over the other, an overall bearish development. Related Reading: Can Solana (SOL) Sustain Its Google-Triggered Price Rally? The digital asset outflows for the week came out to $15.6 million during this time. Furthermore, it was a bearish start to the month of November with $19 million in outflows already. So even though November has been a historically bullish month for the crypto market, investors do not seem to believe this will be the case this time around. Crypto market suffers general bearishness | Source: Crypto Total Market cap on TradingView.com Reason For Bearishness While it has not had as much of a profound effect as expected, the result of the FOMC meeting has been largely influencing the behaviors of investors in the market. The fourth consecutive interest rate hike by 75 bps showed that the Fed was nowhere close to backing down on its hawkish stance against the high inflation rates. As expected, such high interest rates will have an effect on markets such as crypto, greatly limiting their ability to grow, especially during a bear market. It is also no surprise that the United States led the outflows for the week since the Fed decision has the most impact in the region. Related Reading: What Happens To Dogecoin If Twitter Fails To Implement Crypto Plans? Nevertheless, there were still some inflows from across the point. Both Switzerland and Germany saw inflows of $6.8 million and $4 million respectively, most of which were focused on altcoins. Ethereum finally put an end to its outflow trends with inflows of $2.7 million. XRP followed this trend with inflows of $1.1 million, marking its third week of inflows. Since that time, the crypto market has taken a turn so it is expected that there might be a change in institutional investor sentiment in the coming week. However, the general crypto market sentiment continues to skew largely into the negative, which means no significant inflows should be expected.

42415051,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWHZv,1667947740,FTX’s Push for US Crypto Clearing Left In Suspense by Binance Deal,"The crypto industry has eagerly watched for a decision from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to allow FTX to directly clear its customers’ derivatives transactions, but that market-shaping application has entered murky territory.  The potential Binance deal to acquire FTX leaves the ownership of the applicant – FTX US Derivatives – in flux, raising questions about whether and how the effort will proceed. The company’s application, if approved by the regulator, could upend the way margin-backed derivatives trades are cleared, cutting out the long tradition of clearing houses in those markets.  FTX’s derivatives affiliate that applied with the CFTC is part of the U.S. arm of the global crypto exchange. Though the global FTX has struck a deal to be absorbed by rival Binance, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has indicated that the U.S. arm is “not currently impacted by this” because it’s a separate company.  For the CFTC’s part, Steven Adamske, an agency spokesman, said he “cannot comment until the applicant provides clarity on the application.”  A Washington, D.C.-based official for FTX couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  “Its proposal with the CFTC to offer central clearing of margin products to retail customers will be seen in a different light,” said Ian Katz, a managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, in a Tuesday research note. Bankman-Fried has been on a Washington charm offensive in recent weeks, Katz wrote, but this development will mean the company’s “advocacy role in D.C. will, at the very least, be diminished.”  CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said last month that the application could potentially represent “another phase in the evolution of market structure, innovation and disruption.” And Zach Dexter, the CEO of FTX US Derivatives – a company previously known as LedgerX, which is already regulated by the CFTC – said recently that the application process has been going well, and the agency has been collecting a lot of highly detailed information.  Still, the idea has encountered plenty of enemies. Among them are the established derivatives industry, where major firms owe their livelihood to acting as go-betweens, and consumer-protection advocates who have criticized its potential risks from around-the-clock market manipulation and volatility as positions are automatically liquidated.  “Today’s reported fire sale by FTX of its non-U.S. operations to Binance so that it has the liquidity to meet its current obligations proves that FTX does not have the financial wherewithal represented in its application,” said Dennis Kelleher, the CEO of Washington-based Better Markets, in a statement. The company should pull the application, he argued, or the CFTC should immediately deny it.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH | BNB,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/08/ftxs-push-for-us-crypto-clearing-left-in-suspense-by-binance-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe6a32a5be3ab32d7b475a0d392f5d01cea78d07-4352x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Dow led the major U.S. equity averages higher, rising by 1%. While equities continued their recent recovery, cryptocurrencies endured selling pressure amid a liquidity crunch at Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange. As a result, names like Coinbase ( NASDAQ: COIN ), Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) and Marathon Digital ( MARA ) finished lower. Among individual stocks, Him & Hers Health ( HIMS ) surged on earnings news, expanding its value by about a fifth. Quarterly results also prompted buying in Sanmina ( SANM ), which reached a new 52-week high. On the other side of the ledger, R1 RCM ( RCM ) lost about half its value after posting a surprise loss for its latest quarter. The company also announced a CEO change. Sector In Focus Worries about a high-profile pillar of the cryptocurrency market sent the entire asset class lower. This, in turn, prompted selling in stocks related to the sector. The crypto drop started amid liquidity issues at Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research hedge fund, which spilled over to the billionaire's FTX crypto exchange. Late in the day, news broke that Binance had agreed to buy FTX in the face of solvency concerns . Amid the crisis, the FTX Token ( FTT-USD ) dropped 76%. This led to an overall decline in crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) retreated more than 11%, while Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) dropped nearly 17%. In this environment, crypto-related stocks pushed lower. Coinbase ( COIN ) fell 11%, Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) declined 7% and Marathon Digital ( MARA ) retreated 5%. Standout Gainer Him & Hers Health ( HIMS ) surged almost 20% following the release of quarterly results. This came as the company also offered a strong forecast. The telehealth firm exceeded projections on earnings and revenue, with a top-line figure that jumped 95% from last year. The firm said its adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed to $6.1M, compared to a loss of $9.8M in the same period last year. Looking ahead, the company predicted revenue for Q4 of $159M to $162M, beating analysts' estimate of $134M. Meanwhile, HIMS also projected an adjusted EBITDA profit of up to $2M. HIMS finished Tuesday's trading at $5.53, an advance of 91 cents on the day. This took the stock to its highest level in a month. Shares remain well off a 2022 closing high of $7.22. Standout Decliner A disappointing earnings report and a major leadership change sparked selling in R1 RCM ( RCM ). Shares of the provider of revenue cycle management services to the healthcare sector cratered by almost 50%. The company reported a GAAP loss of $0.07 per share, surprising analysts, who had projected a profit. Revenue climbed 31% from last year but the growth rate was slower than experts had predicted. RCM also revealed that Joseph Flanagan will step down as CEO, effective January 1. Lee Rivas will succeed Flanagan as chief executive. The news sent the stock tumbling $7.34 to close at $7.41. During the session, RCM reached an intraday 52-week low of $6.74. For 2022 as a whole, shares have dropped 71%. Notable New High Sanmina ( SANM ) received a boost from its latest earnings report, driving the stock to a new 52-week high. Shares climbed nearly 11% on the news. The company reported a Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.50, topping projections by $0.17. Revenue also exceeded estimates , climbing 34% to $2.2B. Thanks to the earnings report, SANM soared to an intraday 52-week high of $66.53. The stock moderated a bit from there but still finished at $65.45, climbing $6.48 on the day.

3971034,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=509908,1667947331,Crypto Market Tanks As Binance And FTX Battle Continues,"Recently, the crypto space has been facing an unexpected display between two prominent crypto exchanges, Binance and FTX. The CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), announced that the exchange would liquidate all FTT tokens in its holdings. Naturally, this news created a negative impact on FTX and its token. Further, the entire crypto market has been thrown into the red as most crypto assets are losing value. The crash in the price of FTT is also influenced by a massive depreciating trend on several other tokens. Related Reading: Users Flee FTX? Exchange Sees 47% Drop In On-Chain Balance FTX Token (FTT) Falls Among Worse Performers The announcement of Binance CEO CZ has dramatically declined FTX and its token, FTT. Nobody understands the reasons behind CZ’s decision regarding FTT. But some speculate a possible vital issue between the executive and the SBF-owned exchange. FTT has plummeted by a double-digit percentage following Binance’s announcement. As of yesterday, Monday, November 7, FTT dropped to around $22. At the time of the writing, the token is trading below $17.31, indicating a drop of 23.33% over the past 24 hours. Also, its market cap is currently over $2.30 billion. The situation has been getting worse for FTX. The exchange suffered a devastating decline in its ETH reserve. Hence, users were having difficulties completing some transactions on the platform. On his part, the CEO of FTX exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), has been putting some effort into remedying the situation. He has involved the firm’s subsidiaries, SBF-owned companies, and other exchanges for assistance through funds transfers to FTX. Also, the CEO assured customers that FTX’s performance was acceptable. But today’s price drop exceeded 20% of the token’s value from the previous day. Broader Crypto Market Losses Massively The broader crypto market has taken the trend from FTT. As a result, the cumulative market cap had dipped from its coveted position above $1 trillion after losing over $70 billion in a single day. At the press time, the value sits at $978.74 billion, showing a decline of 4.76% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum is now below $1,500 as it dropped over in its value. Also, Polkadot, Cardano, Tron, OKB, and MATIC plummeted by 5%. The list of losers includes Dogecoin, Solana, Ripple, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, and others. Related Reading: The Binance Vs.

But the story has suddenly turned in the early trading hours of today. BTC lost about $1,000 from its value through the bears’ activities. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $18,250, showing a drop of about 9.37% over the past 24 hours. Its market cap is at $378.01 billion, and its dominance over the altcoins sits at 38.60%.

This comes amid liquidity concerns in FTX, a large crypto exchange. Despite the unpredictable nature of this event, technical analysis has been pointing us down for quite some time. Ultimately, I believe Bitcoin should test the Delta Price, which sits around $13,600. Thesis Summary Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has just sold off, going as far as breaking below the June low. This can be attributed partly to the recent debacle between FTX (FTT-USD), Alameda and Binance (BNB-USD). However, this can also be explained by technical analysis, and I was personally expecting a sell-off like this. Another Liquidation Event The recent sell-off has coincided with increased concerns that FTX could become insolvent, which became an issue when Binance CEO Zhao announced that Binance would be liquidating its position in FTT, the native FTX token. Binance holds a large amount of FTT because it used to have an equity stake in FTX. When the two parted ways, a large part of the payment it received was in FTT. This announcement led to millions in outflows of the FTX exchange and also a sharp sell-off in FTT. To make matters worse, it was also revealed by CoinDesk that Alameda Research, a trading company owned by the FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, held most of its assets in FTT tokens. This puts Alameda, a company with $14.6 billion in assets, in a precarious situation, meaning it is also at risk of liquidation. Finally, though, it seems that as the CEO of FTX put it himself, “things have come full circle” as Binance, one of the first investors in FTX, has made an offer to acquire the exchange. While this announcement gave Bitcoin some support, the cryptocurrency continues to sell off with the broader crypto market. BTC, BNB and FTT (TradingView) The chart above shows the recent moves in Bitcoin, FTT and Binance Coin. We can see that all these coins spiked early in the day, which coincided with the takeover announcement. Binance Coin reacted particularly well, rallying over 20%. However, the sell-off has now continued, with Bitcoin breaking its June low and FTT losing over 80% of its value. This, on a day when stocks are actually up on the day. The Bitcoin Chart This recent liquidity crunch could have been predicted, at least once Zhao made it clear he was liquidating his FTT. However, few could have predicted that this would have such a large impact on the crypto market. But for those that have been following my work, you know I have been expecting Bitcoin to sell off even further, and I believe we would have got there with or without a catalyst like this one. The two main drivers of my analysis are Elliott Wave Theory and a study of previous bitcoin cycles: Bitcoin EWT analysis (Author's work) Above, you can see my current EW analysis on Bitcoin, which I usually only share with subscribers. Since the November high in Bitcoin, we have been developing a five wave structure to complete what I see as a C wave in a large-degree wave 4. The June low was the bottom of wave III, and though I had my doubts initially, this became clear as we saw Bitcoin bounce off this support in a very corrective manner. We rallied towards $24K in a wave V and then created a 1-2 setup to the downside, which is now filling out. In fact, this recent sell-off would be a wave iii inside of 3, which makes a lot of sense, given its aggressive nature. Where does Bitcoin bottom? Calling an exact bottom is hard to do, but my guess is that we will at the very least, get near the region of the Delta Price, which I’ve talked about before. This on-chain metric is obtained by taking the realized price and subtracting the average price . I won’t explain it in full again here. What’s important to know is that Bitcoin’s Delta Price has traditionally been briefly breached during the final capitulation events of previous bear markets and that the current Delta Price currently sits at around $13,600. Takeaway Trading Bitcoin is not for the faint of heart, but with the right approach, it can be done successfully. First off, like with any investment, one needs to understand its fundamentals and why Bitcoin is here to stay, something I did in my last article, Why Bitcoin is Better Than Gold . Secondly, understanding Bitcoin's history can help us understand where the important resistance and support levels are.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB | FTT,BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4555005-bitcoin-how-low-will-it-go?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3970382.jpeg
42415032,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWGD1,1667945384,"Bitcoin Miner Marathon Digital Misses Q3 Revenue Estimates, Lowers Hashrate Outlook for 2022","Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest bitcoin miners in the world, reported third quarter revenue of $12.7 million, shy of the average analyst estimate of $23.4 million, according to FactSet data.  Net loss per share was 72 cents for the quarter, worse than the average estimate of 15 cents as per FactSet.  Shares fell 5.1% in the regular session Tuesday alongside a steep drop in bitcoin (BTC) to about $18,000. The stock's lower by another 2.2% in after hours action.  In addition to the miss, Marathon trimmed its year-end 2022 computing power, or hashrate expectations from previous guidance of 11.5 exahash/second (EH/s) to 9 EH/s. The company, however, reiterated its goal to have 23 EH/s of computing power running mid-2023. Hashrate as of Nov. 1 was 7 EH/s.  CEO Fred Thiel called the quarter a transitionary period as his company exited a site in Hardin, Montana, and began energizing operations in Texas.  The lowering of year-end hashrate guidance isn't totally unexpected as doubts had previously emerged about Marathon’s ability to deliver on that prediction, with Jefferies in a note on Monday saying the company faced downside risks on its growth targets.  The first risk, said Jefferies, is Marathon's expectation of 3.2 EH/s to be plugged into a Compute North facility in Texas. In addition to regulatory delays, there's the issue of Compute North's bankruptcy, and whether Marathon might have to renegotiate terms with the hosting company. The other risk, said the bank, is 12.2 EH/s expected from Applied Blockchain (APLD) facilities in North Dakota and Texas, which are also facing regulatory delays.  Speaking on the earnings call, Thiel said Marathon expects a positive answer soon from Texas regulators regarding Compute North's site. Thiel also said the company is looking for opportunities overseas, specifically South America, the Middle East and parts of Asia.

42420875,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZDZ,1667943721,Crypto Markets Take a Wild Ride Following Surprise Binance/FTX Deal,"Questions.  Binance’s mega-deal to buy rival FTX has raised lots of questions among investors, few of them with easy answers. Price fluctuations have been difficult to pinpoint on calm news days, and the blockbuster deal announced Tuesday threatens to roil markets well beyond the volatility of the last few hours.  First of all, here’s what we know with certainty.  In a surprising turn of events, Binance is fully acquiring FTX. The two entities entered a non-binding letter of intent (LOI), to help FTX weather an apparent liquidity crunch.  Because the LOI is non-binding, Binance can withdraw from the deal at any time. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume will be conducting due diligence on FTX over the coming days.  Crypto prices sank, soared and then sank again.  Now for the most pressing questions, although the short list below is hardly exhaustive.  1. Did an exchange the size of FTX really have to sell?  As recently as Monday, CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was assuring his 860,000 Twitter followers that “all assets” were fine. Hours earlier, Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison was offering to buy Binance’s supply of FTX’s FTT tokens. The reversal of fortunes was mind numbingly fast. But balance sheet problems – an overabundance of FTT – with Alameda Research, the trading firm that is part of Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, exposed FTX to liquidity problems that prompted the sudden sale. Too much of FTX’s net equity consisted of its own FTT token, raising concerns among some crypto observers as CoinDesk reported.  2. What happens to crypto asset prices?  FTX’s problems stem from the all-too-familiar cocktail of leverage and liquidity, particularly when there’s too much of one and not enough of the other.  FTX’s “Earn” program offered users the ability to earn as much as 8% on deposits of bitcoin, ether and other assets.  The spread between “earn” and prevailing risk-free rates imply the use of leverage and risk to create surplus yield. But this combination can become increasingly problematic if an entity must meet increases in user withdrawals. That appears to be exactly what FTX was facing.  BTC balances on FTX have declined from 20,000 on Nov. 2 to a single bitcoin today.  Should crypto investors be wary or hopeful? The individual or entity who speaks with the most confidence on price direction likely deserves the highest level of skepticism.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) prices have been whipsawing on Tuesday – crypto markets at their best or worst, depending on your perspective. Following the announcement, BTC and ETH rose 4.33% and 5.7% respectively, only to decline 5% and 6.43% in the following hour. Recently, BTC and ETH were down 8% and 12%  Both moves came with higher-than-average volume implying that bulls and bears have conviction. Technical indicators are changing by the hour, so prudent investors will wait patiently without reading too much into any of them.  But these investors will also be closely tracking BTC and ETH to see if their prices fall below $18,100 and $1,300 respectively, thresholds when trading volume for those assets has historically declined.  3. Will Alameda be forced to liquidate assets?  While Binance has acquired FTX, it appears that Alameda will remain a separate entity. Alameda’s apparent insolvency issues may force the company to liquidate part of its holdings, placing downward pressure on specific assets that will then ripple through the wider crypto market. BTC and ETH could potentially be impacted, but other assets such as SOL, and SRM could reportedly come under pressure as well.  4. Will Binance follow through?  Maybe this should have been the first question. Firms have been known to back out of deals. Elon Musk most recently tried to walk away from his purchase of the social media platform Twitter before he said yes again, albeit under legal duress. His massive job cuts and questionable early steps as Twitter owner suggest he might be regretting his commitment and the debt with which he must now wrestle.  Certainly Binance is under no obligation to consummate the acquisition if it finds issues with FTX that make senior management uncomfortable. The due diligence in the coming weeks will reveal more.  5. Will regulators allow the deal to close?  Questions have already arisen, regarding whether the deal would violate anti-trust laws. Regulators worldwide have the power to block major mergers if they fear they would limit market choice, and also have strict laws against anti-competitive behavior. Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, while FTX is within the top five, according to data site CoinGecko.

42415038,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWGYF,1667943287,US Midterm Elections to Set the Tone for Bitcoin Miners' Future,"Bitcoin miners across the U.S. are looking to Tuesday's midterm elections for a signal on the future of environmental policy, which may impact their expansions and operations.  Since President Joe Biden took office almost two years ago, bitcoin mining has garnered attention in the U.S. political landscape, as miners moved their operations en masse from China and new investments were made domestically.  The midterms are crucial for policy because they could “set the tone for how the industry is perceived at both the state and federal level as they weigh approaches to the industry,” said Kyle Schneps, director of public policy at digital asset mining and staking infrastructure firm Foundry, which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company Digital Currency Group.  As more miners expanded in the U.S., Democratic lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have questioned the industry’s large energy usage and impact on electricity grids throughout the country. Bitcoin mining consumes great amounts of electricity to secure the blockchain’s network as specialized computers try to guess the answer to an equation, which environmentalists think is working against U.S. and global climate goals.  However, the Republicans have been a supporter of bitcoin mining and crypto in general. “Although the mining industry has tried to promote a bipartisan approach to lobbying, support has mostly come from right wing or center politicians,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies. “Republicans are less likely to push the more stringent direction proposed in White House paper released in early September,” Vera said.  The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy called for standards to reduce the industry’s impact on the environment in a September report.  Crypto broadly and mining in particular “has managed to stay largely bipartisan at the federal level,” said Foundry's Schneps. The biggest difference is not along party lines but adoption, meaning “younger and more diverse political leaders are embracing the industry,” he said.  But John Olsen, New York policy lead at industry lobbying group Blockchain Association, thinks the issue “has too often developed into the hyper partisanship we’ve all experienced in other areas of political life.”  Amid this debate, the key states investors will be watching in the upcoming midterm elections are New York and Texas.  In July, New York state passed legislation, sponsored by Democrat Anna Kelles, that prohibits the development of new mining facilities using carbon-based energy for two years as authorities study its impact on the environment on local communities and the environment.  The legislation, which has not yet been signed into law, has nevertheless pushed companies and jobs out of the state, Schneps said.  “Upcoming elections could show a public rebuke of this type of anti-jobs policy during a time of economic hardship,” Schneps said. The economic impact of the moratorium was a sticking point for Democrats Clyde Vanel and Jeremy Cooney, who opposed the bill.  Meanwhile in Texas, arguably the world’s latest bitcoin mining hub with 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of mining projects, politicians are working with industry group Texas Blockchain Council (TBC) to introduce legislation “to support the continued development of the bitcoin mining industry in Texas,” said Steve Kinnard, the council’s director of Bitcoin Mining Analytics.  The TBC has identified eight candidates from both parties who “have demonstrated support for the blockchain, bitcoin and digital asset industry through in-depth technical knowledge of the space or willingness to engage on key policy issues,” Kinnard said. The list includes Governor Gregg Abbott.  The council has endorsed some of these candidates, Kinnard said, adding that the midterms are important because they will “set priorities and key stakeholders for the upcoming legislative session.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/08/us-midterm-elections-to-set-the-tone-for-bitcoin-miners-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56a673560565745abe767d1c789130bdb283838b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $18,200, with a 13% loss in the last 24 hours and an 11% loss in the previous seven days. Other cryptocurrencies in the crypto top 10 by market cap are following a similar trajectory, with Dogecoin (DOGE) showing the highest losses over this period. Bitcoin Crashes Amid FTX “Lehman Moment” The crypto market is reacting to the events related to FTX and Binance. Dubbed the “Crypto Exchange Wars,” Binance emerged victorious when FTX confirmed a deal to surrender its assets, except for FTX.US. The Sam Bankman-Fried led platform could not redeem its users’ new request for withdrawal. According to reports, the venue was missing as much as $6 billion and was forced to halt its operations. Amid this uncertainty, the crypto market and Bitcoin faced immense selling pressure. Rumors have surfaced about Alameda, FTX’s trading arm, possibly liquidating its BTC to cover some of its losses, but the team behind the platform has no official statement. There is speculation about the current state of the market, which has been reflected in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In addition, the U.S. Midterm election is adding more uncertainty into the mix. NewsBTC reported yesterday that a Republican win could be bullish for crypto and digital assets. This party has been more prone to support the industry and crypto projects when compared to the Democratic party. BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes published his perception of the future of Bitcoin and the crypto industry. Hayes seems bearish as he announced the acquisition of puts (sell) option contracts for Bitcoin. These contracts have a strike price of $15,000, meaning they can exercise if BTC’s price records another fresh low and crashes into $15,000 to $14,000 or much lower. The BitMEX Founder wrote: FTX = Lehman That wasn’t the bottom. $SPX hit 666 in March of 2009. Therefore $17,500 BTC is at risk. How ‘bout dem puts now… — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 8, 2022 However, the crypto market has withstood massive stress and several capitulation events. A Lehman moment in the industry might signal a bottom, not more downside. In addition, Hayes has publicly stated its bullish stand on the crypto market.

42415055,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWHpq,1667942090,FTX Token Falls 80% Despite Binance Bailout as Alameda Contagion Spreads to Bitcoin,"The FTX's exchange token, FTT, went into free fall Tuesday even after the company got a lifeline from larger rival Binance, as fears mounted over the crypto trading firm Alameda Research's financial woes, fueling what appeared to be contagion driving down prices broadly across digital asset markets.  Both Alameda and FTX are part of the billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's now-fast-dwindling crypto empire.  FTT fell to $4, down more than 80% over the past 24 hours. SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, fell to $21 from $30. At press time, FTT trades at $5.56 and SOL changes hands at $23.90.  Broader crypto markets, which mounted a short-lived recovery after the bailout announcement, quickly lost steam and turned sharply lower. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks 162 cryptocurrencies, fell 8% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, tumbled to $17,114 on the Bitstamp exchange, a 23-month low. The BTC price recovered somewhat to $18,400 but was still down 12% on the day.  Among the 500 digital assets in CoinDesk's Digital Asset Classification Standard, some 95% were lower over the past 24 hours.  Alameda balance sheet  CoinDesk reported last week that Alameda Research's balance sheet is loaded with highly illiquid FTT tokens, and is also a big holder of SOL tokens. Some of these tokens were put up as collateral to take out loans. As of June 30, Alameda held $3.66 billion of “unlocked FTT” tokens and $2.16 billion of FTT as collateral, while its SOL holdings totaled to about $1.2 billion, according to the documents reviewed by CoinDesk.  Investors fear that the giant Binance exchange's bailout of FTX might not extend to Alameda, which is a significant market maker and lender in the crypto space, and that Alameda might face margin calls and be forced to fire-sell assets from its balance sheet to raise liquidity.  ""There’s a lot more pain to go around as Alameda will be heavily affected by the crash of FTT,"" Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at Storm Partners, told CoinDesk. ""A multi-billion dollar loss will hurt.”  Alameda's rout could spell trouble for the broader crypto industry, including lenders exposed to the trading firm and to crypto ecosystems which Alameda and FTX have been heavily invested.  ""Assuming Alameda doesn’t survive, there could be a good deal of pain, particularly for the Solana ecosystem – in which they were deeply involved – and any institutions that had lent to Alameda,"" Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  To illustrate just how spectacular the FTT token price's collapse has been, take a look at the following chart of the 10 biggest laggards over the past 24 hours in the ""Transparent CeFi Currency"" industry group, within the CoinDesk DACS.

With Bitcoin recording over 13% loss on the day, altcoins took effect and plummeted heavily. Similarly, Chainlink lost its gains following the market trend. But, the token established itself as one of the top gainers on the same day and marked $9.34. Due to turns of events, LINK currently fluctuates a loss of 19.80% and trades at $7.36. This currency made its investors happy with a week-over-week increase of over 3%. Several key metrics favor LINK maintaining its run in the coming weeks. The token’s underlying blockchain has also bagged several partnerships during the week. Furthermore, LINK crossed a 3-month high today despite the market volatility. As such, the token looks poised to face a bullish rally head-on. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Dump Even Lower? This On-Chain Metric May Suggest It Massive LINK Wallet Activities Pushed Token’s Price Upward The LINK price, as reported by Santiment in a recent tweet, reached a high of $9.20. The last time it reached this level was in the middle of August. The data agency’s team of specialists has settled on two possible explanations for the LINK price increase above $9. They assume that the intense activity of LINK wallets throughout last month was the primary driver of the price surge. Furthermore, investors have been “aggressively” longing LINK. This helped increase the altcoin’s price, causing a surge in funding rates. And on November 3rd, Chainlink announced yet another significant partnership. This time with Seedify Fund, a premier incubator and launchpad for DLT games, NFTs, and metaverses. Chainlink’s goal in building this partnership is to facilitate the growth of the GameFi and NFT industries through its oracle services. Meanwhile, the coin’s supporters eagerly await the start of staking on Chainlink. As of the end of October, 459 wallets had more than 100,000 LINK, even though the specific date had yet to be disclosed. In fact, this is the highest level since 2017. In addition, Chainlink implemented fourteen integrations across four chains: BNBChain, Arbitrum, Ethereum, and Polygon. There Is Still the Potential for A 25% Correction Since May, LINK has been consolidating its rebound gains inside the confines of an ascending triangle. Ascending triangles are continuation patterns. This means that after a period of consolidation, the price tends to move back in the direction of its previous trend. Before forming its ascending triangle, LINK was on a declining trend. Based on seasoned investor Thomas Bulkowski’s ascending triangles analysis, LINK’s chances of continuing its downturn and reaching its profit goal are 44%. As seen below, the profit goal is calculated by adding the triangle’s maximum height to its breaking point.

According to him, the token has been trading above the same support that helped drive its price to a record high in May 2021. Pentoshi said, “While people are quiet on it now.

FTX Token loses more than half of its value. Crypto winter could really hurt revenues. One of the biggest losers on Tuesday happens to be crypto platform Coinbase ( COIN ). Shares of the company were down more than 10%, falling below $50 a share for the first time in a number of months. The reason for this fall is due to a major problem in the crypto space, one that if not worked out quickly could send Coinbase to new lows in the coming weeks. In recent days, there have been concerns about the health of Alameda Research, which is Sam Bankman-Fried's (""SBF"") investment firm. At the same time, there were worries that cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which SBF heads, was having problems. Fellow firm Binance (BNB-USD) announced that it was selling its holdings of the FTX token (FTT-USD), as it feared what was going on at FTX, which caused the token to start declining. As the chart below shows, the decline was a bit gradual, but things really picked up on Monday night when the token fell below $20. On Tuesday morning, there were issues with FTX's withdrawal process, sending the token even sharply lower. A little after 1PM Eastern, the FTX token fell into the single digits, meaning it had lost more than half of its value in a matter of hours. FTX Token 5-Day (Yahoo! Finance) As the panic spread around FTX, it seemingly took down all of the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) , which was over $21,000 in recent days, fell below $19,000. While rumors that Binance would buy FTX caused a brief relief rally, selling quickly resumed across the board. Shares of Coinbase, which had jumped to more than $58.40 at their day's high, dropped back quickly and were testing $50 again in early afternoon trading. I bring up the idea of Coinbase falling further because it was just last week when the company announced its Q3 results . The company reported a sizable revenue miss, with total revenues down almost 55% over the prior year period. With the entire crypto space falling significantly from its highs, the company reported significant declines in trading volumes and assets as seen below. The company also swung from a $400 million profit in the year ago period to a more than half a billion dollar loss. Coinbase Q3 Key Numbers (Company Shareholder Letter) Management mentioned in the shareholder letter than October trading volumes were down from July levels, so Q4 is already off to a slow start. The company said it was preparing for a potential multi-year down period in this space, and it still had more than $5 billion in cash. However, I'm worried that if this FTX contagion spreads, and perhaps Bitcoin drops to say $15,000 or lower, Coinbase's results will be a lot worse than previously expected. Going into Tuesday, the average price target on the street was more than $81, implying significant upside from current levels. However, that figure was down about $10 since the Q3 report, and well off its more than $500 high after Coinbase started trading publicly. It would not surprise me to see more price targets cut in the coming weeks if we don't see a crypto rebound quickly. In the end, investors in Coinbase should be quite worried with what's going on with FTX currently. As the FTX token has plunged to the single digits, the entire crypto space is dropping quickly. Coinbase already announced a terrible set of results last week, and the stock is only about $10 from a new 52-week low. If this FTX contagion isn't resolved soon, it would not surprise me if Coinbase shares fell to a new low as a crypto winter could be about to set in.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4554963-coinbase-new-lows-possible-on-ftx-contagion?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3968102.jpeg

3967946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=509867,1667940073,What Is The Possibility Of Cardano Touching $0.50 Mark? Let’s Explore,"The crypto market has halted its brief bullish rally, with prices generally dropping; for example, Cardano (ADA) has lost 9% in the last 24 hours. Currently, Cardano is trading at $0.366. In recent weeks there has been an upsurge in most cryptocurrency prices due to the recent rally of bitcoin. However, experts believe the crypto winter is still on but nearing its closing phases. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Supply Reaches All-Time High HODLing Levels The general slump in the big crypto players like bitcoin has hindered ADA’s full potential. Nevertheless, the Proof-of-Stake mechanism remains a standout feature of Cardano. Cardano’s wide range of applications for smart contracts and DApps will likely see more platforms adopting the token. Developmental Plans unveiled However, Cardano’s developmental plans were intensive on November 2, 2022. Input Output HK (IOHK) released vital information on the Daedalus mainnet 5.1.1 release. This information created positive reactions from the crypto community, Daedalus is a cryptocurrency wallet that only supports ADA tokens and is highly secured. In addition, the wallet enables users to stake their tokens and earn rewards. The launch of this wallet has been widely anticipated in the crypto community as it offers users an extra layer of security. However, this development had no significant impact on the pricing. Similar reactions were noted with the Cardano Vasil upgrade, as it did not significantly impact the token’s price. Will Cardano Reach The $0.50 Mark? Despite the recent brief rally in the cryptocurrency market, it will be difficult for Cardano to reach the $50 mark. The project reached its all-time high of $3.10 0n September 7, 2021, and is yet to surpass the price level. From the Donchain channel, the candles are seen in the upper channel signaling a potential price rise in the short term. The 0.5 level is more realistic for ADA to attain. The MacD also observed above its signal line shows bullish sentiments. It must be noted, however, that the two lines are almost in contact. This indicates that the bull run might likely be short-lived with no significant price corrections. Cardano will likely surpass the critical resistance level of $ 0.58. If such an event occurs, it will likely trigger a bullish run for the cryptocurrency token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Can Cyclical Tools Predict The Next Bubble? | BTCUSD November 7, 2022 However, if Cardano falls below the critical support level of $0.33, the coin might likely go into freefall as market forces act on the price. Although ADA has shown positive price movement in recent weeks, the $50 level is some way off for the token, with critical Support and resistance levels still untested. Cardano might likely fluctuate from the price movement between the $0.4 and 0.5 price level this month. While ADA may not get up to the $50 mark, it is still a cryptocurrency worth investing in for the future.

42415036,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWGIK,1667939432,Alameda Thanked for ‘Prompt Response’ in Transferring $37M of BitDAO Tokens,"Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, the trading firm at the heart of this week’s crypto-industry shakeup, is reportedly making good on at least one promise – adhering to an agreement not to sell tokens associated with the BitDAO blockchain project for at least three years.  BitDAO, one of the largest decentralized autonomous organizations, confirmed Tuesday in a tweet that some 100 million BIT tokens had been transferred into “the original BIP-4 swap wallet” on the Ethereum blockchain, labeled by the website Etherscan as “Alameda Research 25.”  Alameda holds 100 million BIT tokens acquired in November of last year by swapping 3.36 million FTT tokens. The token swap deal required each party to hold tokens for at least three years.  The trading firm has come under scrutiny since CoinDesk reported last week that Alameda’s balance sheet contained billions of dollars of FTT – a cryptocurrency associated with the FTX trading venue, another part of Bankman-Fried’s business empire. The concern was that there were so few players in the FTT market that, if prices for the token started to fall, Alameda likely would get stuck with the holdings.  The giant crypto exchange Binance and FTX inked a landmark deal to combine on Tuesday, but it’s not clear whether the bailout would extend to Alameda, or if the FTT tokens would have any remaining value. Like most exchange tokens, FTT does not confer any ownership rights in the affiliated venue – typically just fee discounts.  Raising liquidity?  Crypto analysts have speculated that Alameda might need to raise liquidity if the price of FTT continues to slide, and that it might seek to sell off crypto holdings that retain value, such as Solana’s SOL tokens.  Coinciding with the recent drama surrounding FTX and Alameda, BitDAO’s native token BIT plunged 20%. BitDAO asked Alameda to prove the firm continues to hold 100 million BIT tokens and even issued a veiled threat to perhaps sell some 3.36 million FTT tokens if Alameda didn’t clarify its intent in 24 hours.  According to data on Etherscan, five transactions from Alamada Research were made on Tuesday. The largest transaction involved 92 million BIT, worth around $34 million, an account on the FTX exchange.  “For community confidence, we recommend that the swapped $BIT and $FTT remain held in our respective on-chain addresses until the end of the no-sale commitment period,” BitDAO tweeted following Alemeda’s swift response.  At press time, the BIT price was still down by 16.9% to 34 cents in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. FTT was down 80.6% to about $4.20.",NEUTRAL,FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | FTT,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/08/alameda-thanked-for-prompt-response-in-transferring-37m-of-bitdao-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70c52367647e9e9405719d29d78dd7857d609e3d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The main battleground for that war was FTT, the exchange token of Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange. FTT support has broken. As a result, there is a letter of intent to buy what remains of FTX by Binance. While the future of FTX (and the accounts on the platform) appears to be up to Binance, the rest of the crypto market is selling off. What had been a generally quiet few weeks in the cryptocurrency market from a pricing standpoint has become incredibly volatile over the last couple of days. And there has been no shortage of intrigue behind the scenes. Up until late Tuesday morning, there was seemingly a war going on between two crypto heavyweights. While that war appears to be closer to a conclusion, there is still quite a bit up in the air and there has been quite a bit of damage inflicted elsewhere in the crypto market as a result of what just transpired over the last 24 to 48 hours. It apparently ends with centralized finance exchange Binance ( BNB-USD ) buying centralized exchange competitor FTX. Through a telegraphed liquidation of about $600 million in FTX Token ( FTT-USD ), Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao (also known as ""CZ"") put a tremendous amount of financial pressure on Sam Bankman-Fried (also known as ""SBF"") of both Alameda Research and FTX. The move came after what was reportedly a leak of Alameda Research's balance sheet just a few days ago and a few weeks after SBF proposed a crypto regulation framework that was widely criticized by influential crypto industry voices. As it turned out, when FTX was in trouble, it was none other than Binance waiting with the remedy. In this article we'll explore the FTT token and why it was significant piece to what CZ just pulled off. We'll look at some of the on-chain data that showed trouble was brewing at FTX. And we'll do our best to speculate what this could all mean for FTT and the broader crypto community. FTT Token FTT is the native token of the FTX crypto exchange, founded by SBF. Like other exchange tokens that I've covered in the past, FTT is a utility token that is designed for usage within the exchange ecosystem that it represents; in this case, as a reward/utility token for users of FTX. 69% of the FTX token was initially distributed to investors with the remaining 31% left for the platform and founders: FTT Token Allocation (Messari) A glance at the current token distribution through E therscan shows 99% of FTT tokens are held by the top 100 addresses. Even more telling, 93% of FTT is held by just 10 addresses: FTT Token Distribution (Etherscan) By any realistic stretch of the imagination, FTT is a highly centralized token and centralized tokens are generally highly illiquid. How We Got Here While Alameda Research and FTX are separate entities, concerns have been raised over the last week because Alameda's leaked balance sheet showed a robust $14.6 billion in assets, nearly $6 billion of which was a combination of locked and unlocked FTT tokens. Alameda's leak also showed a little over $1.1 billion in SOL - the majority of which was categorized as ""locked."" Additionally, the leak showed $8 billion in liabilities on Alameda's sheet. Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison later claimed total assets on the leaked balance sheet were underrepresented by about $10 billion. There are problems here optically speaking because so much of Alameda's net equity is dependent on a token that was created and distributed by Alameda's founder's other business. Any loans that have been collateralized by Alameda or FTX with FTT token theoretically lose their backing and a larger liquidity event becomes more likely if FTT's price gets hit in a meaningful way. How Binance Enters the Picture Binance was an original investor in FTX and received a large portion of FTT tokens after getting an exit from the FTX equity position. According to CZ, Binance received $2.1 billion from the FTX equity exit that was spread out among Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ) and FTT token though the percentages of each asset were not provided. Given what was witnessed on-chain on Sunday, it is believed that the Binance FTT position was somewhere in the ballpark of $585 million and CZ seemed to confirm when Whale Alert pointed out an enormous FTT deposit to Binance exchange: FTT position (Twitter/CZ) It should be noted that CZ said the $585 million FTT position brought onto Binance is apparently ""part of"" what Binance's full FTT position is; though only Binance knows how much FTT is really under Binance's control at this point. But given a fully diluted market cap in the $8 billion range at the time of CZ's tweet, Binance still maintained a large ability to move the FTT market. There was quite a bit of speculation online that CZ's motivation in liquidating FTT, and by extension exacerbating a potential problem for Alameda Research, was in response to SBF's recent regulatory proposal for the crypto industry. That speculation seemed to have been corroborated by CZ himself on Twitter late Sunday : Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA. We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards. It's important to note that many influential voices in the crypto industry pushed back on SBF's original proposal. The criticism was loud enough that SBF openly reflected on the criticism and dialed back some of his recommendations. FTT Breaks And Binance Steps In Shortly following CZ's initial tweet telegraphing Binance's FTT intentions, Caroline Ellison put out a tweet to CZ insinuating Alameda would buy every FTT token Binance was willing to sell for $22. While there was a fight put up to defend $22 over the weekend and into Monday, after some short lived pops and fades FTT broke support early Tuesday morning and the token fell all the way down to $15 in a matter of a few hours. It didn't take long for reports of slow withdrawals to spread and by 11 am, Binance agreed to bail out FTX. CZ via Twitter: This afternoon, FTX asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire FTX.com and help cover the liquidity crunch. We will be conducting a full DD in the coming days. The response to the deal was a large rally across the crypto space though that rally has been very short-lived: FTT Daily (TradingView) As I told BCR subscribers on Monday morning , there wasn't much stopping FTT from falling down to $11 if/when $22 broke as $22 had been support for two years and there was very little price discovery between $11 and $22. Though I was right in thinking the decline to $11 would be swift, even support at $11 has proven to be weak and as of article submission FTT is now under $4. What are the scenarios? The biggest thing that I think all players in the crypto casino need to consider is that Binance can still back out of this deal. Given that the crypto market rally immediately following the news of the Binance letter of intent has been entirely sold off even while equities rally and the dollar declines, it appears as though the crypto market isn't convinced this deal will actually go through. For FTX users, the concern becomes trying to anticipate how much damage could be done to FTX if the exchange's utility token collapse continues. Furthermore, how valuable is FTT if FTX continues to see capital outflow from the exchange? FTX ERC20 Balance (Dune Analytics/21Shares) According to 21Shares , on-chain data shows FTX's ERC20 token balance is down from $2.8 billion on November 1st to $1.7 billion Tuesday morning. That's a large outflow and certainly gives some credence to the idea that FTX is dealing with liquidity problems. The issue for FTT holders is the token is a platform utility token. Without assets on the platform, the token loses purpose. It's easy to find messaging parallels from previous crypto liquidation events. Caroline Ellison's $22 bid harkens back to Do Kwon's now infamous ""steady lads"" tweet shortly before Terra Luna ( LUNC-USD ) blew up. Celsius ( CEL-USD ) CEO Alex Mashinsky was still highly active doing interviews and sharing links with claims the company had the reserves necessary to meet obligations right before withdrawals were halted. None of this means FTT will continue to collapse, but I would not be jumping into FTT either from the long side or the short side because it's too risky in my view. We've already seen what can happen when a centralized exchange token gets shorted heavily in a small amount of time in anticipation of a bankruptcy. It happened to Celsius Network's utility token when Celsius halted customer withdrawals. After the CEL token tanked down to 15 cents, it staged a massive short squeeze in spite of the solvency issues on the actual platform. CEL Open Interest (CoinGlass) To this day, CEL is still higher than where it was the day before Celsius Network halted withdrawal of funds even though the company is bankrupt. While this certainly doesn't mean FTT will rally in the same way, I do think CEL can serve as a warning of the dangers in taking the bear side of any crypto coin. This market doesn't always make sense. FTT Open Interest (CoinGlass) Given the sizeable decline in open interest today, I don't think FTT bears are at risk of getting squeezed the same way CEL bears were earlier this year. But FTT dip buyers should consider possible outcomes for FTT as a utility token before trying to catch the knife. If the deal does go through, how likely is a consolidation of accounts onto one platform? If Binance decides to eliminate the FTX exchange entirely and simply move customer asset obligations over to Binance, there would be absolutely no purpose to FTT's existence. Summary I would just stay way from this market chaos entirely for the time being. While I don't think there is systemic risk to Bitcoin specifically, the entire crypto ecosystem will likely struggle until we get more clarity into the deal between Binance and FTX. Bitcoin is now below $19k. Solana has fallen from $38 to $22 in just two days. Ethereum is down $300 in 48 hours. We've seen a lot of this before. The entire crypto market took a dive after Terra blew up. It did the same when Celsius halted withdrawals. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. The best way to play the FTT war is probably with cash for now.",NEGATIVE,BNB | FTT,EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | BNB | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4554952-ftx-token-another-one-bites-dust?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3967692.jpeg

During a spontaneous recording of the UpOnly crypto podcast on Tuesday, ""Pharma Bro"" Shkreli joined Kwon and the podcast's hosts in discussing Binance's agreement to acquire FTX after rumors about the Bahamas-based exchange's apparent insolvency led to a slowdown of withdrawals.  Shkreli, who was released from prison in May after serving a four-year sentence for securities fraud, told Kwon – who is being investigated in his native South Korea for multiple allegations of wrongdoing, including manipulating the price of the Terra stablecoin, which later collapsed – that jail ""sucks, but is not the worst thing ever.""  ""Hey Do, I just want to let you know, jail is not that bad,"" Shkreli said. ""So don't fret – I hope it doesn't happen. If it does happen ... it's not that bad.""  Shkreli had similar advice for FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried who, only recently, was one of the crypto industry's darlings.  ""It was really reckless for FTX to lead deals in Aptos and Sui. There's a reason banks don't do that,"" Shkreli said. ""It's really funny that you can go from being the bailout giver to the bailout recipient in a matter of a few months.""  ""There's a good time SBF does a little time on this. Hate to say it,"" Shkreli added. ""I don't want to see anybody go to jail because it sucks, but if people don't get 100 cents on the dollar here, SBF is probably gonna do a little time. If you're basically the architect of some empire that took people's money and didn't give it back to them – that's all [prosecutors] need to know. There's going to find some law that applies to you ... nobody's gonna look at Sam Bankman and say anything other than 'guilty.'""  However, Shkreli's predictions for jail time didn't stop at Kwon and Bankman-Fried.  ""It's just sad to see how many crypto people are going to prison and will go to prison,"" Shkreli said, mentioning former Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith and alleged Bitfinex hack launderer Ilya ""Dutch"" Lichtenstein.

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) said Tuesday it would delist and redesignate the privacy tool, which pools transactions to obfuscate senders and recipients, on allegations that North Korea has laundered over $100 million worth of crypto through Tornado Cash to support its WMD program, including the development of ballistic missiles. The sanctions watchdog first designated Tornado Cash in August of this year.  ""This action is part of the United States’ ongoing efforts to limit the DPRK’s ability to advance its unlawful weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs that threaten regional stability and follows numerous recent DPRK ballistic missile launches, which are in clear violation of multiple United Nations (UN) Security Council resolutions,"" a Treasury press release said.  North Korea has fired a number of its missiles in recent months, prompting panic in Japan and South Korea, as the missiles flew in their general direction, though no missile hit land.  In addition to Tornado Cash, OFAC sanctioned North Korea's national flag airline, Air Koryo, and two individuals the watchdog said helped North Korea transfer missile parts into the country.  In a statement, Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said, ""today’s sanctions action targets two key nodes of the DPRK’s weapons programs: its increasing reliance on illicit activities, including cybercrime, to generate revenue, and its ability to procure and transport goods in support of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.""

Much of the crypto industry has argued that Tornado Cash and its wallet addresses are software, not a person or entity, and so OFAC should not be able to designate the mixer as a sanctioned entity.  Lawsuits funded by Coinbase and Coin Center included this argument, as well as alleging that the Tornado Cash designation was overly sweeping and hurt Americans who had funds locked on the platform. OFAC previously published guidance for U.S. persons, detailing a process they could take on to try and recover their funds by applying for a specific license.  In its new FAQ, Treasury pushed back against this argument, saying an entity could be ""a partnership, association ... or other organization.""  Tornado Cash is an entity under the definition created by the executive orders overseeing sanctions, OFAC said. The organizational structure includes both Tornado Cash's founders and developers, as well as the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that votes on new features.  ""Tornado Cash uses computer code known as 'smart contracts' to implement its governance structure, provide mixing services, offer financial incentives for users, increase its user base, and facilitate the financial gain of its users and developers,"" OFAC said.  The watchdog noted that Tornado Cash's founders, DAO members and users were not sanctioned ""at this time.""

42394112,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXmI7,1667934835,The Story of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Backroom Deal With Binance’s CZ,"We may never know how close Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) crypto empire came to collapse, or the collateral damage that would have caused for the industry, but we do know the principal risks at play. And sadly, it’s the same issues Bitcoin was created over a decade ago to solve: financial self-dealing, human hubris and untransparent markets.  What just happened: Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, has agreed to buy a competitor it had initially nurtured and then almost tanked, FTX. Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao confirmed the deal on Twitter, saying the two exchanges signed a non-binding letter of intent.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The deal, still subject to due diligence processes and not completed, is a stopgap measure to save SBF’s crypto exchange from insolvency. It will likely calm markets that had been rocked by a public rift between two crypto titans so well known as to go simply by their initials.  This is a meteoric fall for SBF – the once-beloved poster boy of crypto who plastered his exchange’s name across stadiums and posed for glossy magazine spreads – who just months ago was touted as the “J.P. Morgan” of crypto for his efforts in backstopping bankrupt blockchain businesses like BlockFi.  ""Things have come full circle, and FTX.com’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for FTX.com (pending DD etc.),"" Bankman-Fried tweeted Tuesday, using shorthand for “due diligence.”  Keeping with the full circle motif, it’s worth noting SBF always saw blockchain more as a means to an end. He entered crypto after a few years as a Jane Street quant, with the stated aim of making as much money to gain as much influence as possible. That would be a fine mentality in crypto had SBF any apparent love of the tools and protocols that made him rich.  Instead, SBF, a political mega-donor who has spent $50 million during the past U.S. election cycle, has used his influence to push for regulations that ruffled his customers and competitors’ feathers. He was a vocal proponent of the DCCPA bill that would create a brokerage-like licensing system for decentralized finance and argued against financial privacy.  That’s what he said in public. For CZ, the bigger concern was what was said behind closed doors, “[W]e won’t support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs,” the Binance CEO tweeted this weekend. This was CZ’s attempt at being “transparent,” he said, explaining a large transaction of over $500 million FTT tokens to Binance made the day before.  He announced Binance would be selling these tokens into the open market, and drew a worrying comparison to LUNA, another project Binance was early to back that later collapsed after a bank run. CZ was seizing the moment caused by market uncertainty, after Alameda Research’s financials were leaked to CoinDesk.  The links between FTX and its sister firm, the hedge fund Alameda, have historically been unclear beyond that both were founded by SBF. The leaked financial statement showed that the majority of Alameda’s assets were illiquid or locked altcoins – many of which SBF had a stake in including FTT, SOL and SRM (the token from the Serum decentralized exchange Bankman-Fried co-founded).  Read more: Solana Falls and Speculation Centers on Links to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, Alameda  “Alameda will never be able to cash in a significant portion of FTT to pay back its debts,” Mike Burgersburg, an independent market analyst for Dirty Bubble Media, which was early to call the collapse of Terra/LUNA, said.  Bank runs can be self-fulling prophecies. Although several analysts said it was unlikely that either FTX or Alameda would suffer a margin call, investors began pulling funds, concerned their capital would be locked up in bankruptcy proceedings like with neobanks Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.  Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison did what they could to calm investors’ nerves, offering to mitigate a steep selloff of FTT by offering CZ $22 per token. Ellison said the leaked financial document did not account for another $10 billion Alameda allegedly had, while SBF said that client funds were “safe” and never rehypothecated into other crypto deals.  On-chain analytics showed a more worrying story. Stablecoins and other assets were draining from FTX. Before the Binance buyout was announced today, traders had pulled all the bitcoin FTX had off the platform, according to Coinglass. Alameda was unlocking funds from various DeFi platforms to send ETH to FTX, seemingly unconcerned with steep withdrawal fees.  FTX users began tweeting about delays in moving funds from the platform, while BitDAO asked Alameda to prove that it still held the 100 million BIT tokens the trading firm acquired last November, and began to vote whether to offload the 3.36 million FTT tokens BitDAO earned in that deal.  Throughout this process, industry commentators chided SBF for the exchange’s lack of transparency and called for him to show proof of reserves for both FTX and Alameda. “It’s not much to ask, critics note, given SBF’s recent grandstanding about the need for more regulation and better governance in crypto,” Fortune’s Jeff John Roberts wrote.  Yesterday, it became clear that Binance would reject SBF’s offers to sell its FTT tokens over-the-counter to minimize the sell-off. Instead, it would hold these assets – the fruit of what CZ called a “divorce” – like a Sword of Damocles. Bellwether cryptos like BTC and ETH, trading sideways yesterday, began to slip in overnight trading.  It was clear the contagion would be severe if SBF’s empire fell. Crypto is tied-up in intricate knots, and once it frays the whole ecosystem can unravel – like after the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. A stablecoin called magic internet money (MIM), capitalized primarily with FTT, lost its peg to the dollar.  See also: Binance CEO Zhao Considering Buying Banks: Report  At least with open financial systems like MIM investors knew at what price they would be liquidated. FTX is a blackbox, and people only have the information SBF chose to reveal. Many began to read Bankman-Fried’s retweets of unconfirmed airdrops for FTX users that kept their capital on the exchange as signs of desperation.  “[R]egardless of how it ends, it’s another blow against the industry (and financial institutions in general) simply for a lack of voluntary transparency, but it’s another giant check mark for the transparency of blockchain data and the skilled researchers trained to uncover, read and interpret this data,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Arca, said.  And so, we’re back at the beginning. It should come as no relief that SBF and CZ were apparently able to come to terms. It’s just another backroom deal.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB | FTT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/08/the-story-of-sam-bankman-frieds-backroom-deal-with-binances-cz,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a23baf11318142e8f5a75fbf4f66f5f72b1f13a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

3965310,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=509864,1667934034,Bitcoin To Dump Even Lower? This On-Chain Metric May Suggest It,"Bitcoin has sharply rebounded back to $20.4k, but is the decline actually over? This on-chain metric may suggest otherwise. Bitcoin Coin Days Destroyed Metric Has Spiked Up Over The Past Day As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC Coin Days Destroyed is showing a spike at the moment. A “coin day” is the amount that 1 BTC accumulates after sitting still on the chain for 1 day. When any coin with some number of coin days shows any movement, its coin days reset back to zero, and are said to be “destroyed.” The “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD) indicator measures the total amount of such coin days currently being destroyed on the Bitcoin network. When the value of this metric is high, it means a large number of dormant coins are being transferred on the chain right now. This kind of trend can be a sign of dumping in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin CDD over the past month: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high over the last twenty-four hours | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coin Days Destroyed has observed a spike during the past day. In the last few weeks, there have also been two other instances where the indicator has seen surges of similar values. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Supply Reaches All-Time High HODLing Levels Following each of these spikes, the price of the crypto has gone down, though the magnitude of the decline has differed between each of them. Generally, such large values of the CDD suggest movement from the long-term holders (LTHs), a cohort that holds strong onto their coins for extended periods. Because of this conviction, LTHs tend to accumulate a large number of coin days, which is why when they move to sell their coins, coin days in great quantities get destroyed, and the CDD registers this as a spike. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Can Cyclical Tools Predict The Next Bubble? | BTCUSD November 7, 2022 Thus, it’s possible that it was this dumping from the LTHs that lead to those declines in the previous instances. In the last 24 hours, the Bitcoin price plunged below $20k right after the CDD saw its surge, but as is apparent from the chart, the metric still hasn’t winded off just yet. So far, the crypto has actually sharply rebounded back up above $20k, but it remains to be seen if this retrace will be short lived, or if the CDD will start to die off.

After distancing himself from the concept of war and saying Binance was focused on building, today CZ really showed his true colors. “This afternoon, FTX asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire FTX.com and help cover the liquidity crunch,” he humbly tweeted. There is a lot to cover and will take some time. This is a highly dynamic situation, and we are assessing the situation in real time. Binance has the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time. We expect FTT to be highly volatile in the coming days as things develop. — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) November 8, 2022 However, CZ is admitting to a liquidity crunch that shouldn’t be there. And then, he clarifies that the deal isn’t done yet. “There is a lot to cover and will take some time. This is a highly dynamic situation, and we are assessing the situation in real time. Binance has the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time.” Related Reading: The Binance Vs. FTX War: Here Are The Most Recent Stats & On-Chain Data Analyzing the little data we have, DeFinace Capital’s Arthur Ox tweeted, “Given how little time it took to close this deal. It’s likely Binance acquire FTX for nominal/negligible amount and assume all the liabilities of FTX.” And then, he gave advice, “if I am previous round investor of FTX, I will probably start engaging litigation lawyer now.” The Future For Binance And FTX The analysts are having a field day with this story. Dylan LeClair, who’s been covering the ins and outs from day one, recently tweeted that the resolution “confirms that FTX is insolvent without a bailout from Binance” and that “Alameda was speculating with user funds.” Those are severe accusations, but he’s got some data to back them up.

We could all see the movements flooding back from Alameda wallets on-chain yesterday as reserves got depleted. pic.twitter.com/f7Y3LsYsqq — Dylan LeClair 🟠 (@DylanLeClair_) November 8, 2022 Questioning the liquidity crunch, LeClair asks, “was your “proprietary trading desk” directionally trading using user funds. We could all see the movements flooding back from Alameda wallets on-chain yesterday as reserves got depleted.” Taking it to the next level, economist Tuur Demeester is concerned with the implications, “If Binance buys FTX and hence takes over the claims of its depositors, it seems likely that Binance then would also become (or remain) a fractional reserve operation.” What a time to be alive.

Digital assets may be regulated similarly to the traditional securities, in those cases when they have similar properties, the report says. However, if the underlying technology allows to manage consumer risks, a new regulatory approach can be developed, different from the one already in force for the securities market, the report said. The document mostly covers matters related to the digital assets issued in Russia according to the 2020 law On the Digital Assets.  The document suggests developing more detailed rules addressing the taxation of digital securities and utility tokens, as well as legal framework for tokenizing securities, debt, precious metals and stones, and issuing non-fungible tokens (NFT) that certify property rights.  The Bank of Russia also suggested including digital assets trading into the traditional stock market infrastructure. Rules of access to the digital assets market should be harmonized with the ones for the traditional securities markets, so that unqualified investors can access both within the 100,000 rubles a year limit ($1,640) or more, if they successfully complete a financial literacy test, the report suggests.  The regulator also sees a need to provide framework for allowing digital assets issued abroad to the Russian market, but only those which ""comply with the quality requirements,"" for example, have an issuer and are backed by something.

The amount of money the U.S. government pays on interest alone now exceeds its defense spending. Global central banks collectively added a record amount of gold during the third quarter. Due to rising interest rates and a historically strong U.S. dollar, gold has experienced a monthly losing streak unmatched since 1869. As I see it, decentralized assets have never looked more attractive than they do now. That includes gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC-USD), and you could also make the case for collectibles like art. By ""decentralized,"" I mean that these assets are not issued by a central authority. They are no one's liability. No central banker makes the decision to mint more gold or silver. No finance minister decrees that Bitcoin production be slowed or accelerated. Investors have been diversifying with gold and silver for decades to limit their exposure to poorly executed monetary and fiscal policies. As I shared with you last month, investors bought more American Eagle and American Buffalo gold coins between January and September of this year than in any other such period going back to 1999. I believe this is largely a reflection of Americans' souring opinion of the state of the economy and the imbalance they see in monetary and fiscal policies. U.S. Global Investors For the same reasons, more and more investors are also diversifying with Bitcoin, an asset whose payment system is based on ""cryptographic proof instead of trust."" That's from Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper, released 14 years ago. Satoshi's point about trust is key to the idea of decentralization. As users of government-issued fiat currency, we have little choice but to trust policymakers' economic and financial decisions, which may significantly impact the value of our money. U.S. Spends More On Interest Than On Its Military Take a look at where monetary and fiscal mismanagement has gotten us. Total U.S. debt now stands at an unfathomable $31 trillion, or around a quarter of a million dollars per U.S. taxpayer. Debt accounts for over 121% of the entire U.S. economy. That means that for every dollar the U.S. has, it owes a buck and a quarter (almost). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has been lifting interest rates at a pace we haven't seen in 40 years, which makes servicing debt much more expensive. The amount of money the U.S. government pays on interest alone now exceeds its defense spending. In the third quarter of 2022, the government paid over $736 billion just on interest. That's more than its 2020 national defense budget of $714 billion. U.S. Global Investors Central Banks Load Up On Gold With gold, silver, and Bitcoin, there's no need for investors to put their trust in a third party or intermediary, especially one that may not have their best interests in mind. What I find interesting is that central banks themselves - the ultimate central authorities - recognize the power in diversifying with decentralized assets. According to the World Gold Council (WGC), global central banks collectively added a record amount of gold during the third quarter. Purchases jumped to nearly 400 metric tonnes, more than double the amount compared to the previous quarter and a new quarterly record. With these purchases, the year-to-date total for 2022 now stands at 673 tonnes, higher than any other year since 1967, the WGC says. U.S. Global Investors Gold Down For Record Seventh Month - A Buying Opportunity? Gold's critics and haters will point out that the price of the precious metal has been down for seven straight months, a new all-time record, as of October. They are correct. Due to rising interest rates and a historically strong U.S. dollar, gold has experienced a monthly losing streak unmatched since-are you ready for this? - 1869. U.S. Global Investors This sounds awful, but let's put it in context. Through the end of October, gold has fallen 11% in 2022. The S&P 500, by comparison, has lost 18%. What about other asset classes? Well, tech stocks (Nasdaq 100) have lost even more at around -30%. Emerging markets have done just as badly in 2022. Treasury bonds are down 14%, corporate bonds are down 20%. Bitcoin is off 55% for the year. So yes, the price of gold has declined for a record seven months, but it's still beating close to everything else. That has to count for something. For these reasons, I believe gold is priced very attractively, trading under $1,700 an ounce. The Fed will need to pivot at some point, and when it does, I think gold (and Bitcoin) could rally.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4554832-diversifying-with-gold-bitcoin-other-decentralized-assets?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3963824.jpeg

42415039,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWGir,1667928604,JPMorgan: Lessons Learned From the Crypto Crash,"Despite the recent crash in cryptocurrency markets, the technology behind stablecoins – a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold – will continue to play an important part in the evolution of the monetary system, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday.  The technologies, tokenization of securities and assets, smart contracts and cryptography, will “transform the future of financial systems,” the report said.  As with any new development, “the challenge is to find the right balance between fostering innovation and maintaining financial stability and protection for consumers and investors,” JPMorgan said. The roles of the public and private sector still need to be clearly defined, according to the note.  Policymakers will need to address financial stability risks by improving investor and consumer protection, and by enhancing know-your-customer (KYC) and “identity issue regulation” to stop money laundering and terrorist financing.  “A blue sky regulatory framework is hard to achieve in light of political and technological realities,” the note said. The recent crypto market crash highlights the risks originating from such regulatory shortcomings, it added.  An investor survey conducted by the bank showed that 28% of respondents said crypto would be the worst-performing asset class in 2023, and that 74% expected the bitcoin (BTC) price to be below $25,000 in six months.

42420792,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH2j,1667928428,"FTX, Binance Deal Draws Antitrust Concern","The proposed sale of FTX’s non-U.S. business to Binance, announced Tuesday amid concerns over stability at FTX, has drawn concerns of antitrust retaliation in the U.S. and elsewhere.  Regulators across the world have the power to block major mergers if they fear they would limit market choice, and also have strict laws against anti-competitive behavior. Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, while FTX is within the top five, according to data site CoinGecko.  Binance Chief Executive Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted news of the plans on Tuesday, drawing immediate questions over compliance with antitrust laws.  “Next time, check the compliance of your tweet with antitrust laws before you post,” tweeted Thibault Schrepel, an associate professor at Amsterdam University who specializes in blockchain and antitrust issues, of CZ’s announcement. “At this stage, I wouldn’t be surprised to find this tweet in a forthcoming court document/antitrust litigation.”  US regulators could step in  In the U.S., antitrust laws such as the Sherman Act outlaw direct competitors from acting to protect each other. CZ said that he had stepped in to protect users after FTX, faced with a “significant liquidity crunch” had asked for help. That suggests an illegal agreement, Schrepel says – who believes that U.S. laws would apply since the deal affects the entire company, regardless of whether FTX US is part of the deal or not.  Brandon Kressin, a crypto-focused attorney at boutique antitrust law firm Kressin Law Group, seconded Schrepel's concerns.  ""This [deal is] a textbook horizontal merger of the sort that the antitrust laws in the U.S. and internationally are meant to address,"" Kressin said. ""I think that the apparent hope they have that excluding the U.S. exchanges from the deal is going to save their deal from antitrust scrutiny is very short sighted. These are global markets, and the transaction is undoubtedly going to have an effect on the U.S. – and U.S. enforcers have an interest in making sure that the antitrust laws protect U.S. consumers.""  Mergers and Acquisitions 101  While the Twitter announcements from Binance and FTX on Tuesday made the deal look all but done, Kressin said it's likely just the start of a months-long legal process that could potentially result in federal regulators attempting to block the acquisition.  ""They're likely going to have to file [premerger notifications] with the merger enforcement authorities in a lot of different jurisdictions,"" Kressin said. ""In the U.S., that's with the Department of Justice and the [Federal Trade Commission]. I think it's likely that this would go to the DOJ, and the DOJ would be looking at the deal and deciding whether they want to sue under the U.S. antitrust laws to block a transaction.""  Kressin added that Binance's Chinese origins (though the exchange has long pushed back against being labeled as a ""Chinese company"") could result in an extra layer of scrutiny for the deal.  ""There is a concern that runs along with general antitrust concerns about this being a direct, horizontal overlap with the dominant player in teh world market,"" Kressin said. ""The fact that there's at least a possibility or suggestion of Chinese involvement is going to raise the scrutiny.""  Kressin also said the swift pace of the potential deal and the method in which shareholders were informed could lead regulators to double down on their inspection of the deal.  ""Announcing the deal on Twitter like this with so little notice to other important stakeholders, suggests [Binance and FTX] might be aggressive and potentially reckless here,"" Kressin said.  ""You have to give the antitrust authorities a chance to evaluate the transaction first. You can't just start taking actions that merge the companies and taking actions that you wouldn't otherwise take, if not for the fact that you're being merged,"" Kressin added. ""Them taking actions already based on the assumption that this transaction is going to go through may itself raise what we call 'gun jumping' issues.""

42411707,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJtK,1667927952,What Is an Exchange Token?,"The cryptocurrency exchange industry is a pretty tight market. Fees can only fall so far before trading becomes free, and each exchange promises missile-proof security (though those promises have been broken) and 24/7 trading.  Crypto exchanges realized they had to differentiate themselves from the competition, so they drew on what they knew best – cryptocurrencies – and started to issue some of their own. These are known as exchange tokens.  Exchange tokens, minted by exchanges like Binance and FTX, entitle holders to benefits on cryptocurrency exchanges. Such benefits often include trading fee discounts, rebates and early access to token sales held on the platform (known as Initial Exchange Offerings, or IEOs).  The deal is sweeter yet for the exchanges. By minting these tokens, then keeping a bunch for themselves, they can generate a huge amount of wealth. That wealth is created, it should be noted, not by selling off equity or issuing debt – it is created by introducing the value of the token to the users of the exchange and making a handful of keynote speeches and announcements to build excitement for the mint. Exchange tokens also enhance the liquidity of an exchange, providing the platform additional dry powder to call on when markets get tight.  How exchange tokens work  Exchange tokens function just like any other cryptocurrency token. You can trade them on secondary markets or hold them for speculative purposes. Examples of exchange tokens include FTX’s FTT token, Binance’s BNB, Huobi’s HT and WazirX’s WRX.  These exchange tokens are minted by the cryptocurrency exchange itself. The term is usually reserved for tokens issued by a centralized cryptocurrency exchange – a company with an executive team and structure similar to a traditional finance company, that maintains an order book of buyers and sellers.  Exchange tokens generally refer to volatile cryptocurrencies issued by the exchanges; stablecoin tokens issued by exchanges, like BUSD, HUSD, and Coinbase (and Circle’s) USDC are not generally called exchange tokens, and are simply referred to as stablecoins.  Decentralized exchanges, like Uniswap and SushiSwap, also have their own tokens, although these are usually separated into their own categories, like “DeFi tokens” or “DEX tokens.” These tokens are used in governance; stakers pledge them within various decentralized finance protocols to alter the parameters that define the platforms.  You can usually buy exchange tokens directly from the cryptocurrency exchange – which will often pay you in the token as a reward for completing tasks or trading certain coins. Some exchanges, like WazirX, airdrop, or give away, tokens to holders to kickstart the market.  Exchange tokens do not equate to stock in the company, and do not usually confer governance rights over the exchange. However, exchange token markets often work quite a bit like equity markets; their price is a function of the belief that the exchange will become successful, making its exchange token valuable to hold; the more activity there is on the exchange, the thinking goes, the more demand there will be for the exchange token.  For traders, the main benefit is a reduction in trading fees. Holders of WRX are entitled to discounts of up to 50% when they pay fees in WRX, and FTX offers those that hold more than $100 worth of FTT a 3% discount when trading on the exchange.  Generally, the more a user holds, the more discounts they’re entitled to. For instance, Crypto.com ties its exchange token, Cronos (CRO), to a Visa debit card. The rewards increase along with the CRO stake: stake more than 5 million CRO, which is $574,000 as of this writing, and you’ll get 8% interest paid in CRO, plus 5% back on (fiat) money spent using the card, among other benefits.  Exchange tokens each have different issuance schedules and tokenomics. However, commonly, the team running the exchange reserves a huge amount, then holds the bulk in reserves, doling it out to contributors and the trading community over time to incentivize growth on the platform.  This means that the exchanges remain in control. CoinDesk reported on documents obtained in November 2022 which revealed how FTX’s sister company, Alameda, held billions of dollars of FTT on its balance sheet. Alameda’s single biggest asset at the time of the CoinDesk report was $3.66 billion of “unlocked FTT.”  Lots of exchange tokens are deflationary. FTX buys FTT, then burns tokens that equate to a third of the revenue FTX generates each week (less a few caveats, such as payment processor fees). FTX is not alone in this practice; Binance has long regularly burned its exchange token, BNB, which is issued on its native BNB Chain.

""Although the knee-jerk reaction is that HOOD will be impacted we note that unlike COIN, Robinhood only has 14% of total revenue from trading crypto tokens. It is far more diversified than COIN with equities and options trading,"" Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev said in a research note to clients Tuesday. Dolev added that he doesn't see Coinbase garnering an influx of customers, saying the ""rapid fall from grace of a crypto exchange demonstrates how fickle the crypto industry could be."" Mizuho rates Coinbase with neutral and Robinhood with a buy.  Separately, Needham's John Todaro sees some early positives for Coinbase, saying in a note that ""distractions and withdrawals from FTX could lead to new customer gains for COIN"" near-term. He cautioned, however, that crypto price declines and increased crypto investor concerns could lead to dampened crypto interest. Needham rates Coinbase with a buy rating.  The speculation over Bankman-Fried's FTX started after CoinDesk reported last week that a notable portion of sister company Alameda's balance sheet was made up of FTT, which is the FTX exchange's in-house token.  Regarding what could be next for Sam Bankman-Fried and his team, the firm would ""shift focus to the U.S. market, where they have been spending disproportionate time in the last few months,"" Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said in a note to clients. ""However, they lose the cash machine of the FTX international exchange, which was enabling investments in the U.S. entity,"" Chhugani wrote, adding that a regulatory presence would also lessen.

However, recent developments and bitcoin’s fall below $20,000 has proven that this is not the case. Even more, it points to a further decline in the market that could drag the cryptocurrency to even lower lows. Bottom Is Not In Bitcoin is now trading in the $19,000 which has completely destroyed the expectation that the bottom was already marked at $20,000. Despite the digital asset largely deviating from a lot of established trends, it seems it continues to stay true to the fact that it eventually loses more than 80% of its all-time high value before the next bull rally begins. Related Reading: What Happens To Dogecoin If Twitter Fails To Implement Crypto Plans? If so, then it is possible that the market will see lows below $17,000. Now the question becomes what would trigger such a decline in price and it could be easily traced back to the ongoing battle between Binance and FTX. The market is already feeling the effects of Binance wanting to dump more than $500 worth of FTT, which has triggered a more than 30% decline in the token’s price already. However, as is often the case in the crypto market, it is not localized to just FTT alone. The effects are being felt across other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin which has lost about $1,000 from its value in the last 24 hours alone. BTC price falls below $20,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Will Bitcoin Recover? A recovery in the bitcoin price is not a debate given that recovery after a price decline is always inevitable. However, a significant recovery from this point is not expected given that bitcoin is yet to reach its bottom. And until this happens, it is likely that bitcoin will not break above $22,000. Related Reading: Can Solana (SOL) Sustain Its Google-Triggered Price Rally? There were also significant sell-offs in the market following the increase in price last week. Investors had taken advantage of this to secure some quick short-term gains but the result was the loss of support at $20,000. For bitcoin, it comes down to the current macro climate due to the high correlation. Until there is settling, it is likely that the digital asset will not see any significant value pump.

""Things have come full circle, and FTX.com's first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for FTX.com (pending DD etc.),"" SBF wrote in a Twitter post , adding that the U.S. businesses of FTX and Binance were not included in the deal. In providing more details about the FTX acquisition, CZ confirmed the deal in which both parties signed a non-binding letter of intent in the wake of a ""significant liquidity crunch"" at FTX, he wrote via Twitter. ""There is a lot to cover and will take some time. This is a highly dynamic situation, and we are assessing the situation in real time. Binance has the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time. We expect FTT to be highly volatile in the coming days as things develop,"" he added. FTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Seeking Alpha. Immediately after the news hit, FTX Token ( FTT-USD ) erased nearly half of its intraday losses, currently down around 20% to $18.21 at 11:42 a.m. ET compared with $14.39 just prior to SBF's tweet. The move comes on the heels of CoinDesk's story last week that questioned the overlap between FTX and SBF's hedge fund, Alameda Research, due to its massive stake in FTX's FTT ( FTT-USD ) tokens. On-chain data showed earlier that FTX seemingly halted processing client withdrawals . In a follow-up Twitter post , SBF noted that ""our teams are working on clearing out the withdrawal backlog as is. This will clear out liquidity crunches; all assets will be covered 1:1.""

42415077,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWRam,1667923858,FTX Agrees to Sell Itself to Rival Binance Amid Liquidity Scare at Crypto Exchange,"Binance agreed to buy rival cryptocurrency exchange FTX, a stunning outcome that followed days of speculation – spurred by a CoinDesk article on Nov. 2 – that FTX and corporate sibling Alameda Research faced a liquidity crisis.  The deal – which, like so much else during almost a week of drama, was revealed in tweets – unites two powerhouses of crypto trading. Early this year, FTX was valued at $32 billion, and Binance is the biggest crypto exchange by volume. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed, though FTX's U.S. division – a separate entity known as FTX US – is not included in the deal.  ""Things have come full circle, and FTX.com’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for FTX.com (pending DD etc.),"" FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted Tuesday, referring to due diligence.  Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao also took to Twitter to confirm the deal, saying the two exchanges signed a non-binding letter of intent. Bankman-Fried and Zhao both said that a full due diligence process would be underway in the next couple of days.  The deal comes in the wake of a CoinDesk scoop last week that triggered concern that the balance sheet of FTX's corporate sibling, Alameda Research, was too heavily reliant on illiquid tokens including FTX's own FTT. Both FTX and Alameda were founded and are largely owned by Bankman-Fried.  Read More: The Story of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Backroom Deal With Binance’s CZ  Some observers interpreted the story as meaning Alameda's finances – and therefore maybe FTX's – were not as solid as it had been thought.  Then Binance's CEO amped up the pressure on Sunday by saying he planned to sell his holdings of FTX's FTT token, since the CoinDesk story had shown that much of Alameda's balance sheet was made up of FTT. ""Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA,"" he tweeted. ""We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards.""  Read More: FTX, Binance Deal Draws Antitrust Concern  CZ's decision pushed down FTT's price. Alameda's CEO, Caroline Ellison, then tweeted on Sunday the company would buy all of Binance's FTT tokens for $22 each in order minimize the impact on prices.  The situation worsened early Tuesday as FTX customers struggled to withdraw money from FTX. Dozens of customers complained in FTX’s Telegram group and on Twitter about difficulties they experienced. Roadblocks to pulling money out presaged several other crypto company failures in 2022.  Following the deal, FTX's FTT token initially rallied but that did not last long; after beginning the day just shy of $20, it was recently around $5.

Bitcoin HODLed Or Lost Coins Metric Has Hit A New ATH As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, investors have been showing some aggressive accumulation behavior recently. There are a couple of relevant indicators here. The first is the “HODLed or Lost Coins,” which measures the total number of coins that have been sitting dormant on the blockchain. Such coins either belong to the HODLers, or are simply inside wallets that have been lost (hence the name of the metric). The other indicator is the “HODLer Net Position Change,” which tells us the amount of Bitcoin that is entering or exiting this dormant supply right now. When the HODLer supply goes up, it means investors have been accumulating more and holding strong onto their coins recently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in both these Bitcoin indicators over the last couple of years: The value of the two metrics seems to have been high in recent weeks | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 45, 2022 From the above graph, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin HODLer or Lost Coins supply had a high value just before the 2021 bull run hit in full swing. After it started, however, the indicator declined as HODLers began to sell for profit. This trend of negative net position change in their supply ran until May 2021, when a reversal occurred. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Can Cyclical Tools Predict The Next Bubble? | BTCUSD November 7, 2022 The investors have been generally holding strong and accumulating more coins since then, as the green net position change shows. As a result of this accumulation, the Bitcoin HODLer or Lost Coins metric has now reached a new all-time high. Another way to see this aggressive HODLing behavior is through the “Supply Last Active < 6 Months” indicator, which measures the amount of BTC that has seen some movement within the last six months. Looks like this metric has declined recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 45, 2022 As you can see in the chart, the percentage of the Bitcoin supply last active within the past six months is currently at historical lows. This means that a huge chunk of the supply has been dormant in recent times, further proving the extreme HODLing that is taking place right now.

REEF’s price continues to trend above key support as price broke out of its downtrend with eyes set for $0.01. VET’s price remains strong, holding key support on the daily timeframes as the price trades above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Previous weeks saw the price of most altcoins trend higher this has put these 3 top altcoins in the spotlight, considering how the crypto market has been fairing after the market saw its price decline with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) not looking too good as the week has continued to look unprecedented with the current market looking choked with the current issue between Binance and FTX creating a fear of uncertainty and doubt for most traders and investors. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Polygon Beats Estimates As MATIC Registers 26% Weekly Gain 3 Top Altcoins – Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis On The Daily Chart The previous week saw many altcoins produced over 200% gains over the past 7 days of breaking out of their range-bound movement, as many believe more hope is returning to the crypto space. The new week hasn’t kicked in like the last as most altcoins have begun to look shaky, dropping off from their weekly highs, including the price of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) suffering a minor price retracement back to a region of $1,540 and $19,600 respectively. Still, the price of LINK has continued to show strength after breaking out successfully from its downtrend. With the current outlook of LINK, the price of LINK could rally to a region of $12 as things have continued to look strong for LINK’s price. After having a weekly close above $8, the price of LINK has looked more decent, as the price aims to create more bullish signs that have attracted so much attention in the past few days. Weekly resistance for the price of LINK – $9.2. Weekly support for the price of LINK – $8. Price Analysis Of REEF Protocol On The Daily (1D) Chart The REEF price remains strong in the daily timeframe as it holds above its critical support at $0.0055, rallying from its daily downtrend and breaking above with good volume. REEF’s price needs to hold above its $0.005 value, which corresponds to the 50 EMA holding the price of REEF from sell-off, considering how uncertain the market has become of late. The price of REEF trades at $0.0055 after rejection from a daily high of $0.006 as the price tried to break above this region. Daily resistance for the REEF price – $0.0065. Daily support for the REEF price – $0.0051. 3 Top Altcoins- Price Analysis Of Vechain (VET) On The Daily (1D) Chart The VET price remains strong in the daily timeframe as it holds above its critical support at $0.025 after rallying from a daily low of $0.02, but the price faced resistance to breaking higher in price to a region of $0.03.

The current level of venture capital investment of $500 million to $1 billion per month gives an annual rate of almost $10 billion, which is less than one-third of last year’s pace, they wrote.  Panigirtzoglou called it a worrying development as it shows an unwillingness by venture capital funds to deploy capital in the digital assets sector. He believes it increases the likelihood that the current weakness in cryptocurrency markets may be here for some time.

3957269,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=509849,1667915847,Dogecoin retest support $0.1; Here Is why Doge Army Must Defend This Region,"DOGE’s price needs to stay above $0.1 for the price to have a chance to rally high to a region of $0.15. DOGE’s price continues to trend above key support of $0.1 as the hopes of rallying higher continue to dwindle. DOGE’s price remains strong, holding key support on the daily timeframes as the price trades above the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Previous weeks saw the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) rally with so much bullish sentiment creating more euphoria for a bull run as the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) rallied with over 150% gain in less than 7 days as many anticipated the rally to a region of $0.2. The sentiment surrounding the crypto market is not encouraging, as the week has been filled with less bullish sentiment. The crypto market has seen some relief across all assets, but the new week holds mixed feelings. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: VeChain (VET) Climbs 10% In Last 7 Days – What’s Going On? Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The previous week saw many altcoins produced over 200% gains over the past 7 days of breaking out of their range-bound movement, as many believe more hope is returning to the crypto space. The new week hasn’t kicked in like the last as most altcoins have begun to look shaky, dropping off from their weekly highs, including the price of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) suffering a minor price retracement back to a region of $1,540 and $19,600 respectively with the price of DOGE finding itself in a somewhat similar position after the price was rejected from the region of $0.15 after rallying from its weekly low of $0.05. After having a weekly close below $0.13, the price of DOGE has struggled to replicate the bullish sentiment it had, rallying to a weekly high of $0.15 after a long period with expectations high for a rally back to its weekly high. The price of DOGE needs to hold above $0.1 for the price to have a chance of a rally to the region of $0.15 and possibly to a high of $0.2; if the price of DOGE fails to hold $0.1, we could see price retesting weekly support of $0.075. Weekly resistance for the price of DOGE – $0.15. Weekly support for the price of DOGE – $1-$0.075. Price Analysis Of DOGE On The Daily (1D) Chart In the daily timeframe, the price of DOGE continues to look strong as it holds above its critical support at $0.1 after facing rejection as the price rallied to a region of $0.15. The price of DOGE trades at $0.1 after rejection from a daily high of $0.15, suffering a minor setback in the price of DOGE to trend higher; the price trades above the 50 and 200 EMA, which indicates a good relief sign for DOGE’s price is possible if the price of DOGE rallies away key support zone that can be broken giving room for bears to take over the market. Daily resistance for the DOGE price – $0.15. Daily support for the DOGE price – $0.1.

Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) slid 5.1% to $19.66K at 8:51 a.m. ET after reaching as low as $19.41K earlier in the session. BTC was not the only token feeling the knock-on effects from the FTX-Alameda drama. In fact, most of the major cryptos by market cap traded in negative territory. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) retreated 6.6% to $1.47K, ripple ( XRP-USD ), -7% , dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), -13.6% , cardano ( ADA-USD ), -4.7% , and solana ( SOL-USD ), -10.6% . Sam Bankman-Fried vs. Changpeng Zhao: Recall when Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said over the weekend that his crypto exchange will offload the rest of its sizable holdings of FTX Token ( FTT-USD ) ""in a way that minimizes market impact."" Since his announcement, the price of FTT, the 29th largest crypto by market cap, collapsed 25.8% , shedding roughly $1B in market value, according to CoinMarketCap data . His remarks came shortly after CoinDesk's story parsed Alameda's balance sheet that had market participants on edge. The article highlighted that the trading firm had over $5.8B of FTX Token ( FTT-USD ) on its books, accounting for the largest portion of its $14.6B assets. The troubling part is that FTT's circulating supply is just around $4.36B. That means ""the price that the assets are marked on Alameda’s balance sheet look less like mark-to-market and more like mark-to-myth as it would be impossible to liquidate their FTT at anything like the price they are marked on Alameda’s books,"" Ryan Shea, crypto economist at Trakx, wrote in a recent report. All in all, ""if the latest episode serves to speed up crypto regulation then it could be just the catalyst that brings crypto to a wider audience and this is a good thing,"" he concluded. Crypto and crypto-related stocks: The bearish price action in cryptos pulled down the prices of crypto-related equities, including Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ), -2.3% , MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ), -4.7% , Marathon Digital ( NASDAQ: MARA ), -5.1% , and Riot Blockchain ( NASDAQ: RIOT ), -6.3% . And while all three major stock index futures pointed to a higher open, crypto-related stocks still changed hands in a sea of red, underscoring their deep ties to digital tokens instead of the broader stock market.

42393766,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAmtp,1667912400,"Crypto Has Prepared for Divided US Government, Republican Rise","As U.S. voters head to the polls Tuesday, the crypto industry is confident that it’s positioned itself well for the newly divided government expected to emerge when the votes are tallied.  Legislation that could finally establish U.S. oversight of digital assets is already bipartisan, and the industry’s funding of political campaigns has supported a number of well-placed Republicans.  “Split control of the federal government could bode well for future crypto policy and regulation,” said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association in Washington. “In the current Congress, there is growing bipartisan collaboration on major legislation, and we would expect that trend to continue, and likely accelerate, if control changes hands.”  However, while Republicans are more likely to emphasize a need for the U.S. to allow for crypto innovation and are less rigid about financial rules, taking over Congress doesn’t have an immediate impact on how cryptocurrencies will fare in future regulations. The heads of U.S. regulatory agencies remain Democratic appointees, and lawmakers still have a Democratic gatekeeper in President Joe Biden, who needs to sign off on any new laws.  “For the next couple of years, anything that goes through Congress will have to get the president's signature,” said Ian Katz, a managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm. “So while Republicans may provide a generally more sympathetic audience for crypto, that doesn't mean party time for crypto if the Republicans get control of Congress.”  Red wave  If these midterm elections see a red wave of incoming Republicans, the major visible switch would be in the leadership of the chambers and the committees. The majority party tends to control the agenda for what issues come up and how. And when the administration is led by one party and Congress by another, it typically ignites an open warfare of committee hearings that relentlessly pummel the executive branch.  Crypto observers who have already stoked a dislike for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, for instance, will likely be watching him targeted by Republican lawmakers eager to shred his agency’s performance.  “In a split government, the checks and balances intended by our founding fathers are really in play, and you often see congressional committee chairs try to exert their influence and authority over regulatory agencies and regulated industries,” said Keith Noreika, an executive vice president at Patomak Global Partners who ran the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a time.  A number of bills have been winding their way through Congress this year, but two are farther along than the others: an effort to oversee stablecoins and legislation that would empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate the trading of certain tokens including bitcoin. Both are immersed in bipartisan negotiations, and they’re expected to provide the foundations of similar efforts in the new Congress next year.  Read More: Here’s What Crypto Traders Expect From the Midterms  If Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) moves from ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee to become its chairman, he could pick right back up where he left off on stablecoin oversight this year. He said the committee leaders have already agreed on much of the bill.  The CFTC legislation is primarily an effort in the Senate Agriculture Committee – a product of common ground between Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and top Republican Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) Though it doesn’t settle some of the uncertainties over which tokens should be regulated as commodities and which as securities, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA) has drawn some industry support, including from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. However, the industry has also been wary of how it might affect decentralized finance (DeFi), so negotiations have continued.  The current Democrat-dominated government already provided cryptocurrency lobbyists some practice for navigating a partisan divide, because it was – for practical purposes – a majority in name only. The Democrat’s control of the Senate was so tenuous that legislation usually needed bipartisan support.  If Republicans McHenry and Boozman end up taking over their committees, crypto industry campaign donations have benefited both of them this year. Crypto political action committees (PACs) have given tens of millions to candidates from both parties. For several incoming freshman lawmakers, industry support will have been key to their victories.  In the House, the GOP is expected to increase its number of seats well over the 218 that would secure a majority. Republicans only need to win a handful of the many congressional races up for grabs, and most analysts have been predicting a majority well over 220. One estimate from BTIG this week puts the likely gain at 22.  In the Senate, Republicans need only shift one seat to their side, and polling has indicated they may have a slight advantage to get that, according to the latest analysis at fivethirtyeight.com. The question is expected to be answered by the races in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.  Another tight race is Arizona’s contest between Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Republican challenger Blake Masters, one of the crypto industry’s greatest supporters in the midterms. So far, polling has suggested Kelly will win by a very narrow margin.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | COMMODITY | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/08/crypto-has-prepared-for-divided-us-government-republican-rise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5415a00dd3ac1767690ac138e3b0efbeb37e504f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, known as BaFin, said Coinbase Germany was in violation of standards set by the German Banking Act. The announcement referenced Section 25a (1) of the Act, which lays out requirements for firms to maintain risk-bearing capacity, adequate staffing, emergency management mechanisms such as IT systems and transparent remuneration systems for employees – including management.  The requirements also include setting up ""appropriate arrangements that allow the institution's financial position to be determined at all times with reasonable accuracy.""  Crypto firms the world over are facing increased scrutiny from regulators after a turbulent year that has seen some big industry names go bankrupt, in part because of poor risk-management strategies. Even countries with comprehensive regimes in place to regulate crypto, like Germany and Singapore, are taking a closer look at service providers.  ""An audit of the annual financial statements revealed organizational deficiencies at the institute. The regularity of the business organization was not given in all audited areas,"" BaFin said in its statement. The order to address the organizational issues has been in effect since Oct. 27.  Coinbase Germany received permission from BaFin to provide crypto custody services in the country last year.  ""Coinbase is committed to providing customers in Germany and around the world with the most trusted and easy to use crypto services,"" the company said in a blog post at the time. ""Becoming licensed in Germany marks an important milestone as we strive to enable economic freedom around the world.""  In addition to internal controls, BaFin found Coinbase Germany lacking ""appropriate and effective risk management"" for when transactions or services that are typically conducted by the firm are outsourced to other parties. According to the portions of the Banking Act referenced in its statement, BaFin wants Coinbase to ensure maintenance of “an outsourcing register as part of its risk management.""  Coinbase is ""cooperating fully"" to address the findings of the audit, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk following the publication of this article.  ""We have developed a remediation plan fully addressing each finding of the audit report to address BaFin’s concerns. To date, we have made substantial progress on this plan,” the statement said.

Most top-tier regulators require the fulfilment of some rules for the operation of crypto service providers in their regions. These include registration and other license approval from the country watchdogs. Coinmetro, a crypto exchange, expressed its plans for a global expansion in a new development. This plan propelled the firm to embark on a fundraising round that generated about 7 million euros (worth $7 million). According to the firm&apos;s report, the exchange is now valued at 180 million euros.

""This Recommendation continues to be assessed and rated as part of countries’ mutual evaluation or follow up reports,"" the FATF press team said in an email to CoinDesk.  Since 2018, the international body has looked to define virtual assets and service providers in order to apply guidelines for anti-money laundering (AML) and combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) to the crypto industry. In 2021, it published updated guidance for virtual asset service providers. Earlier this year, it said nearly half of the world's jurisdictions still weren't requiring crypto service providers to identify their customers properly.  Overall, implementation of FATF standards to regulate crypto ""remains extremely poor,"" it said in the email. It also has not changed the process by which it adds countries to the gray list for increased monitoring.

There was a break below a key rising channel with support near $0.1180 on the daily chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

An initial resistance on the upside is near the $0.1150 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.1200 level.

42415072,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWRFY,1667888199,BitDAO Community Asks Alameda for Proof of Funds After BIT's Sudden 20% Drop,"CORRECTION (Nov, 8, 06:57 UTC): Corrects headline and story to say BitDAO has suggested voting on the FTT tokens, not threatened Alameda directly. Corrects dek to say BIT token, not FTT.  BitDAO, one of the largest decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), entered the FTX-Alameda drama on Tuesday after the DAO's native token BIT slipped 20%.  The community behind BITDAO, which is supported by crypto exchange Bybit, Pantera, billionaire Peter Thiel and several other funds, asked trading firm Alameda to prove it continues to hold 100 million BIT tokens the DAO acquired in November of last year by converting 3.36 million FTT tokens. The token swap deal required Alameda to hold tokens for at least three years.  ""BitDAO community is questioning the sudden dump of $bit token caused by Alameda dumping and breaching the 3 yr mutual no sale public commitment. Nothing is confirmed but BitDAO community would like to confirm proof of funds from Alameda,"" Bybit's co-founder Ben Zhao tweeted.  BitDAO's fears perhaps stem from speculation that Alameda is liquidating its other token holdings to defend FTX's native cryptocurrency.  FTTT has dropped 40% to $15 in four days. The FTX-Alameda drama began last week after CoinDesk reported that Alameda held large amounts of FTT tokens on its balance sheet. In response, Binance moved to liquidate its FTT holdings, triggering market panic.  BitDAO community also issued a veiled threat to take action, perhaps sell the acquired 3,362,315 FTX tokens, in case Alameda does not offer clarification in 24 hours.  ""If this request is not fulfilled, and if sufficient alternative proof or response is not provided, it will be up to the BitDAO community to decide (vote, or any other emergency action) how to deal with the $FTT in the BitDAO Treasury,"" the proposal said.  Responding to Zhou's tweet, Alameda Research's CEO Caroline Ellison said, ""that wasn't us,"" and promised to provide the proof of funds once things calm down. Zhou thanked Ellison for the quick response, saying ""it gives a lot of confidence to the BitDAO community.  Ellison's assurance has certainly calmed market nerves. BIT token has recovered to trade at 38 cents, having dropped over 20% to 26 cents early Tuesday, data from charting platform TradingView show.  BitDAO has also introduced a proposal that will allow the community to monitor and verify that the FTT-BIT swap commitments are being followed.

42415086,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWSMX,1667884716,"Bitcoin, Ether Slide as Protective Puts Draw Demand Amid Sell-Off in FTX's Token","Crypto market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) shed their relative calm and faced selling pressure early Tuesday as FTT, the native token of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, nosedived to 21-month lows on lingering concerns regarding trading firm Alameda's balance sheet.  At 04:30 UTC, bitcoin traded 4.3% lower on the day at $19,700, while ether changed hands at $1,480, representing a 5.5% decline, CoinDesk data show. FTX's FTT token tanked 20% to $17, the lowest since February 2021, extending the past week's 13% slide.  Options data showed renewed demand for bearish put options tied to bitcoin and ether. The bearish shift in sentiment perhaps reflects investor fears that the ongoing FTX-Alameda drama may lead to Terra-like crypto collapse.  ""We have seen renewed demand for downside protection after the the negative news flow related to FTT,"" Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter crypto derivatives tech platform Paradigm, told CoinDesk.  ""Short dated skew in particular has moved in favor of puts as we have seen downside protection in both BTC and ETH with strong demand for end November/December expiries,"" Chu added.  A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the right to sell. Options skew measures prices for bullish calls relative to bearish puts.  The controversy surrounding Alameda's balance sheet began last week after CoinDesk reported that the trading firm holds large amounts locked or illiquid FTX tokens, painting the two entities unusually close to each other. (Alameda and FTX are sibling companies).  Since then, FTT has crashed by 40% and the exchange has seen large withdrawals at an alarming rate.  ""Much of the anxiety comes from FTX’s app (formerly Blockfolio), which has a generous 'earn program' of about ~5% up to $100K. As expected, a lot of capital is being withdrawn, which some observers try to frame as a 'bank run'. So far, I have no indication that investors are having trouble withdrawing cash,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at London-based Marex Solutions, said in an email.  ""Moreover, a 5% rate (not far from U.S. rates) is not as egregious as what Anchor [a crypto lending protocol] or Celsius [Network] were doing. But we don’t have any visibility on the repurposing of funds or liquidity mismatches (which doesn’t mean they don’t exist),"" Solot added.  Both short-term and long-term bitcoin call-put skews have turned lower from zero this week. The one-week skew has dropped from -1% to -12%, the lowest since late September, according to digital assets data provider Amberdata.  In other words, puts are back in demand.  A similar pattern is observed in ether call-put skews.  The one-week ether call-put skew has dropped to nearly -20%, indicating strongest bias for bearish puts since mid-September.  Options traders' expectations for price turbulence over the coming week and month have increased. Ether's seven-day implied volatility, or expectations for price volatility, jumped to an annualized 98%, the highest in two months. The one-month gauge ticked higher to a two-week high of 84%.  ""The market seems to be panicking, given the fact that LUNA event wasn't that long ago,"" Martin Cheung, an options trader from Pulsar, said, referring the uptick in the implied volatility.  Terra's stablecoin UST and native token LUNA crashed in May, destroying billions of dollars in investor wealth. The crash brought down several lenders, including Celsius.  According to Solot, FTX and Alameda's issues are unlikely to crash the market.  ""FTX is a systemically important player in the crypto ecosystem, so any trouble or loss of confidence – even if temporary – will have an outsized impact,"" Solot said.  ""That said, there’s a lot less leverage in the system right now, so there’s a greater chance any trouble can be contained more easily – or at least that losses will be concentrated instead of widespread. Indeed, the spill over to other tokens has been very mild so far,"" Solot noted.

42415079,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWRw0,1667878082,FTX Token Plummets on Withdrawal Concerns as Contagion Hits Broader Crypto Markets,"Fears over a withdrawal run from the billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX cryptocurrency exchange sent digital-asset markets into a fresh tailspin on Tuesday, hitting altcoins including the trading venue's own FTT as well as the Solana blockchain's SOL.  In a departure from the stability witnessed earlier in the week, the tremors appeared to spread to bigger cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), down 4.6% in the past 24 hours, and ether (ETH), down 6.3% – on a day when U.S. stocks were trading higher. In crypto options markets, traders were putting on fresh transactions to protect themselves from further downside. The 162-member CoinDesk Market Index lost 5.2%.  The meltdown sparked eery recollections of the crypto market's dizzying crash earlier this year, which was punctuated by the failures of the Terra blockchain's UST stablecoin, the crypto lender Celsius Network, trading venue Voyager Digital and the investment fund Three Arrows Capital.  The fresh drama was magnified by Bankman-Fried's reputation as one of the most powerful and hitherto successful industry figures, and came just days after none other than Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, CEO of the rival Binance exchange, said he planned to dump its remaining holdings of the FTT tokens.  As of press time the FTT was down nearly 14% over the past 24 hours and 44% over the past seven days, to a price of $18.92. Just days ago, the CEO of Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research, had tweeted that the outfit stood ready to buy the Binance holdings at $22 each.  Data from CoinGlass shows there continues to be building short bets on FTT as open interest in the crypto-derivatives market has surged 8% during the last hour to a total of $215 million.  The speculation over Bankman-Fried's FTX started after CoinDesk reported last week that a notable portion of Alameda's balance sheet was made up of FTT, which is the FTX exchange's in-house token, and the Solana blockchain's SOL.  Since then, the market has grown concerned about FTX's liquidity. The exchange has faced a massive stablecoin exodus, with $451 million being sent off its main platform during the last week and $15 million being pulled from its U.S. subsidiary, according to Nansen data. Currently, FTX has a balance of $59.2 million USDC and $28.5 million USDT, along with $8.6 million BUSD. FTX US has $41 million USDC, $12.8 million USDT, $39 million PAX, and $11.3 million BUSD available.  Interest rates on FTX's margin lending platform have jumped, with the exchange now paying 10% for USDT compared to a previous lending rate of 5%.  Meanwhile, Binance has seen an inflow of $411 million in stablecoins over the last week, with a current balance of $26.7 billion.  While users have reported some delays on fiat currency withdrawals, FTX says that it is working through the backlog and they are still being processed. Bankman-Fried, who serves as FTX's CEO, took to Twitter early Monday to say the exchange was far from insolvent and there is no risk of withdrawals being halted.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has previously said that he plans to liquidate any remaining FTT on Binance's books, but on-chain data suggests that this hasn't yet begun.  FTT is currently trading down 19% at $17.93. SOL is lower by 17% and Serum's SRM token is down 10%. The action is spilling over into bitcoin (BTC) as well, which is down 5.6% to $19,650.

The 11th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently down more than 10% over the past 24 hours as investors speculated about its possible place in the ongoing drama surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange and his trading firm, Alameda Research. According to a copy of the Alameda balance sheet seen by CoinDesk, Alameda holds $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” One theory is that Alameda might try to dump its SOL tokens in a bid to raise fresh liquidity, wrote CoinDesk’s Jocelyn Yang.  Early Monday, Bankman-Fried tried to assure FTX users, tweeting: ""A competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors. FTX is fine. Assets are fine.""

Bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptos in market value, had a quieter day, falling about 2% and 1.3%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. BTC remained comfortably over its most recent $20,000 support level after jumping over $21,000 late last week as investors’ looked with hope at signs the U.S. Federal Reserve would scale back from its current diet of hefty, 75 basis point interest rate hikes. ETH continued to hover well above the $1,500 threshold it retook about two weeks ago.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was trading roughly flat.  A day ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, stocks started the week on an up note as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, rose nearly a percentage point, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed up 1.3%. Safe haven gold joined the crowd in the green, albeit barely, inching up 0.1%. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy markets, held over $98, the perch it assumed late last week.  As CoinDesk reported, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao tweeted that the exchange plans to its FTT tokens. Although Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison offered to buy back Binance’s entire FTT allocation, the token declined from over $25 to under $22 and is down 2.5% on the day.  In his weekly Two Satoshis newsletter, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Arca, called the contretemps between the two giants ""another blow against the industry (and financial institutions in general) simply for a lack of voluntary transparency, but it’s another giant check mark for the transparency of blockchain data and the skilled researchers trained to uncover, read, and interpret this data.""

Exchange tokens offer holders discounts on fees at their respective exchanges. It’s now at $86.5 billion market, according to CoinGecko. There’s a line of thought which holds that these exchange tokens are similar to equity insofar as their price reflects the success of the platform, but there’s also a compelling argument that goes in the other direction.  But during the last week, many exchange tokens even outperformed bitcoin.  Over the past week, OKX’s token, OKB has climbed nearly 35%, fueled by positive news that the exchange has registered itself as a licensed digital assets business in The Bahamas.  Crypto.com’s CRO token has gained just under 10% as the token slowly recovers after the exchange was hit with a double whammy of an almost 91% decline in exchange volume year-over-year and major layoffs.  Binance’s BNB token found itself just slightly outperforming bitcoin. While the exchange itself has had some positive headlines over the last week, like its plan to potentially purchase a bank to bolster its licensing regime, token holders might be concerned that its getting caught in a crossfire between its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and FTX’s Sam Bankman Fried.  Over the weekend, CZ tweeted that Binance was planning to liquidate its holdings of FTT after CoinDesk revealed that the balance sheet of the FTX-affiliated fund Alameda Research contained a notable amount of FTT.  On Twitter, spectators quickly highlighted pointed out that liquidation of FTT holdings by a stakeholder as large as Binance would likely cause market contagion if Alameda’s balance sheet became illiquid.  Given that the industry just suffered through the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, testing the resilience of Alamada’s balance sheet is something that many in the industry would prefer not to do. Still, as CoinDesk reported on Monday, open interest is building on FTT, as are negative funding rates.  So far, FTT is down around 11% over the last five days. Let’s see what happens next.

42415084,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWSHE,1667866537,Ethereum Co-Founder Di Iorio Unveils Project to Bring Blockchain Computers to a Wider Audience,"Anthony Di Iorio, the co-founder of Ethereum, Decentral and Jaxx Liberty, unveiled a project he says he’s envisioned, designed and built over the span of a decade. The project, dubbed Andiami, blends game theory with cutting-edge hardware to bring blockchain computers to a wider audience.  The multi-year endeavor is seeking to counter blockchain centralization by enabling crypto users to run full nodes with little to no technical expertise. A full node is a computer that stores the complete transactional history of a blockchain network.  The project's tentative timeline extends to 2025. The first year (2023) focuses on the project's game theoretic components: a game entitled The Quest for Liberty, a player kit and Digital Life Tokens that players earn in the game.  Read more: THNDR Games Launches Play-to-Earn Bitcoin Solitaire Mobile Game  From 2024 to 2025, the focus shifts to Andiami’s flagship hardware product – “The Cube”– a plug-and-play blockchain computer that runs full nodes for networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Many crypto users find the technical requirements for running full nodes too daunting. Di Iorio hopes the plug-and-play nature of The Cube, coupled with carefully crafted gamification, will make it easy and fun for users to run their favorite network’s full node, and in doing so further decentralize blockchain infrastructure.  “The goal is empowering people with what they need to be in control of their digital lives. It starts with you being your own server.” Di Iorio told CoinDesk in an interview. “Anything that revolves around having a third party trusted intermediary between you and your money, or you and your identity, or you and your communications, isn't the ideal situation.”  A problem-solving framework  Di Iorio has been solving difficult crypto problems for many years. He wants to apply the problem-solving framework he used in prior endeavors to societal issues and has pledged $1 million to create an entity focused on this goal.  “I have a framework for solving problems called ‘Perfect Formula.’ It’s a framework I built to solve problems with the end game being to create as many wins for as many stakeholders as possible,” Di Iorio explained.  Many people are familiar with author Stephen Covey’s “win-win” concept that emphasizes mutually beneficial solutions to difficult problems. Di Iorio wants to extend this idea to create what he calls, “win-win-win” outcomes.  ""There's so much competition and divisiveness in this ecosystem, Di Iorio said. ""Our goal is to support the best projects and to give tools to the projects that aren't as good, to get better.""  The idea of everyone winning together is how Andiami got its name. Di Iorio is part Italian and modified the word, “andiamo” (Italian for “let’s all go”) to better encapsulate his concept. “In Italian and in other languages, adding an “i” at the end [of a word] pluralizes it. So it's not just, ‘let's all go,’ it’s ‘let's all go together,’” Di Iorio explained.  Gamification  The initial phase of the Andiami project revolves around The Quest for Liberty – a game where users buy player kits containing puzzles that can be solved to unlock Digital Life Tokens. Di Iorio says player kits will retail between $500 and $5,000.  “A lot of things are going to depend on demand,"" Di Iorio said. “A lot of it is dependent on how many people join the waitlist and our funding targets for selling the player kits to make sure we have the funds we need to continue at different stages.”  Whatever the price ends up being, users will need to purchase player kits containing “Non-Fungible Phygitals” (NFP) – physical items like player cards, embedded with NFC (near-field communication) authentication chips to link digital and physical worlds together.  Read more: Tech Behemoths Could Become ‘Dinosaurs’ if They Enter the Metaverse for the Wrong Reasons, Deepak Chopra Says  “‘Non-Fungible Phygital' is a term I coined and we're going to be using it in all the products we put out. From the puzzle books, to the puzzle cards, to the player kits,” Di Iorio said. “So when you tap a card, it uses public and private key cryptography to verify authenticity.”  With player kits and “phygitals” in hand, players will use what Di Iorio calls, “Proof of Puzzle Solve” (POPS) to unlock Digital Life Tokens that will function as the default currency in the Andiami ecosystem.  The Cube  Andiami will culminate with the launch of The Cube. Di Iorio describes it as a specialized, plug-and-play computer specifically designed to run a variety of full nodes. Just as there are gaming consoles for gamers, Di Iorio wants to build blockchain computers for crypto users.  “They're specific just like gaming consoles. They're made to be blockchain computers. They're unique depending on which chain they are,” Di Iorio explained. “We've got Cardano, we've got Cosmos, we've got Polkadot, we've got Bitcoin, we've got Litecoin. These are all boxes we've already created and have running right now.”  Di Iorio says he’s spent years perfecting a system that enables his company’s infrastructure to run with little to no downtime. Jaxx Liberty is a cryptocurrency wallet that runs multiple blockchains and dozens of tokens. He plans to bring that system, tentatively named, “NodeX,” into the hands of retail users.  “We've developed a system that doesn't require any maintenance. Because when you're running a node, one of the biggest issues is technical difficulties,” Di Iori said.  Andiami’s goal is to further decentralize crypto infrastructure. Much of crypto’s infrastructure is run on giant cloud computing provider platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or outsourced to infrastructure firms like Infura. Andiami’s end game is to transition that infrastructure to regular users by making it less intimidating to run a full node.  One way to accelerate that transition is by creating a “node sharing” protocol that connects Cube owners over the Internet, allowing them to earn rewards for sharing their infrastructure resources.  “If AWS shuts down, more than 50% of Ethereum is gone, Di Iorio said. ""That’s nuts! That's not how Ethereum was planned. That's not how Bitcoin was planned. So our line is, you can't have a user-controlled Internet unless the user has their own server.”  Read more: Ethereum Already Showing Signs of Increased Centralization  UPDATE (Nov. 8, 17:45 UTC): Added ""Non-Fungible"" in 15th paragraph and included event photo.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | WALLET,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/08/ethereum-co-founder-di-iorio-unveils-new-project-to-bring-blockchain-computers-to-a-wider-audience,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88e789c54da558218ec75436349c0e55e21ccc2f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
