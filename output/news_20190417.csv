42430406,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWTh,1555535275,Binance's Singapore Fiat-to-Bitcoin Exchange Is Launching Next Week,"Cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance will launch its new fiat-to-crypto platform in Singapore next week, its chief financial officer said.  CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao announced in early April that the Singapore fiat “on-ramp” would be coming sometime this month. But speaking to CoinDesk Wednesday from Paris, Binance CFO Wei Zhou gave a more precise timeframe.  “Next week we are going to launch the Singapore simple buy/sell on-ramp,"" said Zhou, who was in town for Paris Blockchain Week. ""It will actually be a new product we are launching, as a very easy buy/sell platform so users in Singapore can buy and sell bitcoin with Singapore dollars.”  Zhou said that for now in Singapore, “it will just be bitcoin, but we hope to add more [cryptocurrencies]. For a lot of these regulated jurisdictions, it's easy to start with things that people know and understand and you can gradually build on that.”  Binance began its project of building fiat-to-crypto gateways in January when it partnered with Simplex to let traders use Visa and MasterCard to buy a wide range of cryptos. Then in March, it launched Binance Lite in Australia which allows users to buy bitcoin at newsagents in over 1,300 locations across the country.  The company's expansion in recent months has been both rapid and eclectic, taking in Europe and the U.K. via the islands of Malta and the British Crown Dependency of Jersey. The company has also set up in Uganda citing the need to bring financial inclusion to the underbanked in that region. It is currently the No. 5 exchange by 24-hour trade volume (when excluding no-fee trades and transaction mining), according to CoinMarketCap.  Asked if the exchange had any designs on North America, Zhou said:  “We have plans for U.S. but I can't go into these right now.”  Clear the DEX  Binance has also embarked on plans to start a system of decentralized exchange (DEX), which is going to be built on Binance Chain, the exchange's home-grown ledger to transfer and trade blockchain assets.  In terms of the timing of that, Zhou noted that the Binance Chain testnet is up and running and “we hope to release the mainnet by the end of the month as well.”  He said there are a couple of reasons for pursuing a DEX route. As well as providing trading functionality, exchanges, by their centralized nature right now, hold customers’ assets, making them juicy targets for hackers.  “That is a risk that we do not want to take in the long run,” said Zhou  Speaking philosophically, Zhou also pointed out that change is the only constant in crypto. Two years ago 90 percent of trading was fiat to crypto; today 90 percent is crypto-to-crypto, he said. Hence:  “I think the key here is that innovation is going to happen regardless of whether it comes from us or other people – so we would rather be proactive.”  It’s possible to disrupt your own business model and do so in a virtuous way, Zhou added. “We are almost there, very close.”  Old money  Regarding the expectation that large swathes of institutional investors from the traditional finance world are waiting to enter the crypto sphere at some point soon, Zhou said Binance has seen institutional trading increase some 40 percent to 50 percent over the past six months.  According to Zhou, these institutional traders are leveraging Binance's application programming interface (API), heralding a new type of institution entering the space. These players wield less capital than, say, a typical tech-focused hedge fund, but they operate in a way that is “highly nimble, highly algorithm-driven and highly efficient,” he said.  This will characterize the new money entering institutional crypto trading, said Zhou, adding:  “I think right now, all the world is focused on what they call ‘old money’ – which is great, but I think the style of a lot of these institutions just don't move at crypto speed.”  In the context of crypto trading, algorithmic trading strategies interact directly with the technology of an exchange. Traders can develop their own applications, using programming languages like Python, and execute trades using the API.  “It’s basically my code fighting against your code fighting against another code – figuring out each one,” said Zhou.

In an April 5 court filing, Judge Jed Rakoff of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the case, explaining that the parties had informed the court they had reached a settlement.  However, both parties have the right to reopen the cause and proceed to trial within 30 days, or by May 5, ""if the settlement is not fully effectuated,"" the judge wrote.  The terms of the settlement are confidential, Brian Klein, Shrem's lawyer, told CoinDesk.  According to a separate filing by the attorney for the twins' Winklevoss Capital Fund (WCF), the plaintiff in the case, ""WCF and Shrem will each bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs. The case will not be reopened.""  In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Shrem said:  ""From day one, I’ve maintained the allegations are bogus, and they are of course. After their attorney was sanctioned and they were ordered to pay my legal fees twice, we recently reached a confidential resolution, and I’m dismissed from the case. I’m thankful for Brian Klein and my legal team and pleased to have this behind me.""  Early days  The Winklevoss brothers had alleged, in their case filed in September of last year, that back in 2012 Shrem had accepted a total of $1 million to buy bitcoin on their behalf and later realized that Shrem had not given them the full value of the amount in bitcoin.  They claimed to be short by roughly 5,000 bitcoin, worth about $26 million at today’s prices.  At the time of the deal in 2012, one bitcoin was worth approximately $12.50.  Before the settlement was reached, Shrem had sought to depose the Winklevosses' attorney, Tyler Meade.  CoinDesk will update this article as more details are obtained.

Chen, who is currently also HTC's decentralized chief officer, said that fund will “work closely with HTC to define the standards and interactions for this new internet and bring mobile and hardware know-how for our portfolio companies.”  The fund’s other investors include YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, former chief risk officer at Ripple Greg Kidd and Taiwanese chemical firm Formosa Plastics. Advisors include Kidd, Howard Wu of zcash and Dominic Williams of Dfinity, among others, according to the announcement.

42430426,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWph,1555506059,Bolt Labs Raises $1.5 Million Seed Round to Boost Lightning Privacy,"Academic researcher Dr. Ayo Akinyele is working on a cryptographic solution to boost privacy across second-layer blockchain solutions like the lightning network for bitcoin.  Akinyele just announced the formation of Bolt Labs, named after the BOLT protocol that aims to give lightning hubs shielded addresses for anonymous payment channels. The startup is launching with a $1.5 million seed round led by Dekrypt Capital and support from Ripple’s investment arm, Xpring, plus Lemniscap and Access Ventures.  Furthermore, Electronic Coin Company CEO Zooko Wilcox is advising Bolt Labs and helping the startup create its first proof-of-concept this summer for the privacy coin zcash, which doesn’t use lightning like bitcoin.  “Ultimately, interoperability is the goal,” Akinyele told CoinDesk about why the startup is working on compatibility for both bitcoin and cryptocurrencies without comparable scaling solutions. “Our design is independent of the underlying currency.”  Stepping back, BOLT is still an experimental software idea that theoretically applies directly to the cryptocurrency node, which communicates payment information to the broader network. Whether the software is integrated directly into a Layer 2 node like a lightning client or a Layer 1 node like zcash’s, the intention is always to protect information about the account, including who sends payments to it and how much the channel holds.  “The initial balance of the channel is hidden,” Akinyele said. “And now when you make a payment from this channel no one can link you to that payment unless you disclose the information.”  Dekrypt Capital co-founder Howard Wu told CoinDesk these types of features will be essential for cryptocurrency payments to spread without proliferating surveillance capitalism, a term coined by sociologist Shoshana Zuboff in 2014 to describe omnipresent surveillance and data collection online.  “A lot of credit card companies today, and advertising companies, acquire data from outlets like Best Buy or Overstock and sell this data to traders or other companies,” Wu said.  Referring to compliance requirements such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which prohibits companies from immutably storing some types of personal data, he added:  “We see that as being a risk, fundamentally, to privacy and compliance. Being able to have shopping sites integrate wallets [with BOLT] in the future would absolutely be interesting for helping to protect users.”  Dekrypt Capital co-founder Jon Allen also said that cryptocurrencies will only reach their decentralized potential for empowering individuals if there are options to spend crypto in ways that are closer to cash, without names and addresses.  “We also need a private, money-like currency,” Allen said.  Speaking to why Xpring invested in Bolt Labs, a Ripple spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “We're believers that the combination of Layer 2 solutions like Bolt and interoperability technologies like Interledger will improve the experience for both developers and end users, thereby paving the path for the mass adoption of crypto.""  Baby steps  Akinyele told CoinDesk there’s still a long way to go before the first BOLT mainnet experiment launches later this year.  “I would liken [BOLT] to infrastructure that makes it possible to have instant, cheap and private payments for everyday purchases,” he said.  Lightning Labs engineer Alex Bosworth, who is partially responsible for the LND implementation Akinyele is modeling BOLT after, told CoinDesk that more privacy features are already being built into lightning itself.  “We’ll try to make private channels less identifiable,” Bosworth said. “We’re going to change it so that a two-of-two multisig on-chain looks like a single multisig, just like a normal spend. That will use more of a cryptography solution.”  This strategy of making payment hubs look like normal wallets, obscuring the individual payments that pass through them, will also use a cryptographic solution. Only time will tell how BOLT’s cryptographic solution will fit in with these lightning updates.  In the meantime, the nonprofit Zcash Foundation, separate from Wilcox’s startup, gave Akinyele more than $40,000 worth of grants in 2018 as the researcher geared up to launch Bolt Labs. Bolt Labs eventually plans to generate revenue by offering services to institutions involved in activities like over-the-counter trading, that require both significant scale and discretion.  Comparing the potential of BOLT-enhanced nodes to standalone lightning nodes, Zcash Foundation executive director Josh Cincinnati told CoinDesk:  “BOLT's approach potentially offers more privacy and similar scalability characteristics that we think are worth researching and exploring.”  Lightning image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/17/bolt-labs-raises-15-million-seed-round-to-boost-lightning-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bcb5b0ddf88237230b5e9733cd9d9c416556a3c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430409,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWZh,1555506058,"Microsoft, Ethereum Group Launch Token-Building Kit for Enterprises","The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) and Microsoft have corralled the major blockchain providers behind a new project to help businesses design and create the right sort of crypto tokens for their particular needs.  The EEA, which is focused on creating standards and specifications for business users interacting with ethereum technology, stressed it is merely the host for the so-called “Token Taxonomy Initiative,” an entirely catholic and technology-neutral project which crosses ethereum, Hyperledger, R3's Corda and Digital Asset’s DAML.  Announced Wednesday, members of the Token Taxonomy Initiative include Accenture, Banco Santander, Blockchain Research Institute, Clearmatics, ConsenSys, Digital Asset, EY, IBM, ING, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Komgo, Microsoft, R3, and Web3 Labs, among others.  EEA executive director Ron Resnick explained that in essence, this is a composition framework which is open and accessible to technologists and non-technologists alike. It will comprise workshops as well as a GitHub repository where findings and test data can be linked to existing token implementations on various blockchain networks, said Resnick, adding:  “We are doing this for the greater common good. Standardizing tokens across all networks could hold the key to one of the greatest economic opportunities in modern history.”  Marley Gray, principal architect at Microsoft, who came up with the idea, explained the inspiration for it arrived from two directions.  On the one hand, Gray said his team ended up fielding lots of questions from internal businesses at Microsoft, keen to explore how software licenses (traditionally complex holographic product IDs that you have to register) could be tokenized and imported into smart contracts.  At the same time, through his involvement with the blockchain activities of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and the EEA, Gray said he was often in touch with various industry consortia who were spending a lot of time trying to work out how best to tokenize a barrel of oil, for example.  Gray said his team would have many rather repetitive conversations trying to describe tokens and the particular properties desired by users – “we would use analogies like airline tickets a lot” – and how these requirements relate to existing blockchain platforms.  As such, a kind of hierarchy of characteristics and behaviors was established: fungible and non-fungible; transferable and non-transferable; subdividable and non-subdividable; mintable and burnable, and so on.  Gray told CoinDesk:  “The idea is to use a workshop with business people to describe a token completely that services their business requirements. That token itself is composed of reusable components so another group can use those same components to define a slightly different token without redefining all the things that initial group did – so it creates this framework.”  Drag and drop  In practical terms, Gray said a business user or consortium can “grab a non-fungible token and drag it over and then start from a pallet of behaviors, drag those behaviors,"" as they would drag an icon on a screen.  The result, he said, is that a business person can create a token visually using a design tool that does not involve writing any code whatsoever, and allows them to then say to developers, ""I want one of these.""  In addition, Gray said his team has been exploring ways to use GitHub so that these certain business requirements can be matched to stored metadata and “mapped” to specific blockchain implementations.  “An individual [token] behavior could point to a snippet of code for a particular platform, i.e. DAML for some particular behavior would link me to a particular piece of DAML code, or the same for Solidity, or Chaincode.”  Judging from the cross-blockchain support the idea is getting, others in the space have also been having repeated conversations trying to define tokens.  For instance, Oli Harris, head of Quorum at J.P. Morgan, said in a statement: “With this significant step, the industry leaders – from the world’s largest companies and innovative startups – are coming together to define tokenization in ways designed to address the needs of the global enterprise community.”  Meanwhile, R3 co-founder and token tsar Todd McDonald added: “The initiative represents a new and innovative way for the industry to collaborate on defining a token taxonomy that is appropriate for any enterprise-grade blockchain technology.”  Reiterating the need to remain network-agnostic, Gray concluded:  “We prefer people to go into the workshop not even thinking about whether it's ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric or Corda or DA. In fact, we tell people when using the framework is to leave the technology baggage at the door.”  Microsoft image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/04/17/microsoft-ethereum-group-launch-token-building-kit-for-enterprises,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/724e9ef986a96fbcfd77340fe41b24d817e4a0ea-1500x851.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430404,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPrh,1555499438,Bitcoin Eyes April Price Gains for Fourth Year Running,"View  Bitcoin appears on track to end April on a positive note for the fourth consecutive year. The cryptocurrency is currently up 27 percent on a month-to-date basis.  Increasing that monthly gain look unlikely, as the bulls will likely have a hard time forcing a convincing break above multiple resistance levels lined up in $5,200–$5,300 range.  Prices may fall back below $5,100 in the next few hours, as the hourly chart relative strength index (RSI) has diverged in favor of the bears.  Bitcoin (BTC) looks set to end April in the green for the fourth consecutive year, having confirmed a longer-term bull breakout earlier this month.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $5,200 on Bitstamp, representing a 27 percent gain on the month's opening price of $4,092. BTC previously rallied 8, 26, and 33 percent in the fourth month of 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.  The sharp rise seen this month seems to have put the bulls in a commanding position for a long haul. The cryptocurrency has violated the most basic of all bearish technical patterns – the lower highs, lower lows – with a convincing move above $4,236.  Prices have also found acceptance above the 200-day moving average (MA), currently at $4,520, for the first time since March 2018, a sign of a bull market.  These gains look sustainable, too, courtesy of a sharp rise in trading volumes. For instance, 24-hour trading volume across all exchanges jumped to a 15-month high of $22.89 billion on April 3 – the day BTC solidified the bull breakout with a move above $5,000.  As a result, a drop all the way back to the monthly opening price of $4,092 on or before April 30 looks unlikely.  Bitcoin has posted April gains in five out of the last seven years.  The cryptocurrency gained 45 percent in the fourth month of 2013, its biggest April gain on record.  That record will likely stay intact, as BTC may have a tough time finding acceptance above multiple key resistance levels lined up above $5,200 in the short-run.  Monthly and weekly charts  As seen above (left), the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) served as strong support in five months to October 2018. Further, a downside break of the line in November was followed by a sell-off to lows near $3,100 by December.  As a result, the 21-month EMA, currently at $5,237, is the level to beat for the bulls. Forcing a break higher, however, could be a tough task with short-term technical indicators reporting overbought conditions.  Other bearish technical lines located near the 21-month EMA could also keep the gains under check. For instance, the descending (still bearish) 10-month and 50-week MAs are located at $5,180 and $5,546, respectively. While the three-day chart's 100-candle MA, currently at $5,239, is also proving a tough nut to crack, as discussed yesterday.  Usually, such a strong band of key resistance lines is breached after multiple attempts. So, the probability of BTC extending gains before the month end appears low.  In fact, the cryptocurrency may end the current month with lesser gains if the price finds acceptance below the crucial support at $4,912.  Weekly chart  BTC closed at $5,190 on April 3, confirming a falling channel breakout on the weekly chart. A similar looking pattern in 2015 paved way for a three-year bull run.  So far, however, the follow-through to that longer-term bullish breakout has been discouraging.  Notably, the cryptocurrency witnessed two-way business last week before ending on a flat note. The resulting doji candle is indicative of indecision among the bulls.  That buyer exhaustion would gain credence, inviting stronger selling pressure, if the cryptocurrency closes (UTC) below $4,912 (doji’s low) this Sunday. A bearish close, if confirmed, could yield a deeper pullback to levels below $4,600.  As for today, BTC may fall back to levels below $5,100, according to shorter-duration technical charts.  Hourly chart  An hourly close below the channel support, currently at $5,200 would validate the bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) and fuel a drop to $5,100 and below.  The bearish divergence of the RSI would be invalidated if the price finds acceptance above the upper edge of the channel, currently at $5,250.

The product is aimed to streamline Generali’s Employee Benefits Network offerings, including insurance cover for life, disability, accident and healthcare, the two firms jointly announced Tuesday. Through smart contracts and automated reconciliation, the system allows participants in the reinsurance process to share accurate data and reduce processing errors.  Using blockchain technology allows the firms to streamline ""complex"" manual processes within insurance, said Daniele Presutti, Accenture’s insurance practice lead in Europe.  The rollout comes after the firms conducted a trial of the solution last year. The effort saw participation from agriculture firm Syngenta and local insurers in Spain, Switzerland and Serbia.  “The prototype demonstrated significant results – lowering costs, saving time and improving data quality for all stakeholders,” according to the announcement.  Generali Employee Benefits CEO, Sergio Di Caro, said:  “The use of blockchain technology allows for a truly connected ecosystem and a seamless partnership between clients, advisers, local insurers and Generali. Blockchain will change not only our network but the employee benefits industry as we know it.”  Generali Group started experimenting with blockchain in 2017 when it joined B3i, an insurance industry blockchain group set up to test the potential of the technology.  As far back as 2016, Accenture’s Abizer Rangwala, who focuses on insurance IT strategy for the firm as a managing director, said that he expects blockchain technology to have a “profound effect on business” in the insurance industry.

The investment came via the bank's venture capital unit, MUFG Innovation Partners, Chainalysis said Tuesday. The round also saw participation from Tokyo-based investment firm Sozo Ventures.  The additional funding means Chainalysis’ total for its Series B round now sits at $36 million. It raised $30 million back in February, in an initial round led by venture capital firm Accel Partners.  With the additional investment, Chainalysis said it aims to expand its Asia-Pacific business and open a new office to assist that effort.  The startup said it has already significantly grown its business in the region, claiming to have more than doubled client numbers and increased contracted revenue by “more than 16x” last year.  “Chainalysis plans to build on this momentum with a physical presence and deeper engagements with entities including Sozo and MUFG, who will provide critical market insights,” the firm said.  In April 2018, Chainalysis raised $16 million in Series A investment from Benchmark Capital, and launched a cryptocurrency compliance tool, called Chainalysis KYT (for ""know your transaction”), which it says provides transaction analysis in real time.  MUFG Innovation Partners CEO and president, Nobutake Suzuki, said in yesterday's announcement:  “Chainalysis’s compliance technology is important to providing the insight and anti-money laundering controls banks need in order to establish next generation compliance frameworks.”  Founded in 2014, Chainalysis notably helped investigations in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case, in the attempt to locate the collapsed exchange's missing bitcoin.  Last week, the startup published a public comment letter in response to a draft recommendation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), saying that it is unrealistic and harmful for the crypto industry to expect exchanges to send know-your-customer (KYC) information to recipient platforms with every transaction.

42430393,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPZh,1555488039,Gemini Is Now the Largest Bitcoin Exchange to Add 'Full' SegWit Support,"Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced Monday that it has added ""full"" support for segregated witness (SegWit), an important bitcoin code change that paves the way for scaling improvements.  While many bitcoin companies have adopted SegWit to some degree, Gemini is unique in it's the largest bitcoin exchange thus far to roll out support for ""native SegWit addresses,"" a newer type of bitcoin address which helps to scale the cryptocurrency even further but has been adopted to a lesser degree.  Gemini head of communications Carolyn Vadino told CoinDesk:  ""Our choice to use native SegWit addresses was based on many factors including block space savings as well as safety concerns. As SegWit's use, support, and adoption grows, it will help reduce fees, wait times, and network congestion.""  As helpful a change SegWit is for boosting how many transactions bitcoin can support at once, each individual wallet and exchange needs to individually code up support for the new type of transaction. And adding native SegWit addresses takes a bit more time -- hence why the change hasn't been rolled out everywhere.  But Gemini – perhaps best-known for being led by entrepreneur-brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – is eager to adopt the technology in part because it enables lightning, a ""layer-two"" technology seen by advocates as the future of bitcoin payments.  ""SegWit transactions also lay the groundwork for more advanced technologies; of which the lightning network is the most well known,"" Vadino explains.  Gemini admits, though, it still might take a while for the ecosystem to fully adopt the change.  ""We think it’s the right time to make this change, though there will still be some growing pains,"" wrote Gemini software engineer Brian KimJohnson in a blog post that announced the change.

42430388,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPRh,1555473635,Gate.io Raises $64 Million for Launch of New Exchange Cryptocurrency,"Crypto exchange Gate.io has raised $64 million worth of crypto assets in seven days for its own exchange cryptocurrency that won’t be launched on a blockchain for at least six months.  One of the oldest Chinese exchanges, Gate.io claimed on Monday that over the last week it was heavily oversubscribed with orders totaling $2.99 billion for the so-called Gate Points, which can be used for offsetting trading fees on the platform.  Moreover, each Gate Point further entitles a holder to receive 2.5 Gate Tokens (GT), the native cryptocurrency of Gatechain, the exchange’s yet-to-be-launched proprietary blockchain. Gate.io says it expects the network to go live in the fourth quarter.  According to a blog post published on April 1, the first phase of the Gate Points sale started on April 8 and lasted for seven days. As Gate’s fees are paid in tether (USDT), the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, one Gate Point is worth 1 USDT in reduced fees. The points were purchasable with bitcoin, tether, ether, EOS, or the tokens of rival exchanges Binance (BNB) or Huobi (HT).  Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer of Gate.io, told CoinDesk in an interview that the exchange distributed 150 million GTs to successful Gate Point subscribers during the first phase, and in return, collected $64 million as prepaid trading fees. (The initial reward ratio of 1 Gate Point for 2.5 GT depreciated by three percent every day during the first phase.)  Gate.io was founded in 2013 under the name Bter.com by CEO Lin Han. It suffered a hack in 2015, which resulted in loss of some 7,000 bitcoin from its cold wallets.  Following the Chinese central bank’s ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and fiat-to-crypto spot trading in 2017, Bter.com closed its domain, rebranded to Gate.io and dropped fiat trading. The exchange shifted its focus to crypto-to-crypto and Chinese yuan over-the-counter (OTC) trading.  IEO bandwagon  Issuing an exchange token with a trading fee point system rather than a conventional ICO is not unprecedented, as Huobi also issued its Huobi Tokens (HT) in a similar fashion in early 2017. Binance, on the other hand, sold its exchange tokens BNB through a traditional ICO while BNB can also be used to offset trading fees.  But Gate.io’s plan comes at a time when exchange tokens are seeing notable growth in the crypto markets partially due to the emergence of initial exchange offerings (IEOs), which have gained traction on major platforms such as Binance and Huobi.  In fact, Tatibouet said Gate.io will announce a plan on Wednesday to launch its own IEO platform, similar to Binance’s LaunchPad.  She further claimed that on April 8, the day the Gate Points sales began, about $155 million worth of tethers were deposited to the platform’s USDT wallets overall.  Weirong Chen, an analyst from Beijing-based blockchain data analytics startup TokenInsight, said the recent price surge of exchange tokens has bolstered retail traders’ enthusiasm for the area.  She told CoinDesk:  “The demand is indeed correlated with the overall market condition, when exchange tokens have jumped by 150 percent in Q1. Thus retail investors’ anticipation for these tokens to yield a high rate of return is still positive.”  Such interest appears to have also caused an influx of USDT to Gate.io from rival exchanges such as OKEx and Huobi. The resulting scarcity of tethers on those exchanges drove up the stablecoin’s price to an average 3 percent premium over par value when Gate’s sale began.  For instance, for 1 USDT, the bid and ask orders among OKEx’s OTC market makers on April 8 centered around 6.95 Chinese yuan, or $1.03, while some even posted ask prices as high as $1.14 per coin.  Yet Chen said multiple reasons led to the price premium for USDT among Chinese traders, including the demand for Gate’s exchange tokens with a high expectation of return, but also bitcoin’s bull run on April 2.  Tradable promises  But, despite such seemingly high buying interest, it’s important to note that for the time being GT is at best a tradable sign or liability.  Because unlike Huobi’s HT or Binance’s BNB, which were issued as ERC-20 based tokens on the ethereum network at the time when they were sold, GT is not yet issued on any public blockchain with a verifiable contract address.  Based on Gate.io’s announcement, the exchange plans to issue a total of 1 billion GTs, 50 percent of which would be reserved and locked up for a year for research and development as well as marketing efforts.  Another 300 million would be allocated to users who subscribe to the exchange’s trading points, half of which were distributed last week.  Gate.io said trading of GT will be enabled at the end of April but deposit and withdrawal won’t be available until the launch of Gatechain.  As such, Tatibouet acknowledged that for the time being, there are no other ways to track and verify the movements of any GTs, including those that are said to be locked up.  “There will be proof on how this is issued, since not every technical detail has been worked out now,” she said.  Meantime, Gate.io has started the second phase of the Gate Point sales lasting for a week for users who have been on the platform for over a certain period of time. The exchange aims to raise another $23 million in prepaid trading fees this week.  “The trading of GT [for now] will be more like trading credit points that’s entirely closed,” Chen of TokenInsight said, concluding:  “Indeed, investors can’t see how much is really being issued or how much is circulating at the moment – that’s one risk factor.”  Bitcoin and U.S. dollar image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | GT | TOKEN SALE,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/17/gateio-raises-64-million-for-launch-of-new-exchange-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bdf749960a0a062087ecadd847898c34831a657-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
