42398743,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUY8,1444858151,Chainalysis: Barclays Deal is Start of Banks Opening Up to Bitcoin,"It's an open secret that companies working with bitcoin funds have long faced challenges gaining access to banking services.  Though few are forthcoming about this business reality, the difficulties have affected startups around the globe – from the US to India and Argentina – resulting in business interruptions and attempts by industry firms to solve the problem through innovation.  A new partnership between compliance startup Chainalysis and UK financial services giant Barclays, however, could hold the keys to reversing this trend. Announced yesterday at an event celebrating the graduation of 11 startups in the most recent TechStars FinTech accelerator, the deal is an attempt by Barclays to arm its financial crime and transaction monitoring teams with the skills needed to onboard bitcoin clients.  In interview, Chainalysis co-founder and chief revenue officer (CRO) Jonathan Levin framed the deal as one that will help mark the first time that a major bank with clearing ability would be able to publicly open its business to bitcoin and blockchain industry clients.  Levin told CoinDesk:  ""Barclays had a blanket no rule [for working with bitcoin companies], as do most of the banks in the UK. We're working with the compliance division to bring things into place so they can transact with companies in that space.""  Levin said that Barclays will not be accepting bitcoin funds directly, but rather seeking to use the partnership as a way to capture the first-mover advantage inherent in marketing a bitcoin-friendly fiat banking service, while also bolstering the abilities of their tech team.  ""It's a recognition that financial crimes divisions haven't seen that much innovation, to make it a competitive advantage by saying that they have a compliance department that can handle the latest trends in technology,"" he said.  Along with the deal, Chainalysis received an undisclosed amount of funding from startup accelerator TechStars in exchange for 6% equity and participation in the 13-week program. The company has said it plans to relocate to New York following the news.  Founded by former members of bitcoin exchange Kraken and bitcoin wallet provider Mycelium, Chainalysis offers web-based compliance tools alongside an API for transaction-based risk scoring and Reactor, a product it bills as an ""enhanced due diligence and investigation tool"".  Defining thresholds  Thought its products have proved controversial among more privacy-conscious bitcoin users, Levin framed Chainalysis's work as necessary to helping Barclays determine how industry startups can best meet bank-level compliance standards.  In this light, Levin indicated that the biggest challenge faced by institutions like Barclays isn't an inherent aversion to bitcoin as a payment method, but rather a lack of understanding about how the due diligence it needs to perform on these customers should be conducted.  Levin said that all payment methods have separate standards for different forms of value, comparing the transition as akin to defining best practices and thresholds for cash.  ""Even cash has limits,"" Levin remarked. ""If you're a bank, accepting cash that smells of marijuana is illegal under the law. You need to file a suspicious activity report (SAR), which is the case in places like Colorado. You can't walk into a bank branch and just deposit that cash into a bank account.""  Here, Levin said, bitcoin has an advantage as there's a level of transparency the blockchain brings that, when paired with certain services, is sufficient to help banks ensure they aren't establishing relationships with firms conducting illegal activities.  ""Everyone's going to have been exposed to crime, but it's about limiting abuse in the system,"" Levin continued.  Business understanding  This isn't to say Barclays is looking to develop a one-size-fits-all approach to banking bitcoin clients, as Levin indicated it also needs help identifying the kinds of industry companies that pose a risk from a regulatory perspective.  For example, he noted that most compliance teams at major banks aren't yet able to differentiate between companies that purely provide software, and those that custody customer funds directly.  ""Banks haven't been able to understand the nuance of different business models in the space. People within the bank will now have that domain expertise to say this is a software business, this is not a money transmitter, this is something that is very important in developing that domain expertise,"" he said.  Though a time-intensive investment for Barclays, he framed the task as one that's in line with recent developments in financial innovation.  ""This is a big trend, where cybersecurity and money laundering will be going hand in hand in the future,"" he remarked.  Standard deal  Levin further said that, while a big-name client for his startup, the company's relationship with Barclays would not be substantially different than those with other firms.  Chainalysis, he said, would not be consulting Barclays on its product use, nor would it be allocating daily resources to the effort.  ""There are some elements that we have built specifically to suit their needs, but fundamentally, we're a product company,"" he said.  Speaking to the abilities of the firm's technology, he indicated he believes the products will help Barclays ""know what bitcoin is down to the wallet implementation"".  Ultimately, however, he positioned the process of bringing bitcoin firms into the banking community as one that will take more than a single partnership, concluding:  ""What is the right level of compliance? We're working that out. Having a relationship with banks and regulators is key, so you can develop a standard of what's possible and put into practice what's possible.""

42398739,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUUC,1444845915,Blockchain Project Factom Raises $400k at $11 Million Valuation,"Factom Inc, the for-profit entity seeking to facilitate commercial business conducted on blockchain recordkeeping project Factom, has raised $400,000 in new seed funding.  The investment was provided by Kuala Innovations, which purchased a 3.64% stake in the company for 400,000 Seed Series Shares at $1 per share. According to a statement by Kuala, the investment gives Factom Inc a pre-money valuation of $11m.  In statements, Kuala co-chairman Jim Mellon stated that he believes Factom has the potential to ""revolutionize"" how companies process and store data, thereby solving ""real commercial issues"" facing enterprise businesses.  Mellon said:  ""With growing sales, a wide developer network integrating additional applications, and a pipeline of large client wins expected over the next 12 months, the board believes this seed round investment by Kuala comes ahead of a significant value shift for Factom when it completes its anticipated Series A funding in the first half of 2016.""  The release finds Factom using language that positions its 2015 crowdsale as one that resulted in the sale of $1.2m in software licenses distributed in the form of native tokens (Factoids) on the Factom blockchain. Factom launched its crowdsale in April, ultimately selling 2,278 BTC (roughly $540,000 at the time) in Factoid tokens to users.  Project representatives have stated that further token sales were made in sales to private investors, for a total of 1,500 purchases. Factom Inc, which operates separately from the Factom Foundation which oversees development, raised $1.1m in an equity crowdsale in July.  The investment is the second made by Kuala in the bitcoin and blockchain sector, following a December decision to provide bitcoin micropayments startup SatoshiPay with €160,000 ($183,000) in funding.  Blockchain investment firm Coinsillium, which counts Factom Inc among its portfolio companies, reported it facilitated the deal.

The UK regulator – which oversees more than 70,000 businesses in the financial industry – issued a public warning against Cryptoconomist Limited, registered to a London address, on its website earlier today.  In the warning  , the FCA said it believed the trading website had been providing ""financial services or products in the UK"" without its authorisation. ""Almost all firms and individuals offering, promoting or selling financial services or products in the UK have to be authorised by us,"" it explained.  When checking the Financial Services Register – a list of companies and individuals regulated by the FCA – CoinDesk found that Cryptoconomist Limited was listed as ""unauthorised"".  The search result brought up the following message:  ""This is a firm that we have been told is either operating regulated activities without the correct authorisation, or is running a scam. We strongly suggest you avoid dealing with unauthorised firms like this.""  According to its website  , Cryptoconomist, allegedly in-market since 2013, offers traders the opportunity to ""earn a good surplus"" on their cryptocurrency investment through a referral program which promises payouts of 4% and 1.5% for first line and second line referrals respectively.  A due diligence check lists Eller Otte as the company's director and secretary. Otte has no other apparent previous employment history online.

42426553,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZFh,1444823896,"Bitreserve Overhauls Platform, Rebrands as 'Uphold'","Bitreserve has today unveiled a major overhaul of its platform and a new name: Uphold, Inc.  As part of the rebrand, the startup – created last year by CNET founder Halsey Minor and currently led by former Nike CIO Anthony Watson – will allow users to link bank accounts and make deposits using credit cards, in addition to bitcoin.  European users from 33 countries will have access to the bank account deposit options, with the service set to roll out for customers in the US, China and India in the coming weeks.  The company’s overhaul includes a new logo and the rebranding of its open API. Uphold is also planning to release a series of physical and digital payment cards tied to user accounts.  Bitcoin pivot?  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Watson denied that the company was pivoting away from bitcoin, though he did offer a critique of the digital currency, pointing to market speculation and concentration of holdings among a relatively small number of individuals as weaknesses.  He framed the rebrand as both a response to member demand for additional services and an expansion of its previous efforts to promote low-cost transacting and transparency.  ""A lot of our members have been asking for us to open up our platform to not just to virtual currencies but all kinds of money transactions and commodity transactions. So, as of October 14th, we’re launching and taking away the dependency on bitcoin for our members.""  Watson said the company remains committed to cryptocurrencies, adding that Uphold was looking to add support for others beyond bitcoin.  Fees apply  The company has also reworked its membership structure as well as its fee structure. Uphold doesn’t charge for deposits made using bitcoin or bank transfers, though it does levy a 2.75% fee if a credit or debit card is used.  Verified users can conduct member-to-member transfers and currency conversions at no charge, though some fees apply to precious metal conversions. User withdrawals past 60 BTC, £8,000 or €10,500 annually will include a fee of 0.5%.  Uphold said it is cutting withdrawal fees entirely for charities, non-profits and non-government organizations (NGOs). Credit and debit card deposits would still incur the 2.75% fee.  In a new blog post outlining the platform changes, Watson elaborated on the name change, writing that it ""represents our commitment to consumer protection and true transparent financial services accountability"".  He continued:  ""In a word, Uphold embodies our core values and is the best way we can describe our bold vision of providing accessible, equitable, free and fair financial services to everyone, everywhere - secure in the cloud, real-time on any device.""",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/14/bitreserve-overhauls-platform-rebrands-as-uphold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cd7ab97074bff30dcd97a139ec2145bb441b6cd-1460x626.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426567,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZbh,1444819257,Peruvian Presidential Campaign Pursuing Blockchain Solutions,"A political party in Peru is looking to make the blockchain a part of its presidential campaign platform.  Perú Posible  , a centre-leaning party led by former president Alejando Toledo, is gearing up for the upcoming presidential election set to take place next April. Hillmer Reyes, a policy director for Toledo’s campaign and a member of the party’s national committee, told Peruvian newspaper El Comercio the party would propose using the blockchain to help ease societal issues and combat corruption.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Reyes expanded on the initiative, outlining how a formal policy proposal is being drafted amid the run-up to the election. He framed it as part of a broader focus on technology's role in improving government services.  He said the party had been looking at the technology for months, considering both bitcoin and Ethereum, explaining:  “This is something that’s new. It’s still developing. But we want to start trying some of these things, and in the long run, if things go well, these things will increase in presence in the judicial system, land registry, political party system, and government itself for providing additional transparency and, really, to help make decision making a more decentralized process, to avoid corruption.”  Reyes pointed to the technology as a potential solution to what he called social conflicts arising from disputes over agreements. Reyes, who wrote about the issue in a May blog post, suggested smart contracts could help enforce agreements that become disputed.  He also pointed to the use of smart contracts to enforce elements of public policy that might otherwise fall victim to corruption.  “We see these smart contracts as a way to enable automatic execution of some of these policies that are written in black and white, but because there are political agendas, they don’t get implemented,” he said.  Next steps include continued debate within the campaign as its proposal is developed and reaching out to those in the field and beyond for input. Reyes said further details would be released sometime later this year.
