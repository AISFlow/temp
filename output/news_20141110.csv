42426158,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQZh,1415653208,Russia Lowers Proposed Penalties For Bitcoin Activities,"Russia’s Ministry of Finance has reduced the proposed fines both individual and institutional bitcoin users would potentially face for creating, issuing or promoting digital currencies under a draft bill that seeks to outlaw the use of so-called ""money surrogates"" like bitcoin.  The updated bill decreases penalties for individuals, who under the latest version would only incur a maximum 50,000 ruble fine (roughly $1,050), down from 60,000 rubles ($1,314) in the previous iteration.  Under the new terms  , individuals who disseminate money substitutes directly could be fined 20,000–40,000 rubles (about $431–$862), down from 30,000–50,000 rubles ($646–$1,078) in the original proposal. Further, those who disseminate information about money substitutes face fines of 5,000–30,000 rubles ($107–$646), reduced from 5,000–50,000 rubles ($$107–$1,078)).  Speaking to CoinDesk, Artem Tolkachev, managing partner at the law firm Tolkachev & Partners, suggested that he believes this could be an early signal that the proposed law will not be as strict as some had feared.  Tolkachev noted that the latest revisions come despite the fact that lawmakers have yet to take into account public input on the bill, saying:  “None of arguments expressed in public discussion has been taken into account by the lawmakers. That is why we cannot see any positive changes in attitude of the Ministry of Finance toward bitcoin and other digital currencies.”  Still, he cautioned that any optimism must be tempered as “the conceptual framework of the bill has remained the same”.  Fines for officials decline  The maximum fines officials and legal entities face under the proposal has also been reduced.  Specifically, fines for officials involved in the dissemination of information related to monetary surrogates have been dropped from 100,000 rubles to 50,000 rubles ($2,156 to $1,078), while those for legal entities have decreased from 1m rubles ($21,563) to 300,000 rubles ($6,468).  Officials who disseminate digital currencies will now face a maximum fine of 80,000 rubles ($1,753), down from 100,000 rubles ($2,156). Legal entities now face a maximum fine of 500,000 rubles ($10,781) for this action, down from 1m rubles ($21,563).  Regulator lauds blockchain tech  The development comes at a time when public statements from Russian officials on bitcoin are growing increasingly positive.  CoinTelegraph recently sat down with Evgeny Volovik, head of Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service, which works to combat domestic money laundering and terrorist financing, much like FinCEN in the US.  In the interview  , Volovik spoke out against bitcoin specifically, suggesting that it is likely to have a limited future as a payment mechanism. However, he conceded that digital currencies can’t be banned due to their distributed nature, and acknowledged the potential applications for blockchain technology.  “I consider the bitcoin ecosystem as a prototype of a system that is undergoing rigorous testing from all sides,” Volovik said. “With experience and further innovation, I think it is very possible that the blockchain will have a very bright and promising future.”  Volovik went on to laud lawmakers for taking the time to assess public opinion on the matter as the government works toward a regulatory framework.  Community unmoved  Although the developments could be read positively, given previous statements from Russian regulators, members of the local bitcoin community were unmoved by the changes.  Ivan Tikhonov, founder of popular bitcoin security forum BTCsec, argued that the changes don’t go far enough given the public outcry over the proposal. He cited public comments on the proposed bill since the release of the full draft, which he characterized as being overwhelmingly negative, explaining:  “Of the 119 comments on the bill, none have been positive. There was one humorous comment, which was not an explicit criticism of the bill.”  Similarly, bitcoin blogger Yuri Filipov, who writes for Coinside.ru, marveled at the lack of changes in the latest version, while suggesting that the motives behind the alterations remain unclear.  “The fines were 60,000 rubles before and they’re 50,000 now. Why this was done, no one knows,"" he said.

42426153,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQRh,1415647518,Payments Giant NCR to Integrate Bitcoin into Small Business Service,"Global payments conglomerate NCR has announced that one of its merchant point-of-sale (POS) systems will soon offer bitcoin support.  The integration of bitcoin into the NCR Silver POS is expected to happen sometime before the end of this year. The system will also support mobile bitcoin wallet payments and will be a free service attached to its POS platform.  NCR  is one of the world’s largest payments companies. Founded in 1884 as a cash register maker, NCR offers a number of hardware and software solutions and reported more than $6bn in revenue in 2013.  In recent years, NCR has moved to take a broader share of the mobile payments space through strategic partnerships. Citing the evolving nature of digital payments, NCR indicated that it wanted to provide a greater degree of flexibility to its customers, which includes supporting technologies like bitcoin.  NCR Small Business director of business development Reggie Kimble suggested in a press statement that bitcoin is starting to make a bigger impact on the broader payments landscape, saying:  “Gone are the days when cash and cards were the only payment options available to customers shopping at small businesses. Offering bitcoin as a payment alternative allows small businesses the flexibility they need to better serve their growing number of customers who prefer digital payment solutions.”  The move brings bitcoin payments to users of NCR’s tablet-based Silver payments POS product, which targets small businesses and startups that have minimal infrastructure.  NCR sees future in mobile  Though whether NCR will pursue a broader integration of digital currency in the future remains to be seen, its support of bitcoin can be interpreted as part of a broader move to embrace mobile payments.  Over the past two years, the company has moved to position itself as a major player in the increasingly important space. This includes several integrations with its Silver POS product that take advantage of both new and established payment offerings.  In January 2013, NCR and PayPal inked a deal to integrate the two companies’ offerings, leveraging NCR’s hardware to connect merchants to PayPal’s payment channels. Merchants who currently use the NCR Silver POS can opt to use PayPal when accepting payments.  NCR has also taken steps in recent months to take advantage of the upswing in interest surrounding the Apple Pay payments service, which includes opening support for the service to NCR Silver customers.

42426169,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQvh,1415639822,"Crypto 2.0 Roundup: SEC Rumours, Swarm's Payday and Ethereum's Expansion","While the crypto 2.0 sector of the digital currency industry is showing strong signs of maturity, it has also begun to attract its share of controversy.  Following their emergence in late October, rumours that major projects in the space could soon face additional scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have continued to persist into November.  For all the conversation surrounding the possibility, however, major publications have struggled to find evidence that any crypto 2.0 projects have received letters. At press time, however, at least one lesser-known investment project had reported being contacted.  That said, this week's developments prove that there is equally strong positive attention being paid to this sector of the community.  Techstars invests in Swarm  Seed-stage startup accelerator Techstars has announced an investment in Swarm, the decentralized crowdfunding platform that recently held its first demo day.  The Colorado-based investment fund will invest $118,000 in Swarm, with $18,000 paid upfront and another $100,000 to be paid as the project advances, according to founder Joel Dietz. This staggered payout aside, Dietz framed the funding as evidence of the appeal of crypto crowdfunding.  “Techstars decided that it really believed in cryptoequity and its future possibilities,” Dietz said, adding that the incubator had been persistent in its attempts to invest in Swarm.  “They really tracked us down and said we like what you’re doing, we’ve been looking at the space in particular and we haven’t really seen anything that was as compelling,” Dietz said.  Techstars, in turn, suggested it sees platforms like Swarm as a way to disrupt the traditional venture capital industry, by providing companies and projects with direct access to the retail investment market.  “We believe that Swarm's innovative fundraising model has the possibility of completely transforming the venture capital industry and we want to be the first movers in making this happen,"" Techstars CEO David Cohen said.  Dietz also responded to criticisms that the initial batch of Swarm projects – which included a decentralized dance party – were more silly than serious, suggesting it intends to be less formal until the regulatory picture for the project is more clear.  Ethereum’s talent grab  Ethereum, the decentralized publishing platform invented by bitcoin wunderkind Vitalik Buterin has been in relative stealth mode since raising an estimated $15m–$18m through a pre-sale of the network’s native token, ether, this September.  According to Ethereum COO Stephan Tual, however, much is happening behind the scenes as the growing project prepares for an early spring 2015 launch. Tual told CoinDesk that the recent funding has given Ethereum the necessary funds to increase its employee base as it grows its global operations.  Tual reported that Ethereum is conducting the majority of its hiring in Europe – Berlin, Amsterdam and London to be specific, the latter of which has seen the addition of at least four employees dedicated to its Mist browser, a decentralized app store.  London will be the base of the company’s outreach and communications, while Berlin will be focused on development for Whisper, Ethereum’s peer-to-peer messaging platform, and Swarm, its client file distribution network.  Tual, however, was quick to stress that the hirings may only be temporary owing to Ethereum's long-term goals.  “Now with the Ether sale, we’re in the position to hire a lot of people. Not necessarily for 10 years, but a couple of years, because ultimately we’re a not-for-profit organisation,” he said.  Elsewhere, Tual sought to stress that Ethereum is not a 'bitcoin 2.0' project, but rather one that is more broadly concerned with enabling decentralized applications through technology.  He said:  “We want to see everything from decentralized Airbnb to decentralized Uber to decentralized financial markets.”  The significance of sidechains  While the crypto 2.0 sector works toward its own particular future, the bitcoin ecosystem is advancing as well, most notably with the much-lauded sidechains white paper – a proposal funded in part by VC-funded Blockstream that could allow assets to be exchanged across multiple blockchains.  Although it has been branded as a concept that could have drastic implications for the altcoin market, members of crypto 2.0 sector sought to frame sidechains as a development that takes some inspiration from its own experiments, particularly the launch of Counterparty.  The crypto 2.0 project famously “burned” bitcoinshttp://www.minyanville.com/business-news/editors-pick/articles/The-People-Who-Burn-Bitcoins-bitcoin/4/16/2014/id/54627, destroying a certain set amount of bitcoin to create value for its native token, XCP.  DigitalTangible  founder Taariq Lewis told CoinDesk that the “beauty of sidechains” is that they allow project developers to 'freeze' bitcoin on the blockchain, thereby gaining the ability to store value as a way to create new tokens, while ensuring this value could be recoverable.  “With a sidechain. the difference would be that we could create XCP on a sidechain by pegging bitcoin to XCP and we would have this new XCP that would be its own currency, on its own chain,” Lewis explained.  Ethereum’s Tual called sidechains “a major plus” for bitcoin, but stressed that they don’t replace the ability crypto 2.0 platforms offer for users to create a whole ecosystem of new products including decentralized applications (Dapps) and decentralized autonomous organisations (DAOs).  “We have no problem with somebody creating a sidechain for Ethereum that will represent the value of Ether,” Tual said. “But, it won’t copy the ecosystem across, and I think that’s been the misunderstanding in the media lately.”  NXT’s Bas Wisselink noted that his community has been working toward a similar goal, and that it is close to launching its NXT Monetary System, which will allow developers to release coins on top of the NXT blockchain.  Others like Counterparty’s Adam Krellenstein and CoinSpark’s Gideon Greenspan were more critical of the idea, arguing that some key security questions surrounding sidechains have yet to be fully resolved.

42426170,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQth,1415627553,Markets Weekly: Bitcoin Rises Amid Dark Markets Crackdown,"The bitcoin price has risen in the last seven days after two weeks of declines. It gained $25 over the week to hit a high of $351.44 on 7th November and is trading well above that level today, at a high of $365.82.  The price increase has been accompanied by a rise in trading volume, which increased 32% week-on-week to 2.61 million BTC. This rise in volume was led by activity on Huobi, OKCoin and BTC-e.  Although OKCoin reported this week that it would calculate its futures trading volume in a new way that would double its figures, this did not affect its volume numbers in its market for spot BTC prices, it said. Read more on this issue below.  The markets like dark web busts  This week's big news came courtesy of the long arm of the law, as agencies on two continents swept through the dark web, seizing a number of markets trading in illicit goods.  Code-named 'Operation Onymous', the FBI, the European Union intelligence agency Europol, and a number of other agencies worked to arrest at least 17 individuals, shut down Silk Road 2.0 and other dark markets, and seized hundreds of Tor hidden services in raids across 18 countries. Bitcoin, of course, is the de facto currency of the global dark markets.  Where did the price of bitcoin go? Perhaps counterintuitively, it went up. The price closed down just 2% as word of Onymous got out on 7th November, then rebounded by closing up a point at $344.03. In other words, the bitcoin price was higher by about $3 after the market digested the impactful news.  Intra-day prices told much the same story. The price opened at $348.23 before the operation went public, dropped to a low of $340.19 the same day, then closed the following day up, at $344.03.  Operation Onymous, of course, comes almost exactly a year on from the FBI takedown of Silk Road, which took place on 2nd October, 2013. How did the bitcoin markets respond then?  The price had been trading in the $120s for weeks when the now infamous seizure notice appeared on Silk Road's Tor-hidden service. As one might expect, the price plunged, opening at $125.49 and hitting an intra-day low of $82. It closed 20% down on 2nd October compared to the day before.  Then something strange happened. Just as in the latest bust, the bitcoin price recovered. Last year, it rose by 17% the day after the Silk Road seizure was announced, closing at $116.32.  After the Silk Road rebound, the price began its historic rally, hitting a high of $1,147 in early December. Is the market saying it welcomes the intervention of lawmen on the dark web? Dare we hope for a repeat of a climb to those dizzying heights?  Controversial volume inflation  OKCoin took to Reddit last week to explain why its futures trading volumes had suddenly doubled. They hadn't, but the exchange was now counting each trade twice, leading to an inflated figure. The Chinese exchange justified the move by saying its competitors, Huobi and 796, were doing it too.  That may be the case, but such moves only serve to undermine bitcoin traders' perception of inflated trading volumes on the Chinese exchanges. This is despite the fact that OKCoin's spot-BTC trading volumes are not affected by the new double-counting method. The zero-fee model and automated trading mean that bitcoin investors often discount the volume figures reported by the Chinese exchanges.  One derivatives trader told CoinDesk:  ""I know the market is pretty sceptical in general of exchange-reported volumes, this is pretty damning proof.""  He was wrong about the damning proof, of course. He had misunderstood OKCoin's announcement, taking it to mean that it had been double-counting its spot-BTC trades all along.  His sentiment is real, however, and it's one shared by many market participants. It might be prudent for exchanges to open a new front in the battle for perception of liquidity, instead of inflating volume numbers meaninglessly.  Where are the transaction fees?  As a corollary to last week's Markets Weekly on the rising number of transactions, analyst Tim Swanson, who also works at altcoin exchange Melotic, contacted CoinDesk to highlight a few anomalies.  He pointed out that, even though the number of transactions appears to have risen, he couldn't detect a corresponding increase in transaction fees or bitcoin days destroyed. Indeed, the all-time transaction fees graph as reported by Blockchain.info, is pretty flat.  This could suggest that the increased transactions aren't in the service of any real exchange in value for goods and services, Swanson said.  ""Instead, it is likely a combination of advertisement spam, P2SH, mining payouts, mixing and Counterparty transactions,"" he said.  Swanson's guess is that transactions are rising because of non-commercial trades, meaning coin-mixing and various forms of 'blockchain 2.0' transactions.  If Swanson is right, it's hard to say how these transactions affect the bitcoin price, or what this development implies about the rate of bitcoin use and adoption in general. However, a blockchain at work is certainly a more positive signal than an idle one.  Disclaimer: This article should not be viewed as financial advice.

42377767,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73X3T,1415622625,Digital Currency Conference to Follow Australian G20 Leaders' Summit,"Industry lobby group the Australian Digital Currency Association (ADCCA) will host a special cryptocurrency-focused event that will overlap with the G20 Leaders' Summit taking place in Brisbane later this week.  Called the Global Digital Currency Conversation (GDCC), the forum will take place on 16th–17th November at the close of the Leaders' Summit, which is noted as the most important event on the G20's annual calendar.  The GDCC will feature speakers and panelists representing both the digital currency industry and government policymakers, including the chair of Australia's inquiry into digital currencies Senator Sam Dastyari, Perianne Boring of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), bitcoin legal academic Elizabeth Stark and former Central Bank of Ireland director Peter Oakes.  Engaging stakeholders  Australia has held the G20's rotating presidency since last December, a term that ends this month.  ADCCA  chairman Ron Tucker, who also heads local bitcoin exchange Bit Trade Australia, said that the conference gives Australia the opportunity to position itself as a world leader in the most formal discussion yet of digital currencies held worldwide.  He said:  ""With Australia chairing the G20 this year, there is no better time to engage with relevant stakeholders to make sure the digital currency industry can continue to grow and prosper at home and globally.""  The opportunity extended beyond just digital currencies and into the wider FinTech sector, Tucker said.  He explained that Australia's model, which blends self-regulation and government oversight, would appeal to the rest of the world and the GDCC forum would showcase what can be achieved if this model is applied to bitcoin and blockchain technology.  The international response to the conference has been good so far, he added, even in the short time since it was announced. There has been a lot of enthusiasm from similar lobby groups in other countries, such as the US. With bitcoin moving ""at the speed of light"" it was important for stakeholders to respond just as quickly.  ""It is my intention that this forum will serve as a springboard to another conference at the next G20 conference in Turkey where a global digital currency structure can be more formalised.""  International forum  The G20  , or Group of 20, brings together leaders from the world's 19 largest national economies, the European Union, and invited guest countries on a regular basis to discuss economic issues.  The group formed in 1999 as a response to the Asian financial crisis. It has since expanded beyond its original scope as a meeting of financial ministers and central bank governors to become a full-fledged international forum of its member countries' heads of government.  The ADCCA, which formed in mid-2014, has played an instrumental role in informing Australian government stakeholders on digital currency issues with seminars, calls for taxation clarity, and promoting the idea of a self-regulatory model for the industry.

42377772,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73X8V,1415618220,Asian Exchanges Adopt Controversial Counting Method For Futures Trades,"Trading volumes reported by exchanges in Asia became a talking point again over the past weekend, after some companies altered the way trades are counted on bitcoin futures markets.  The latest issue arose last week when OKCoin's manager of foreign operations Zane Tackett posted a thread on reddit's 'Bitcoin Markets' page, titled ""You might have noticed OKCoin futures volume experienced a sudden rise (doubled) over night, here's why"".  OKCoin  , Tackett wrote, had noticed competitors 796.com and BitVC (a subsidiary of Huobi) were employing a counting method that regards a single bitcoin traded as two units: one bought and one sold.  In doing so, OKCoin's 24-hour high volume that week leaped instantly from 300,000 BTC to 600,000 BTC. The company did not retroactively alter historic trading data before that date.  Industry standard?  Since other exchanges were employing this ""industry standard"", it made sense for OKCoin to do the same, he said, while revealing the information publicly in the interests of transparency.  Tackett made it clear, however, that OKCoin does not necessarily endorse this counting method and was simply following others so that comparisons could remain accurate.    ""We want to use the traditional method since that’s the method used in the traditional finance world. Furthermore, we will be switching back to the traditional method for all westerners, ie: our English page will report it using the traditional method, any western site that pulls our data will be provided with volume using the traditional method, and we will only use double counting for domestic purposes.""            At present the counting method is employed only on digital currency derivatives exchanges, while the companies' spot markets retain the traditional method of 1 BTC traded = 1 BTC in volume.  Futures market method  Responses to OKCoin's Reddit disclosure were mixed. While some praised the company for publicly stating the change, others questioned whether counting trades this way should be regarded as an industry standard.  Huobi's Robert Kuhne told CoinDesk the counting method comes from futures markets outside the cryptocurrency world (links in Chinese language), explaining:  ""Whether each 1 BTC transacted should be counted as two for the calculation of cumulative futures trading volume is not something we can say. However, this is also the method of cumulative volume calculation used by Chinese commodity futures markets, so this wasn't just something invented by BitVC and 796.""  OKCoin chief technology officer Changpeng Zhao said falling into line with competitors was the main motivation behind altering the calculations, saying the exchange was ""one against two on this reporting method"".  Users who prefer the previous method, he added, are now aware of the change and could simply divide by two to compare historic figures.  ""In a free and open market promoted by bitcoin, everyone has their choice to report in whatever format they wish, as long as they make it clear what the format is.""  Transparency in disclosing reporting methods is very important, Zhao said. He pointed out OKCoin had not been aware its competitors were using the double-count method until it had been pointed out by some users.  Not all will follow suit  Not all exchange operators, however, see the counting method as preferable. CEO of London-based bitcoin derivatives trading platform BTC.sx, George Samman, called the method a ""disingenuous"" way to inflate volumes that served little other purpose.  ""When 1 BTC changes hands from buyer to seller it is only one bitcoin. Same as the share market or any other market. We do not count volumes like that and as far as switching goes we have no plans to do this.""  Kuhne also said transparency is important, along with consistent standards, and that Huobi would consult with other companies planning to launch bitcoin derivatives platforms in future, such as BitMex.  Since the three large Asia-based exchanges were now using the double-count method, it is likely to be an industry standard for the foreseeable future ""whether this is the most logical way or not"", he said.  BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes said that when the Hong Kong-based exchange goes live later this month, it will follow traditional asset derivatives exchanges and count the matching of buyer and seller as one trade, not two.    ""We believe that double counting trading volume paints a false picture of exchange liquidity. Traders not aware of these non-standard reporting practices could potentially assume there is greater liquidity than exists in reality. As a result, estimates of market impact are rendered useless.""            OKCoin added bitcoin futures trading to its Singapore-registered international exchange OKCoin.com in August. Huobi joined in with its Hong Kong-based subsidiary BitVC the following month.
