42402388,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCbpC,1546466408,"New York Forms Blockchain Study Task Force, Hints at BitLicense Update","New York State is officially launching a cryptocurrency task force aimed at helping the state understand cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology.  Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill last month creating the task force to study cryptocurrencies, other forms of digital currency and blockchain technology, according to a press release issued Wednesday by the bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel.  The task force will be composed of technologists, consumers, institutional and retail investors, representatives of enterprises and academics; the members will be appointed by Cuomo, as well as the state Senate and Assembly. The panel will be required to submit reports on the technology by Dec. 15, 2020.  These reports  will include proposals on how the state may best regulate, define or utilize cryptocurrencies, as well as sweeping overviews of the space, including the energy cost of mining cryptocurrencies, how cryptocurrencies are being traded within the state, how these trades may be affecting tax collection and a number of other aspects.  New York has already developed its own landmark regulation around cryptocurrency businesses in the form of its controversial BitLicense. Only 14 licenses have been granted since the regulation was introduced four years ago.  While the new law does not explicitly mention updating or otherwise changing the license, Vanel's press release noted that the space has changed significantly since the regulation was written.  Striking a balance  Vanel, who represents the Western Bronx and is the chair of the Assembly's Subcommittee on Internet and New Technologies, said in a statement that the state already ""leads the country in finance,"" and ""will also lead in proper fintech regulation."" He added:  ""The task force of experts will help us strike the balance between having a robust blockchain industry and cryptocurrency economic environment while at the same time protecting New York investors and consumers.”  Vanel first proposed the task force in late 2017, introducing the bill in December of that year alongside a number of other measures aimed at increasing the state government's understanding of the technology and its possible uses.  Fellow Assemblyman Ed Ra noted in a statement that the state would have to balance consumer protection with encouraging investment and innovation. To that end, he said, ""convening experts and stakeholders is a good step forward.""  Lawmakers around the country have been acknowledging that in order to regulate the crypto space, they must first better understand it. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last year proposing a similar task force to analyze cryptocurrencies, albeit with a focus on financial crimes. That bill is currently sitting before the U.S. Senate.  On a state level, California is likewise forming a blockchain working group tasked with studying how the state might utilize blockchain technology.  Andrew Cuomo image via Sgt.

The report added that the withdrawal process, including the sale of its mining machines, could continue until the first half of 2019.  Founded in 1999, DMM is one of the largest e-commerce sites in Japan. It launched a cryptocurrency exchange business, dubbed DMM Bitcoin, in January 2018, which is one of 16 licensed trading platforms in Japan.  In September 2017, DMM announced its plan to set up a mining farm with a goal at the time to become one of the 10 largest mining farms in the world by the end of 2018, and to eventually reach a top-three ranking.  It then began mining cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ethereum and, litecoin, in February 2018 in Kanazawa, the capital city of the Ishikawa Prefecture, the report said.  The news came just days after Japanese internet giant GMO announced it would halt making its next-generation bitcoin mining machines, after recording an ""extraordinary loss"" of 35.5 billion yen (or $321.6 million).

42402395,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCbv6,1546432218,The Secret for a $1 Trillion Crypto Market? Keep Building,"Jim Radecki is the Global Head of Business Development at Cumberland, a subsidiary of DRW Company.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  Earlier this year, the total value of all crypto assets reached an all-time high of over $800 billion, driven by a flood of retail customers looking to capture opportunities in a new market.  Although the ecosystem aimed to attract this influx of interest, in reality, it lacked the necessary infrastructure to sustain this magnitude of participation. The industry hit a critical point, where systems were stress-tested and it became clear that the existing model was not refined nor built to scale at such a rapid rate of adoption.  The industry wasn’t prepared, and while volumes have sharply declined, the work to develop the ecosystem over the last year has increased dramatically.  Within traditional capital markets, there are different systems in place that work together to enable these markets to operate efficiently. The required crypto asset infrastructure diverges from the more traditional model, which has created several pain points within the space.  These hurdles have made it challenging for investors – particularly on the institutional side – to enter these markets. While the industry is addressing these nuances, there are several key obstacles to overcome before it is prepared for the next wave of market participation.  Barriers to Entry  Crypto asset market structure is extremely fragmented; there are more than 200 unique exchanges and platforms, each offering their own set of products. Exchanges also operate out of different jurisdictions, which yield different rules, requirements and operational standards and guidelines.  In addition, there are still questions to be answered around qualified custodians. The solutions that exist are varied and nascent, each offering different services for different coins. There is simply no one-stop solution in place today.  The industry also lacks generally accepted standards or best practices around security controls, operations and research and valuation. You have to think about managing your operational risk in a completely different way than in traditional markets – this is the only market in the world where the operational risk is greater than the financial risk. And while research and methodologies continue to improve, people want access to more standardized metrics, analysis and price discovery to understand how to value these assets.  And perhaps most important, concerns around regulatory clarity remain as one of the greatest barriers to entry.  While regulators have taken important steps to understand these markets and have provided guidance in some cases — bitcoin classified as a commodity, not a security — we still need clearly defined rules of the road.  Anyone sitting on the sidelines today is likely waiting on clarity from regulators before even considering operating in these markets.  What’s next?  While these drawbacks may sound daunting, the pressure on these systems has prompted the industry to arise and to begin developing solutions at a much faster rate than if we hadn’t experienced the rush of market activity late last year. There has been a lot of work underway in 2018 to encourage regulatory clarity, streamline operations and continue building out the space.  There was a major shift this year as talent left big banks and financial institutions to apply their expertise to the development of the crypto ecosystem. There was also an uptick in the hiring of operational jobs as these obstacles came to light and businesses realized they needed the right talent to handle the buildout of new infrastructure.  On the regulatory front, we saw the introduction of new industry associations and SROs focused on protecting market participants, providing clear rules and standards and encouraging professionalism in the space, including the Blockchain Association, the Association for Digital Assets Management (ADAM) and the Virtual Commodity Association. The collaboration between these parties, organizations like the Chamber of Digital Commerce and government officials should pave the way for key developments in the year ahead.  So much of the attention today is focused on price, but there is strength in the work done this year to create real, tangible advancements. If you look at where the industry was two years ago today, before the dramatic run up on price, before the underdeveloped infrastructure issues were identified and before so many eyes were watching the space – we have come a long way, very quickly.  While there is still a lot of work ahead, there remains a strong base for optimism.  We expect that 2019 will look a lot like 2018, with more people diligently working behind the scenes, refining their strategies and preparing for the next wave of growth. At Cumberland, we are committed to helping the ecosystem grow and evolve in a responsible and sustainable way.  This year moved the industry closer to that future – and we were proud to be part of it.  Have an opinionated take on 2018? CoinDesk is seeking submissions for our 2018 in Review.

42402402,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCc1z,1546426866,Bitcoin Price Suffers Worst Monthly Losing Streak in 7 Years,"Bitcoin (BTC) chalked up its longest monthly losing streak in seven years in December.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value closed at $3,689 on Dec. 31, representing a 13 percent drop from the monthly opening price of $4,241. That was the fifth straight monthly loss – its worst period since November 2011 – according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Back then, BTC was trading below $20 and had depreciated by 81 percent in five months to November 2011. Notably, the tide had turned in favor of the bulls in the following months. BTC gained 59 percent in December 2011 and traded at record highs above $900 in November 2013.  Bitcoin may repeat history by posting gains this month. After all, the cryptocurrency is looking oversold, having lost 52 percent in the last five months and 70 percent in 2018. Further, it is currently down 80 percent from the record high of $20,000 seen in December 2017.  The follow-through, however, may lack vigor, as key fundamental metrics are still biased toward the bears. For instance, the widely followed network value transmitted (NVT) ratio of 108 is still reporting overbought conditions.  Further, on technical charts, a long run bullish reversal would be confirmed above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) of $5,547.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,790 on Bitstamp – up 1.86 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  Bitcoin is likely charting an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern on the daily chart with the neckline resistance at 4,180.  A UTC close above that level would open the doors to $5,200 (target as per the measured move method).  More importantly, the resistance at $4,180 could be put to test soon as the 3-day chart is biased toward the bulls.  3-day chart  As seen above, BTC is holding well above the December low of $3,122. Therefore, the bullish view put forward by the positive divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) in mid-December is still valid.  4-hour chart  On the 4-hour chart, the 100-candle moving average (MA) is located by the 200-candle MA, indicating the path of least resistance is on the higher side.  The chart also shows a falling channel breakout – a bullish pattern. BTC, therefore, could re-test recent highs above $4,200.  View  BTC could snap its five-month losing streak in January.  An inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, if confirmed, would validate the bullish divergence of the RSI seen on the 3-day chart and could yield a rally to $5,000 in the near-term.  The prospects of BTC posting gains in January would drop if prices find acceptance below the Dec. 27 low of $3,566.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402435,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCc2y,1546419603,"Down More than 70% in 2018, Bitcoin Closes Its Worst Year on Record","Exhale. The nightmare of the 2018 cryptocurrency market is finally over.  Of course, more downside is always possible, if not likely, but at least the year in which bitcoin prices dropped more than 80 percent and the broarder market lost nearly $700 billion of total capitalization is over.  By now, you’re probably well aware the world's premier cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), catapulted more than 2,500 percent from its 2017 low to reach a new high of almost $20,000 by December of that year.  Unfortunately for those at the time who were betting on more immediate upside, one of bitcoin’s many speculative bubbles or “hype cycles” reached its peak on Dec. 17, 2017 and its price has been trapped in a steep and record-setting downtrend ever since.  What exactly transpired for the price of bitcoin over the past 365 volatile days is explored below.  Price History  When reviewing bitcoin’s 2018 price history, two technical developments stand out: the moving average death cross and breaking support of $6,000.  Moving averages are exactly what the name suggests - an average of bitcoin's price over specified time periods that when plotted on a chart tend to provide support and resistance for price, as well as the strength and bias of the longer term trend.  Multiple moving averages are commonly used on the same chart and complete the bearish development known as a ‘death cross’ when a major short-term moving average crosses below a major long-term moving average, indicating a significant loss of strength to the longer term trend.  BTC/USD witnessed a death cross between the 100- and 200-day moving averages on April 16, confirming the end of its most recent bull market.  All eyes were on this level from that day forward as price went on to test it several more times before finally breaking down nine months later on Nov. 14.  Up until this point, many believed $6k had fortified itself as the ‘bottom’ of the 2018 bear market since it had been strongly defended for what in crypto time seemed like an eternity.  Coincidentally, Nov. 14 was the day before one of the world's largest crypto-networks, bitcoin cash (BCH), underwent a divisive hard fork, which many suspect provided enough uncertainty in the broader market to catalyze bitcoin's break below $6,000.  Now having closed the year at the price of $3,747, 2018 will go in the record books as bitcoin's worst performing 12-month stretch ever in terms of price.  The leading cryptocurrency's 2018 performance of a more than 70-percent depreciation from its opening price of $13,062 is considerably worse than the previous record holder, 2014, the year when its price fell roughly 55 percent open to close, according to CoinDesk's pricing data.  Trading Volume  Bitcoin monthly trading volume peaked towards the end of 2017, bringing in a total of $70.2 billion across exchanges in November just before its price reached an all-time high, according to data from Bitcoinity.  Trading volumes, along with price, have been stuck in a downtrend ever since and for all of 2018.  Just $7.8 billion in monthly trading volume was recorded in September - a stark difference and 88 percent drop from the high recorded in Nov. 2017 and a 15-month low at the time.  The volume performance for 2018 isn’t all discouraging, however.  Using data from Coinmarketcap, a post from Satoshi Capital Research revealed over $2 trillion worth of bitcoin was traded in 2018, which as of Dec. 1 marked a 61 percent increase from the previous year.  While it's not quite the 96 percent increase recorded in 2017 over 2016, it’s clear investor interest still grew substantially in 2018 despite the relentless bearish market conditions.  NVT Ratio  There are plenty of other tools that can be used to evaluate bitcoin’s 2018 market conditions besides technical analysis.  Our favorites of which are those created by cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo that focus on various bitcoin blockchain metrics and its relation to price and network value, like the NVT Ratio.  The network value transmitted (NVT) ratio emulates the price to earnings ratio (P/E) used to value a company’s stock price by comparing bitcoin’s network value (market capitalization) and the value of funds transmitted through its blockchain.  A ratio above 100 suggests bitcoin’s price has outstripped its network value, or in other words has become overbought. Conversely, a reading below 100 indicates the market is representing a truer value for bitcoin where price is at less risk of witnessing an aggressive and elongated downtrend.  As can be seen in the above chart, bitcoin's NVT ratio was well above 100 for almost all of 2018 and even reached its highest level since 2011 above 200, confirming the market was significantly overvalued and a drop in price and network value was highly likely.  Now at the year end, bitcoin has witnessed a near 80 percent drop in network value, falling from $280 billion to $56 billion. While the downtrend is still aggressive, the daily estimated value transmitted through its blockchain stopped plummeting in May and has stabilized above roughly $250 million ever since, allowing the NVT ratio to finally begin deflating.  At the time of writing, bitcoin’s NVT ratio records 108, so the market is still slightly overbought but is much closer to finding a healthy bottom than it was earlier in the year.  If the bear market experienced in 2014-15 is any example, the NVT ratio will once again need to stabilize for several months below 100 before another sustained uptrend can begin.  It should be noted Blockstream's liquid side-chain was launched on Oct. 10 which takes some bitcoin volume off-chain so not all transmitted volume is being taken into account in the NVT ratio.  Looking forward  Indeed, 2018 was a historically bad year for bitcoin if solely price action and network value are being taken into account.  Other metrics though, like total trading volume, show a substantial increase in investor interest from the prior year, whereas the NVT ratio shows bitcoin’s latest bubble is coming close to being fully deflated.  All in all, 2019 will be an interesting year for bitcoin as valuations deflate and continue to align with fundamental principles.  Simply put, bitcoin’s market in 2019 can’t possibly be worse than 2018, right?      Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st, and AMP at the time of writing.

42402404,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCc3x,1546405385,Resisting the Threat of Blockchain Recentralization,"Chelsea Palmer is an open source educator and free agent in the cryptocurrency ecosystem who tweets (too much) at @IMmsGNU.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  I think most can agree that it's been a hell of a long year, in crypto and in general. The greatest way to reflect back on the year may be to review our expectations as we entered it; to this end, I'd highly recommend a revisitation of the ""95 Crypto Theses"" post by Ryan Selkis.  Selkis was wise enough to veer away from micro-predictions and focused instead on broad and conceptual observations that ring true no matter where our current prices stand. Most crucially, his theses were shaped by the core values of most crypto-decentralists: pursuit of liberation, escape from censorship and bewilderment at the success of centrally issued XRP.  As Zach Harvey has already excellently outlined in this series, these values come from the cypherpunk roots of cryptocurrency, which are crucial to keep in focus. Unfortunately, my biggest takeaway from 2018 was this: recentralist tricks were in full swing as the year kicked off, and even as opportunists fled the crashing market, we're still surrounded by those who seek to undermine the core principles of our presumed revolution.  You Don’t Have To Care About Prices… Until You Do  My 2018 began with desperate angst at the massive throngs of scammers still HODLing on from December's highs. As a public-facing educator at a small community commons, I was relieved when the prices dropped in February: we could breathe and take a break from telling all these noobs not to burn themselves on the stove.  For most of the year, I ignored prices – as the market dipped again in June, I was busy bringing the absurdist conference of my dreams to life, and we danced through the streets of Vancouver without a thought or word about money.  However, even my punk ass got served by the brutal spiral at the end of this year, losing both my job in the industry and a massive chunk of my savings' worth in fiat. I've finally stopped fighting and embraced the bear market that I first foolishly wished for, then desperately ran from.  I'm not alone in this: Crypto Twitter got quieter, and those who are still around are resigned to keep building, and learning for what might be another long winter. This is a perfect opportunity to reflect on the contemporary lessons around us if we hope to sustain the original dream of decentralizing social power.  Outgrowing Simple ""Immutability""  Halfway through the year, Vlad Zamfir began to solidly document a conversation he's instigated for quite some time: how we can define and understand blockchain governance. A vibrant community discourse arose from this, with some notable contributions coming from CleanApp, Dean Eigenmann and Matthew Prewitt and Steven McKie.  The reason I find this topic important enough to spend a huge chunk of my review summarizing it is this: ""blockchain governance capture,"" as Vlad Zamfir phrases it, is not merely theoretical, but already manifesting in ecosystem politics.  Zamfir is a self-professed immutability cynic, but even those of us who prize it as a core strength of this technology have to accept that blockchains cannot live on immutability alone. In fact, the most jarring example of attempted corporate capture arose just as 2018 drew to an end.  'We Captured Your Code; Sorry Not Sorry'  Ethereum Classic (ETC)  , the small but dedicated community which rejected the 2016 hard fork of Ethereum following the DAO hack, is known to value the concept of immutability above almost everything else.  ETC was hit with a blatant attempt at corporate capture of protocol code last month when ETCLabs, under the control of Digital Finance Group, sweet-talked its way into owner access on the main ETC GitHub repo, then swiftly deleted all other owners to achieve sole control of the main ETC codebase.  I'll give them shocked credit for the fact that they completely owned up to this coup d'état – heck, they essentially boasted about it. Emphasizing that nothing they did technically violated GitHub's terms and conditions, they boldly declared that they knew better than the community at large and thus had no need to ask for their approval.  The community rallied to successfully subverted this takeover  but it’s a cold lesson to close out the year. I focus on this as a case study because I fear it’s the logical conclusion to the year’s power struggles, and a sign of more struggles to come.  Are Just We Looking for New Masters?  Social revolutions often fall prey to opportunists who convince others that intermediaries are not just a necessary evil, but valuable leaders. When you look closely, these folks are making money on the back of open source protocols, straining ecosystem infrastructure and even taking credit for community-driven intellectual property.  As much as I despise the ICO model, and believe it to be responsible for the swell of get-rich-quick optimism and doom-and-gloom capitulation that defined the markets of 2018, it presented one really beautiful promise: you could raise funds free of the dirty trappings and oppressive fine print of legacy business practices.  We must scrutinize the objective value-add of private companies and power players within our industry. We have to ask who benefits from every new major financial “win,” and how each of these impacts the open commons and decentralization.  It would be easy to build a new world that looks much like the old one, but I think we have enough collective chutzpah, and diverse enough opinions, within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to push through the temptation to just elevate new leaders to rule over us in old ways.  If 2018 has shown us anything, it’s that we have tireless agitators among our ranks who will trade off the roles of leaders and whistleblowers, builders and pen testers, in an endless cycle of growth. True innovation will require vigilance, persistence, and often turbulence.  Though it’s exhausting work, it’s way more rewarding than a shiny new set of upgraded shackles.
