42382937,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tVR9,1572640250,Reggie Middleton Reaches $9.5 Million SEC Settlement Over Alleged ICO Fraud,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it has reached a settlement with Reggie Middleton, organizer of the fraught $14.8 million Veritaseum (VERI) initial coin offering (ICO).  In a filing with the New York Eastern District Court, dated Oct. 31 and published today, Middleton agreed to the consent decree of the final judgment, without having to admit or deny the allegations, while waiving any right to appeal.  The settlement came three weeks after the court announced that it had entered into a discussion with Middleton to settle the case.  The defendant agreed to pay approximately $9.5 million to settle the case.  According to the SEC filing, Middleton has the obligation to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $8.47 million, plus a civil penalty of $1 million.  The case concludes the long-running saga since 2017, with Middleton accused of allegedly raising millions of dollars through an initial coin offering without registering with the SEC, while misleading investors to attract more funds with false information.  A week after the raise, Middleton claimed a hacker stole 36,000 of its tokens, valued at $8 million, and subsequently exchanged them for ether, and the funds are still missing, according to the filing.  According to the initial complaint filed by the SEC, at multiple times, the defendant referred to the tokens as “software” or compared them to prepaid gift cards to be used on a technological platform.  The SEC also accused Middleton of manipulating the securities’ value post-ICO, and misappropriating at least $520,000 of investors’ money for personal use, the complaint said.  In an emergency action in August, the SECr froze Middleton’s assets and asked the court to prevent him from continuing to operate a public company or participating in a digital asset securities offering.  The case is one of the latest settlements for fraudulent ICOs. Data storage startup Sia negotiated a $225,000 settlement over its $120,000 raise on Oct.1, while EOS maker Block.One agreed to pay a $24 million penalty on a raise that totaled $4.1 billion on Sept 20.

42382944,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tVYh,1572631205,How Many More Birthdays Until Bitcoin Wins?,"John Biggs is CoinDesk's multimedia editor. The views expressed here are his own.      Bitcoin just turned 11  and it's worth looking at what this technology has achieved. First, some context.  Facebook is 14 while Twitter is 13. Linux is 28. The World Wide Web – the network you're reading this on – is 30. TCP/IP is about 44 years old, depending on whom you ask.  If you're into a bitcoin, you're most likely 18 to 34 years old, according to pollsters at the Global Blockchain Business Council. And you probably joined the bitcoin party about five years ago and own some fraction of or even a full coin. Some of you own many, many more.  I'm about as old as TCP/IP. I'm part of the generation that saw computing's evolutionary bloom. If you're younger, you've gotten used to modern networking technology and you don't remember a time when everything wasn't done on a screen. You were there for the birth of bitcoin.  But on the 11th anniversary of the white paper's publication, we face a question: How long must we wait until bitcoin becomes like Twitter or Linux, something you use every day? Ten years? Twenty?  Bitcoin, from the vantage point of pure adoption, has been a failure. But it remains a beacon, the best chance we have for truly shaking up the status quo and, ultimately, changing the way we interact with our fellow global citizens.  When will we be using bitcoin daily? When will the underlying technology embed itself into the fabric of our financial lives?  Shrug. We don't know.  Bigger than Belgium  A billion people use Facebook every month. On Twitter, it's 330 million. Both services ramped up quickly but really took off in the last few years. Linux is on 98 percent of servers worldwide – that took a while but ramped up after the dot-com boom. The web is everywhere, but that took a solid 20 years to happen.  How many people use bitcoin? It's hard to gauge on a decentralized network designed for anonymity. For a rough proxy, CoVenture Research says there are ""11.2 million bitcoin addresses that hold at least .001 BTC,"" or about $9 worth.  That's a big number, more than the number of people in New York, including the outer boroughs. Of course, a single user can, and often does, control multiple addresses. Yet if anything, this estimate may be too conservative. An April 2019 survey by Harris Poll, done for Blockchain Capital, found 9 percent of Americans – 27 million people – own bitcoin.  All told, it's safe to say that if the crypto community were a country, it would be bigger than Belgium.  But it's not 330 million and it's not a billion. It's enough that the average investor and programmer will take notice and it's enough for Hollywood to consider the topic interesting enough for an awful movie. But 11 million in 11 years is not good for bitcoin.  If bitcoin were a startup it would exist in the Valley of Death.In the startup world, an app with 11 million users is strong enough to generate some revenue but not interesting enough to attract massive investment. Bitcoin is like that. It works, but not enough to turn heads outside of a vocal minority.  So where is bitcoin going? Is 11 million enough? How many more years until we get to mass adoption?  Another shrug. Another unknown. We see the forward motion every day on CoinDesk – the various small changes that add up to a story of a platform. (Or is it a movement?)  This points to the primary problem that bitcoin and the wider crypto ecosystem has to accept. Facebook and Twitter achieved those numbers through investments far smaller than bitcoin's $165 billion market cap. Linux and FOSS endeared themselves to developers enough that they happily contributed their time freely. The web grows by itself because it is trivial to join the party.  Bitcoin exhibits few of those traits. Bitcoin startup investment is cold. The crypto ecosystem is insular and self-involved, difficult for outsiders to join. The network grows by fits and starts, driven primarily by Number Go Up. We are in a vibrant early stage in which everyone is a pioneer and there is no clear way forward. Infighting turns developer against developer while crypto clowns hog the mainstream media's attention. Only a small, dedicated group holds the center together.  This is bad for bitcoin.  Stay tuned  By all rights, bitcoin shouldn't survive another ten years. All the things that made Linux and Twitter and Facebook and the PS4 and Netflix commercial successes cannot be seen in bitcoin's rise. You can't spin up an AI that can write Harry Potter novels on bitcoin.  Bitcoin doesn't move the world's financial markets the way Twitter does nor does it get the same scrutiny that Facebook does. There is no ""bitcoin and chill.""  Yet it still exists.  You will argue that it's unfair to compare bitcoin to all of those things. But bitcoin is both a financial instrument and a technical product. It is, like a startup, a work in progress, an alpha product that may graduate to beta with a little more time. It is a good idea that needs another summer or two to germinate.  When I first looked at Spotify, 13 years ago, I saw the future of streaming music that freed me from CDs. When I stuck a copy of Mandrake Linux into my Pentium computer in 1998 I saw a future of machines freed from paid software. When I look at bitcoin through the eyes of an uninterested programmer I see numbers and hype and scams. But when I look at bitcoin through the eyes of someone who wants to catch the next big thing, I see the possibility that one day, not too far in the future, it will make banking and commerce vastly different.  All of the other services and tools I mentioned above are reaching their apex. It's all downhill from here. Bitcoin, to quote the Joker, is just getting warmed up.  Bitcoin is a slow burn, one that will take another five or ten years to really explode. And when it does it won't be visible like Facebook or Netflix. It won't be one level removed from our browsers, hiding just out of sight, like Linux. It will be ingrained in our lives, in the interaction between our money and the world. It will be the currency used between humans and robots and between robots and robots. It will become so useful that it will disappear.  Bitcoin is 11. Where is it going? When will it win?  Shrug. We don't know. But, compared with everything that came before it, there is little out there to stop bitcoin and a lot of energy driving it forward. It's only a matter of time.

42382938,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tVSP,1572626168,"Crypto Burner Wallets Helped an IT Conference Give $40,000 to Charity","Data analytics giant Splunk raised $40,000 for charity from 10,000 attendees at its annual conference in Las Vegas last week by gifting everyone an ethereum-based blockchain wallet, in what became showcase for the power of “big data” merged with blockchain technology.  Buttercup Bucks (BCB) was the name of the ERC-20 token created to pay for conference swag, activities and donations.  Originally designed by ConsenSys research director Austin Griffith, the open-source “burner wallet” simply requires users to be connected to the internet and able to open a web browser on their mobile devices.  “It gives users the ability to participate without having to jump through all the hoops,” Griffith told CoinDesk in an interview. “You can get right in and use it first. It’s like a Trojan horse into the decentralized onion.”  Over 2,000 individual donations were made to three different non-profit organizations including NetHope and Conservation International. The single highest donation of $10,446 was awarded to the human-trafficking awareness group Global Emancipation Network.  It was donated by Caroline McGee, a cyber engineer for IT company SAIC, who told CoinDesk she managed to raise these funds by collecting other attendees’ unused BCB tokens.  “I was standing at the exit of the conference. I was basically yelling at people to scan my QR code and transfer me their BCB. ... There were five people scanning me at a time,” said McGee, adding:  “It was a different mindset. People are hesitant to donate via their credit card especially at a cybersecurity or data science conference because of the potential risks. But because of it being cryptocurrency, there was no question.”  Scaling showcase  Part of the motivation for Splunk to use cryptocurrencies at the conference was to show the power of “big data” analytics merged with blockchain technology, according to Splunk’s blockchain leade, Nate McKervey.  Based in San Francisco, with a market cap on NASDAQ of over $18 billion. Splunk began expanding its traditional product base into the blockchain industry in the first quarter of 2019 by building data analytics tools for platforms such as IBM’s Hyperledger Fabric.  Splunk is currently planning to build even more blockchain-focused products specifically for the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains, as well as for other major public cryptocurrencies.  “People say blockchain technology is immature, it can’t scale, doesn’t have good performance or security,” said McKervey, adding:  “We want to show although that’s all true, if you harness the data behind it you can solve all these problems.”  The transaction activity generated during last week’s Splunk conference was tracked and recorded using Splunk’s “Buttercup Bucks Ops Center.”  “They had three full walls of screens solely for [BCB] analytics,” McGee explained.  Splunk’s Ops Center synthesized data about BCB transaction activity from users’ mobile devices, the conference app, the ethereum blockchain and the xDAI sidechain all in real-time.  (For context, xDAI is a blockchain network pegged to ethereum that’s able to process transactions at sub-second speeds. Normally, on ethereum, transactions take roughly 15 seconds to complete.)  “If things start to get slow and transaction latency goes up a lot, it’s difficult to understand why,” Splunk’s McKervey said. “Is it the phone network? Is it this lambda function? … The only way to solve transaction speed problems is to have the insight into all the different sources of data.”  Troubleshooting for issues on a blockchain application using comprehensive data analytics is one thing. According to Griffith of ConsenSys, the other major issue that data analytics can solve is poor user engagement.  Making blockchain fun again  During the first deployment of burner wallet at the ethereum conference ETHDenver in February, Griffith said Splunk built an analytics tool that could create a word map of the public messages people were attaching to their token transactions.  “We had this great big word cloud of what everyone was saying at the event while they were buying beer,” Griffith said. “Everybody was having a lot of fun. It was a blast.”  Provoking user engagement and promoting the user experience is the ultimate aim of Griffith’s burner wallet.  Viewing Splunk’s iterations to the burner wallet as a step forward for its open-source development, Griffith said all cryptocurrency products in the market today could improve by thinking more deeply about user experience and onboarding.  For Splunk, that process is already beginning. While Buttercup Bucks was originally intended to be a one-off demonstration of blockchain data analysis, the company is now considering extending the application for wider use cases.  “The feedback we’ve had has been tremendous,” McKervey said, adding:  “Now our community wants us to continue with Buttercup Bucks and we have had other requests to do this at other conferences.”  Splunk 2019 conference image via Twitter / Nate McKervey",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/01/crypto-burner-wallets-helped-an-it-conference-give-40000-to-charity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a987da0d43c9feb6ee333af602a7d14308ed390-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382948,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tVbD,1572621940,Crypto Portfolio App Ember Seeks $1 Million in SEC-Registered Securities Sale,"Ember Fund, makers of an AI-managed cryptocurrency portfolio app, is seeking to raise up to $1 million through a Securities and Exchange Commission-registered securities sale.  The year-old company revealed their intention in today's filing with the SEC, detailing their sale of ""Crowd SAFE"" securities that will occur through the end of January 2020 on Republic, an online startup investment platform. SAFE stands for ""simple agreement for future equity;"" it is an investment contract entitling holders to equity if and when Ember Fund is acquired or goes public. Investors must post a $100 minimum buy-in.  Ember Fund markets itself as an app-based equivalent to crypto hedge fund, with an automated AI system re-balancing a portfolio of cryptocurrencies. Ember is not itself a hedge fund, however; as a non-custodial service Ember Fund never actually touches or transmits crypto - all coins remain on users' phones.  In May, Ember Fund CEO Alex Wang told CoinDesk that the service, that he and two others bootstrapped in 2018, saw nearly $2 million in transactions in April 2019.  The current financial status is unknown because the company's public reporting is until the end of 2018. The four-person company reported in their filing with the SEC that they had only $2,557.00 in cash on hand on December 31, 2018. Ember Fund's reported loss for the year was $24,523.00. Wang told CoinDesk that they began processing transactions in November 2018.  Ember Fund’s target fund numbers are relatively low; the minimum target sale is $25,000 and a maximum of $1,070,000. But Wang told CoinDesk the funding round – which he said is directed at “friends and family"" – is small by design.  “Our hope is really to raise as little money as possible,” said Wang, who wants to ensure that he and his founding partners Guillaume Torche and Mario Lazaro retain control of the company they founded, and funded, in 2018.  Since that time Wang said they have learned their user acquisition costs and value, enabling Ember Funds to develop a strategy for continued growth. This, he said, makes them different from many move-fast-and-break-things-type California startups rushing to trade their equity for capital.  “A lot of companies go out and raise a ton of money without having a business model. We took the other approach: let’s have a business model and then scale it up.”  A transcript of a marketing video included in the SEC filing indicated that Ember Fund will use the capital to expand. The narrator, CTO Guillaume Torche says:  “We have already processed about $10 million to the platform without any marketing budget. We're at a point where we're ready to scale.”  Bitcoin markets image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,SAFE,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SAFE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/01/crypto-portfolio-app-ember-seeks-1-million-in-sec-registered-securities-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ed756a65182317874960653cf3f71aae2007c41-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382953,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tVhV,1572616814,Telegram Releases Test Crypto Wallet Despite SEC Lawsuit,"Telegram, the messaging app company turned blockchain startup, has released an early desktop wallet for its ""gram"" token.  Now users can download the test app for MacOS, Windows and Linux 64 bit on Telegram's official website and get their keys on the TON testnet. The wallet asks users to save 24 seed words and create a password for payments, after which the wallet is ready to receive and send grams.  ""Now you have a wallet only you control – directly, without middlemen or bankers,"" the app says to new users.  Users can also get testnet grams from a special Telegram bot, asking it to send from 5 to 20 tokens. A test transaction took just a minute for this CoinDesk reporter, though the bot warned it could take longer at busy times.  TON, an ambitious blockchain project by Telegram, which raised $1.7 billion in a closed token sale last year, had been previously scheduled to launch until October 31. In September, the team released the code for a full node, a validator node and block explorer, signaling that the project had been on its way to launch.  In the beginning of October, the project published the terms of use for the wallet app and asked the investors to share their public keys using TON's key generator — according to the developers community chats groups, the same generator is now built into the app.  However, the launch was postponed after Telegram was sued by the SEC, which deemed grams to be unregistered securities and asked the court to prevent Telegram from delivering tokens to investors. Telegram subsequently got an approval from investors to postpone the launch until April 31, 2020, to win more time time to clear the situation with the SEC.  The company is going to meet the SEC in court on February 18 and 19, 2020, in New York.

The unfortunate email also opens users up to targeted phishing attacks, as anyone obtaining the email has a portion of what's needed to access the account login.  BitMEX has now asked customers to add BitMEX's support email to their contact lists to decrease phishing emails along with adding 2-factor authentication (2FA). The exchange appeared to suggest a bug caused the incident, saying on the company blog: ""The error which has caused this has been identified and fixed.""  “We are aware that some of our users have received a general user update email earlier today, which contained the email addresses of other users,” they said on the blog. “Our team have acted immediately to contain the issue and we are taking steps to understand the extent of the impact.”  In a statement to CoinDesk, BitMEX Deputy COO Vivien Khoo said:    Earlier today, the majority of our users received an email containing the email addresses of other users in the ‘to’ field. This was a general email update about upcoming changes to the weighting of our indices.      We are deeply sorry for the concern this has caused to our users. The issue was caused by an error in the software used to send emails. As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we immediately prevented further emails from being sent and have since addressed the issue to ensure this does not happen again.    BitMEX takes the privacy and security of our users very seriously. We are working around the clock to establish communication with all our users to provide any assistance and to ensure the continued safety of their account.    Beyond email addresses, at no point during this issue has any personal data or account information been disclosed.    According to data tweeted by data analytics firm Skew, BitMEX has around 22,000 users daily.  The mishap adds to the woes of the exchange, which is also reportedly being probed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Exchange Commission (CFTC) over whether it has allowed U.S. traders to use its platform. BitMEX geo-blocks multiple countries from participating on its exchange, including the United States, although some users may have jumped the fence by using virtual private networks (VPNs).  One of the largest crypto derivatives markets, known for its leverage rates of up to 100x, BitMEX operates out of Seychelles. Its largest product, the XBT/USD trade pair, had a 24-hour trade volume of $2.8 billion as of press time according to CoinGecko.

42382931,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tVJb,1572608700,Bitcoin Mining Power Sees Short-Term Drop as Rainy Season Ends in China,"After sustained growth over the past three months, computing power on the bitcoin network has seen a fallback as the summer rainy season trails off in China.  According to data from Poolin, the world's largest bitcoin mining pool by real time hash rate, bitcoin's seven-day average computing (or hashing) power has dropped to around 90 exahashes per second (EH/s) since Oct. 24, signaling that some miners have been unplugging from the network. It had previously been estimated that the hash rate would go above the 100 EH/s threshold by the end of 2019  As a result of the power drop, data from mining pool service BTC.com estimates that bitcoin's difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards on the world's top cryptocurrency by market value – will decrease by 1.5 percent when it's set to adjust in about seven days.  Bitcoin's mining difficulty had reached an all-time-high at 13.69 trillion on Oct. 24, following a 38 percent increase since early August. The climb resulted mainly from an increase in miners' hashing power made possible by the abundant and cheap hydroelectricity in China's southwestern provinces.  Mining difficulty is designed to adjust itself to go up or down about every 14 days, based on whether the hashing power on the network in the two-week cycle increases or declines, respectively. The Oct. 24 difficulty record followed a jump in the 14-day average hash rate to an all-time-high at 97.90 EH/s.  Poolin's co-founder Chris Zhu said in a recent WeChat post that one main reason for the fallback over the last week is the gradual end of this year's rainy season in China. As a result, some hydropower stations in China's Sichuan province – estimated to account for 50 percent of bitcoin's global computing power – no longer have the capacity to generate enough energy to support mining activities.  Miners without sufficient hydropower supply would have to shut down their operations or relocate to other provinces like Xinjiang or Inner Mongolio, where mining farms have a more stable, but more expensive, power supply generated from fossil fuel plants.  Xun Zheng, CEO of Hashage, which owns mining facilities in China's southwestern Sichuan province, echoed Zhu's comments, adding that even if some may still be able to find a hydropower resource, the cost has gone up from $0.04 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in the summer to around $0.05.  Further, bitcoin's sudden price drop on Oct. 23 to below $7,500 could have resulted in a large scale of shutdown of older but widely used mining models like the AntMiner S9 made by Bitmain. The S9's profit break-even price point is between $7,000 to $7,500. However, the price's significant rebound since last weekend may have stopped that panic.  The fact remains, though, that the profitability of the S9 and other similar modes made by Bitmain's rival miner makers, is a critical issue for their utility lifespan. And that may soon be affected by the higher winter cost of electricity in China, as well as the scheduled halving of bitcoin mining rewards in May 2020 – before next year's rainy season.  According to a miner profitability index provided by Poolinhttps://www.poolin.com/shop-miner-list and its rival F2pool, at bitcoin's current price and an electricity cost of $0.05 kWh, the mining profit margin of models like S9 is about 30 percent.  Some, like INBTC, a sister company of Poolin, are currently making efforts to extend the life of the S9 miner by merging two units into one in an attempt to generate a higher ratio of hashing power over electricity consumption. That would allow a higher daily profit margin than would be achieved using two individual units, though it remains to be seen if such a method can be proven to work and adopted on a large scale.

42403479,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4YW,1572606008,"Bitcoin's Defense of Major Support May Fuel Price Bounce to $9,600","View  Bitcoin's repeated defense of the 200-day average support indicates an end of the pullback from $10,350 and scope for a bounce to the 100-day average at $9,601.  A UTC close above that level and a further rise to above $10,000 cannot be ruled out, as the recent pullback from $10,350 lacked volume support.  Acceptance below the hourly chart support of $8,977 would weaken the case for a bounce in the next 24 hours.      Bitcoin looks primed for a price bounce to $9,600, having repeatedly defended long-term support in the last 72 hours.  The top cryptocurrency by market value began the week on a negative note by shedding 3.56 percent on Monday. Notably, BTC formed a candle with a long upper shadow on that day, signaling buyer exhaustion and opening the doors for a deeper drop to the former resistance-turned-support of $8,820.  So far, however, the downside has been restricted around the 200-day moving average (MA), a widely-tracked barometer of the long-term market trend.  The cryptocurrency dipped to $8,985 on Thursday, below the 200-day MA, but soon recovered. On similar lines, Tuesday's dip below the key average was shallow and short-lived.  Similarly, BTC came close to testing the MA at $9,046 during the Asian trading hours today before jumping back to highs near $9,200.  The repeated defense of the major support indicates the low-volume pullback from the high of $10,350 reached last Friday has likely ended and the risks are skewed to the upside.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,120 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.40 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  BTC is defending the 200-day MA for the third straight day.  The cryptocurrency formed a doji candle on Thursday, which occurs when the market witnesses two-way business and a flat end of the day close (UTC). Usually, that candlestick pattern is taken as a sign of indecision in the market place.  The latest pattern, however, has appeared following a $1,000 pullback from $10,350 and represents indecision or exhaustion among sellers near the 200-day MA support.  As a result, a bounce, possibly to the 100-day MA at $9,601, may be in the offing in the next 24 hours or so.  Note that trading volumes dropped as prices pulled back from $10,350 to $9,000. A low-volume pullback is often reversed, so, a rally all the way back to $10,350 could be on the cards.  Bitcoin has also failed three times in the last six days to close above the 100-day MA. Therefore, if the bulls can pull off a UTC close above the average, it will likely invite stronger buying pressure and lead to a move above$10,350.  3-day chart  Bitcoin jumped 28 percent in the three days to Oct.27, reinforcing the bullish view put forward by the 100-candle MA's move above the 200-candle MA (bull cross) confirmed in mid-October.  Further, the sharp rise was also backed by the highest trading volume since February 2018. The path of least resistance, therefore, is to the higher side.  Hourly chart  The case for a rise to $9,600 in the next 24 hours would weaken if the horizontal support line at $8,977 seen in the above chart is breached with strong volumes.  That would expose support lined up at $8,820 (Oct. 11 high). A violation there would prove costly as the next major support is lined up directly near$8,400.

42403460,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4Jl,1572602120,Harbor Now Has Both Broker-Dealer and Transfer Agent Licenses in the US,"Security token startup Harbor has secured a transfer agent license from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  A month after receiving a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Harbor was granted the license Thursday to better ensure interest and dividend payments to investors. The firm is the first blockchain company to be granted both licenses.  Transfer agents act as liaisons between firms, investors and regulatory bodies by keeping track of investment certificates. If a wallet contained security tokens is lost, for example, the transfer agent can help mint new tokens to replace the lost securities. By acquiring the license, Harbor has the green light to service higher class firms, investors, and offerings.  Seeking to become a “one-stop-shop” for digital asset issuance, Harbor has done its fair share of leg work to get the appropriate regulatory licenses. In fact, it took over a year, according to CEO Josh Stein.  “It took the regulators a long time to get a handle on the space and understand it and its implications. This was very new for the SEC and FINRA, and they wanted to do it right,"" Stein said as the firm was awarded the broker-dealer license.  Harbor recently engaged in a $100 million real estate tokenizing effort on the ethereum blockchain on behalf of four firms. By tokenizing investor shares, Harbor and the 1,000 plus participating investors and placement holders hoped to decrease digital asset management friction.

Binance's presence the Korean market was confirmed Friday by CoinDesk Korea, after the company registered Binance Co. Ltd. with local authorities on Oct 29.  The new arm – which has Binance CFO Wei Zhou as co-representative – comes on the heels of suggestions that Binance intends to open a Beijing office, complementing an office in Shanghai, though it's not to be an exchange due to local regulatory restrictions.  Operating out of Malta, Binance has local entities in Singapore, Jersey and Uganda, as well as a partner entity in the United States. Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao also told CoinDesk recently the firm has plans for expansion in Russia, though that may not involve a new exchange branch.  CoinDesk Korea reached out to Binance to confirm the acquisition of Binance Co. Ltd., a Korean entity opened this past spring by parent firm BXB Inc. The crypto exchange said: “Binance has incorporated corporations in several countries as part of its long-term business plan.”  This April, CZ told CoinDesk Korea that Binance was looking for a “clear signal” from Korean regulators before moving in. The following month, Korean corporation Binance LLC registered in the country with no known affiliation to the crypto exchange.  Two months later, the launch of a Korean arm seemed imminent after CZ confirmed conversations with BXB Inc. which was also eyeing the issuance of its own won-pegged stablecoin. At the time, Binance posted a job ad for a South Korean compliance officer.  With the acquisition, CoinDesk Korea says Binance will soon issue a won-stablecoin under its ""Venus"" project.

42403467,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdg4Og,1572598825,Venezuelans Made Lightning-Savvy Hardware to Use Bitcoin During Blackouts,"On March 7, 2019, all the lights went out in Venezuela. Total blackout.  While the electricity crisis was already part of everyday life, the blackout still crippled communications across the country. It also inspired Venezuelan Randy Brito to focus fully on the Locha Mesh initiative, an open-source project working to enable private messages and payments without an internet connection.  During the blackout earlier this year, it became clear to Brito that poor internet infrastructure was a leading barrier to crypto adoption. People were using dollars during the blackout not because they preferred cash, but because they lacked alternatives.  “In Venezuela, cryptocurrency adoption can be very complicated,” Brito told CoinDesk, adding:  “People can have trouble even downloading a wallet because of the lack of infrastructure.”  Locha Mesh has created two hardware prototypes so far, Turpial and Harpy, both of which act like small routers that don’t rely on local WiFi. Instead, they pass messages around the “mesh” until one outlet finally has an internet connection. (It’s not dissimilar to the work of New York-based startup goTenna.)  “These devices allow commerce [during a blackout] by making it possible for users to send and receive payments using the bitcoin network,” Brito said, describing the devices as “easy to carry and hide” for safety purposes.  In March, these small devices created an experimental system that actually worked for 22 consecutive hours, even connecting Harpy devices to the Blockstream satellite and relaying that connectivity to other users via the Turpial device. Next up, came a focus on enabling small, fast payments using a scaling solution called the Lightning Network.  “The Lightning Network requires you to be connected, otherwise, you wouldn’t know if your counterpart is lying,” Brito said. “These nodes, these devices are always connected to the Lightning Network.”  This struggle to use bitcoin without electricity is widespread across emerging markets, from Venezuela to Lebanon to the Palestinian territories. So Brito presented his latest mesh-network hardware tools for such transactions at the 2019 Lightning Conference in Berlin, because Locha Mesh is currently looking for investors and donors. His six-person team aims to start selling these devices in the first quarter of 2020.  “We are currently finishing the second prototype and development kits,” he said.  The team’s expectations are set on providing an accessible and safe form of communication for anyone in the world, said Luis Ruiz, CTO and co-founder of Locha told CoinDesk.  Said Ruiz:  “Basically, we are providing an accessible solution for anyone who finds themselves without energy or internet access in need for a safe, decentralized and censorship-resistant way of communication.”  Locha Mesh's Turpial prototypes, photo by Diana Aguilar for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Diana Aguilar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/01/venezuelans-made-lightning-savvy-hardware-to-use-bitcoin-during-blackouts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3db6d1a456ecb887cf1115fdbd6eb15bf99e13d-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Existing institutions  include the Nigeria-based SaBi exchange, with about $100,000 worth of daily crypto trading volume, and the South African exchange HIZA, which is expected to go live in the fourth quarter.  Mohit Davar, EMEA regional president of Huobi Group, described to CoinDesk how these institutions are looking to leverage an international platform’s security resources and deeper liquidity, otherwise difficult to recreate on their own.  Huobi Cloud has been talking with potential partner companies across 10 countries in the Middle East and Africa, hoping to launch two or three of them this year, according to Davar.  ""We cannot go and market our product in a localized manner in over 200 countries. There are certain markets where it is better to partner with somebody,” Davar said.  The push comes as part of the Huobi’s expansion in the Middle East and Africa, following its fiat-crypto gateway launch in Turkey this month. Through the cloud service, Huobi is spreading its wings to enable a wider range of institutions besides its existing partners to trade cryptocurrencies, the company said.  The cloud service will offer core functionalities of the global exchange, ranging from cryptocurrency trading to the security system that guards such transactions.  According to Davar, the firm is looking for more institutionalized clients with a large user base of their own existing services. Huobi is targeting institutions such as credit unions, banks or fintech companies with a large group of customers who'd want to trade digital assets.  Davar said Huobi offers exchange services via its API, which could be used for localized exchanges, or a white-labeled cloud service, which is much simpler than launching a fully-localized exchange .  The cloud service brings a stream of new profits, rather than eating into their local market shares, due to a revenue-sharing fee structure. Clients would pay an upfront fee in the range of hundreds of thousands dollars plus 50% of their revenue from transaction fees on the platform, Davar said.  In May, Huobi Group’s senior business director David Chen told CoinDesk that the unit had earned $1.5 million in net profit from cloud partnerships gone live between Oct 2018 and May 2019.  Chen said, at the time, there were 150 platforms under the Huobi Cloud umbrella, plus 80 partnership deals in the pipeline.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/01/huobi-cloud-to-offer-white-label-exchange-services-in-middle-east-africa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa2f6bd27ed612412066e25e68a0471bb96cb7f4-640x427.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Another flash crash has occurred for bitcoin (BTC), this time appearing on the Coinbase Pro and Deribit exchanges.  At 19:55 UTC on Oct. 31, BTC's spot price dipped from $9,260 to $9,055 in quick succession on Coinbase's exchange for professional traders.  An hour later, Deribit, a futures and options exchange for BTC, saw futures prices drop from $9,150 to $7,720 before bouncing back above $9,000 within minutes.  The move caught traders unawares as multiple orders were executed in the process.  Crypto trader @Crypto_boy1 took to Twitter to slam Deribit for telling customers that trades would not be rolled back and that they should manage positions accordingly.  “It’s over. I would withdraw all funds and never use this exchange again If I was a user” he said.    5-minute chart    As seen above, BTC dropped to a low of $7,720 on Deribit, sending shock waves throughout the derivatives market. Liquidations shot through the roof on Bitmex, for example.  However, in an official response on the same thread, Deribit said it would attempt to rectify the incident by changing the price of stop-loss trades to a fixed BTC level, depending on the product.  “Equity will be brought back to the pre-incident level, around index price $9,160,” the exchange said.    5-minute chart    An hour before Deribit’s incident, Coinbase Pro users also experienced problems as stop-loss orders were “deleted” right before BTC’s sharp drop from $9,260 to $9,055.  According to a user of CoinDesk’s Dojo trading forum who goes by the handle Radyohead, the price dropped below their stop-loss order, yet no sale was executed:  “Coinbase crashed as far as I can see. And it deleted my Stop Loss as it happened, nothing sold for me despite the price being lower than where my stop was.”  Prices have since rebounded, currently changing hands for $9,145, while the issues on both exchanges appear to be resolved.
