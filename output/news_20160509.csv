42399030,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Wb,1462832818,Gemini Trading Launch Does Little to Boost Ether Price,"Ether prices experienced only modest movements on 9th May despite the high-profile launch of trading support for the digital asset on Gemini, the digital currency exchange owned by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  Announced last week, Gemini began offering both ETH/BTC and ETH/USD pairs at 14:30 UTC today, a launch that coincided with news coverage from Reuters and Bloomberg, among others.  Despite the visibility, the digital currency opened the day at $9.55, Poloniex data reveals, and later fell to a low of $9.36 at 02:25 UTC. Ether remained at this price level until 04:30 UTC, when it rose to a high of $9.48.  The currency proceeded to climb, reaching a high of $9.69 at 07:20 UTC, but even at this daily peak, it was only 1.44% above the session’s opening value.  After reaching this high, ether moved downward, hitting a low of $9.21 at 17:10 UTC, 3.6% below the opening price of $9.55 and 5% lower than the daily high.  But, while the price remained flat for the day, the news that Gemini is offering its support is the latest sign ether is gaining market momentum alongside the Ethereum network.  In a blog post dated 5th May, Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder and president of Gemini, touted the benefits of Ethereum and the reasons ether was a clear choice for the exchange.  ""The Ethereum protocol’s unique features and the wide range of applications being developed by the Ethereum community, along with increased liquidity and market cap, have made ether an obvious addition to the Gemini trading platform,"" he wrote.  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have added additional credibility to the market of late, revealing they have personally invested in ether, though they did not disclose the amount.  Charles L.

42399021,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Ml,1462826184,Private Digital Currency Founder Jailed for 20 Years,"The founder of Liberty Reserve, a private digital currency system shuttered by the US government for its alleged use by organized crime, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Arthur Budovsky was arrested in the spring of 2013 and later extradited to the US for trial. He was ultimately charged with the operation an unlicensed money transmission business as well as conspiracy to both operate an unlicensed money services business and commit money laundering.  Budovsky pled guilty to the money laundering conspiracy charge in January after spending years trying to fight the US government’s efforts.  Prior to its shutdown in 2013, Liberty Reserve was a private money system that enabled the exchange of a digital currency called LR. The US government alleged at the time that Liberty Reserve functioned as a de facto financial hub for organized crime in the digital era.  The crackdown on the Liberty Reserve network has arguably impacted law enforcement efforts focused on bitcoin and other comparatively decentralized digital currencies. By contrast, Liberty Reserve functioned as a centralized transaction network.  In addition to the 20 years-long sentence, Budovsky was also ordered to pay a fine of $500,000.  ""Despite all his efforts to evade prosecution, including taking his operations offshore and renouncing his citizenship, Budovsky has now been held to account for his brazen violations of US criminal laws,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement last Friday.  Two other former Liberty Reserve employees, Vladimir Kats and Azzeddine El Amine, await sentencing, and the Justice Department says that charges remain pending against both the company itself as well as two other ""fugitives"".

42399020,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Lm,1462818741,SWIFT: Blockchain Won't Remove All Third Parties in Securities Trade,"It may come as little surprise to find that blockchain technology could require a major re-imagining of the securities market.  But a report published today by the research arm of financial messaging service SWIFT argued that the technology does not entirely remove the need for third parties, even if it demands a ""substantial re-engineering of business processes across multiple securities market firms.""  The major finding of the report, based on interviews and focus group meetings with individuals from 75 organizations in technology and post-trade processing, is that industry firms need to re-imagine their role in post-trade processing – but this, SWIFT goes on to say, is not in itself an existential threat.  Michael Mainelli from Z/Yen Group, who co-authored the report, said in a statement:  ""The challenge of using mutual distributed ledgers in securities markets is not just in demonstrating technological feasibility, but in achieving the necessary industry coordination to reengineer business processes across securities firms.""  The research paper, entitled ""The Impact and Potential of Blockchain on the Securities Transaction Lifecycle"", found that blockchains or ""mutual distributed ledgers"" could significantly reduce the $40b per year spent in post-trade processing of securities around the world.  But the report also highlighted the “danger” of “unrealistic expectations"" as new technologies like blockchain are explored.  Some roles irreplaceable  Conducted by the SWIFT Institute, the academic branch of SWIFT, with the help of Mainelli and Alistair Milne from Loughborough University’s School of Business and Economics, the researchers based their results on two “general insights” gleaned from the interviews.  The report's authors argue that blockchains can be ""expected to replace"" the safeguarding function of third parties in the post-trade environment, an arrangement that seeks to prevent the proliferation of duplicate and fraudulent transactions.  The technology is also being positioned as a means to replace the current means of cataloguing transaction histories and dispute resolution applications, according to the report.  But a third function of a trusted third party in this context – the act of confirming or validating the existence of a thing being traded – cannot be replaced by blockchains, the report goes on to say.  The authors state:  ""In real world contexts distributed ledgers do not entirely remove the need for central third parties. The central third party role narrows towards confirming identity and asset existence (notary function), as well as dispute resolution and enforcement of legal obligations.""  Expensive process  In the current securities transactions framework, the responsibilities and access of various parties are ""well understood by the participants"", including institutional investors, asset managers, custodian banks, brokers, hedge funds, central counterparties and central securities depositories.  The shift from third parties that possess a combination of trusted documentation and institutional knowledge to a mutual distributed ledger could prove “problematic” because the semantics behind how third parties choose to use available services and data is never fully expressed in processing logic.  The report continues, that while this isn't an impossible process, it will undoubtedly prove to be an expensive one, explaining:  ""Given the problems of understanding poorly documented legacy systems many years after their original implementation, it might be argued that the necessary evolution in existing systems will be prohibitively expensive.""  Based on the interviews, the report concludes ""unsurprisingly"" that a permissioned blockchain is preferential to a permissionless blockchain.  ""The key insight for us is the availability of 'configuration files' for cryptographic control of access and updating rights to ledger participants,"" the report states. In other words, the ability to ensure that not everyone can see everything.  Complications  According to the report, the interconnected nature of the securities trade ecosystem means that altering any single part of the workflow will impact many other areas, not all of which stand to benefit from a blockchain.  One example given in the report is syndicated lending, which can take 20 days or more due to legal complications ""not affected by the method of recording ownership data.""  It's the interconnected nature of securities transactions that, according to the report, should raise questions as major financial institutions and enterprises look to develop proofs-of-concept.  Rather than focusing on one specific application, conceptual developers should bear in mind ""substantial changes in operational arrangements"" for tasks that include collecting, warehousing and analyzing data for a wide range of applications.  The report concludes:  ""The challenge of using [a] mutual distributed ledger in securities settlement is not just demonstrating technical feasibility but also a coordinated reengineering of business processes across multiple firms.""

42399025,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Rg,1462811134,Swiss City to Accept Bitcoin Payments for Government Services,"The city of Zug, Switzerland, has announced it will pilot a bitcoin payments project that will allow local citizens to pay for public services using digital currency.  Zug, a well-known Swiss financial hub long associated with the country’s tax haven reputation, kicked off the initiative during a local government hearing on 3rd May. Payments will go live on 1st July and run through the rest of the year, the city said in a statement.  The move was announced on the city’s official website, which characterized the initiative as a means to assess the efficacy of accepting bitcoin for public obligations that cost 200 francs (roughly 0.44 BTC at press time) or less.  The city explained:  ""The pilot project of the city government is initially limited to a limit of 200 francs on chargeable services the residents of the city train. The end of 2016 [we will conduct] an analysis of lessons learned. Then...the city council [will decide] if bitcoins and most other digital currencies are to be accepted as payment for other urban services in the future.""  The idea – adding bitcoin as an option for taxpayers – isn’t a new one, though the Zug pilot is certainly one of those cases in which the concept moves from the drawing board to the testing lab. Cities and states have toyed with the notion in past years, though in many cases the idea simply didn't catch on.  The move is perhaps slightly less surprising given the proximity of several digital currency startups in the region. Companies like Xapo, ShapeShift and Monetas are among several located in and around Zug.  City mayor Dolfi Müller said in a statement that he hopes the project will attract more financial tech firms to the region.  ""We want to express our openness to new technologies and expressed early on your own experiences. And we will invite to exchange ideas with the City Council FinTech companies in the region train,” he said, according to a translated statement, adding:  ""Our goal is to meet their needs for optimal development in our living and economic environment in more detail.""

42399019,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Jo,1462806040,Is Blockchain the Key to User-Controlled Social Media?,"New social media platforms are starting to emerge that utilize blockchain and distributed ledger technology in an effort to build platforms where users are in control of their data and more expressive choices are available.  The development in the industry's startup ecosystem coincides with a growing disillusionment with the traditional social media platforms. But will security, control and less exploitive content be enough to compel people to start over?  Dor Konforty, CEO of Synereo, one of the next-generation social platforms, thinks so. But, he believes this transition will happen in stages, starting with open-source communities and decentralized technology.  Synereo is actively targeting cryptocurrency enthusiasts, recently presenting its distributed tech stack, programmatic content delivery network and smart contract system at the COALA blockchain workshop in New York City.  Konforty and his team are building the platform as more of a public utility rather than a profit-making machine. And that's when things get interesting, because now users aren't made to follow a specific path and flow determined by centralized platform providers.  For instance, because the platform is peer-to-peer, users can create multiple identities for different groups. During the COALA event, Konforty illustrated this feature saying it would be fine for his friends to see pictures of last night’s party, but that he might decide to shield those pictures from co-workers.  Another next-gen social platform that’s targeting the cryptocurrency community is being developed by Steemit.  The goal for Steemit is to create a Reddit-like platform that ""rewards positivity and accuracy over garbage content like some of the things you see on Facebook,"" said Ned Scott, CEO and founder of Steemit. ""On the other hand, we want to create the lowest barrier means to getting cryptocurrency.""  This direction is a sound one.  ""The more people get disillusioned with how Facebook and Twitter manage their data and do not protect them and use their streams to advertise and tinker with...the more they’re going to want a platform not controlled by a single entity but instead distributed,"" said Gil Luria, head of technology research at Wedbush Securities.  And while replacing the incumbents will be difficult, Luria said that bitcoin users might be a market where such an idea can be incubated.  He said:  ""There is some demand for this especially in groups that are sensitive to privacy and commercialization of their data.""  The altcoins  In practice, most industry startups are using forms of community currency to facilitate this goal.  On Steemit, there will be three different types of currency: steem, the proprietary cryptocurrency; steem power, the digital currency users get when they post successful content that then can be used to vote on other content; and steem dollars, which is cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar.  According to Scott, one of the problems with the cryptocurrency movement is the difficulty in acquiring the tokens; with Steemit, it’s as simple as liking or creating a post.  The company’s interest in getting more people into cryptocurrency is just as simple: ""It’s a very liberating tool,"" Scott said.  Synereo also has it’s own proprietary cryptocurrency, amp.  Amp allows users to benefit from their participation and will also help make sure good, accurate content reaches the most people. Each user will have a reputation on the network determined by their location on the network and the history of how their content has been appreciated.  A better reputation allows a user's post to reach farther into the network. If a user invests amps into a particular post, that post can then permeate past the user’s organic reach and into greater spheres of the network.  The people who see that content then get amps just for their attention; the number of amps received for views depends on the reputation of the user viewing the content with those users that have better reputations getting more amps. For instance, a well-known political commentor that has a large following would be compensated more for their attention to a political column than a user that posts in networks that discuss sports.  Synereo is currently giving amp bounties to anyone that contributes to the project, either developing on the open-source code, creating new content or spreading the message.  And this is where distributed ledger technology plays a role, in the transferring of tokens across the network.  Although Konforty said a blockchain isn’t the correct tool for most of Synereo’s features. The technology doesn’t make sense for transferring information to be replicated, such as picture of your cat or your breakfast, but instead is only advantageous when working with immutable data like valuable units.  Both Synereo and Steemit aren’t putting all its chips in one basket though, seeing the social networking applications as one iteration of a bigger decentralized platform play.  Steemit has been building its platform after raising money from several investors, although the terms were not disclosed.  Synereo has funded its work through crowdsales of amps. Another campaign will take place soon so Synereo can finish developing the voting system – sending tokens towards posts to create a hierarchy of relevant and useful content.  Reluctance from Average Joes  But, proprietary tokens are also how many new blockchain-based companies make initial money to fund projects. It’s a type of crowdfunding that also resembles multi-level marketing schemes that have scammed users out of money in the past because tokens increase in value as more users join the network.  Should the developing company have a large stake in that token, it could decide to cash out when the price rises, making substantial amounts of money while destroying the value of everyday user’s tokens.  There’s also the risk of pump and dumps, since the cryptocurrency community is made up of a significant amount of speculators.  In the community these platforms fare going after ""there’s a high level of awareness to not being taken advantage of by having a cryptocurrency that’s goal is to enrich the founders,"" said Luria, adding:  ""The target audience is likely to be sensitive and skeptical of native currencies.""  But this skepticism can be counteracted by a good amount of transparency. The founders of these companies need to be clear with users about how much stake they have is the cryptocurrency and what they’ll use the gains for, Luria said. Ethereum, he added, is a prime example of how projects can ""communicate a value-add so people will participate in the crowdfunding sense, instead of pyramid scheme sense"".  Steemit also tries to offset some of this uncertainty by encouraging everyday users that see benefit in a decentralized platform to use the steem power and steem dollars, instead of regular steem which even today is being traded by speculators. The company has even coded the blockchain to steer users in that direction, giving 50% steem power and 50% steem dollars when awarding users for content.  Although tech-savvy users will be able to divest or ""power down"" steem power into regular steem to trade on exchanges for speculation, Scott said. And steem dollars will be able to be cashed out into fiat currency through exchanges as well.  ""We recognize that the whole volatile world of crytpocurency is not for everyone,"" said Scott. ""We’re not telling everyone to get into a risky business; we’re just creating a fun gaming platform for rewarding good content.""  Starting conversation  Overall, these platforms are advancing a dialogue about how social media platforms can be more user-centric and sustainable.  Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and Snapchat have taken over social media, and it will be difficult to get users to switch after building profiles on those platforms for years. But Konforty doesn’t think it’s impossible, especially as more people become aware of the dangers of centralizing these platforms.  For instance, there has been outcry over Facebook’s manipulate OS user newsfeeds for profit, selling information to the highest marketing bidder, and the psychological experiment it conducted in 2012, finding that they could shift political sentiment of users.  Twitter has also been through the ringer for the increasingly number of fake accounts and bots. And recently, people have been complaining about LinkedIn where political commentary and memes are finding it’s way into the feed developed for career networking.  According to Synereo, more people will join these decentralized social networking platforms once the open-source tech community starts developing expressive applications and empowering tools for the platform, like better control over one’s data.  ""What we all know by now is that the current social networks are based on centralized entities where the user is the product,"" said Konforty.  In this way, he suggested that any of the negative connotations of digital currencies are perhaps outweighed by their benefits over existing systems.  He concluded:  ""[These platforms are about] monetizing who you are through the content you post and by harvesting information about your participation in the network… essentially, capitalizing on human nature as it manifests online.""

42399023,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Pi,1462803379,"After Months of Tests, the Big Bid to Scale Bitcoin is Nearing Launch","Since Segregated Witness was announced last December, it has been one of the most anticipated software releases across the bitcoin community. If it succeeds, the software patch could be the first step to growing the block size and scaling bitcoin.  Yet, due to the scope of the project and the long-term implications it could have for the $7bn network, the development team is moving carefully. Despite recent assurances that segwit would launch in April, the team continues to review the software well into May.  In an interview, Eric Lombrozo, CEO of Ciphrex and a spokesperson for Bitcoin Core, cautioned that there could be any number of unanticipated bugs that the team found, leaving the timeframe for when it launches up in the air. On top of the regular Core developers, Lombrozo said that independent developers have been tasked with trying to break the code as an extra precaution.  While Bitcoin Core is cautious not to launch prematurely, the team is pushing hard to complete the project as it provides an immediate block size increase. Lombrozo suggested that ""with typical commonly used transaction types"", users can expect an 1.8x capacity increase to Layer 1, the base layer of the bitcoin network.  However, segwit is much more than just a step towards scalability. Lombrozo explained that the update will also make it easier to implement future changes.  Lombrozo told CoinDesk:  ""Being able to deploy improvements to the protocol smoothly has been a difficult challenge in the past. With segwit we will also be able to do things like improve or replace the scripting language and build more sophisticated smart contracts.""  While it is true that scaling is highly anticipated, the capacity by which new rollouts can be implemented could have even greater implications for bitcoin down the line.  Testing the framework  But, segwit didn’t originate as a method by which to scale the bitcoin network. Instead, the ultimate goal was to try and solve transaction malleability, a quality of the network that has been controversial since its use as a scapegoat for Mt Gox's early exchange issues.  With the transaction malleabiltiy goal in mind, Wuille started working on segwit with Elements Alpha, a sidechain software developed by Blockstream for this sort of prototype development.  It wasn’t until after the Scaling Bitcoin Montreal conference held in September that the idea of using segwit as a scaling mechanism via a soft fork was discussed.  Lombrozo explained that bitcoin developer Luke-Jr first discovered the mechanism by which segwit could be used to scale bitcoin without needing to initiate a hard fork. Instead, a backwards-compatible soft fork would allow nodes to upgrade to the more current software without kicking older nodes entirely off the network.  ""Only miners need to upgrade,"" explained Lombrozo. ""Everyone else can upgrade at their leisure without risk of getting thrown off the network because the change is backwards compatible. Old wallets will continue to be able to send and receive bitcoins without any problem.""  Once Wuille presented segwit to the community, it became necessary to actually build it out and test it. In many instances, testing software can take just as long, if not longer, than the process of building it.  But when dealing with software that powers billions of dollars, it's necessary, Bitcoin Core argues.  Lombrozo explained that Core has already deployed four separate testnets for them to test segwit and are currently working on what they call Segnet4. A testnet in the generic sense is akin to a test server whereby developer can run their test cases against, trying to find any breaks in the software.  This is different from the bitcoin testnet, which is akin to a staging environment for the actual bitcoin software.  ""The key things we’re looking for are how edge cases are handled and how the network behaves as we approach or surpass its limits,"" Lombrozo said.  For example, it’s important to test whether the network can actually handle a block with 2MB of space. In one transaction, which had 13,982 inputs and 9 outputs for a total of 5 transactions, the size of the block was 2MB exactly. In some instances, the team of testers pushed the block up to 3.6MB to test whether the network could handle it.  Lombrozo explained that, while possible, it’s not likely that any block would be that large because miners would wind up losing money.  To ensure deploying segwit doesn't break the network the team conducts regression testing on their local machines.  ""These tests are part of a test suite that’s incorporated into our continuous integration process. If any build breaks something, we hope to be able to detect it right away,"" Lombrozo said.  Once all is said and done, the team will have to deploy the software to the bitcoin testnet and merge it. A timeframe for this is still uncertain, but Lombrozo confirmed that the team hopes to deploy in May.  Encouraging adoption  There are advantages to taking the soft fork approach. Specifically, users that are attached to the network are not suddenly kicked off because of laziness, technical deficiency or inaction.  However, because adoption is optional, the maximum benefit can only be achieved if everyone upgrades.  Lombrozo feels that the benefits of upgrading to segwit are worth enough to encourage application developers to put the work in.  ""Not only will they be able to use the higher capacity afforded by segwit and pay lower fees, they will also be able to support other features later on that are enabled by segwit with only minor upgrades,"" he said.  According to a FAQ published on the Bitcoin Core website, the transaction fees are going to be significantly smaller because the effective size of the transaction is also smaller.  The site reads:  Each byte of the witness part of a segregated witness (segwit) transaction will only count as 0.25 bytes towards the size of the transaction. Since transaction fees are based on the size of a transaction, this is effectively a 75% discount on fees for that part of a transaction—but only for people who use segwit.  But the other reason that developers are likely to adopt segwit is because it is a huge necessary precursor, along with the recently released CheckSequenceVerify to the Lightning Network. If estimates are true, nodes that are on high-speed internet can expect to process thousands of transactions a second, up from the seven-per-second rate that the network currently allows.  Further, this is just the first stage of segwit.  Once it’s rolled out, the team intends on combining signatures, which would compact transactions even further. Lombrozo explained that while they’re not introducing this currently, it will now be possible with segwit.  As with many technologies, the first use case evolves into many others.  While many continue to argue about the merits of hard forks versus small forks, the first significant increase in block size in quite some time is nearly ready to launch. With further testing to come, the developers continue driving toward the goal of expanding the network for everyone.
