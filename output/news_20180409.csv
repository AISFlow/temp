Rachael Horwitz joins the company from Spark Capital, a Coinbase investor. She previously held high-level communications roles at Facebook and Twitter.  ""Incredibly grateful and excited to join Coinbase as the company's Vice President of Communications,"" Horwitz wrote on LinkedIn. ""An amazing company with a terrific story to tell. Time to get to work.""  Horwitz told Recode that the size and buzz around Coinbase reminded her of Twitter, which she first joined in 2011. She acknowledged that the role could be challenging, however, given that the public – and even some Coinbase users – is largely mystified by cryptocurrency.  ""The range of audiences who are probably reading about this stuff, seeing it in their feeds and seeing it in headlines but don't totally grasp where we're at in the history of all this,"" Horwitz said. ""There's a huge educational challenge.""  Horwitz is the latest executives to join Coinbase's ranks in recent weeks.

Led by venture capital firm Beenext and accelerator 500 Startups, an early investor in bitcoin startups, the funds will contribute to Stably's efforts to launch a fiat currency-backed stablecoin with ""organic price stability and high reserve transparency.""  Angel investors – drawn from both Canada and the U.S. – who backed the round include Raaid Hossain, Jeffrey Roh, Tony Chen and Randy Hana.  The company was founded in 2017 and its funding round commenced in January. Its project represents one of a growing number of stablecoins, which are designed to avoid volatility by adjusting their supply with the rise and fall of prices and pegging them to some kind of underlying asset.  As a result of their purported volatility-resistant engineering, stablecoins have also been touted as a means of bolstering the commercial case for blockchains.  ""The blockchain economy desperately needs a reliable and price-stable medium of exchange as well as store of value in order to evolve and scale beyond its current speculative state,"" Stably co-founder Kory Hoang wrote in a blog posthttps://www.stably.io/single-post/stably-raises-seed-funding-for-currency-backed-stablecoin-project.  The company plans to launch its coin on both the Stellar and ethereum blockchains, and said it may consider operating on additional platforms in the future.  Tether challenger?  Hoang said in the blog post that he envisions the coin as a rival to the currently dominant stablecoin, Tether.  ""Tether's first-mover advantage has paid off handsomely, but their dominance probably won't last forever as more stablecoins start coming onto the scene,"" he wrote.  The company outlined several measures for transparency in its statement, including ""publicly verifiable on-chain transactions"" and ""quarterly reserve and transaction audits,"" among others.  Critics have also pointed out that stablecoins are not decentralized, diminishing their appeal for some. However, Hoang argues that this is necessary to achieve price stability.  ""Our stablecoin derives its organic price stability from a centralized reserve of hard currency (e.g. Canadian or U.S. dollars) in the real world,"" he wrote, arguing further:  ""While it may be true that this removes many aspects of decentralization, it is impossible for a stablecoin to possess organic price stability without actually being backed by a price-stable asset such as hard currency.""

According to a Form D document submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Intangible Labs raised the funds via SAFT from 225 investors between March 22 and April 3. Intangible Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Intangible's basecoin token aims to avoid price volatility by pegging its value to a group of other digital assets. Founder Nader Al-Naji, who left Google last year to pursue the basecoin project, previously told CoinDesk that the token was created to serve as a medium of exchange.  A combination of oracles would monitor the prices of these assets, and the network's protocol would add or remove tokens to ensure that basecoin's price remains stable, as CoinDesk previously detailed.  The startup is also developing ""base bonds"" and ""base shares,"" or cryptocurrencies that will serve to underpin basecoin. Together, the two will help the protocol manage the supply of basecoins. Base bonds can be converted for basecoin tokens as needed, while base shares simply ensure new tokens are distributed to the shareholders when they are created.

However, director-general of police Ashish Bhatia said an initial probe could not verify that the 200 bitcoins were actually transferred from Bhatt to Patel, and police would examine both citizens' wallets for proof, according to the Times.  He added:  ""In his application, Shailesh Bhatt had mentioned the transfer of 200 Bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore ($1.8 million) from the digital wallet of his business partner, Kirit Paladiya. Another Rs 32 crore ($5 million) were allegedly paid for their release from a farmhouse. Later, Rs 78.5 lakh ($121,000) were allegedly paid to get the Bitcoins back. All these transactions mentioned in the application could not be proven.""  A Special Investigative Team is being formed to fully investigate the matter, Bhatia said. So far three of the constables have been arrested, and the remaining six, as well as Patel, are on the run, according to News18.com.

The National Energy Commission, which is a part of the country's Energy Ministry, said it would commit data to the public ethereum ledger in order to ""augment levels of security, integrity, traceability and confidence in the information available to the public,"" according to a statement.  The commission is particularly concerned that its databases can be hacked and manipulated. The ethereum-based approach represents an alternative method for data storage, given that distributing records among a large number of nodes helps to alleviate that concern.  The commission has already begun committing some data to the blockchain, including information about installed electricity-generating capacity, average market prices, marginal costs, hydrocarbon prices and compliance with laws requiring that renewables account for a certain share of electricity generation.  Following this first stage of the project, known as ""Energia Abierta"" or ""Open Energy,"" the commission will study the results and share them with other companies and government bodies in the sector.  Susana Jimenez, Chile's energy minister, said in a statement:  ""We are interested in taking this technology from a conceptual level to a concrete case, understanding that it's considered to be the most disruptive technology of the last decade by world-class experts, and that it could be part of day-to-day life in the next few years.""  The commission's decision to use an open blockchain like ethereum as opposed to a so-called permissioned network stands out. The statement explained that having ""hundreds of thousands of servers"" authenticating the data makes it more trustworthy and difficult to alter.

To put it simply, human diversity, multiplied by quantity and speed came to be the real threat to global safety. Humanity has to deal with real plurality drama.Paradoxically, the only solution to the global plurality drama is Singularity. That is the universal state to which global life gravitates. Singularity is the principle of unity applied to the whole human population. The singular system that has already managed to build a technical solution for global plurality crisis is called Nimses.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, OneCoin – a pyramidal marketing scheme widely believed to be fraudulent – has been the subject of investigations by multiple countries including India, Finland and Italy - the latter of which fined OneCoin 2.59 million euros for utilizing pyramid scheme tactics in 2017.  Officials in Samoa are investigating whether people in the country have been defrauded, noting that promoters have been targeting would-be investors.

Having suffered a 50 percent decline in March, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market value fell to $394 by April 1 – the lowest level since Dec. 7, according to Bitfinex data.  However, at the time, ETH was extremely oversold, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) at record lows.  So, a corrective rally was overdue and, accordingly, ETH has created a minor double-bottom bullish reversal pattern as seen on the chart below.  Daily chart  What's more, ether was trading above the neckline hurdle of $418 earlier today, signaling increased odds of a corrective rally to $475.  However, today's drop in bitcoin prices from $7,100 to $6,700 seems to have played a spoilsport. ETH backed off from the daily high of $430 and is currently trading at $392.  So, ether has failed to hold on to gains above the double bottom neckline. Further, the daily candle now looks like a bearish ""inverted hammer.""  These developments have neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.  Still, ETH is holding well above the recent low of $358 and could close (as per UTC) above $418 if BTC regains poise. In such a scenario, one can envisage a move higher to $475.  Also, the ""death cross"" indicator – 50-day moving average (MA) and 200-day MA crossover – could occur very soon. It should not be an undue cause of concern as the ominous-sounding signal is often followed by a rally (working often as a contrarian indicator).  There is always a risk of bitcoin extending losses further, though, and the ether-U.S. dollar exchange rate chart will likely follow suit. Hence, ETH bulls risk being trapped on the wrong side of the ETH/USD market.  Still, the ETH's oversold status could work in its favor against bitcoin – i.e. ether will likely outperform bitcoin, irrespective of any bitcoin bull/bear move. And this is already happening, as BTC/USD has depreciated by 4 percent in the last 24 hours, while ETH/USD is trading largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap. It also means that ETH has effectively appreciated by 4 percent against bitcoin.  ETH/BTC daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bittrex) shows that the ETH/USD pair has cleared the descending trendline in a convincing manner, having formed a base around 0.053 BTC since the end of March.  The upside break adds credence to the ""dragonfly"" doji candle, which is characterized by a small body and a long lower shadow. It is considered a sign of bullish reversal if it appears at the bottom of the downtrend, as seen in the above chart.  View  The ETH/USD chart shows signs of life, but is vulnerable to a deeper correction in BTC/USD.  ETH/BTC looks set to test the 200-day moving average (MA) located at 0.0652 BTC in the short-run.  Only a close below BTC 0.053 (April 4 low) would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change.

42428834,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeEPh,1523282421,Blockchain Startup Symbiont Teams with Wall Street Legend Ranieri,"The company founded by the ""father"" of the mortgage-backed securities market has partnered with blockchain startup Symbiont with the aim of shaking up the mortgage industry.  Ranieri Solutions was created by Lewis Ranieri – a former Salomon Brothers bond trader who pioneered the development and use of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) back in the 1970s – and will now work with Symbiont's smart contracts platform, Assembly.  Ranieri, who declined to be interviewed for this article, said in a statement last week that the mortgage market ""continues to lag behind from a technological standpoint creating inefficiencies that impact mortgage loans throughout their lifecycle.""  “By partnering with Symbiont, a proven blockchain pioneer, Ranieri Solutions believes that together we can implement this transformative technology to bring necessary efficiencies, transparency, and security to the mortgage markets,"" he went on to say.  Mark Smith, Symbiont's CEO, said in an interview Friday that the mortgage market ""lends itself perfectly to a blockchain solution.""  First, he said, ""you've got all these disparate participants"" – referring to the banks, borrowers, and brokers – along with companies like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, that would benefit from doing business across a common network.  He went on to argue that Symbiont's platform could allow mortgages to be grouped into ""very transparent pools that can be securitized.""  And transparency is key. Mortgage-backed securities were blamed for sparking the late-2000's financial crisis, as the ""junk"" status of some loans was hidden in large, opaque pools. These pools were given investment-grade ratings, despite the hidden risks.  Indeed, Ranieri was among those blamed for setting the stage for that crisis. Smith said, though, that such practices began long after Ranieri's involvement in the creation of the MBS.  ""This beautiful product that he created was turned into a Frankenstein by others,"" he said.  Smith went on to say that he sees the regulatory reaction to the crisis as a mistake – a ""big doubling down on centralization"" that set the stage for history to repeat itself.  ""What should have occurred was a breaking up of that concentration through decentralization. Blockchain and smart contract technology is really the first opportunity to embrace decentralization that provides the same type of efficiency [as] traditional markets,"" he told CoinDesk.

42428823,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeE5h,1523278887,"Dear Students, Everything In Bitcoin's Way Is Your $1 Billion Opportunity","“No one owns it, and no one uses it.”  That’s how BlockTower Capital’s Ari Paul described bitcoin (and, really, cryptocurrency in general) multiple times during his keynote at PennBlockchain on Friday, the inaugural crypto conference by students at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business School.  While it might not sound like it, Paul emphasized bitcoin’s low adoption as a rallying cry. In fact, taken in total, the conference in West Philadelphia felt mainly like a day of recruiting pitches by crypto luminaries.  In saying that no one uses it, Paul was illustrating how, despite all the conversation and hype the technology has generated, in the grand scheme of things, the ecosystem is still very small. He compared it to the internet in 1995, when the number of websites online was only in the hundreds, but it was being prepped for an explosion in adoption.  Grayscale’s Michael Sonnenshein struck much the same chord during a panel, bemoaning the level of media attention in late 2017, contending that “the unfortunate result of all those touchpoints is that everybody thinks everybody who wants to be is already involved.”  But in fact, throughout the day, presenters emphasized there’s lots of opportunity for all kinds of talented people to work in the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem.  Yet, the day wasn’t without its notes of caution. Regulatory uncertainty, especially in the U.S. cast a shadow over nearly every conversation. Additionally, presenters also commented on the plethora of ridiculous projects transparently chasing easy millions though initial coin offerings (ICOs), one of the reasons regulators are starting to get involved.  But these issues were presented more as disclosures than discouragement.  In other words, nothing in this space will be easy, but there’s a good chance it would be worth it; or as Sonnenshein put it:  “It’s new, it’s nascent, there’s bugs but it’s very exciting and also very risky.”  Not legal advice, but...  Probably no other project exemplifies the industry's hidden treasures and pitfalls as much as Tezos, whose co-founder Kathleen Breitman (one half of the husband and wide co-founding team) was on hand for a panel about ICOs.  Last summer, the project raised more than $200 million to build what Breitman said was a blockchain that could ""self-amend"" in a way, in an effort to put a stop to the contentious upgrading debates most cryptocurrency communities have struggled with. It was an exciting endeavour, but one that came to a halt when the partner the Breitmans had chosen to run the project's Switzerland-based non-profit foundation, refused to pay the developers.  If that legal battle wasn't enough, large groups of Tezos' former supporters started organizing to bring class action lawsuits against the Breitman's, demanding refunds.  This hasn't completely stopped the couple. According to Kathleen on stage, ""We're planning to launch the network,"" in weeks or months.  But, the Breitmans, along with anyone else that's a stakeholder to ICOs, might have more headwinds to worry about. The biggest, at least from what it seemed listening to the day's talks, is the U.S. regulatory system's sometimes aggressive approach to the space.  The issue that these conversations always come back to is this: utility tokens (or whatever entrepreneurs prefer we call them – as if the name matters).  Joe Guagliardo, a tech-focused partner at Pepper Hamilton, addressed regulators' refusal to give clear guidance on whether all crypto tokens will be categorized as securities. “It’s stifling – not so much to innovation – but to companies trying to do the right thing,"" he said.  Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition echoed that sentiment, telling CoinDesk in an interview that selling crypto tokens is the best way for new projects to bootstrap their business.  It builds an incentivized, motivated group of supporters, yet it will be difficult to operate in the U.S. in that way, she said, adding:  “Federal security law fundamentally conflicts with building an organic community.”  Once again invoking the internet in the days before it was a fixture of modern life, the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Amy Davine Kim said that the U.S. needs forward-thinking leadership from the top echelons of government, and soon.  “We need a clear statement like we had in 1999 for the internet, saying this is important technology,"" she said.  Don't underestimate  Still, even though there’s frustration with the political reality today, there's currently no evidence of panic.  Elizabeth Stark, the founder of Lightning Labs, a company building a layer-two lightning network implementation for scaling bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies poked fun at the Silicon Valley adage of ""move fast and break things,"" defending the sometimes slow progress of updates with:  ""Move slowly and build a more secure base layer.”  Cornell professor Emin Gun Sirer had similar things to say during the event, telling the students that based on layer-one demands, the industry is doing fine, but also prodding them by pointing out that if Venezuela shifted entirely over to bitcoin (this was mentioned since many worry about Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro new ""petro"" crypto token), “every adult in the country could only make one transaction every 36 days.”  He continued, ""It’s possible for new protocols to emerge that are strictly better than anything that came before them. We are far from having established the stack.”  It was as if everyone who showed up to the event had come to challenge the students.  Were they smart enough to get in on the ground floor? And even then, were they smart enough to pick winners now, in a world where, as Future/Perfect VC Jalak Jobanputra put it, “There are 10 altcoins for every business case.”  For his part, Paul told the students that while people will try to tell them that cryptocurrency won't amount to anything, there are billion-dollar businesses in building tools for interacting with the technology. But he warned, “Many of these projects are on the wrong side of the Gartner Hype Cycle.”  Speaking in much the same way to blockchain's potential to surprise, Amber Baldet (on her last day as the blockchain lead at JPMorgan Chase), reminded the audience that the most lasting ideas are sometimes discovered by someone just playing around with a technology they find interesting.  Sometimes the most important ventures aren’t born from serious people building serious companies or noble people taking on noble causes.  As such, Baldet said:  “You can’t underestimate things like CryptoKitties.""

42428840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeEbh,1523268036,Bitcoin Teases Bull Reversal with Rise Above $7K,"Bitcoin (BTC) found acceptance above the $7,000 mark over the weekend, boosting the odds of a double-bottom bullish reversal, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency trapped the bears on the wrong side of the market as it defended the psychological support of $6,500 on Friday, despite a bear flag breakdown, and rose above $7,000 on Sunday.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,081 – up 0.84 percent for the session, and up 9.8 percent from last week's low of $6,513, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The positive turnaround is being associated with reports that Wall Street bigwigs or ""real whales"" are set to enter the crypto waters. Notably, George Soros, the billionaire investor who broke Bank of England in 1992, has given his Soros Fund Management macro investment manager Adam Fisher the go-ahead to trade cryptocurrencies, according to Bloomberg.  Reports are also doing the rounds that Venrock, the venture capital arm of the financial empire began by John D. Rockefeller, is all set to bet on bitcoin.  While the speculation seems to have put a bid under bitcoin, the job is only half done for the bulls, the price chart analysis indicates.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) show that the rally from $6,500 to $7,186 (session high) has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook.  However, BTC bulls need to clear the descending trendline and the double bottom neckline before claiming victory over the bears. The descending trendline hurdle is seen around $7,300 and the double bottom neckline resistance stands at $7,510 (April 3 high).  A close above $7,510 would confirm the double-bottom bullish reversal and allow a stronger rally to $8,500 (target as per the measured height method).  The 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA are now biased to the bulls. Also, the relative strength index (RSI) has cleared the falling trendline in a convincing manner, indicating BTC could rise to $7,300–$7,510.  And, last but not least, BTC has moved back above the key ascending trendline (drawn from the July low and September low) as seen in the linear-scaled daily chart below.  Bitcoin retakes rising trendline  The immediate outlook is neutral.  On the higher side, the key level to watch out for is $7,500. If passed, bitcoin could see a sustained rally to $8,500 (double-bottom breakout target).  On the downside, the focus is on the April 1 low of $6,425. A close below that level over the next few days could put a slide to $6,000 back on the table.

42428838,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeEZh,1523264448,Making the Most of Crypto Mining Tax Breaks,"Mario “The Problem Solver” Costanz is a lifelong entrepreneur and the author of ""Crypto Taxes Made Happy: The Definitive How-To Guide For Preparing Cryptocurrency Tax Returns In The United States,"" available for free on Amazon. He was named to the “One to Watch” section of Accounting Today’s 2017 Top 100 Most Influential in Accounting List.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      Ever since the bitcoin genesis block, coin mining has been the lynchpin of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Miners power the transaction and verification processes that make most virtual currencies function. As a result, mining has a dominant position in the ever-expanding world of virtual currency.  For many, cryptocurrency mining has grown into a thriving business characterized by substantial investments in complex systems and costly resources. As cryptocurrency mining becomes more costly and competitive, miners are looking to take greater advantage of tax breaks to help them maximize their profits.  Taxable income  The Internal Revenue Service treats cryptocurrency mining income as business income, even for miners who only operate on a small scale. Anyone who receives mining rewards worth over $400 in a calendar year must report their activity to the IRS.  Miners must report income from every coin they receive in a given tax year, at the market value of the coin at the time it is received. Those who own their mining equipment individually must report their mining income as self-employment income on Schedule C of their tax return. The net income on a Schedule C is subject to ordinary income tax plus a 15.3 percent self employment tax.  From a tax perspective, however, some coin miners prefer to own their mining equipment through a company and be treated as business entities rather than as self-employed individuals. Corporate tax policies can be more generous than individual tax rules if there is significant net income for the mining business.  If the net income exceeds $60,000, for example, an S Corporation (or a LLC taxed as an S Corp) may make sense. Utilizing an S Corporation, you may be able to eliminate paying the 15.3 percent self employment tax charged to individuals on a portion of the mining income.  In a high-cost industry like cryptocurrency mining, these tax benefits can carry substantial value. However, depending on the state in which a company is registered and does business, business entities other than an S Corporation may make more sense.  Be sure to consult a credentialed tax professional to discuss the best options for your particular scenario. Business entities also generally have a lower instance of audits than self-employed Schedule C filers.  Expenses and losses  Good mining operations can be incredibly profitable. However, cryptocurrency mining is full of technical and financial pitfalls that can send a mining business into the red.  The most significant cost facing just about any cryptocurrency mining operation is the hardware and electricity used to keep it going. Miners living in areas with deregulated electricity marketplaces are advised to rate shop to pursue cheap rates. A few cents per kilowatt-hour can mean the difference between profit and loss.  Miners with access to cheap electricity do brandish this substantial competitive edge in regards to profitability. Even mining businesses in higher cost areas that aren’t so lucky can still deduct their mining-related electrical costs from their business income, reducing their net profit. For miners that spend thousands of dollars each year purchasing electricity, this tax deduction can quickly add up to a substantial value.  Cryptocurrency mining uses a staggering amount of electricity, and all that power goes towards running complex mining hardware systems called “rigs.” A mining rig includes various pieces of specialized equipment, including graphics cards and a GPU, a microprocessor specialized for graphics calculations.  Better hardware specs can be very expensive, but they lay the groundwork for the efficiency of your mining operation. As a result, efficient rigs often require coin miners to lay out some serious cash.  Fortunately, however, the IRS allows miners to deduct the depreciation of their mining equipment. Using the Accelerated Cost Recovery depreciation methods recognized by the IRS, coin miners typically deduct the value of their rigs over a span of three to five years. However, in most cases a deduction of the entire purchase price of equipment in the year it was purchased can be made using special Section 179 depreciation rules.  Some rigs are simply not powerful enough to generate a profit, particularly for coins that a particularly difficult to mine. After adding up the cost of electricity, office space, hardware and other mining expenses at the end of the year, some miners discover that they actually lost money in their operations.  If there is a net loss on a mining operation, those losses can be used to offset other income. Mining companies should accurately document all business expenditures that are related to the endeavor so they are prepared to maximize the tax savings.  A business and an investment  The goal of mining activity is to provide the necessary resources for blockchains that also create profits for the miners. This profit oftentimes hinges on the market value of the cryptocurrency being mined. A bad day in the cryptocurrency market can mean the difference between profit and loss, so talented coin miners must be both competent technicians and skilled investors.  Typically, cryptocurrency miners focus their resources on coins that return good value. Because some crypto coins offer higher rewards for miners than others, mining operations sometimes swap their mined cryptocurrency to another crypto that they prefer to hold on to. When miners make this exchange one coin for another, they are actually selling the first coin in return for buying the second coin which in turn creates a capital transaction.  These coin-for-coin swaps are required to be reported separately and additionally to the actual mining income as business income. They create short- or long-term capital gains or capital losses to be included on Form 8949 which then flows to Schedule D.  Long-term capital gains are taxed at favorable rates and are applicable to those coins held on to for over one year. Short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates which are higher. There are numerous accounting methods potentially available to apply to these capital gain transactions to create tax efficiency when reporting the subsequent sales of any mined coins.  Audit safety  Safety is critical to success.  Coin mining income received individually is usually taxed as sole proprietorships on a Schedule C which are audited much more frequently than individuals without self-employment income.  As a result, coin miners should always make sure to keep their financial records in order in case of an audit.  From the classification of mining income to deductions, depreciation schedules for rig equipment to having a second reporting and tax requirement after the mined coins are sold, tax rules for cryptocurrency miners can get complicated.  Anyone who generates more than a few hundred dollars per year in cryptocurrency mining income would be wise to speak with a credentialed tax professional – either a certified public accountant, a tax attorney or an enrolled agenthttps://www.naea.org/educating-america/becoming-enrolled-agent-faqs.

According to a statement on Monday, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will conduct on-site inspections on the NongHyup, KB Kookmin and KEB Hana banks from April 19 to 25.  Early this year, the FSC prohibited domestic banks from offering virtual, anonymous accounts to cryptocurrency exchange customers from February in a bid to prevent money laundering and illegal capital outflow via cryptocurrencies.  Since then, at least six banks – NongHyup, KookMin, Shinhan, KEB Hana, IBK, and JB – have been developing their implementations of the new procedures, three of which will be inspected later this month.  Notably, among those institutions up for review, NongHyup Bank has been providing the real-name verification process for two major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, Coinone and Bithumb.  The focus of the inspection will be whether the banks have fully complied with the new real-name verification rules for cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, including the number of accounts held by these exchanges and the respective amount of deposits, the regulators said in the announcement.  The plan follows a previous on-site inspection conducted by the financial watchdogs in January and also confirms a previous report on March 22 hinting that regulators may soon launch a second probe this month.  In addition, the FIU also urged other financial institutions not included in the inspection this time to conduct their own checks in an effort to comply with the new anti-money laundering and real-name verification guidelines.

42428827,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeEFh,1523253635,Japanese Regulator Suspends Two Crypto Exchanges Over KYC Failings,"Japan's financial regulator has ordered two cryptocurrency exchanges in the country to halt their operations for two months due to insufficient know-your-customer (KYC) procedures.  Effective immediately, the suspension will last until June 5 and June 7, respectively, for Eternal Link and FSHO, according to two administrative penalty orders issued by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) on Friday.  Through its months-long inspection, the agency alleged the two operators had not properly required to customers to provide information such as purposes of trades. They had also not implemented procedures around reporting suspicious transactions to the FSA.  The failure to put such anti-money laundering efforts in place is not in compliance with the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds, the agency said.  Separately, the penalty order to Eternal Link also indicates that the firm had violated laws in Japan by using deposits from customers to pay for company expenses, even if temporarily.  In addition, Eternal Link, FSHO, as well as a third local exchange, Last Roots, were all found to have made insufficient improvements to their internal safety measures that guard user information against potential cyber threats, the FSA said.  The latest round of administrative penalties mark the continuing scrutiny by the Japanese regulator of the domestic cryptocurrency industry.  The new FSA suspension order sent to FSHO follows a one addressed to the firm on Mar. 8. At the time, another exchange, Bit Station, was also ordered to halt its operations, while five others were ordered to report back to the FSA regarding business improvement measures.  The FSA has been stepping up its efforts to inspect domestic cryptocurrency exchanges regarding their business operation loopholes after a heist that saw $500 million-worth of NEM tokens stolen from the Coincheck exchange.

42428830,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeEHh,1523246449,The Anti-Petro? Zcash Throws Venezuelans a Lifeline,"Zooko Wilcox received his first plea for help from someone in Venezuela a few months ago.  The founder and CEO of the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (ZECC) had been closely following what he describes as ""a humanitarian crisis of the first order"" unfolding in Venezuela when he got that first message, followed by a series of others.  ""They said things like 'Do you see what is happening?'"" Wilcox told CoinDesk. ""'We need zcash here now.'""  The problem facing many of those citizens was that in addition to the alleged humanitarian violations, Venezuela's monetary policy had hyperinflated its national currency, the bolivar, to near-worthlessness, and they were looking for a way to store value in the traditionally stable, but difficult to access, U.S. dollar.  The trick was converting the bolivars to dollars while protecting the users' identities.  While the government has stopped short of banning the dollar, the official exchange rate discourages legal ownership, and has led many Venezuelans to buy dollars on the black market and store them under the proverbial mattress.  Which is where zcash, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Wilcox helped create, enters the picture.  In response to the flurry of requests for help, Wilcox last month partnered with AirTM, a Mexico-based peer-to-peer exchange, to promote zcash as an optional intermediate step when converting bolivars into U.S. dollars.  While adoption of zcash among AirTM's 168,000 Venezuelan users has so far been slow, the partnership has only just begun. According to AirTM founder and CEO Ruben Galindo Steckel:  ""We're just helping zcash get access to the people who need it most. Not necessarily the people in the States who like privacy, but the people in Venezuela who have been oppressed.""  Seeking stability  Founded in 2015, AirTM is specifically designed to let users in hyperinflated economies such as Venezuela store value in historically stable U.S. dollars.  The company gives users a variety of ways to enter and exit the dollar. For instance, they can send money from a bank or PayPal account, drop off cash at a Moneygram location or zap some zcash (and nine other cryptocurrencies) to AirTM. The company then stores the money as USD in an account on the customer's behalf.  Customers are then able to withdraw the funds, provided AirTM can find a buyer for the original currency. In exchange for the service, the company usually takes a 20 percent cut of the cashier's commission. Users can also convert back into the local currency at the point of payment when shopping at a participating merchant.  No underground operation, AirTM, which last month conducted $5 million in transactions worldwide, is registered as a money services business by the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). As such, the startup conducts know-your-customer (KYC) reviews to comply with anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations.  What made the partnership so attractive to Wilcox was that by the time it began last month, AirTM had already registered more than 168,000 Venezuelans living in the country and as many as 40,000 more living abroad and sending money home.  So significant is the Venezuelan population that those users now conduct about 60,000 transactions per month using AirTM, according to Josh Kliot, AirTM's head of engagement and operations, or about 60 percent of its entire business.  In a related push, AirTM also partnered with four Venezuela-based non-governmental organizations as part of the newly launched AirTM Foundation, aiming to serve a wide range of humanitarian needs with donations through zcash and other supported payment methods.  To make it easier to connect to peers around the world willing to buy the rapidly deflating bolivars with zcash, the partnership between ZECC and AirTM further includes a marketing investment from both companies, promotion through their various communications channels, and the waiver of AirTM's 20 percent cut throughout the duration of the partnership. (AirTM's $0.30 transaction fee is still in place.)  In addition, ZECC is conducting a review of AirTM's user experience and providing feedback about how to make the interaction more user-friendly to non-technical users. Wilcox described the review of AirTM's interface for exchanging bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptos as ""a community contribution about how we can make cryptocurrency more accessible.""  So far, only about 500 zcash users have conducted a total 1,000 transactions in Venezuela on AirTM since the March 8 launch. But Kliot said he expects that to change based on what the partners have learned from the process.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The initial 30 days are for us to gauge how best to scale our marketing efforts. We expect a substantial increase in the following 2 months.""  The age of the petro  The team-up comes as the Venezuelan government is looking for ways around various sanctions by launching its own cryptocurrency, called the petro, which supposedly raised as much as $5 billion through a sale in February.  But according to Wilcox, Venezuelan citizens do not trust the petro any more than they trust the bolivar.  ""Zcash is an open source decentralized system where the supply and behavior of the network are part of an open global consensus, whereas the petro is part of a construct and under the control of the Venezuelan government,"" said Wilcox.  To be fair, zcash is not what many people would consider an ideal store of value either. Like nearly all cryptocurrencies, it fluctuates wildly against the dollar.  But zcash's privacy features made it an appealing way to quickly move from rapidly depreciating bolivars into the more stable U.S. dollars held at AirTM.  ""It's legal for Venezuelans to hold USD,"" Kliot wrote in an email. But ""they may want to hide their ID,"" to avoid being detected buying dollars ""by an unofficial means – ie. exchanging bolivars for USD at the free-market rate vs. the government's official (artificial) rate.""  Underscoring the direness of the situation in Venezuela, a trip to the grocery store can now cost far more than the minimumhttps://panampost.com/sabrina-martin/2018/01/04/new-monthly-minimum-wage-in-venezuela-barely-enough-to-buy-daily-cup-of-coffee/ monthly salary, according to a local AirTM zcash user who spoke with CoinDesk via an encrypted messaging platform.  According to this source, a self-identified economist in his 40's who spoke on condition of anonymity, some citizens have resorted to using cartons of eggs as a store of value.  The source sent CoinDesk a copy of a receipt from last month in which two kilograms of bananas, cookies, a half-kilogram of white cheese, 2 liters of orange juice and 2 liters of corn oil cost 1,981,000 bolivars, or about $39.00.  Given those high costs of living, zcash's relatively low transaction fees make it a more appealing cryptocurrency to Venezuelans compared to bitcoin, the economist said.  ""People use bitcoin for savings but not for daily purchases,"" he said. ""That is the opportunity for help on crypto with easy to use wallets and low fees.""  Sanctions evasion?  All this work is taking place against a complicated backdrop of regulations, sanctions and attempts by the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to evade them.  Earlier this month, President Donald Trump forbade anyone in the U.S. from buying or dealing with the ""petro.""  But as long as zcash — or any support to Venezuela — doesn't interact with the petro, with anyone on the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control's sanction list, or with debts owed by Maduro's government, the AirTM customer or foundation donor is safe.  That's according to Michaela Frai, a research associate at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, D.C., who specializes in Venezuela policy. But Frai cautioned that it's the company's responsibility to make sure those conditions are met.  ""Any U.S. company which helps provide funds to Venezuelans, however, would still have the burden of ensuring the funding is not reaching Venezuelan officials,"" she said. Further, ""the anonymity of the transactions does raise compliance risks.""  According to AirTM founder Steckel, this is exactly where the company's AML/KYC policy comes into play.  ""We're not touching or establishing a relationship with any Venezuela companies, banks, or the government,"" he said. ""We're just working with the people.""  A bigger problem than U.S. regulations could be the Venezuelan government, which may not look kindly on this particular application of cryptocurrency.  When asked about the possibility of losing access to Venezuela, Steckel said:  ""We are concerned, but that has been a concern for the last three years.""

""These platforms, and any businesses that allow coins/tokens that are securities to trade on them, may be offside securities laws,"" she added.  Under Ontario law, exchanges must apply for recognition by the commision.

None of the platforms the OSC is looking into have been legally recognized as exchanges in the province, nor have any of them been granted an exemption from the regulation.  The commission indicated that its effort isn't a full-bore investigation, as Rose made it clear that at this stage, the OSC is only ""gathering information about [the platforms'] activities.""  The OSC recently published a document laying out its priorities for the current fiscal year, with a noticeable focus on cryptocurrencies.
