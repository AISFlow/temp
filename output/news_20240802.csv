31861102,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632881,1722639617,‘Not All Hope Is Lost’: Crypto Analyst Weighs In On The Market’s Performance,"As the crypto market faces another drop, a pessimistic sentiment surged again. Some investors seem to fear that altcoins won’t take off this cycle and that they have lost their chance of profiting from the bull run. However, renowned analyst Altcoin Sherpa weighed in on the matter, suggesting that the market is set up to “do well” in the coming months. What Makes This Cycle Not Like Others? A few months ago, Altcoin Sherpa addressed the pessimistic sentiment brewing among some sectors of the crypto community. In an X post, the analyst asserted that Altcoins had to “cool off” for a few months before resuming the bull run. He also emphasized that this cycle differed from previous ones. Related Reading: Solana Looks ‘Ripe To Push Higher’, Is A Mania-Like Rally To $600 Coming? At the time, Sherpa highlighted that altcoins’ performance didn’t meet expectations during the first part of the bull run. Additionally, he suggested the market was heavily affected by the overabundance of projects and fragmented liquidity. This cycle, attention has been mostly captured by a few sectors like memecoins and AI tokens. In a new X thread, Sherpa reaffirmed his previous analysis. “This has definitely been a weird cycle so far; not similar at all to 2021 or 2017,” the analyst said. He pointed out that crypto investors “aren’t really up that much” despite Bitcoin (BTC) nearing all-time high (ATH) prices. Due to the singularities of this cycle, recommending “DCA and just holding the projects that you like and holding forever” is no longer an option for the analyst. The overabundance of tokens makes predicting the cycle winners “very hard,” which makes “picking your shitcoins pretty important.” As a result, the analyst suggested that investors learn some trading concepts, study momentum, and understand market dynamics. To Sherpa, understanding the market is key, “now more than ever”, so that investors can be prepared for “when the market REALLY starts to move later this year.” But I think that slower times like these is where it’s important to learn and educate yourself for the coming moves. Crypto Market Is Down But “Not All Hope Is Lost” Sherpa emphasized that the crypto market will resume its bullish performance in the coming months. “The good thing is that BTC is still going to break ATH later this year and $ETH is also going to do well,” read the post. The analyst disagreed with those who believe that Altcoins will have an altseason reminiscent of previous cycles and that we are early in the bull market. To him, it is “very unlikely” that all altcoins will go “to full send like in 2021” or even 2017. Despite the cycle differences, he considers most cryptocurrencies might have a decent performance compared to current prices. Moreover, he deemed that some altcoins will have remarkable rallies. Related Reading: New Memecoin Sensation Neiro Hits $200 Million Market Cap In Four Days In the post, sherpa predicted that the crypto market will have a massive Q4, as it historically does. Ultimately, investors will seemingly get another opportunity to profit from the bull market: As I said, not all hope is lost. We’re going to have a huge Q4 as we always do. The macro-environment should be solid and BTC should break all-time highs, which sets up for a huge November-January time period. Be lucky that you get another chance at this bull market.

Features like in-depth block data, verified smart contracts, and full API access are some of the things Arbitrum users will have access to because of this. The platform’s DAppScout feature will also help users filter dApps with low-security scores, improving user experience while giving them the ability to keep their funds safe from malicious actors. ArbOS 31 ‘Bianca’ To Bring More Devs On-Board ArbOS 31 is a proposal that would expand Arbitrum’s position within the dev space. If it passes, several key features will be added like Stylus VM which will enable the Arbitrum chain to support more programming languages like Rust and C++. To make it simple, Stylus VM will be used by devs to code on their language of expertise rather than switching to Solidity, Arbitrum’s native coding language. This change will make smart contract deployment easier as it makes any smart contract written on the platform be compatible with existing Solidity-based smart contracts. The proposal also covers the implementation of Passkeys, a password-less system of identification to protect user data and funds, and the Nova Fee Router which will make the collection of fees on the Arbitrum DAO more efficient. Arbitrum has also announced that voting for the proposal is now live. A Long Time Recovery For ARB? The market’s bearishness might continue until middle of August, which poses an important question to ARB bulls: whether to attempt slowing the bears down now or attempt at a later date.

42417531,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYeUv,1722634074,On-Device Proofs Solve DePIN Verification Challenges,"As DePINs revolutionize the way certain types of infrastructure are delivered, they face a significant hurdle in ensuring the integrity and reliability of their operations.  The good news is that zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are emerging as a powerful solution.  The Verification Challenge  DePINs rely on numerous types of verification for their day-to-day functions. From confirming performance capacity and location to validating actual services provided and computational accuracy, reliable verification is essential for DePINs to operate and be trusted. In recognition of this, we at the peer-to-peer ZKP network NovaNet published The DePIN Verification Handbook to cover the wide range of verification requirements.  Wyatt Benno and Houman Shadab are cofounders of the zero knowledge proof network NovaNet. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  The consequences of inadequate verification can be severe. Without robust checks in place, nodes or service providers may receive payouts on false pretenses. Networks can become vulnerable to gaming, and users risk adopting poorly performing or unstable platforms.  Earlier this year, fraudsters sent fake uptime data to IO.net to earn rewards. They did this by falsifying the existence of 1.8 million GPUs. Unverified GPUs on IO.net currently outnumber verified GPUs by more than 3 to 1, likely reflecting an industry-wide challenge.  Current Verification Methods  Unfortunately, existing DePIN verification methods are often found lacking.  Many verification methods lack sufficient accuracy, as evidenced by the ongoing threat of spoofing GPUs, locations, and other data. Likewise, policing bad actors with community-driven blacklists and terms of usage enforcement has its limitations.  Existing verification methods are also not completely trustless, which undermines the ethos of DePINs  Some methods prove too costly. For example, DePINs often use and must compensate validators that have no other purpose than to repeat or double-check the work already performed by service nodes. Validators may also cause DePINs to be sluggish by requiring additional operations to take place.  Privacy preservation is another critical concern when it comes to DePIN verification. Any time data is put on blockchain or sent to a validator for verification, that data is no longer private.  Existing verification methods are also not completely trustless, which undermines the decentralized ethos of DePINs.  Enter Zero Knowledge Proofs  This is where zero-knowledge proofs come to the rescue. Next generation ZKPs present not just an improvement, but often the only viable way to provide robust verification for DePINs while maintaining speed, efficiency, decentralization, and privacy.  ZKPs enable a prover to demonstrate the truth of a statement to a verifier with near-absolute certainty without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself. Whereas a traditional verification method may need access to confidential data to verify whether a DePIN node meets network requirements, ZKPs use cryptographic methods that verify whether specific conditions have been met without revealing how the condition was satisfied.  For DePINs, this means that network participants can prove they're adhering to the rules and providing the services they claim without compromising sensitive data.  Proofs Must be Generated on Devices  To truly preserve privacy, ZKPs must be generated locally on DePIN devices or the networks that provide services. Sending data to validator nodes or a separate prover system robs ZKPs of their “zero knowledge” property.  Proofs should ideally be generated on sensors, location trackers, compute nodes, and other devices. Local proving ensures that proof data remains in the hands of the network participants and doesn’t centralize operations – aligning with networks’ core principles. Proof verification can take place locally, on cloud networks, or on chain, depending on how the network is structured.  ZKPs must be very memory efficient to be generated locally for privacy. Fortunately, recent innovations in ZKP design enable highly efficient proving. Folding schemes, for example, allow proof generation to be broken into small steps suitable for local proving.  However, memory-efficient ZKPs have been overlooked by the industry due to its focus on scaling Ethereum. At NovaNet, by contrast, memory efficiency is core to our technology enabling proofs to be generated in constrained environments such as browsers and consumer devices. As a result, the prover network operates peer-to-peer without adding centralization to DePINs.  The Path Forward  As DePINs continue to grow and evolve, the adoption of zero knowledge proofs for verification will likely become not just an advantage, but a necessity. Networks that embrace this technology will be better positioned to offer reliable, efficient, and truly decentralized services while protecting the privacy of their users and providers.  At NovaNet, we are excited to help make the goals of DePINs a reality.

31854811,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632787,1722628821,Fox’s Tucker Carlson Drops Bombshell: Did The CIA Create Bitcoin?,"The real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, has remained a mystery despite Bitcoin being a decade and a half old. It has become the best kept secret in crypto, leading to various theories of who the creator might be. Many theories have pointed to prominent figures, with software developer Craig Wright claiming he’s the creator. However, Fox Television’s Tucker Carlson has gone down a different route, fingering a United States intelligence agency as the creator. Did The CIA Create Bitcoin? The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is known to have far reach worldwide, leading to a lot of notable events being attributed to them. This time around, they are being pointed to once again as the Bitcoin creator by Tucker Carlson at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Will Rise Over 7,200% To Reach $10, Here’s Why Speaking at a private event at the conference, Carlson shared his beliefs on who Satoshi Nakamoto really is. The Fox presenter believes that the CIA is the creator of Bitcoin. Carlson called out crypto supporters for being able to answer all crypto-related questions except the creator of Bitcoin. According to him, it is quite obvious who the Bitcoin creator is and it is the Central Intelligence Agency. Carlson also draws on a previous experience, noting that the National Security Agency (CIA) had spied on him through the Signal app. Why this accusation is serious is that Signal has become known worldwide as a completely private message app. However, Carlson believes that the NSA was still able to spy on him using this app. Comparing the two scenarios of Bitcoin and the messaging app, Carlson says, “It’s like Signal, they got there first.” Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto? The real identify of Satoshi Nakamoto has managed to remain secret despite different theories and speculations on who it might be. There are some who believe it is billionaire Elon Musk or NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, others like Tucker Carlson, believes it’s the work of US intelligence agencies to spy on people’s transactions. However, only one person has claimed that he is the creator of Bitcoin and that is Craig Wright. Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Out Of 6-Year Triangle, But Is A Rally To $1 Possible? For years, the computer scientist has maintained that he created Bitcoin, eventually going to court in a bid to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto. However, the High Court of England and Wales found Wright to be an impersonator, forcing him to admit that he is not Satoshi Nakamoto. This comes as the court said that Wright’s evidence were full of lies in a bid to make people believe he created Bitcoin, going as far as forging documents to do so. The court found Wright’s actions to be “a most serious abuse,” and has put measures in place to forbid Wright from entering any more legal proceedings in his claim to be the Bitcoin creator.

42417526,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYeRp,1722626456,"As Trump Suggests Crypto as a Fix to U.S. Debt, Harris Camp Highlights His Remarks","Former President Donald Trump argued the benefits of the U.S. government jumping onto the crypto boat on Friday (transcript below).  Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign flagged Trump's comments on Bitcoin, specifically when he mentioned the token as a potential savior for the country's indebtedness.  Harris' bid for the White House, while in its infancy, hasn't yet addressed a policy view on crypto.  Former President Donald Trump heaped more praise on the ""very, very smart people"" of the crypto industry in an interview broadcast on Friday, suggesting that the U.S. embracing Bitcoin {{BTC}} could aid in addressing the $35 trillion U.S. national debt.  ""Who knows? Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion dollars, hand them a little crypto check, right?"" Trump suggested to Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo in an interview. ""We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion.""  Though Vice President Kamala Harris, his presumptive Democratic opponent in the presidential race, hasn't yet made any policy statements about her own view on cryptocurrency, one of her campaign accounts on X – the ""rapid response"" campaign effort – seemed to slam Trump's view by airing his comments.  Most of Trump's remarks suggested his primary interest is in the U.S.'s competitive position with China, though he also issued a dig at President Joe Biden's administration and its crypto position.  ""Biden's trying to shut it down– Biden doesn't have the intellect to shut it down,"" Trump said. ""Can you imagine this guy's telling you to shut something down like that? He has no idea what the hell it is. But if we don't embrace it, it's going to be embraced by other people.""  So far, the former president has drawn hefty support from prominent crypto advocates. There are signs that some in the sector are also considering support for Harris, though they're eager to hear what she thinks.  Below is a transcript of Trump's answers to Bartiromo's questions on crypto:  Donald Trump: ""Crypto is a very interesting thing. Very high-level in certain ways, intellectually very high-level. But if we don't do it, China's going to do it. China's going to do it anyway. But if we don't do it, China's doing it. China is already doing it, and if we don't do it, other countries are going to do it. So we might as well be at the forefront. And there are people in crypto that are very, very smart people who do love our country, and they think it's-- they think it's good. Who knows? Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion dollars, hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion."" …  ""It's already prominent. It's moving along. It's very loosely regulated. That's one of the reasons it's moving along. But it is a different form of a currency, and it's going to end up benefiting the country. But if we shut it down like, you know, Biden's trying to shut it down-- Biden doesn't have the intellect to shut it down. Can you imagine this guy's telling you to shut something down like that? He has no idea what the hell it is. But if we don't embrace it, it's going to be embraced by other people. You know, it's a massive thing already. Did you read where it's bigger than any company in the world already, if you look at the market. It's bigger than many countries. It's a very big thing. If we're not going to be the leader– we have the people that are the leaders. I know some of them. They're very smart. And if we don't embrace it, other countries are going to embrace it. Other countries will anyway, but we can be the leader. We might as well be the leader.""

31851796,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632831,1722623439,Research Firm Predicts Bullish Bitcoin Breakout For Q4: 4 Key Reasons,"Matrixport, a digital asset financial services group born from Bitmain, an industry leader in Bitcoin mining, projects a bullish breakout for Bitcoin in the upcoming fourth quarter of 2024. In their latest research report titled “Matrix on Target: Bullish Prospects for Bitcoin in Q4,” the firm provides four reasons to be bullish in the upcoming weeks. #1 Narrowing Trading Range Signals Breakout Matrixport’s analysis begins with a technical assessment of the recent Bitcoin price action. Historically, Q3 has posed significant challenges with frequent breakout failures. This year, however, Bitcoin has demonstrated a notably narrowing trading range, a pattern typically preceding significant price volatility. “The constriction of price movement is often a precursor to dynamic price shifts, suggesting an impending breakout,” the report notes. #2 Monetary Policy As A Bitcoin Catalyst A pivotal aspect of the report focuses on the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate policies. Currently, the Fed maintains a rate of 5.25%, in contrast to a 3.0% inflation rate. Related Reading: Would Bitcoin Fall Below $60,000 Again? Analyst Reveals A Concerning Trend For BTC However, recent comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have ignited speculations of a possible rate cut with the September FOMC meeting. “If inflation follows the projected path, an interest rate cut in the September meeting is possible,” Powell indicated. Matrixport’s analysis correlates these potential rate cuts with increased market liquidity, which historically benefits risk assets like Bitcoin. “Each quarter-point reduction by the Fed could inject substantial liquidity into the market, enhancing the appeal of non-traditional assets,” the report elaborates. #3 Impact Of The US Presidential Election The upcoming US Presidential election also features prominently in Matrixport’s forecast. The firm speculates on the impact of a potential re-election of Donald Trump, noting his previous administration’s relatively hands-off approach to crypto regulation. “A re-election of Trump could renew vigor in regulatory reform or laxity, providing a less uncertain landscape for crypto innovations,” the report suggests. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO On Bitcoin: ‘We’re Not Bullish Enough’ – Here’s Why Trump’s recent appearance at the Nashville Bitcoin conference, although not meeting some expectations, was perceived largely positively, signaling potential supportive stances on cryptocurrency if re-elected. Trump promised to sell the Bitcoin previously confiscated by the US government and establish a “national stockpile” of Bitcoin. As reported by NewsBTC, this action, if it comes to fruition, could have substantial implications for the game theory of BTC. It could spark a race for a quick allocation, with nations printing money to buy as much Bitcoin as possible. #4 Seasonal Patterns Of Bitcoin The report also delves into the seasonal patterns affecting Bitcoin’s performance, highlighting the typically sluggish months of August and September. This pattern is attributed to lower trading volumes during the summer vacation period and market caution in anticipation of economic indicators and central bank policy decisions in the fall. However, Matrixport posits that this year’s unique economic and political context could disrupt these usual trends, setting the stage for an unseasonal rally. Conclusively, Matrixport maintains a cautiously optimistic stance for Bitcoin’s performance in Q4 2024. “Considering the confluence of a narrowing price range, likely easing of US monetary policy, and the potential impacts of the US Presidential election, we are poised to witness a significant bullish breakout in Bitcoin’s price trajectory,” the report concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $64,730.

42417532,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYeZ3,1722622359,How DePINs Address AI's GPU Gap and Ethics Problems,"With the explosion of generative artificial intelligence projects, computational power has become a hotly contested resource. As AI becomes more ubiquitous and the race for graphic processing unit (GPU) supplies intensifies, the need for wider and more democratized access to computing power has become an urgent priority for non-MAANG companies. Combine this red-hot demand with scarcity that is quickly transforming into resource exclusivity, and the ugly likely result is an AI ecosystem is largely being molded by a small handful of massive tech corporations.  Mark Rydon is the Co-Founder and Head of Strategy at Aethir, a decentralized enterprise-grade cloud computing network. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  If we are to avoid this, the future of AI, and its ethical implications, hinges on the ability to distribute these resources widely rather than relying on a handful of corporations to monopolize this power.  Addressing the Supply Side of Compute Demands  As the demand for computing surges, the current infrastructure struggles to keep pace. As reported in the Washington Post, several states are running short of power. Northern Virginia, for example, needs several large nuclear power plants to serve all the new data centers planned and under construction.  Additionally, the escalating costs of model training raise critical questions about the future of AI development: Where will this necessary computing power come from? China recently announced that it aims to boost its computing capacity by 50% in the next decade and a half, but this avenue won't be available to all.  One way to address this is through a decentralized model.  Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) can be used to aggregate underutilized enterprise GPUs and put them to use, redistributing previously inaccessible supply back into the market. They can also help leverage the latent compute capacity in consumer devices, creating a vast, accessible network of GPUs that can be utilized for AI training and other compute-intensive tasks. These approaches democratize the supply and access to computational resources, challenging traditional GPU monopolies and fostering innovation.  Moreover, distributed infrastructure optimizes resource use, ensuring that unused computational power can contribute to significant AI projects. This approach maximizes efficiency and aligns with ESG principles of reducing energy waste and environmental impacts associated with large-scale data centers.  Unlocking New Data Oceans  Not only can DePINs address the supply and resource challenge that drives compute accessibility. They can also help unlock new data oceans that can provide the diverse datasets needed to train more specialized, robust and inclusive AI models. This approach enhances the quality of AI systems and promotes data sovereignty and privacy.  DePINs use blockchain technology and advanced encryption methods to ensure data remains secure and ownership is clearly defined. This decentralized approach broadens the spectrum of information, including that of underrepresented regions and communities, leading to more accurate and inclusive AI models.  Furthermore, DePINs give data owners more control over their information, enhancing privacy while encouraging widespread data sharing. For instance, consider a healthcare scenario where a patient’s data from various hospitals and clinics can be securely shared without compromising on privacy. By leveraging DePINs, researchers can access a rich, diverse dataset that enhances their ability to develop better diagnostic tools and treatment plans. Similarly, in the environmental science field, DePINs can facilitate sharing climate data from various sensors, often located on private homes and properties worldwide, leading to more accurate models and predictions.  The Ethical Imperative  It’s also worth noting how the concentration of AI development within a few Big Tech companies raises significant ethical concerns. When advanced AI model training and deployment are monopolized by a few entities, it restricts AI's potential to benefit all. This centralized control can reinforce existing inequalities and curtail the scope of AI's positive impact on society.  The concentration of power can lead to biased AI systems that reflect the perspectives and priorities of a narrow segment of the population, exacerbating social and economic disparities. Such a scenario contradicts AI's democratizing potential, where innovations should ideally serve diverse communities and address a wide range of societal challenges.  Democratizing access to GPU resources is not just an imperative for the industry – it is an ethical necessity. By ensuring that researchers, startups, and innovators worldwide can access the computational power required to develop AI technologies, we can promote a more inclusive and equitable AI landscape. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang who coined the term ""Sovereign AI,"" also emphasizes that nations must create AI to ensure cultural preservation. This broader access encourages diverse perspectives in AI development, leading to fairer, more balanced, and more effective AI solutions that can benefit society.  Impact on Innovation  The potential impact of decentralized GPU infrastructure on innovation and research, particularly in emerging markets, cannot be overstated. For instance, our recent collaboration with TensorOpera AI to advance large-scale language model (LLM) training on a decentralized cloud infrastructure showcased the tangible benefits of this approach. By harnessing the power of decentralized GPUs, TensorOpera can now conduct significant LLM training runs without relying on traditional, centralized resources. This democratization of computing power now paves the way for innovative projects and research endeavors previously unattainable due to resource constraints.  Bridging the compute divide  Decentralized GPU infrastructure represents a pivotal step towards bridging the compute divide and democratizing access to AI resources. By distributing computational power more equitably, we can ensure that the benefits of AI are realized by a broader spectrum of society, thereby increasing innovation across the board. This approach addresses the ethical challenges posed by AI monopolies and fosters global innovation and research, particularly in emerging markets.  As we move forward, embracing decentralized models and leveraging latent computational capacities will be crucial in meeting the growing demands of AI development. The future of AI depends on our ability to build a more inclusive, equitable and decentralized computational landscape.

42417528,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYeVx,1722619937,"Coinbase's 'Solid' Earnings May Get Derailed by Low Volume, Fed Headwinds, Analysts Say","Coinbase's second-quarter earnings were 'solid,' Wall Street analysts said, but could continue to slow in the third quarter.  The exchange reported total revenue of $1.45 billion but revenue from transaction fees slipped 27%.  If that trend continues, revenue could be even lower in the third quarter, one analysts said.  Wall Street analysts characterized Coinbase’s (COIN) second-quarter earnings as ‘solid’, given the industry's downtick in trading volume - the exchange’s biggest source of income historically.  “It was a solid quarter in what was a far less robust market than we witnessed in 1Q24,” J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note on Friday. The bank maintained its neutral rating on the stock.  Similarly, Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, who rates the crypto exchange outperform, wrote: “We believe COIN has found the formula to remain profitable despite earnings volatility, and be a resounding leader in this space.”  The San Francisco-based firm reported total revenue of $1.45 billion versus an average estimate of about $1.4 billion, according to FactSet data. Revenue from transaction fees slipped 27% from the previous quarter due to a 28% lower volume during the quarter.  Coinbase shares were down more than 3% as digital assets and broader equity markets fell on Friday.  Looking ahead, the company seems optimistic about some of its other ventures to bring in more capital, such as its offering of derivatives products and Coinbase Wallet, its self-custody wallet.  “Management indicated there are other revenue streams that are beginning to have an impact on the company's blended average take rate which are not included in spot trading volumes but are in revenues,” analysts at British bank Barclays, which maintains an “underweight” rating, noted.  Overall, the analysts got a positive sentiment from Coinbase’s management call which highlighted the expansion of several strategic growth initiatives and a more friendly political environment.  However, Oppenheimer’s Owen Lau notes that if the current trend continues, revenue in the third quarter will likely be lower than the previous quarter combined with likely lower interest rates by the Federal Reserve in October. Coinbase also predicted that operating expenses will remain high in the next quarter due to high spending in sales and marketing.  'Murky' macro  With the Federal Reserve hinting at rate cuts as early as September and recent employment numbers showing a softening job market, much of the exchange’s performance towards the end of the year could depend on the macroeconomic landscape.  “What will be interesting to see is whether crypto will be correlated with the stock market – which, if it is, then things could be seriously murky,” said Brian D. Evans, founder and CEO of venture capital firm BDE Ventures. “But if crypto shows a correlation with gold, then upwards should be the trajectory.”  “With these BTC and ETH ETFs in the U.S. and other markets, we could see the gold correlation actually play out, meaning that crypto could boom. This would be the perfect scenario for Coinbase, which experienced decent second-quarter numbers,” he said.  The U.S. added just 114,000 jobs in July, well below estimates of 175,000, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  As a result, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped 15 basis points to the lowest percentage since December, signaling markets fear a slowdown in economic growth.  The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates during its meeting in September with traders betting on a 70% chance of a 50 basis point.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/02/coinbases-solid-earnings-may-get-derailed-by-low-volume-fed-headwinds-analysts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d6748c3b8216e30803324b9820280688fbeefad-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31848789,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632837,1722618027,"Bitcoin Down But Not Out: BTC To $700,000 Highly Probable Says Analyst","Bitcoin remains volatile at spot rates. Despite the spectacular recovery yesterday, August 1, the downtrend remains, at least for now. Specifically, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, there could be more growth once prices break $70,000. Before then, traders are closely monitoring price action aware that there could be more losses, pushing the coin below $60,000. Amid this, some analysts are bullish in the long term, ignoring short-term price volatility. Bitcoin Remains Bullish Despite Recent Price Drops In a post on X, Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, said that though bears might succeed in the short to medium term, unwinding gains and progress made in the first half of the year, the path of least resistance in the long term remains northward. Related Reading: Polygon Price Risks Plunge With 90 Million MATIC Tokens Selling At $0.5 As on-chain data reveals increased movement among long-term holders (LTHs), shifting coins to top exchanges could heap more pressure on prices. Even so, Woo thinks that in the years to come, Bitcoin could range between $700,000 in the lower level and as high as $24 million, assuming it finds maximum adoption. The analyst said this bullish prediction is primarily based on the bullish assumption that Bitcoin would capture anywhere between 3% and 100% of the global wealth, which stands at over $500 trillion. Woo says the lower limit, 3%, is the upper bound of the recommended exposure laid out by Fidelity for institutions seeking to invest in the world’s most valuable coin. If most institutions allocate just 3% of their portfolio to Bitcoin via derivatives as spot ETFs, the probability of the coin soaring to $700,000 will be high. On the other hand, assuming everyone chooses to move their wealth to Bitcoin, divesting from the current traditional portfolios and choosing BTC, then the coin will explode to as high as $24 million. This assumption is, even according to Woo, improbable but cannot be discounted. BTC Is Transitioning, Spot ETFs Crucial For Growth Woo, in the post on X, said at spot rates, Bitcoin is in a transition. Looking at adoption charts, the coin is moving from the early to late majority adoption. Though in the nascent stages, a successful, hitch-free evolution will be crucial in driving prices even higher. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Won’t Skyrocket After Ripple-SEC Ruling: Crypto Pundit The key driver and catalyst of adoption in this vital stage will be the adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved this derivative product, one analyst has picked a direct correlation between bullish swings and inflows into spot ETFs. For this reason, how institutions perceive BTC and allocate funds will be critical.

The broker's analyst noted the company's share price outperformance since adoption of bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in August 2020.  Since then, the stock's performance was significantly better than other assets like bitcoin or the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, Palmer noted.  Wall Street brokerage Benchmark defended MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin plan and raised the stock's price target to $2,150 - the highest among analysts - even after the company reported a revenue miss during the second quarter.  Since adopting bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in August 2020, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor-led company has appreciated 1,206%, Benchmark’s analyst Mark Palmer wrote in a research report on Friday. The stock's performance, since then, stands in contrast to bitcoin {{BTC}}, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq which have gained 442% 64% and 60%, respectively, he noted.  “While MSTR's approach has had plenty of detractors, including those who have asked why anyone would buy its shares rather than simply buying bitcoin, management has responded to criticism by pointing to the scoreboard,” Palmer, who has a buy rating on the stock, said.  MicroStrategy's shares were down about 1.2% on Friday, relatively outperforming other crypto-linked stocks. The bitcoin price and the broader CoinDesk 20 Index fell more than 3% in the last 24 hours.  Doubling down on its bitcoin strategy, the firm on Thursday introduced ""Bitcoin Yield,"" a key performance indicator that tracks the percentage change in the ratio of the company’s bitcoin holdings to its diluted shares outstanding. The new metric will make it easier for investors to track the firm’s bitcoin strategy's performance, Palmer said.  MicroStrategy’s bitcoin yield year-to-date was 12.2%, the company said on the earnings statement. It targets 4%-8% in each of the next three years.

A weak July U.S. jobs report earlier Friday sent bond yields and the dollar plunging – the sort of action that often sends risk assets like stocks and bitcoin into the green, but it's not the case today. Just ahead of the noon hour in the U.S., the Nasdaq is down 3.1% and S&P 500 2.7%, led by an 11% post-earnings decline in Amazon (AMZN) and a 5% drop in Nvidia (NVDA). The Volatility Index (VIX) is up a whopping 54% today.  Bitcoin managed a small gain to above $65,000 at one point but has succumbed to the risk-off mood, tumbling back to $62,900 at press time, down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index is suffering even more, off just shy of 3%. Among those leading the way lower are ether {{ETH}}, solana {{SOL}}, uniswap {{UNI}} and chainlink {{LINK}}, each sporting declines of 4%-5%.  Setting the dour mood even before the U.S. jobs report was a continuing plunge in Japan, where the Nikkei fell 5.8% on Friday following a 4%+ decline a day earlier. The selloff appears to be in response to the most minor of monetary tightening actions on Wednesday by the Bank of Japan, which lifted its benchmark lending rate to 0.25% from a previous range of 0%-0.1%.  Genesis Trading bankruptcy rears its head again  Adding to the bearish action was the movement of 16,600 bitcoin (roughly $1.1 billion) and 166,300 ether (roughly $521 million) from wallets linked with bankrupt Genesis Trading. This action, according to Arkham Intelligence, is likely for in-kind repayments to creditors.  Indeed, at least one creditor took to X to announce that he had received a modest distribution from the bankrupt Genesis estate.  Having already suffered the sale of 50,000 bitcoin by the German government in early July, the beginning of distributions from bankrupt exchange Mt.

I think the real highlight was Bitcoin treasury strategies by publicly traded companies. The private sector's adoption of BTC as a treasury asset may drive government acceptance and regulatory support for Bitcoin, potentially leading to massive price appreciation. I cover some nuances about these BTC treasuries from the conference and synthesized from research. The Bitcoin 2024 Conference took place in Nashville last week. This is an annual event sponsored by BTC Inc, the company behind the popular publication Bitcoin Magazine and the parent company to the venture fund UTXO Management. While I personally did not make it to Nashville, I went through many different clips and posts on social media to get a sense of what was happening. Bitcoin Magazine posts all the keynote speeches on YouTube, so anyone could get the primary source over there too. Perhaps the most talked about aspect of Bitcoin 2024 was the participation of two POTUS candidates: Robert Kennedy Jr. and former-POTUS Donald Trump. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming also made an appearance. All three have alluded to or explicitly mentioned a Bitcoin Reserve for the United States, much to the excitement of the Bitcoin community. The narrative of the political importance of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and crypto has been building over the course of this year. The SEC performed a rather high-profile pivot on their hawkishness on crypto when they approved the Ethereum spot ETFs in May. As I read more about the Bitcoin Conference, I began to realize that the most important stuff was not the highly publicized participation of politicians, including a former POTUS. An interesting fact is that Trump is actually the first US president in history to attend a conference on digital assets, so this was arguably a big stamp of credibility for the entirety of Bitcoin and crypto. I believe the real “signal” at the conference can be found in the panel involving Eric Semler from Semler Scientific (SMLR), Andrew Kang from MicroStrategy (MSTR), Simon Gerovich from MetaPlanet (TYO: 3350), and Dylan LeClair (moderating, from Bitcoin Magazine). The topic of the panel was Bitcoin Treasury strategies for corporations. My thesis is that corporate adoption of BTC as a treasury asset will be the most powerful driver of BTC returns in the coming years. While talks of a US strategic BTC reserve is interesting, I think people are getting very carried away on political campaign promises which are easy to make but tough to keep. Government or Private Sector? Here is why the corporate BTC treasuries are a big deal. The private sector leads and catalyzes government and regulatory acceptance. This has largely been the case in America. The utility of disruptive tech is first realized by the private sector and then, through either lobbying or raw popular sentiment (or both), laws are created which fit around the existing use cases of disruptive tech. This is more or less the pattern that tech companies have taken, how social media has developed, and now we are seeing it develop with electric vehicles and crypto. Being anti-crypto and anti-Bitcoin is politically unwise because people who find crypto useful are going to be extremely hostile towards politicians who try to flippantly dismiss their livelihood. Incentives drive human action. At some point along the adoption curve, it becomes hard for the incentives to be anti-crypto to seriously compete against the incentives to be pro-crypto. What is actually driving the private sector to see the value of Bitcoin, which is compelling politicians to respond with energetic support? There are many things. Jobs are probably the biggest. If you kill jobs, you are killing your own political career. Beyond that, people want Bitcoin for its properties as a superior asset class, which is quickly being recognized for its unique quality of excelling at preserving long-term value. Any 4-year period has seen monumental gains in the price of BTC, signifying its role as a superior long-term store of value. People are recognizing it, and they want this superior asset class. This is why BlackRock helped push the spot ETFs to approval, even as the SEC foot-dragged on Grayscale for years . Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries The Bitcoin Conference showed three publicly traded companies which have found success in a Bitcoin treasury strategy. MSTR, SMLR, and MetaPlanet (which is publicly traded in Japan) have implemented Bitcoin treasuries and all of them saw notable increases in their share price thanks to Bitcoin. Representatives from each company talked about how they arrived at their Bitcoin treasury strategy and what they are doing to make it work. I believe this was the most impactful moment of the Bitcoin Conference because it suggests the beginning of the private sector’s adoption of BTC as a pristine treasury asset. I think that given enough time, this is an extremely compelling incentive which will eventually force government acceptance and regulatory dovishness for Bitcoin. In short, the politicians were there to earn political brownie points with their speaking, but corporate adopters seeing success in BTC was the real signal. I think the corporate Bitcoin strategy is still something that confuses a lot of investors, especially those who are skeptical about BTC as an investable asset. I want to summarize some of the main takeaways from the video and also synthesize some other points based on my research about this topic. First of all, note that these three companies are not the only ones with Bitcoin treasuries. Bitcoin miners hold a lot of BTC, even after selling some of their proceeds to cover electricity and maintenance costs. Marathon ( MARA ) recently added to its BTC treasury and holds over 20,000 BTC now. For a much larger list of corporate Bitcoin treasuries, you can reference this website here . MSTR, SMLR, and MetaPlanet have core businesses totally unrelated to BTC, yet they chose to invest in BTC rather than issuing dividends, doing buybacks, or making acquisitions. It seems like their success will only cause more to follow, and this would be the real catalyst for explosive price appreciation in BTC. Hurdle Rates and What To Do With Excess Cash? The Bitcoin treasury strategy basically argues that the best use of cash is to purchase BTC. Traditionally, cash should be returned to the shareholders, either via dividends or buybacks. If not, cash should be reinvested into the business or used to acquire competitors to grow the top line. The main gist is that if you have unencumbered liquidity, you should spend it on increasing value. The breakthrough of the Bitcoin treasury strategy is observing that there is almost nothing which can easily outperform the CAGR of BTC. This standalone observation makes purchasing BTC with excess cash quite justifiable, in the perspective of someone running a Bitcoin treasury. You can think of this as using BTC itself as the hurdle rate. When evaluating different investments, think of their chance of outperforming BTC. If it cannot feasibly do so, just buy BTC instead. That’s the rough idea of the logical first step. Now, think about this in relation to the other four choices: dividends, buybacks, reinvest, and acquisitions. Buybacks and reinvest is just seeing if the CAGR of your business beats the CAGR of BTC. For nearly all publicly traded companies, this answer is no. Acquisitions are just evaluating the CAGR of other companies, so the answer is still no. Dividends are worse than buybacks because of double taxation, so it is even more value destructive to the shareholder. This means that anyone running a Bitcoin treasury is just going to prioritize buying BTC with their excess cash. Financing From the Capital Markets As soon as BTC becomes a hurdle rate to these companies, it now arguably makes sense to go to capital markets and raise more dollars to buy more BTC. This is what MSTR has been doing since 2021. It is also what SMLR is applying to do with their recent S3 Filing . The idea is to issue equity and debt to buy more BTC, because this is accretive to shareholders. This makes sense from a financial perspective when we return to the question of hurdle rates. If BTC is the hurdle rate under this strategy, then you should always try to get dollars at a lower cost of capital than BTC’s expected return. Since the cost of capital for a publicly traded company comes from equity and debt markets, and they are both based on the company’s CAGR (which we already established generally does not exceed that of BTC), it almost always makes sense under this logic to issue equity and debt to purchase BTC. Financing From Convertibles and Warrants While issuing equities and debt are interesting, I thought the most interesting part of this discussion was exploiting the volatility of BTC and leveraged balance sheets with BTC to raise money at even better costs of capital via options markets. This seems a bit convoluted at first, but it's actually very interesting and reasonable. Convertible debt is debt with an equity call option attached and given to the lender. Option values are determined by implied volatility. When a company has BTC and debt on the balance sheet, its equity starts to resemble a leveraged version of BTC. Since BTC is very volatile, this means the stock has a very, very high implied volatility. That increases the value of the options embedded within the convertible debt, which justifies a lower interest rate on the convertible. This is precisely how MSTR is borrowing at under 1% interest rates to buy BTC, while the risk-free rate is 5%. The convertibles give MSTR money upfront to buy BTC, and if the conversion option is ever exercised, the company will get another cash inflow at the exercise price, at that point in the future. The same can be said about issuing warrants. These are basically extremely long-dated call options on the stock. Again, the higher stock volatility due to embedded leveraged BTC exposure allows the warrants to be priced quite high, which allows the company issuing them to receive more capital upfront. I think the coolest part about these option variations for capital raises is that there is a small chance that it isn’t even dilutive. For instance, the share price might not grow enough to justify convertible debt holders to exercise their option, so in that case the company would have been borrowing at extremely low-interest rates for a multi-year period! Of course, given the core thesis behind a Bitcoin treasury is that BTC will go up, this might not be something that the company is counting on. But is all this dilution bad? This discussion must ultimately be received with the proper framing. You see, the endgame is, like many of the other things mentioned here, complicated. What is the Endgame? The endgame is to maximize value for the shareholder, but what does this look like for a company doing such an abnormal strategy? I think the simplest answer is to just maximize the amount of BTC per share. If this number is going up, then all of the actions that the company is taking is technically accretive. It’s a lot like a REIT issuing shares to buy more properties. If the portfolio is getting bigger and income is growing because there are more properties, then issuance was accretive. As long as BTC keeps increasing in dollar terms, a rising BTC per share means a rising book value per share (assuming no major changes to EBIT and EBITDA and no major changes on the balance sheet), which will justify a continued premium of share price to the underlying BTC held by the company. This is why MSTR trades at 2x its NAV of BTC holdings: MSTR is able to strategically take advantage of the capital markets to increase BTC per share. Holding shares of MSTR is in some sense better than just holding BTC because the BTC you own through MSTR shares will increase over time, while the BTC you hold by just holding BTC does not increase. It’s only if BTC goes down in dollar terms that the dollar value of book value will start to collapse. The leveraged capital structure of such companies can also work against the shareholder because it would be holding a higher beta against BTC. However, the collapse of BTC in dollar terms is mitigated and backstopped by the absolute scarcity of BTC. While dollars must continue to be printed for the US government to pay back its burgeoning debt load, BTC cannot be created like that. Also, as more companies start to do this, the buying pressure on BTC will not be able to support lower prices for BTC. So the real endgame is actually to hold the BTC forever. As more companies start to use this strategy to boost their balance sheets, more and more value will accrue to BTC and therefore to the balance sheets of earlier adopters. This might sound a bit like a Ponzi scheme, but in this case, there is no intention to “cash out” because the asset BTC has utility as a superior store of value, which is precisely the original intention of companies adopting this strategy: to preserve the value of the excess cash they have, sourced from either their operating business or from capital markets. Of course, not everyone will “never sell.” Some will adopt this strategy to get a short-term gain and then cash out. Others might sell when they realize a genuine investment opportunity to beat the CAGR of BTC. In which case, they will divest parts of the BTC treasury and commit the proceeds as capex for the business. (There will be tax implications for liquidating BTC, and these must be weighted against the expected return of the capex. At any rate, companies could also borrow against their BTC treasuries to unlock liquidity without creating taxable liabilities.) The point is that the long run trend of what will happen is, in my opinion, more than clear. The playbook for adding BTC to corporate treasuries is out. Every CFO who desires to deliver superior performance to shareholders has, at this point, multiple case studies to review. I think it will only be a matter of time before even more BTC is added to the treasuries of even more companies. That will be a lot of buying pressure. Risks BTC is a reflexive asset, and this thesis is highly dependent on the innate reflexivity of the whole system. If everyone tried to sell their BTC tomorrow, the price would obviously crash and a lot of shareholder value would be destroyed. I am certain that there is plenty of skepticism around a Bitcoin treasury strategy today. This skepticism exists in MBA programs, on corporate boards, and amongst institutional investors. It can drag out for a very long time and severely slow the adoption rate of BTC in corporate treasuries. BTC could also suffer a correction, and this would discourage boards to approving such a plan. Generally, these kinds of decisions do not happen when sentiment is awful. It just doesn’t have the momentum to overcome existing inertia. You will notice that SMLR’s Bitcoin treasury was only approved after BTC had run back up to all-time highs. Today, SMLR is still down on their BTC purchases, even though the stock is up quite a bit. Serious corrections in the price of BTC could cause boards and executive teams who were otherwise committed to a treasury strategy to backtrack. This could lead to more selling into a correction, which could increase the volatility of BTC. A treasury strategy ideally requires some high conviction to execute, and the conventional wisdom of not adding volatile assets to a balance sheet is certainly going to get louder when the volatility turns adversarial. Of course, as I mentioned in the section about convertibles financing, volatility can be very helpful for accreting more BTC because it pumps the value of embedded options. There are pros and cons, and every company has to weigh these factors before committing to acquiring BTC as a strategy. Personally, I think the risk of prolonged skepticism is decreasing as the sentiment and institutional acceptance of BTC seems to be improving. We now have major actors in the financial sector who have a vested interest in the near-term success of BTC. BlackRock and Fidelity will both make tons of money from the spot ETF fees, and they will probably continue to push a narrative that BTC protects you . The good thing about BTC treasuries is that Bitcoin's decentralization will not be affected by some entities holding large stashes of BTC. Control over the network is not conferred through ownership of BTC . This neutrality is why BTC, and not a proof-of-stake crypto, is a far better corporate treasury asset. Higher concentrations are risky, however, from the perspective that the BTC price could be affected in the short term if a whale decides to liquidate their position. For instance, when Germany was selling its 50,000 BTC a few weeks ago, BTC pulled back to about $56,000. But if BTC acquisition becomes a widely adopted corporate strategy, then there will almost always be buyers to absorb that kind of sell pressure. The Bottom Line BTC is a Buy. Lots of interesting things happened at the Nashville conference. I tend to be skeptical about the impact of politics and political promises, but I do recognize that these are bullish signs. To me, the practical reality of corporations taking on Bitcoin treasury strategies is the most compelling thesis for outperformance in the next few years. I think it is unlikely the US government adopts a strategic BTC reserve before some more companies in the S&P 500 do so. SMLR is a profitable company with a solid product. They have no debt and have consistently grown revenues. In that discussion, Eric Semler mentioned how the board realized that they were a “zombie company” which was doing good on the traditional metrics and yet was failing to receive attention from the market. That was what pushed them to take a chance with Bitcoin. I think many small and mid-caps may be in this position. I know that MSTR was in this position a few years ago, and now it is big enough for the S&P 500. My main takeaway from the conference was that this story of Bitcoin adoption is probably just starting to take off, which means the upside is still enormous.

This is undoubtedly a positive development for the ADA ecosystem, especially since it indicates a wave of accumulation among the token’s large holders. Cardano Matches Ethereum In Large Transaction Volume Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Cardano is witnessing a similar large transaction volume as Ethereum. In the last 24 hours, Cardano recorded a large transaction volume of $6.7 billion, while Ethereum witnessed a large transaction volume of $6.71 billion. Related Reading: Why Did This Crypto Whale Spend $400 Million Buying Bitcoin Yesterday? This development suggests that Cardano whales have been active these past few days as they look to add more tokens to their positions, especially with the market currently on a dip and as these investors anticipate the much-awaited price rally from ADA. Further data from IntoTheBlock confirms this, as there has been an over 15% increase in large holders’ net flow over the last seven days. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment also shows that Cardano whales have added to their positions. These investors, wallets holding between 100,000 and 10 million ADA tokens, collectively bought 120 million ADA tokens between July 17 and August 1. These wallets now hold over 5.69 billion ADA tokens. An increase in whale activity presents a bullish outlook for the Cardano ecosystem. These investors could influence market prices, and these purchases could spark a significant surge in ADA’s price. This will provide a much-needed boost for Cardano, seeing how the crypto token has underperformed since the start of the year. Cardano has a year-to-date (YTD) loss of over 35% and is one of the most shorted altcoins, thanks to this unimpressive price action. However, Santiment has suggested that a massive turnaround for the crypto token cannot be ruled out since Cardano being heavily shorted increases the “chances of liquidations leading to pumps.” The on-chain analytics platform claimed these liquidations could act as “rocket fuel” for a price rally for Cardano. What Will Eventually Spark That ADA Rally? Cardano has failed to enjoy any significant rally despite several bullish developments in its ecosystem this year. The most recent bullish fundamental was the news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) no longer considers ADA a security following the amendment of its complaint against Binance. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Will Rise Over 7,200% To Reach $10, Here’s Why Meanwhile, the Chang Hard Fork is underway as Cardano transitions to the Voltaire era and ushers in its most advanced governance system. It is worth mentioning that ADA’s price maintained a tepid price movement following the release of node validator software, version 9.1.0, which incorporates the Chang Hard Fork. As such, Cardano’s price action begs the question of what needs to happen for the crypto token to finally witness that much-anticipated price rally and catch up with the rest of the major cap tokens in terms of YTD gains. At the time of writing, Cardano is trading at around $0.38, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42417521,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYeNh,1722610794,Make America Mine Again: How Donald Trump's Plan for U.S. Bitcoin Dominance Could Trigger a New Digital Gold Rush,"In a bold proclamation that has sent ripples through both the cryptocurrency and energy sectors, former President Donald Trump recently suggested that all remaining Bitcoin should be mined on U.S. soil. While this goal is technically unattainable due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin mining, it raises questions about America's potential to dominate this burgeoning industry. As of 2024, the U.S. accounts for approximately 37.8% of global Bitcoin mining, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Could we push this figure above 90%?  This ambitious goal, while challenging, could reshape America's technological and economic landscape in profound ways. Importantly, the thriving of the American Bitcoin Mining Industry should be a bipartisan objective. Whether you lean left or right, the potential for job creation, energy innovation, and technological leadership makes this a topic that should matter deeply to both Democrats and Republicans alike.  Transforming America's Energy Wealth  The United States is blessed with an abundance of natural resources ideal for energy production. It boasts 48.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 691 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, reflecting significant increases from previous years￼. Additionally, the U.S. has vast potential for solar, wind, and uranium for nuclear power. However, it’s crucial to not forget that China is making significant investments to become abundant in energy. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, China’s total energy production reached 141.7 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) in 2021, compared to the U.S.‘s 95.7 quadrillion Btu￼.  While the U.S. still leads in per capita energy production, China’s rapid growth and massive investments in this sector underscore the urgent need for a strategic reassessment of energy and technological policies to maintain a competitive edge. Energy is at the core of the reshoring plans proposed by both the Biden and Trump administrations, and naturally, the cheaper and more robust the energy infrastructure, the better positioned American Bitcoin miners will be in the global market.  Beyond energy considerations, Bitcoin mining is emerging as a powerful force for economic revitalization of rural areas hit hard by globalization and the offshoring of American industry. According to our research team, in 2023, U.S. Bitcoin mining operations generated $2 billion in revenue, a figure that represents 3% of the American iron and steel industry's output. This comparison underscores the growing economic significance of this nascent sector. In just five years, the industry has created substantial employment opportunities. According to our internal estimates, direct employment in U.S. Bitcoin mining has grown to approximately 1,700 jobs, doubling over the past two years. When considering indirect employment, PwC estimates the figure rises to around 11,000 jobs nationwide.  The impact extends far beyond the mining operations themselves, with a job multiplier effect of 6.4, meaning each mining job supports an additional 6.4 jobs in the broader economy. These opportunities span various sectors, including transportation, construction, plant operations, electrical engineering, and cybersecurity. As such, Bitcoin mining is not just a technological phenomenon but a potential lifeline for communities seeking economic renewal in the wake of industrial decline.  America stands at a crossroads with three divergent paths to Bitcoin mining supremacy. Each route — ranging from aggressive dominance to free-market evolution — carries profound implications for America’s industrial future and global standing. Let's dissect these strategies and their potential to reshape America's technological and economic landscape.  Let's start with the “Oops, I Nuked the Competition” strategy. This approach, straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster, would see Uncle Sam flexing his military and intelligence muscles to unplug every non-American Bitcoin miner faster than you can say “geopolitical disaster.” Sure, It would corner the Bitcoin market in weeks, but at the minor cost of triggering World War III. It's a brilliant plan... if your goal is to mine Bitcoin in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where bottle caps are the preferred currency. Needless to say, we're mentioning this option purely for its absurd value.  Neo-Keynesian Interventionism  A more realistic strategy is the state intervention approach. This method, implementable within a single presidential term, would involve recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic asset aligned with U.S. interests. Key policy changes could include eliminating capital gains tax on Bitcoin transactions (currently at 20% for long-term holdings) and mining equity, offering tax efficient loan facilities to miners, and abolishing the 21% corporate income tax rate for mining operations.  Designating Bitcoin mining as critical national infrastructure could transform the American approach to grid management. Bitcoin miners, with their ability to rapidly adjust power consumption, can act as a dynamic buffer for the electrical grid. During peak demand periods, miners can swiftly reduce their operations, redirecting power to essential services. This flexibility is particularly valuable as the U.S. integrates more intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar.  By offering tax incentives for participation in grid stabilization, we can make it economically attractive for miners to operate in the U.S. while simultaneously enhancing our grid's resilience. The Department of Energy estimates that data centers, including cryptocurrency mining operations, could provide up to 2 gigawatts of demand response capacity by 2030. This strategy creates a win-win scenario: grid operators gain a powerful tool for network management, while miners receive economic benefits that could boost U.S. competitiveness in global Bitcoin production. Rather than aiming to increase both energy efficiency and mining output simultaneously, this approach fosters a symbiotic relationship between Bitcoin miners and the grid, potentially increasing America's share of global mining operations while strengthening our energy infrastructure.  This approach would also prioritize energy abundance as a crucial national development goal. The U.S. currently spends about 2.3% of its GDP on energy infrastructure. By increasing this investment and focusing on high-density electricity generation, grid connectivity, and internet infrastructure expansion, we could create a dynamic competitive environment for Bitcoin mining.  Laissez-faire Bitcoin  The third strategy is the free market approach. While slower to implement, potentially taking decades to fully materialize, this method could have far-reaching positive effects on American prosperity. This approach centers on recognizing the free choice of money as a fundamental right and involves massive deregulation of the power generation industry, removal of energy policy barriers, and elimination of manufacturing obstacles.  Consider that the average industrial electricity rate in the U.S. is currently 7.74 cents per kilowatt-hour (as of March 2024). By removing regulatory barriers and fostering competition, we could potentially drive this cost down significantly, making U.S.-based mining operations far more profitable than their global counterparts.  Additionally, this approach would advocate for significant reductions in capital gains, income, and corporate taxes. The current combined federal and state corporate tax rate in the U.S. averages 25.1%. A substantial reduction could unleash a wave of investment and innovation in the Bitcoin mining sector.  By dismantling excessive taxation and regulation, we could naturally position the U.S. as the most attractive location for Bitcoin mining globally. The size of its resource and capital base, combined with the entrepreneurial spirit of the population, could drive energy abundance to unprecedented levels, making mining elsewhere economically unfeasible.  Crossroads  The United States stands at a digital crossroads. While 100% Bitcoin mining dominance is a lofty goal, the pursuit itself offers a golden ticket to national renewal. Imagine revitalized rural areas humming with high-tech activity, America leading the world's first truly digital commodity (after oil and natural gas), and an energy revolution fueling a new era of industrialization.  This isn't just about Bitcoin; it's about mining the foundations of 21st-century economic power. By reshoring critical supply chains, from chips to ASIC miners, we're not just creating jobs — we're securing our technological independence.  Economist Noah Smith warns, ""If U.S. heavy manufacturing withers and dies in the face of Chinese competition, the U.S. won't be able to add much to its defense production capacity in a war."" Bitcoin mining could be one of the keys to preventing this scenario. By driving demand for cheaper, more abundant energy, it could catalyze a renaissance in American manufacturing, ensuring we maintain our industrial might and national security.  The potential economic benefits are substantial. Projections suggest that if the U.S. can capture 90% of the global Bitcoin mining market by 2028, it could contribute $30.6 billion to GDP - representing 1.2% of the projected U.S. GDP. This includes both the direct impact of $10.2 billion in Bitcoin mining revenue and an estimated $20.4 billion in indirect economic activity. Additionally, the industry could support over 54,000 total jobs nationwide.  The choice is clear: watch from the sidelines, or lead the charge. Whether through government intervention or free-market innovation, the path America chooses will shape its energy future, technological leadership, economic destiny, and global dominance. In the race for digital supremacy, Bitcoin mining isn't just an economic opportunity. It's a strategic imperative.

31842183,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632829,1722607227,PEPE Bullish Trend Line Under Threat: $0.00000766 Level On Sight?,"PEPE, one of the top meme coins in the crypto space, is currently at a crucial point as it approaches its long-standing bullish trend line. As the price draws near the bullish trend line, a break below it could signal a major shift in market sentiment, triggering a price draw down to the $0.00000766 mark. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the current price action, focusing on the bullish trend line. It examines whether a potential break below this line could drive the price to the critical support level at $0.00000766 or if a potential reversal is on the horizon. As of the time of writing, PEPE’s price has dropped by 5.10%, trading at approximately $0.00001005 in the past 24 hours. PEPE boasts a market capitalization exceeding $4.2 billion and a trading volume surpassing $821 million. The asset’s market cap has decreased by 5.32%, while its trading volume has increased by 35.01% in the past 24 hours. Technical Analysis: Current Market Sentiment For PEPE On the 4-hour chart, PEPE has demonstrated significant bearish momentum, with the price dropping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the $0.00001152 support mark, signaling a potential bearish move toward the bullish trend line. A successful breach below this trend line could signal the start of a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency, potentially driving the price down to the next key support level at $0.00000766. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signal line has dropped below 50% and is approaching 30%, which is considered the oversold zone. This movement indicates increasing bearish momentum and suggests that selling pressure is intensifying. Technical analysis on the 1-day chart reveals that, following the rejection at $0.00001313, PEPE has been on a bearish trajectory toward the bullish trend line, marked by the formation of multiple bearish candlesticks. Furthermore, the crypto asset’s price is trading below the 100-day SMA, suggesting a bearish market sentiment. The signal line of the 1-day RSI indicator has recently dropped below 50% and is moving toward the oversold zone, suggesting that the digital asset may continue its bearish trajectory below the 100-day SMA toward the bullish trend line. Navigating Potential Breakdowns And Bounces At The Trend Line PEPE is currently on a bearish path while approaching its long-standing bullish trend line. A successful break below this trend line could indicate the beginning of a bearish trend, potentially driving the asset toward the $0.00000766 support level and beyond. However, if PEPE bounces back at the bullish trend line, it could retrace towards its previous high of $0.00001152. Should the crypto asset break above this level, it could signal a further upward movement, possibly targeting the $0.00001313 resistance range and other higher levels.

Those 114,000 jobs were well shy of expectations for 175,000 and down from 179,000 in June (itself revised lower from an originally reported 206,000).  The unemployment rate of 4.3% was up from 4.1% in June and above forecasts for 4.1%.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} is about flat from just before the numbers hit, now trading at $64,500, and little-changed from 24 hours ago.  Reaction in traditional markets was far bigger, with the 10-year Treasury yield tumbling 15 basis points to 3.83% and the two-year yield a full 23 basis points to 3.93% – both levels the lowest in more than a year. Stocks aren't loving the numbers nearly as much, with Nasdaq futures now down 2.3% and S&P 500 lower by 1.6%.  Also on the move are the dollar, which has sunk 0.6%, and gold, which has risen 1.3% to a new record high of $2,513 per ounce.  Checking other report details, average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in July, shy of 0.3% expected, and 0.3% in June. On an annual basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 3.6% versus 3.7% expected and 3.8% in June. Average weekly hours also missed expectations, coming in at 34.2 against forecasts for 34.3 and 34.3 in June.

A check of the December meeting shows traders beginning to place bets on a total of 125 basis points in rate cuts between now and the end of the year.

A prominent whale transferred 400 billion PEPE tokens—worth about $4.22 million—to Binance. Related Reading: GRT Market Signals 12% Drop: Is A Turnaround Possible? Strategically timed among the general negative market mood, this move seems to be a deliberate one for partial profit booking. The whale’s behavior corresponds to the breach of a critical support level around $0.00001075, a key threshold that has lately increased the downward pressure on PEPE’s price. A whale deposited 400B $PEPE($4.22M) to #Binance to take profits in the past hour. The whale withdrew 795.92B $PEPE($2.55M at the time) from #Binance on Mar 1 and currently has 395.93B $PEPE($4.18M) left. His total profit on $PEPE is $5.85M, the ROI is 230%!… pic.twitter.com/o7T1ihjoq9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 1, 2024 Previously active on March 1st, the whale pulled out 795 billion PEPE tokens from Binance, worth $2.55 million. Even with this big withdrawal, the whale still has a decent 396 billion PEPE, which means it has an unrealized profit of $5.85 million, or a 230% return on investment. This amazing financial dance shows how smart the whale is and how dangerous it is to trade PEPE in a market that is always changing. Pepe Technical Study: Negative PEPE is trading at about $0.00001051 as of the most recent report, a 7.5% decline in price over the last 24 hours. Concurrently, trade volume has jumped by 14%, indicating a change in market involvement and investor participation. Technical study shows a pessimistic view of the cryptocurrency despite this higher activity. With forecasts showing a possible 20% collapse in the short future, the recent violation of the important support level of $0.00001075 is expected to propel further drops. The 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) suggests PEPE may find support around $0.0000852. Despite the gloomy market, this technical indicator suggests price stabilization. Technical indicators and market dynamics challenge PEPE’s prospects. Liquidation Levels And Possible Rebound The latest development also puts into perspective PEPE’s main liquidation thresholds, which lie on the lower end at $0.000010 and on the upper end at $0.0000118. Should the bearish mood persists, the meme coin may experience a downward motion below $0.000010, forcing the liquidation of around $2.04 million in long bets. Conversely, a shift in market sentiment could result in PEPE falling below $0.0000118, which would result in the liquidation of approximately $13.4 million in short positions. Beyond the current volatility, PEPE projections remain somewhat positive, though short-term forecasts show a significant comeback with an expected 249.99% gain over the following three months. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Go Up 680% This Week? This Analyst Believes So With expected rates of 183.50% over six months and 169.42% over one year, the longer horizon seems as bright. These scenarios could be good news for the popular meme coin as it maneuvers its way into the volatile crypto market, but all things considered PEPE could be headed in the right direction. In essence, the larger projection stays robust even if PEPE has major short-term difficulties and liquidation hazards. The direction of the token will be greatly shaped by the combination of whale movements, technical indicators, and market emotion.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin was little changed during the European morning, sitting around $64,500 following a slump to $62,500 on Thursday. That's near its 50-day moving average, which remains a tactical support line for traders. “If the decline develops, dynamics around the $63K and $61K levels, near where the 50 and 200-day moving averages are, will be important,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an FxPro senior market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email. “A failure of this support will open the way to $55K, which is quite frightening.” August has been a losing month for BTC eight times and a winning one five times, he added. ""The average decline was 15.4% and the average rise was 26%.""  Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold $14.8 million of COIN shares on Thursday, the biggest single-day divestment since May 7, ahead of Coinbase's second-quarter earnings announcement. The sale means the fund-management company sold more Coinbase shares on the first day of August than in the previous two months combined. After the market closed, Coinbase reported second-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street analysts' expectations. Profit, however, came in lower than the consensus. The exchange's shares, which fell 5.2% to $212.64 during regular trading, rallied briefly after the report and were little changed in pre-market trading. ARK sold a total of 69,069 COIN shares across two of its ETFs.  Hong Kong stock broker Futu Securities has introduced bitcoin and ether trading, and is offering shares in Alibaba and Nvidia as rewards to new clients. The company, which calls itself Hong Kong’s largest tech broker, is working on ""expanding our crypto offerings in the near future,"" according to a report by the South China Morning Post. Futu is offering the crypto trading services through a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange HashKey Exchange, one of only two licensed in Hong Kong. It is also seeking a license to offer the same services for its subsidiary, Panthertrade. The entity is currently deemed-to-be-licensed by Hong Kong's regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, which allows it to offer crypto services while it awaits full approval.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the U.S. Conference Board's leading, coincident and lagging economic indicators.  Leading indicators trend lower as the other two rise, indicating economic weakness and a potential recessionary phase ahead.  Crypto analysts said a Fed rate cut implemented against the backdrop of an economic swoon may not help bitcoin.

42407768,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga4KqO,1722599574,Kujira Foundation's Tokens Stung by Its Own Leveraged Positions as Bets Backfire,"Lack of risk management in financial bets by the Kujira Foundation led to a 55% drop in KUJI token prices within 24 hours.  Liquidations of leveraged positions by Kujira's operational wallet resulted in significant losses and further price declines.  Kujira plans to establish a DAO to manage its treasury and core protocols, aiming to reduce debt and increase transparency.  The team behind Kujira, a decentralized finance (DeFi)-focused blockchain, put up leveraged liquidity positions that backfired, wiping 55% off the value of the network's KUJI tokens in 24 hours.  Wallets belonging to the Kujira Foundation, which builds and contributes to running Cosmos-based Kujira, started to see their KUJI holdings automatically liquidated on Thursday as some of their leveraged positions on the protocol became bad debt to the tune of millions of dollars.  The liquidations occurred as loans taken by Kujira from their publicly allocated KUJI tokens became undercollateralized during a period of general market volatility. The liquidations sent KUJI lower, leading to more liquidations, even lower prices and a downward spiral.  Liquidations are the automatic closure of a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of their initial margin. They can be stopped in time if a trader tops up funds to keep their position open.  In a Telegram broadcast message on Thursday, a Kujira team member said the leverage positions were taken out in the hope they would drive value across the network’s set of applications.  “As a team, we thought the best use of a portion of ops funds would be to leverage and deploy across the ecosystem to bootstrap liquidity and activity,” a @team_kujira member wrote on Telegram. ""We genuinely felt like this was the correct course of action.”  “Sadly this coincided with various attacks. Not trying to feel sorry for ourselves but just explaining the sequence of events. People targetted the team positions, and it’s been a constant fight since these positions were created,” they wrote.  Kujira had more than $124 million worth of funds locked at its March 2024 peak. The value was down to $50 million earlier this week and $35 million on Friday morning following the KUJI token liquidations.  In a Friday post on X, the team said it would create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) – an organization managed in whole or in part using a blockchain-based voting system – to take ownership of the Kujira Treasury and core protocols “with an initial mandate to safely reduce debt.” It said there was 14 million KUJI, worth $5.5 million at current prices, in the treasury.  “This DAO will also assume control of the configuration of the core Kujira Protocols,” the team wrote. “Combined with upcoming admin dashboards, this will create transparency over how these protocols run, and allow the community to propose changes that will be voted on by members of the DAO.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/02/kujira-foundations-tokens-stung-by-its-own-leveraged-positions-as-bets-backfire,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae6cfc4e2d472bdfd04f0084aaa515a00f58b142-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31835441,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632795,1722596405,Polygon Price Risks Plunge With 90 Million MATIC Tokens Selling At $0.5,"Polygon (MATIC) recently broke below the crucial support level at $0.5 and is at risk of further price declines. This price drop is thanks to several traders who offloaded their tokens as soon as Polygon reached this support level amid the downtrend in the broader crypto market. Polygon Faces Significant Selling Pressure The Exchange-Onchain Market Depth indicator on the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Polygon is currently facing significant selling pressure. Over 90 million tokens were sold after the coin hit $0.5. This indicator tracks the order books of the top 20 exchanges and shows the average price at which traders are looking to buy and sell the token. Related Reading: Market Experts Update Ethereum Predictions: Is A 1,400% Rally To $50,000 Possible? Polygon bulls could not defend the crucial support level of $0.5 as further data from IntoTheBlock shows that just over 55 million tokens were bought at an average bid price of $0.49. Meanwhile, Polygon is at risk of further price declines, with data from IntoTheBlock showing that the sell orders continue to outweigh the buy orders. The silver lining amid this wave of sell-offs is that Polygon whales look to have maintained their confidence in the MATIC token and have taken advantage of this price dip to accumulate more tokens. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that large holders’ net flows have increased by over 1,700% in the last seven days, indicating accumulation among these investors. Only 3% of Polygon holders are currently in the money, which could lead to further price drops for the crypto token. If the crypto token doesn’t rebound soon enough, the 96% of investors currently at a loss could cut their losses at some point, thereby triggering another wave of sell-offs for MATIC. Thanks to its bearish price action, Polygon recently dropped out of the top 20 crypto rankings by market cap. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that it is currently the twenty-first largest crypto token by market cap, behind Litecoin. Market Conditions Not Making It Easier For MATIC The current conditions in the broader crypto market have also contributed to Polygon’s recent decline. Bitcoin recently dropped to as low as $63,500 from $69,000, dragging altcoins down in the process. Tokens like MATIC have suffered more significant price drops because of their strong positive price correlation with Bitcoin. Related Reading: Why Did This Crypto Whale Spend $400 Million Buying Bitcoin Yesterday? The flagship crypto has experienced this price decline thanks to the rising tensions in the Middle East, with Iran and Israel at the forefront. However, the market is expected to pick up again soon enough, meaning that tokens like MATIC could enjoy a massive rebound sooner rather than later. The first goal will be for the crypto token to reclaim the crucial support level at $0.5. At the time of writing, Polygon is trading at around $0.48, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A weak report will likely bolster Fed rate cut expectations and potentially support risk assets, including bitcoin.  With markets awaiting Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, analysts at ING caution that the scales are tipped toward a weaker number, potentially adding to volatility in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.  The data due at 8:30 ET (12:30 UTC) is expected to show the U.S. economy added 185,000 jobs in July, down from June's 206,000, according to economists polled by the Wall Street Journal. The jobless rate is seen at 4.1%, unchanged from June, while the annual growth in hourly wages likely slowed to 3.7%.  ""Evidence from employment components of the ISM and NFIB surveys suggest the risks are skewed to a weaker payroll print,"" analysts at ING said in a note to clients Friday, explaining their bearish view on the dollar.  A weak report would undoubtedly bolster expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year, denting the currency's appeal. Traders already expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in September and ramp up easing even though Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday ruled out big rate cuts. According to ING, macroeconomic forces could drive the dollar lower once the ongoing equity turmoil and haven demand from geopolitical tensions abate.  A weaker greenback, the global reserve currency with an outsized impact on financial conditions, often galvanizes demand for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has recovered from the Asian session low of around $62,200 to $64,500 ahead of the payrolls report, CoinDesk data show.

The organization said luring some crypto supporters' votes and donations from the Republican camp ""could make a difference in key battleground states.""  U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, cannot afford to cede crypto to Republican candidate Donald Trump because the support of crypto voters – not to mention their donations – could ""make a difference in key battleground states,"" according to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), an independent think tank.  Last week, Trump wooed crypto supporters, speaking to a packed hall at the Bitcoin Nashville conference where he promised to create a strategic bitcoin reserve if elected. If the Democrats kept the White House, that would be a disaster for crypto, he said.  ""Trump has, with characteristic opportunism, identified a segment of disgruntled voters and, perhaps more importantly, potential donors,"" Lewis McLellan, the editor of OMFIF’s Digital Monetary Institute, wrote in a Thursday website posting.  ""Perhaps more importantly, acquiring 200,000 bitcoin a year over five years will give the US a not inconsiderable share of the eventual 21m total bitcoin. This reduction in free-floating supply is likely to drive the asset price up. This measure alone might be enough to attract campaign finance donations from those with significant bitcoin holdings.""  Ahead of this month's Democratic National Convention, Harris has not stated an official position on crypto but is ""signaling a new openness,"" and ""her camp has had contact with crypto representatives in recent weeks,"" according to a Politico report. That report also indicated a crypto rift among Democrats highlighting ""the policy tensions that are boiling beneath the surface of Democrats’ honeymoon with Harris.""  The commentary, titled ""Harris cannot afford to cede crypto to Trump,"" said: ""There is little to be lost, and potentially much to be gained,"" and ""Kamala Harris must lay out her own agenda for cryptoassets or she risks ceding the ground entirely to the Republicans.""  ""Few will abandon the Democrats because they show support for the growth of the crypto industry – particularly when the Republicans have already done so.

Today, the total market cap shows a percentage slip, due to the major cryptocurrencies returning to levels that investors can sustain. On the altcoin side, GRT is one of the tokens that were hit hard by the bears. Related Reading: Crypto Watch: Why Today’s FOMC Meeting Is The ‘Most Important Of Your Life’ According to CoinGecko, the token is down nearly 12% since last week, showing exaggerated losses in the face of continuous downward pressure. Although the token’s performance within the market leaves much to be desired, The Graph devs are brewing something around the corner that might turn the tide. More Web3 Data To Be Serviced By The Graph The Graph recently released a blog post about their plans to introduce new tools for indexers, further building up the platform’s capability to handle data. They are introducing two specialized tools to help grow the platform’s ecosystem namely Firehose and Substreams. The upgrade is part of their New Era roadmap, a path that was laid in late 2023, providing developers, users, and investors a transparent look at where The Graph is headed. The two new tools provide different levels of data stream to indexers. Firehose will provide real-time data which enhances “the immediacy and responsiveness of blockchain data access.” It’ll help apps access data quickly, reducing latency thus improving user experience. On the other hand, Substreams is more accurate, giving developers the ability to pick and choose the data needed for their applications. This will improve data retrieval as their systems won’t need to scour the database for its specific data needs. The two tools will serve the platform’s data servicing niche, providing developers the flexibility of choosing whether they want a real-time stream of data or a select, more specialized access to specified data sets. This improvement would largely benefit the platform’s push to grow its artificial intelligence base. Last May, the platform announced the deployment of Agentc, a “ChatGPT-like tool” built on top of The Graph’s Uniswap data. More Pain Ahead? More pain around the corner awaits investors with the bears having a chokehold of the GRT market. With the major cryptocurrencies also struggling to keep their ground within more suitable levels, the altcoin market will fall more within the early weeks of the month. Related Reading: Render Continues To Flash Red In All Timeframes – What’s Going On? The grip GRT bears have on the market will last as long as market conditions continue to favor selling. A breakthrough on $0.1715 line will make the situation much worse which might turn the situation into a firesale. GRT bulls should then attempt to hold on to this line as any further gains by the bears will mean a possible reversion back to mid-February levels.

Other indicators based on inactivity of supply also point to strong holding sentiment.  While bitcoin's {{BTC}} price has more than doubled in the past year, the largest cryptocurrency continues to offer an appealing risk-reward ratio for those eyeing an investment, according to an on-chain indicator that successfully predicted the bull run in early 2023.  Bitcoin's ""reserve risk,"" an indicator that gauges the confidence of long-term holders based on their willingness to defer spending coins, remains entrenched in the so-called green zone below 0.002, according to data tracked by CryptoQuant. The measure can range between 0 and 1.  The low reading is a sign long-term holders are motivated to hold at bitcoin's going market rate rather than sell, implying favorable demand-supply dynamics and an attractive risk-reward ratio for those looking to make additional or fresh investments.  ""The reserve risk continues to remain in the green zone, which means buying BTC at the current levels still offers an extraordinary reward to risk. Investing in bitcoin during periods where the reserve risk in the green zone has produced outsized returns over time,"" MintingM, a crypto research firm based in India, told CoinDesk.  Reserve risk tends to oscillate in sync with bullish and bearish trends. Historically, the green zone below 0.0027 has marked a slow transition from the final stage of a bear market into a bull market. Readings above 0.02 have marked bull-market tops.  Other indicators measuring the percentage of supply that is inactive over a specific period also show a return to a holding strategy after some profit-taking at record highs early this year.  ""Bitcoin bull markets naturally attract sell-side pressure, as higher prices incentivize long-term holders to take profits on some of their holdings. We can observe this phenomenon through the significant decline in the Supply Last Active 1y+ and 2y+ metrics throughout March and April,"" blockchain analytics firm Glassnode said in a weekly report. ""The rate of decline across these curves has slowed of late, suggesting a gradual return to HODLing dominant investor behavior.""  On-chain indicators' persistent bullish messaging is consistent with the market consensus that the impending interest-rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve would see bitcoin make a bullish escape from its prolonged range play between $60,000 and $70,000.

31828083,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632774,1722584887,Why XRP Price Won’t Skyrocket After Ripple-SEC Ruling: Crypto Pundit,"As the XRP lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inches closer to a ruling on remedies – the final ruling on district court level – the crypto community is abuzz with speculation about the potential repercussions for the XRP price. Notably, Rachelle Renee, a popular crypto pundit, has voiced a dissenting perspective via X, arguing that the forthcoming Ripple-SEC ruling will not significantly impact the price of XRP, contrary to the expectations of many investors. How Will The XRP Price React? Renee’s analysis starts with a sobering view on the nature of the legal resolution itself, which will penalize Ripple. “It is simply the details on how Ripple will be punished for the few minor indiscretions committed,” Renee explained. She expressed skepticism about the potential for this legal closure to serve as a catalyst for a substantial price increase of XRP. According to Renee, the pivotal moment for a possible price surge was when regulatory clarity was initially provided by Judge Torres in July last year, a milestone that has already been passed without a long lasting effect. “The point at which clarity was decided would have been the time to see it move upward in a big way. It did not,” Renee stated. Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Out Of 6-Year Triangle, But Is A Rally To $1 Possible? She further elucidated that institutional investors, who might be considered a primary driver for such a surge, only required confirmation that it was legally permissible to buy, hold, and utilize XRP. This clearance has already been granted. Therefore, the details of how Ripple might be reprimanded for early sales of XRP are unlikely to sway their investment strategies: “Institutions only needed to hear it was legal now to buy, hold and use. That happened. They do not need to hear or if #ripple will be punished for a few early sales of XRP.” Renee concluded, “I hate to be the one to say it. But I do not think the final Ripple/SEC/Torres event will do anything for the price of XRP. The institutions that might drive a significant price increase already know it’s legal to engage with XRP, and the specifics of Ripple’s punishment are unlikely to influence their decisions further.” She further conceded that while a minor uptick in the XRP price could occur following the resolution, she firmly believes that “this will not be the moon shot” many are hoping for. Instead, Renee suggested that significant market movements for XRP would more likely result from new developments that demonstrate XRP’s utility and adoption by major global players, such as banks and financial institutions. Related Reading: XRP Goes To All-Time High If This Resistance Breaks: Crypto Analyst Contrasting with Renee’s tempered expectations, Bas van Gestel, another voice from the XRP community, presented a more bullish outlook. Van Gestel argued that the end of the Ripple-SEC case would catalyze a major surge in XRP’s price due to enhanced regulatory clarity attracting more investors, institutional adoption by major banks, and global partnerships that would broaden the currency’s use cases. Responding to van Gestel’s optimism, Renee reiterated her point that much of what was anticipated to drive a price surge has already occurred, with regulatory clarity being established over a year ago. She posed critical questions about the timing of the institutional adoption and significant global announcements that van Gestel cited as catalysts, suggesting that while these developments are possible and could be impactful, they have yet to materialize in a way that affects the XRP price meaningfully. “Since regulatory clarity was provided over a year ago, why have we not seen big announcements. I am a believer these announcements will come. But not as part of the final Torres case close,” Renee claims. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5632.

42407780,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga4LNS,1722584219,"Bitcoin Traders Eye $55K Amid U.S. Stocks Sell-off, XRP Leads Losses in Major Cryptos","Bitcoin rebounded from lows near $62,500 in Asian morning hours on Friday, amidst a global asset sell-off entering its third day.  Despite the rebound, BTC remained under pressure, trading near its 50-day moving average, which is a key technical support level for traders.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} reversed losses in Asian morning hours Friday as a general sell-off across global assets continued into its third day this week, exacerbated by Middle East geopolitical tensions.  BTC slumped to as low as $62,500 in late U.S. trading hours on Thursday, reversing losses and trading just under $64,000 at 6:30 UTC to trade near its 50-day moving average, which remains a tactical support line for some traders.  “If the decline develops, dynamics around the $63K and $61K levels, near where the 50 and 200-day moving averages are, will be important,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email. “A failure of this support will open the way to $55K, which is quite frightening.”  “August is considered one of the two worst months for BTC. Over the past 13 years, bitcoin has ended the month up only five times and down eight times. The average decline was 15.4% and the average rise was 26%,” he added.  Crypto majors fell in the past 24 hours amid weakness in global equities. Ether (ETH) lost 1.6% in the past 24 hours, while major tokens XRP and Solana’s SOL dropped as much as 8%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, was down 2.44%.  This broad sell-off in BTC was felt in some of the bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to market data.  While the U.S.-listed BTC ETFs had a total daily net inflow of $50.6 million, GBTC, FBTC, ARKB, BITB and HODL posted outflows.  Meanwhile, Ether ETF's collectively posted net inflow of $26.75 million although many registered zero flow.  The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 ended Thursday with a 2.6% loss, and the S&P 500 Index sank 1.4%, losing nearly all of Wednesday’s 1.6% gains on concerns around the U.S. economy and future earnings of technology firms.  Elsewhere, Japan’s Topix index dropped 6% on Friday to mark its biggest fall since 2016.  In a note shared with CoinDesk, Presto Research highlighted Microstrategy's (MSTR) standout performance in 2Q24 due to its 3.7% BTC per share increase via ""intelligent leverage,"" a planned $2 billion equity offering for BTC purchases, and the adoption of fair-value accounting for BTC by 1Q25, which will benefit the broader BTC market.

The study also found that India's anti-money laundering rules were not sufficient to reverse the impact of the high taxes on the crypto industry.  India should consider revising its taxes on crypto and not depend on its anti-money laundering rules to reverse the impact of those high taxes, the latest survey of savvy Indian investors by a New Delhi-based technology policy think tank revealed.  The study by the Esya Centre also found that Indian investors are considerably aware of regulations relating to the taxation of cryptocurrencies (58%) and money laundering (52%), and prefer collateralized stablecoins (93%) over algorithmic ones.  The survey was conducted in March and April in five urban cities: Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, Jaipur, and Lucknow and focused on 1,342 highly educated respondents.  Critically, the study found that India's ""anti-money laundering law has led to a shift in favor of equity investments compared to crypto investments (by 8 percent).""  Since last year, India has required crypto businesses to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the country's anti-money laundering unit, to comply with processes under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).  Despite evidence-backed studies by Esya and others calling for reduction, India has kept high crypto taxes unchanged since introducing them in 2022.  Esya's latest survey found that knowledge of the ""tax regulations not only increases investment in crypto assets (by 10 percent), but also investment via foreign crypto platforms (by 15 percent).""  That trend was reversed to some extent once India blocked as many as nine off shore exchanges, some of which have now been registered in India.  The survey found that some Indian investors were circumventing offshore exchanges' URL blocking, suggesting that the anti-money laundering laws were not ""sufficient to reverse or neutralize the impact of tax regulations.""  Thus, the think tank reiterated its suggestion that the government should ""consider revising the tax rules for crypto assets to prevent offshoring"" and that ""future attempts by the government to nudge consumers to engage responsibly in the crypto asset market should be in consultation with crypto exchanges.""  All the respondents considered crypto assets to be very attractive as an ""additional investment opportunity and for cross-border transactions,"" while NFTs and stablecoins were ""not perceived as similarly lucrative.""

42407783,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga4Ldz,1722573000,Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve,"Over the weekend, former U.S. President and current Republican nominee Donald Trump and a number of lawmakers spoke at the Bitcoin Nashville conference. The biggest piece of news everyone has been talking about was Trump and Sen. Cynthia Lummis' proposals to create a strategic reserve for Bitcoin, but the event also served as Sen. Tim Scott's entry into actual crypto discussion.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  BTC conference  The narrative  Lawmakers – and Donald Trump, who of course is hoping to regain the presidency this November – took the stage through the Bitcoin Nashville conference last week to try and appeal to BTC holders for votes or funds.  Why it matters  This is the first major U.S. election where crypto is getting attention from lawmakers and candidates. While it's still not totally clear whether there truly is a significant mass of single-issue crypto voters, what is clear is lawmakers are going to continue to appeal to this crowd over the next few months.  Breaking it down  First up: Former President Donald Trump spoke, saying if he's elected he'll work to appoint friendlier regulators, but his biggest promise may be his suggestion that the U.S. would create a strategic bitcoin stockpile, a promise echoed by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) who introduced a bill this week that would support that goal.  ""And so as the final part of my plan today, I am announcing that if I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future, we'll keep 100%,"" Trump said. ""I hope you do well, please. This will serve, in effect, as the core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile.""  The former president also acknowledged that ""most of the bitcoin currently held by the United States government was obtained through law enforcement action.""  ""You know that they took it from you. Let's take that guy's life. Let's take his family, his house, his bitcoin. We'll turn it into bitcoin. It's been taken away from you, because that's where we're going now. That's where this country is going to – fascist regime. And so as I take steps to transform that vast wealth into a permanent national asset to benefit all Americans,"" he said.  The proposals – both from Trump and Lummis – still leave some questions unanswered at the moment, but in a broader sense, they're more just messages to the bitcoin community at the moment, that if Trump becomes president again (and/or if Republicans become the majority party in the Senate), he'll be friendlier toward the industry than in his first term.  Trump also shouted out Vivek Ramaswamy, who briefly also vied for the Republican ticket.  ""I've heard from Vivek 175 million people in some form, are involved with this world of crypto and Bitcoin and all of the others, 175 million,"" he said. ""So when they heard that, they said, 'Let's be nice to them, at least until after the election.'""  You can read a partial transcript of Trump's remarks here.  As my colleague Jesse Hamilton reported, this event also served as Sen. Tim Scott's (R-S.C.) first substantial introduction to the crypto community. The Senate Banking Committee's top Republican, Scott – another former contender for the presidency – will become the committee's chair if the GOP retakes the Senate, putting him in charge of legislation that could affect the Securities and Exchange Commission and crypto regulation more broadly. He did not introduce any specific policy ideas during his remarks on stage.

After a strong performance in July, which saw XRP outperform even Bitcoin with a gain of over 35%, the token has now dropped nearly 10% in the last 24 hours. Analysts Bullish On Long-Term Price Targets Market intelligence platform Santiment, has highlighted the performance of XRP’s blockchain ecosystem, the XRP Ledger (XRPL), despite this recent price drop. The platform attributes this success to heightened on-chain activity, major whale transactions, and significant network growth that propelled XRP’s 35% monthly surge during July. This comes as Ripple, the payment network associated with XRP, announced on Thursday a substantial allocation of $10 million towards a tokenized version of US Treasury bills (T-bills) on the XRP Ledger, contributing to the bullish sentiment surrounding the token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes Third Retest Of Historical Support, Analyst Sounds Alarm In light of this latest announcement, analysts remain divided on the short-term and long-term outlook for the XRP price. However, there is enough bullishness for the token to resume the uptrend it has been on for the past month. Some, such as crypto analyst “XRP Captain,” believe the token could eventually reach as high as $482.48 based on the $27 trillion US Treasury bill market that Ripple is aiming to participate in. This would represent a significant 790x increase from current levels. Similarly, analyst Mikybull has outlined both short and long-term price targets for the XRP price. In the immediate future, targets range from $2.5 to $3.5, while the long-term outlook suggests figures starting from $25 and potentially soaring higher, based on his analysis. Mikybull noted in his latest social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that the 2-month XRP/USD chart is “looking crazily primed to rip upward.” XRP Price At Crossroads Despite these optimistic projections, the XRP price faces a critical juncture. Key support levels must withstand pressure to facilitate a resumption of the positive momentum witnessed in July. Currently priced at $0.5739, XRP’s first major support rests at $0.5650 on the daily chart. A breach of this level could lead to a sharper downturn towards $0.5657 and potentially down to $0.5400, a crucial support level in the near term. Related Reading: New Memecoin Sensation Neiro Hits $200 Million Market Cap In Four Days Of particular importance is the $0.5400 level, which aligns with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). XRP traded below this for the past four months before successfully breaking through, leading to the 35% gains recorded in July. Ultimately, XRP’s ability to hold above these critical levels will be key in determining the coin’s near-term trajectory, especially as the current downtrend continues at the time of writing.

31816371,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632699,1722565812,"XRP Price Breaks Out Of 6-Year Triangle, But Is A Rally To $1 Possible?","The XRP price has been experiencing notable movements since the last week of July, closely linked to updates about a potential settlement between the SEC and Ripple. This anticipation has significantly influenced XRP’s market performance, causing a remarkable surge in its price as it skyrocketed from $0.599 to $0.655 in just a matter of hours. Although the price has since corrected, this rapid increase has once again highlighted XRP’s potential and its ability to draw substantial investor interest. According to a crypto analyst, XRP is just waiting to break out of a symmetrical triangle in which it has consolidated for years. A breakout of the triangle would mean intense, full, bullish pressure on the price of XRP. XRP To Breakout Of Symmetrical Triangle The analysis of the XRP price movement, recently shared on the social media platform X by the prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez, has captured significant attention. Martinez’s detailed examination reveals that the XRP pri has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern for the past six years. According to the monthly candlestick XRP price chart he posted, this consolidation phase began after XRP reached its all-time high of $3.40 during the early 2018 bull market, which triggered a bearish run until it bottomed out at $0.11 in 2020. Since then, XRP’s price has been characterized by a series of lower highs and higher lows, which has resulted in the formation of the symmetrical triangle pattern observed by Martinez. Symmetrical triangle patterns typically indicate periods of consolidation before a significant price movement. For XRP, this period of consolidation has been notably prolonged, extending beyond the usual timeframe expected for such patterns. This extended consolidation has been further exacerbated by Ripple’s legal issues with the SEC, which have stunted the crypto’s price since December 2020. A breakout from this symmetrical triangle would signal the beginning of intense bullish pressure on XRP’s price, potentially leading to a substantial upward trend. Martinez highlights that the critical breakout point for XRP is around $0.90. He suggests that surpassing this level could be the catalyst for a substantial upward trend. In his own words, “A bullish breakout could occur if #XRP surpasses $0.90.” XRP Price Rally to $1? The XRP price has increasingly been in the spotlight in the past year as the Ripple-SEC lawsuit seems to be drawing to a close. This increase in activity has seen the cryptocurrency inch closer to the breakout level of $0.90. On-chain data provides further insights into the growing optimism around XRP’s future performance. Many investors are anticipating a bullish run for XRP and are already positioning themselves accordingly. According to data from Santiment, there has been a notable increase in shark and whale wallets over the past five weeks. These wallets, which hold at least 10,000 XRP each, have seen a significant uptick. Wallets falling into this category are now around 279,400 addresses, which suggests increased accumulation.

Bitcoin ETFs And Institutions Now Control 9% Of Total Supply Data from analytics providers SoSo Value and Ecoinmetrics show that Bitcoin ETFs have been consistently accumulating BTC in their holdings, despite a brief dip in inflows at the start of June. However, since July 1st, inflows have resumed at an accelerated pace, surpassing the averages recorded over the previous two months. Specifically, on July 31st, the Bitcoin spot ETF saw a net inflow of $298 million, while the Grayscale mini ETF BTC had a net inflow of $17.99 million. Additionally, the BlackRock ETF IBIT recorded an inflow of $20.99 million. Related Reading: Hoskinson Claims Cardano Will Flip Bitcoin As Leading Crypto According to data from data analytics firm Ecoinmetrics, Bitcoin ETFs have added nearly 300,000 BTC to their holdings since their approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) January 2023. While the pace of accumulation has slowed from earlier this year, the consistent inflows, even during periods of price stagnation, are a testament to the persistent institutional demand for the leading cryptocurrency, according to the firm. In total, institutions now control nearly 9% of the entire Bitcoin supply, with ETFs and ETF-like products accounting for approximately 5.2% of the total. Public companies hold another 1.6%, while private companies account for at least 2% of the BTC supply. Sentiment Soars To Highest Level Since May Despite Bitcoin’s inability to surpass the $69,000 resistance level in its latest uptrend and a recent retrace of over 5% in the past 24 hours, the overall sentiment toward the leading cryptocurrency appears to be turning increasingly bullish. According to market intelligence platform Santiment, the level of bullish commentary on Bitcoin this week has reached its highest point since the week of May 15. This suggests that many in the crypto crowd believe that the Bitcoin price is poised to reach the $70,000 milestone soon. Corroborating this sentiment, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has noted that top traders on the Binance exchange are currently buying the Bitcoin dip, with nearly 70% of them going long on BTC, according to on-chain data. Related Reading: Chainlink At Risk: Key Indicators Signal Further Losses To $12 However, the cryptocurrency’s short-term price action remains a cause for concern as if Bitcoin fails to close the day above the $64,200 mark, which corresponds to its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), it could spell trouble for the asset’s near term price action. As can be seen on the daily BTC/USDT chart below, marked by the thick yellow line, the 200-day EMA has historically acted as a strong support level for Bitcoin, but whenever the price has traded below this indicator, it has also acted as a notable resistance wall. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $62,830, erasing most of its gains from last month, as the cryptocurrency is up just 1.6% in the 30-day timeframe.
