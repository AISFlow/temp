42420390,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpfJN,1684448576,What Are the Stakes in the SEC vs. Ripple Case?,"There are rumors circulating that Ripple Labs Inc., the U.S.-based technology company that builds XRP infrastructure, may soon settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There is hardly an example of how many unsettled legal questions surround crypto as this case, currently in the dockets of the Court of Southern District of New York.  Femi Olude is studying for a masters of law degree in international corporate and commercial law at the University of Lincoln.  The SEC asserts that Ripple distributed 14.6 billion units of a crypto token known as XRP, and sued the company and its executives CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen for failure to register XRP as security, that being a requirement for the public offering and sale of securities.  The question for the court, therefore, is whether XRP can be considered a security, which would determine if Ripple should have registered XRP.  The SEC argues that XRP is security for reasons that make sense in some contexts, but not if thinking holistically about cryptocurrencies. For its part, the agency has said there is generally information asymmetry between token issuers and buyers (that is: issuers of crypto tokens almost always possess superior information that would traditionally be grounds for disclosure through registration with the SEC). Secondly, purchasers of crypto tokens can reasonably be said to expect to profit from the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of token issuers.  However, XRP purchasers do not necessarily expect profit from the efforts of Ripple's managers. In terms of information asymmetry, an infinite list of factors can potentially contribute to profitability or decline of XRP. This includes its open-source design, which enables anyone to build new business models or applications on the XRP protocol, which Ripple does not control.  All stakeholders should consider and treat legal controversies as necessary parts of the rule-making process.  Therefore, developers cannot speak with certainty how changes on the protocol will impact the value of XRP in a decentralized ecosystem. In other words, what exactly would they disclose in an SEC “registration statement?” Issuers instead are just as ignorant as token purchasers.  On the flipside, the SEC’s argument may not be totally misplaced. In reality, some cryptocurrencies may not be totally decentralized in operation and information asymmetry sometimes exists. For instance, in 2018, engineers discovered a vulnerability on the Bitcoin blockchain that could inflate the total amount of bitcoin beyond its 21 million cap. The developers who fixed the bug withheld information of the bug and its risks that could have possibly devalued bitcoin (BTC) until the exposure was fixed.  See also: The Latest Bitcoin Bug Was So Bad, Developers Kept It Secret  It therefore stands to reason the ideal way to apply securities law to crypto is not set in stone. Regulators may have made their determinations, but that does not mean the current regulatory regime will be acceptable to the courts.  This type of regulation by enforcement can have unintended consequences for financial stability and integrity both in the crypto sector and wider economy. If the court for instance rules in favor of the SEC that XRP is a security, this can translate to heavier regulatory burden on other crypto firms including exchanges and market-makers to comply with onerous requirements.  Moreover, this opens up the crypto industry to enforcement actions for failure to fulfill regulatory requirements which, to be fair, are largely tailored towards the traditional securities market as opposed to decentralized cryptocurrencies. Not only does this potentially stifle innovative financial technology, it effectively operates as an indirect ban on cryptocurrencies.  Not only are bans of crypto hard to enforce (given that decentralized protocols broadly defy regulation by essence of their design), they come with a knock-on effect of pushing legitimate operations into gray or black markets, further compromising financial integrity. In fact, crypto use reportedly jumped in China after a ban was imposed by the Chinese government.  On the flip side, a ruling in favor of Ripple may have its own bad effects. Even a small signal of judicial approval could be read as validating the industry, giving destructive impetus to an ecosystem that is already volatile and prone to abuse. Crypto's extremists, feeling legitimized, pose their own risks to financial stability.  Again, the real risk here resides in the signals sent to the market and the market reaction in response to those signals. Governments and regulators should not appear to be at war with crypto and vice versa. It is not uncommon for the media to promote this narrative – such as the common headline cliche suggesting there’s a regulatory “war on crypto."" Rather all stakeholders should consider and treat legal controversies as necessary parts of the rule-making process for the regulation of an emerging, albeit disruptive, financial technology.  See also: SEC Can't Seal Docs Tied to Hinman's Ether Speech, Judge in Ripple Suit Rules  Worthwhile rules will require both regulatory and judicial creativity as well as industry support. Both sides need to want to come to the table to carefully craft out distinct disclosure requires and standards that reflect the genuine nuances of cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrencies are clearly not securities, so trying to fit them into traditional regulations is like forcing a square peg into a round hole. However, it will be foolhardy to ignore the need for disclosure standards in the crypto industry – there are clear examples of information asymmetry and significant concentration of power in the crypto ecosystem.  Whether Ripple is an example of such a concentration of power is for the courts to decide.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,Femi Olude,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/18/what-are-the-stakes-in-the-sec-vs-ripple-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d58013056b209c2b8a062f0e53c2eabf308cd79-1080x608.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12757966,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533917,1684447255,MATIC Surges Past Key Resistance Level: Can This Breakout Sustain?,"The MATIC price recently broke above a key resistance level, indicating a positive development. However, its price appreciation over the past week has been modest, with only a 2% increase. MATIC has remained close to a critical support line on its daily chart despite the breakout. The technical outlook suggests that recovery might take some time as the bears dominate the price. Both demand and accumulation have decreased in the daily timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Stays Low, Here’s What This Means While MATIC currently sits above an important resistance, the absence of buyer support could lead to a significant loss in value before any recovery occurs on the daily chart. If the bears exert further pressure, MATIC will likely resume sideways trading, fluctuating between $0.81 and $0.84. The uncertainty in the Bitcoin price movement, as it fluctuates from $27,000 and retraces from that level, has impacted altcoins, weakening their respective price action. The MATIC market capitalization has fallen, indicating a higher level of selling activity than buying activity. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.86. It successfully surpassed the $0.84 resistance level in the short term, but buyer sentiment remained weak. The coin’s next significant resistance is $0.87, and breaching this level could initiate a recovery trend. However, if sellers persist, the altcoin could drop toward $0.81 and potentially below $0.80. The key for the bulls to regain control of the price lies in MATIC, staying above $0.86 in the upcoming trading sessions. The trading volume of MATIC in the last session was low, indicating a lack of buying strength. Technical Analysis MATIC faced challenges in generating strong buying support throughout April and May, resulting in reduced demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated a decline, with the indicator remaining below 40, highlighting the dominant presence of sellers in the market. Furthermore, the price dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers were driving the price momentum. However, if MATIC surpasses the $0.87 level, it will trade above the 20-SMA line. In contrast, the altcoin exhibited buy signals on the daily chart, albeit with a diminishing size and strength. The presence of green histograms on the Awesome Oscillator indicated buy signals for the altcoin, reflecting price momentum and potential reversals.

Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and the likelihood of price fluctuations, remained narrow and wide.

Grayscale Investments, a prominent digital asset management firm, has been instructed by the SEC to withdraw its application for a Filecoin Trust, citing potential securities implications. Grayscale’s intent to launch an updated Filecoin Trust product was initially disclosed through a Form 10 application submitted to the SEC on April 14. However, in a recent announcement, Grayscale revealed that the regulatory body has expressed reservations about Filecoin’s categorization, asserting that it could fall under the definition of a security. Related Reading: Conflux Network Partners With China Telecom For Blockchain, SIM Project – Details Grayscale Pushes Back Against SEC Filecoin Securities Claim Grayscale has revealed that it received a comment letter from the SEC on May 16. In the letter, the regulatory body cautioned that Filecoin (FIL), the underlying asset of Grayscale’s proposed Filecoin Trust, meets the criteria for being classified as a security under federal law. As a result, the SEC requested that Grayscale withdraw its application for the trust product. The intended transformation of Grayscale’s existing Filecoin Trust into a more public company-like entity, as outlined in the Form 10 application, would have entailed the filing of quarterly reports detailing the financial activities of the trust. However, the SEC’s recent warning has cast doubt on the regulatory viability of such a structure. In response to the SEC’s assertion, Grayscale expressed a differing viewpoint. According to the firm, Filecoin should not be classified as a security under federal securities laws. Consequently, Grayscale intends to promptly submit a detailed explanation to the SEC staff, outlining the legal basis for its position. SEC Definition Of Securities; Implications For Crypto Industry The comment letter received by Grayscale Investments from the SEC sheds light on the regulator’s perspective regarding the classification of Filecoin (FIL) as a security.

42420404,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpfVl,1684442607,"Bitcoin Drops Below $27K as Investors Continue to Weigh Debt Ceiling Talks, Regulatory Actions","Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled back below $27,000, reversing its advance from a day ago as investors continued to weigh the ongoing debt ceiling talks in Washington, D.C. and the latest regulatory moves.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $26,700, down 2.1% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. BTC had challenged $27,500 Thursday morning, but a quick pullback early in the afternoon took the price down to nearly $26,400.  “Bitcoin is hovering near its recent lows as investors await regulatory clarity and whether Wall Street believes any use-case arguments will be made anytime soon,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Thursday note. “This frustrating trading range has turned off many investors and if the crypto fundamentals don’t improve anytime soon, downward pressure could resume,” he continued.  Over $20 million of BTC futures were liquidated in the past four hours, with 87% of them being long positions, or bets on higher prices, according to Coinglass data.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, followed a similar trend, down 1.6% to change hands at around $1,795 on Thursday afternoon. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market performance, was down 2.2% on Thursday.  Equity markets closed higher Thursday afternoon, with a late rally pulling the Nasdaq higher by 1.5% the S&P 500 by 0.95%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 0.35%.  Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at Ninepoint Partners, told CoinDesk in an interview that BTC has recently performed more like “a technology stock” than “a pure store of value.”  “Last year, almost all assets weakened against the US dollar,” Tapscott said. “We were in the midst of a real liquidity crunch where rates were going up so much that people were deleveraging. The most liquid and most safe assets a lot of people considered were U.S. Treasuries and U.S. dollars.""  “The Nasdaq and other tech-focused investments have played a little bit of catch-up” this year, he added. “At the same time, we're seeing bitcoin consolidating around [near] between $27,000 to $30,000 level.”  While some analysts argued that the debt ceiling debate could boost “safe-haven” assets such as gold and bitcoin, Tapscott said he’s not convinced that BTC’s price will go up in the event of a government default.  Noelle Acheson, a market analyst and former head of research at Genesis Trading and CoinDesk (both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group), pointed out in her newsletter on Thursday that if the debt ceiling ended up being raised, there could be “a sharp withdrawal of monetary liquidity as the Treasury issues a ton of debt in order to replenish its treasury.”  The issuance of debt to top-up coffers means that “money will move out of cash and risk assets into US government bonds, especially as yields on these instruments rise to offset the increase in supply,” Acheson wrote, adding that this could be unfavorable for bitcoin and gold as both tend to fall in price when yields are rising.  Bitcoin’s 2024 halving cycle  While the market wavers during these debt ceiling talks, Ninepoint Partners' Tapscott suggested that investors will soon be pivoting their attention toward BTC’s 2024 halving cycle that “typically precedes a bull market in crypto.”  Messari Research Analyst Sami Kassab told CoinDesk in an email that when examining price charts from the last three halvings – 2012, 2016, and 2020 – “it becomes apparent that bitcoin has consistently entered a bull market within 12-18 months prior to each halving event.”  Kassab said the current price action of BTC appears to be in line with these previous cycles, suggesting that ""the pattern is still holding.” He reminded, however, that past performance is not a guarantee of future results.  Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, said the halving likely isn’t fully priced in. He told CoinDesk that “miner selling pressure literally halves next April which is buoyant. Moreover, the 4-year cycle normally sees bitcoin end the cycle above the average price for that cycle.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/18/bitcoin-drops-below-27k-as-investors-continue-to-weigh-debt-ceiling-talks-regulatory-actions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82f4c6440c9242808167a395355087b22a389650-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One of the new models, WhatsMiner M53S++, delivers 320 terahash per second (TH/s) of computing power with efficiency of 22 joules per terahash (J/T). It is more powerful than rival Bitmain's equivalent, the Antminer S19 XP Hydro, which delivers up to 257 TH/s, but less efficient that the Bitmain model, which can run at 20.8 J/T, the company's founder and CEO Zuoxing Yang said.  The other two models were the M50S++, designed for air-cooling and with computing power of 150 TH/s, and the M56S++, designed for immersion cooling, which can deliver up to 230 TH/s. Both machines have an efficiency of 22 J/TH.  The rig maker's motivation for the new machines were mainly to utilize sustainable source of energy, amid heated debate over enormous power usage by the miners. ""Faced with the energy crisis and global warming, Dr. Yang believes that the power source for bitcoin mining needs to be upgraded by finding better solutions like green energy,"" the firm said in a press release.

He also pointed out that over 90% of the heat generated from the mining machines can be collected which then can be used for various other uses, including space heating, steam for industry and fish hatchery.

The firm filed three lawsuits late Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware against FTX insiders including founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Embed shareholders, and Embed executives including founder Michael Giles, Reuters reported. FTX alleges the Bankman-Fried and other FTX employees misused company funds to buy stakes in Embed as part of the transaction. The acquisition occurred six weeks before FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022. FTX's efforts to sell Embed produced a high bid of $1M, made by Giles. The auction ""leaves no doubt"" that the $220M that FTX spent to purchase Embed was ""wildly inflated relative to the company's fair value, which Giles well knew,"" Reuters reported, citing the lawsuit. The lawsuit also alleged that Embed's software, which FTX intended to use to add stock trading to its crypto platform, was ""essentially worthless."" As part of the deal, FTX paid Embed employees $70M in retention bonuses, most of which went to Giles.

The company, granted a New York BitLicense in January 2023, had advertised free wallet storage on its website, but it charged fees that sometimes entirely emptied investors’ accounts, the investigation concluded. In an agreement with the state, Coin Cafe is paying back those harmed, including 340 investors in New York.  “Coin Cafe defrauded hundreds of New Yorkers out of thousands of dollars with its deceptive marketing and due to a lack of effective regulation,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement. “This is yet another example of why the cryptocurrency industry needs to be better regulated, just like any other financial institution where New York investors put their hard-earned money.”  James’ office has been pushing state legislation seeking much more authority in the digital assets industry, which is currently handled primarily by the New York Department of Financial Services. Crypto insiders fear the new measures will make it much more difficult to do business in the state.  Coin Cafe customers who want the refunds must request them in the next 12 months.  The platform also illegally failed to register with the attorney general as a commodity broker-dealer, according to the agreement dated Thursday.

12755702,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533890,1684440023,"Whale Alert: 1,750 Bitcoin (BTC) Moved To Exchange, Massive Plunge Incoming?","An intriguing development has caught the crypto community’s attention as a Bitcoin whale deposited a substantial amount of BTC on the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance. This significant move has sparked speculation about potential selling pressure and the subsequent impact on Bitcoin’s price. Notably, the massive deposit was recorded when Bitcoin showed signs of a rebound following its recent losses in the past week. Whale Moves BTC To Binance According to renowned on-chain analyst Lookonchain, a notable Bitcoin whale made a deposit of 1,750 BTC which is worth over $48 Million, on the Binance exchange a few hours ago. This occurrence has raised concerns among market observers, as large transactions can indicate imminent selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin whale moves BTC to Binance exchange The on-chain data analyst further reveals this whale has a history of triggering sudden moves in the price action. On April 21, the same individual deposited a staggering 5,791 BTC (equivalent to $163 million), leading to a subsequent 3% drop in Bitcoin’s price within five hours. Notably, Lookonchain says this whale has a history of buying large amounts of Bitcoin. The analyst reports that the whale initially acquired 10,000 BTC, valued at $171 million, on December 1, 2022, when Bitcoin was priced at $17,101. And as of now, the whale has a current Bitcoin holding balance of 2,459 BTC and an approximate profit of $107 million. Bitcoin Reaction: Analyzing the Possibilities It is worth noting that the Bitcoin market reaction to this whale can be quite unpredictable as the large investor alone might have a different reason to move the coins besides selling them. However, given the historical evidence of price movements following whale deposits on exchanges, Bitcoin will likely experience a spike in volatility soon. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For A Breakout? Glassnode Co-Founder Weighs In Particularly, If the past is any indication, there is a possibility of a short-term dip in Bitcoin’s price if the whale sells its BTC deposit. The sudden influx of 1,750 BTC into the exchange may trigger a cascade of sell-offs from other market participants, leading to a temporary downturn. Regardless, Bitcoin’s price has experienced a quick spike in the past 24 hours, up by 1%. Bitcoin has shown possible signs of rebound along with the rest of the crypto market. BTC has surged from low trading below $27,000 yesterday to trading for $27,406 at the time of writing. Before the bullish signs, BTC has since been in a downward trend in the past weeks, down by more than 10% in the past month. Interestingly, BTC trading volume remains below $10 billion despite the whale movement.

12754617,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533893,1684436410,CeFi Users Want To Explore DeFi: Uniswap Survey Uncovers New Wave Of Adoption,"Uniswap Labs, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, has recently conducted a survey to understand the motivations and barriers of US-based retail users towards DeFi. The survey received 1,860 responses, including non-crypto, centralized finance (CeFi), and DeFi users. The survey revealed that despite the bear market backdrop, nearly half of CeFi users expressed an interest in experimenting with DeFi protocols in the next 12 months. This finding is encouraging as it indicates a growing interest in DeFi among traditional finance users, who are willing to learn and explore the possibilities of on-chain activity. Related Reading: Internet Computer (ICP) Dips, Will Bearish Momentum Persist? Uniswap Survey Points to A Shift from CeFi To DeFi However, the survey also highlighted that complexity, lack of understanding, and costs are the main barriers preventing CeFi users from using DeFi platforms for all their cryptocurrency trades. This finding underscores the importance of providing educational material, improved user experience, and support to overcome the learning curve associated with DeFi. But how is Uniswap Labs simplifying DeFi for CeFi users? Seamless User Interface: Uniswap Labs has a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate the platform and execute trades with a few clicks. This contrasts traditional DeFi platforms, which can be overwhelming for new users. Automated Market Making (AMM): Uniswap Labs uses an AMM system that eliminates the need for order books and allows users to easily swap tokens at a fair market price, simplifying the trading process and eliminating the need for users to understand complex trading concepts. Self-Custody: Uniswap Labs strongly emphasizes self-custody, meaning users have complete control over their assets and do not rely on centralized custodians. While this may seem daunting initially, Uniswap Labs provides educational resources and support to help users understand the benefits of self-custody. With this, Uniswap Labs, which builds products to onboard people directly to DeFi, aims to bridge the gap between CeFi and DeFi by focusing on UX and considering the first steps as a gateway into the broader crypto ecosystem. By doing so, Uniswap Labs seeks to provide CeFi users with a more transparent, self-custodial, and publicly verifiable alternative to centralized finance platforms that often lack accountability and transparency. Transaction Fees And Costs Identified As Biggest Barriers Transaction fees and costs were also identified as notable barriers to entry. However, as Ethereum continues to scale and layer 2 solutions see greater adoption, DeFi will become more economically accessible for price-sensitive users, according to Uniswap’s blog post. The survey also revealed that better educational resources and increased user support would increase willingness among CeFi users to trade on DeFi platforms. Products targeting this CeFi segment have already invested in these educational resources. Uniswap Labs has assembled one of the few customer support teams in crypto, considered one of the best in the industry. For this, Uniswap Labs is exploring layer 2 scaling solutions that will significantly reduce transaction fees and increase the speed of transactions. This will make DeFi more economically accessible and user-friendly for price-sensitive users. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Addresses Controversy Surrounding BitBoy’s BEN Token Sell-Off Overall, Uniswap Labs’ survey sheds light on the motivations and barriers of US-based retail users towards DeFi. The platform aims to simplify and abstract the complexities unique to crypto without compromising on the ideals of self-custody and transparency. As the industry continues to grow, it is important to prioritize user education and support to help users build their knowledge base and grow their confidence.

42393508,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biygnp,1684435865,Should We Worry About Tether’s Bitcoin-Buying Plan?,"Like any good Bitcoin maximalist, Tether is holding its own coins. The issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT, disclosed that information in a recent blog post announcing it will be “regularly” buying bitcoin with its surplus profits to build up a war chest. This follows a surprisingly robust attestation (aka an “Assurance Report” completed by top five accounting firm BDO Italia, which is not the same as an audit) showing Tether netted $1.48 billion in profit in the first quarter of the year. The firm’s “excess of reserves” has about doubled to $2.4 billion, which I think would be included in its $81.8 billion in “consolidated total assets” (most of which would be the cash, cash-like and other investments Tether makes to back its eponymous stablecoin).  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     With the new bitcoin-buying plan, announced about a week after the attestation, Tether joins the ranks of a number of institutional behemoths hoovering up BTC. Notably, MicroStrategy, the publicly-traded tech firm that after nearly two years of dollar cost averaging now essentially trades as a backdoor bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), is getting pretty close to owning about 1% of bitcoin’s total supply. Tether already holds a little over 52,000 BTC, making its bitcoin treasury among the largest among corporations, with plans to spend 15% of the “tangible gains from its operations” on more coins. The company’s “conservative and prudent” investment strategy also includes a sizable investment in gold (unknown if that’s self-custodied, too).  Although Tether didn’t state as much, its bitcoin-buying plan could also be seen as an attempt to de-risk its exposure to the U.S. dollar. It’s en vogue nowadays to talk about “dedollarization,” or the process by which countries (and to a lesser extent companies) reduce their reliance on the greenback, seeing as trust is dwindling in the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. More specifically, the Federal Reserve (which manages monetary policy) is caught between quelling inflation and starting a recession while the U.S. Congress (fiscal policy) is locked into a “debt ceiling” debate that genuinely risks the U.S. Treasury defaulting on its loans – leaving the world to search for alternatives.  It wouldn’t be totally off base to suggest as much: Circle, Tether’s largest competitor, is “diversifying” its holdings of U.S. Treasury’s (often considered “risk free” in portfolio construction) into the overnight “repo” market. Both stablecoin issuers have stated bluntly they are reducing their reliance on “pure bank deposits,” considering the wave of bank failures in the U.S. So, while Tether’s CTO Paolo Ardoino is only willing to go in the press release as far as talking up bitcoin’s strengths and the company’s attempt at “aligning ourselves with a transformative technology,” the move is as much about the weaknesses of the U.S. dollar.  There’s really no amount of bitcoin that would save the firm if the buck breaks. But until that happens, Tether just has to take in funds and pay out withdrawals – and it can invest the spread wherever it wants  None of this is an issue, of course. Tether is a private company and can do what it wants with its money. As Austin Campbell, an ex-portfolio manager at Paxos who used to run the Binance-branded BUSD stablecoin when it was worth some $22 billion, said: ""if they are buying bitcoin with profits and adding that as a safety buffer, it's just a way for them to speculate on BTC prices that is not particularly harmful.”  So long as the company is not swapping out bitcoin for its cash or cash-like reserve assets, like U.S. Treasury’s, meant to ensure USDT is always redeemable 1:1 for the U.S. dollar, then it’s fine. And Tether did say it's only using profits.  But the situation might still churn a few stomachs. First, it’s worth noting Tether is keeping up releasing attestations after the New York Attorney General found the company had “at times” lied to its users and the investing public about the nature of its reserves. Tether is riding high today, benefiting from a confluence of recent forces including a nice little run up in bitcoin’s price, general crypto volatility and a bank run that bolstered the case for alternative stores-of-value like stablecoins (while, more or less by chance, dislodging Circle’s USDC as the most-trustworthy option). But it’s not clear sunny days are here to stay.  See also: USDC's Depeg Laid Bare the Risks Traditional Finance | Opinion  Even putting aside the regulatory anvil that is yet to drop, Tether’s recent move stinks of the type of hubris that seems to precede wily crypto firms running into walls. Maybe my memory is tainted by Do Kwon, the backer of the now defunct algorithmic stablecoin UST, saying “Besides Satoshi [Bitcoin’s creator], we will be the largest single holder of bitcoin in the world,” but it does seem like an unnecessary risk to use a highly volatile asset in building a rainy day fund. Kwon, if you don’t remember, had planned to buy $10 billion worth of bitcoin to act as a security blanket, at a time when his LUNA/UST Rube Goldberg machine was worth over $80 billion.  Of course, Tether and Kwon had entirely different business models and risks – there’s a world of difference between algo and non-algo stablecoins. Whereas UST was a decentralized Ponzi scheme in that it was prone to “death spirals” because it used fake money to print representations of real money, Tether is only a decentralized Ponzi-like scheme in that it operates a bit like a bank. Tether takes in capital and mints an equivalent amount of its stablecoin, and then invests that capital and gets to keep the profits. So long as it maintains at least as much in reserve as there is USDT left to be redeemed, it’s a golden goose.  There’s probably someone in the world saying the bitcoin-buying plan is exactly the type of reason why stablecoin issuers need to be regulated. The European Union, for instance, just passed rules so issuers have to maintain strict reserves. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress seems divided on how to tackle the issue – leaving issuers essentially along to regulate themselves. Is it strange we just found out Tether was holding BTC and gold, having chosen to “increase transparency” by adding those “additional categories” to its reports? Given the structural importance of USDT to crypto markets, crypto stakeholders might demand not just more insight into but control over the company’s investment decisions.  See also: Why Everyone Is Talking About De-Dollarization  But, in a real way, buying bitcoin with surplus cash likely won’t affect USDT users (though it might even benefit BTC holders). For the trade to go sideways, so much else has to go wrong. It never really made sense to me when Do Kwon would bash the U.S. dollar, claiming that his “decentralized money” (which was pegged to fiat!) would outcompete the world’s reserve currency. Likewise, Tether’s support of bitcoin as a hedge is an implicit acknowledgement of the risk of its own main product. There’s really no amount of bitcoin that would save the firm if the buck breaks. But until that happens, Tether just has to take in funds and pay out withdrawals – and it can invest the spread wherever it wants.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/18/should-we-worry-about-tethers-bitcoin-buying-plan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db4d58b67a337bbcef5b9ac6505dba2750c725f0-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The agreement could amount to $180 million in revenue over the next 24 months. On the same day, the company disclosed a prospectus that has executives and insiders registering shares for sale. The following day Applied Digital disclosed a $175,000,000 mixed shelf offering. On May 16th, Applied Digital (APLD) announced an agreement with what it says will be the company's first Artificial Intelligence cloud computing customer: through its wholly-owned subsidiary Sai Computing, has secured its first major AI customer with an agreement worth up to $180 million over a 24-month period The announcement, which came pre-market on the 16th, mentioned a possibility of $180 million in revenue over a 24-month period from the agreement. In the release, CEO Wes Cummins mentioned that this is just the ""tip of the iceberg:"" With a surge in demand for high-performance compute power to support the growing AI industry, we are excited to be at the forefront of this transformation. This partnership not only reaffirms our commitment to advancing emerging technology applications but also solidifies our position as a key player in the digital infrastructure landscape Applied's release said the revenue includes a significant prepayment with service beginning in June. What was notably not in the press release was any mention of a baseline revenue estimate or an estimate of how much of the $180 million will be realized before the end of 2023. Applied Digital's Stock Rally Given the massive jump in sales this would represent for a company with just $41 million in twelve month trailing revenue, the stock price responded very favorably to the news and is now up 320% year to date. Much of that appreciation has come in just a few sessions: Data by YCharts On the 16th, APLD shares closed 79% higher on the session and did so on nearly 80 times the volume from the previous day. There was a continuation on the 17th with APLD shares moving up another 15% on the follow up session. However, the 15% gain came on about 34% of the volume from the May 16th rally. On one hand, it's easy to make the case that this rally is warranted due to the potential revenue increase. Artificial Intelligence Search Interest (Google Trends) On the other hand, there's a lot of interest in Artificial Intelligence, or AI, at the moment and any company that theoretically benefits from growth in that space figures to benefit from speculative stock buyer interest. Speculative buying interest appears to be the main driver of the immediate response to the company's AI revenue announcement. However, I suspect this rally could be somewhat short lived. Share Registration Applied Digital's AI revenue press release before the market opening wasn't the only release from the company on May 16th. After hours the company disclosed two separate prospectus filings that individually detailed the registration of 13,500,213 and 41,224,531 shares of the company's common stock for stockholder selling. The two combined shareholder registrations amount to 54,724,744 common shares. These sale registrations represent 57% of the 95,908,964 outstanding APLD common shares. Name of Selling Stockholder Shares Beneficially Owned Registered Shares B. Riley Securities, Inc. 613,163 155,000 PFSI Custodian FBO Carla Cummins IRA Account 423,833 423,833 Cummins Family Ltd.

Through various accounts, Cummins collectively owns approximately 42 million shares that amount to almost 44% of the company's outstanding common stock. It should be noted that there is no guarantee that any or all of these shares will ultimately be sold. But if all of the shares that have been registered are indeed sold, it would result in Cummins owning just 2.1 million APLD shares. Now for full disclosure, Cummins did purchase another 10,000 APLD shares on May 17th at $6.17 per share. But the main story here is the overwhelming majority of his stock is now registered to be sold. He's not the only one either. Co-founder Jason Zhang registered all 3,256,426 of his shares. CFO David Rench and CMO Regina Ingel also registered the majority of their shares. Though their positions are much smaller than Zhang's. Shelf Offering On May 17th, Applied Digital disclosed a $175 million mixed shelf offering that may include the sales of common stock, preferred stock, and/or warrants. Beyond that, details are limited and will be provided in future disclosures: Common Stock, par value $0.001per share (the ""Common Stock"") To be set forth in a prospectus supplement Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 (the ""Preferred Stock"") To be set forth in a prospectus supplement Warrants To be set forth in a prospectus supplement Total $175,000,000 Source: Applied Digital The company says the proceeds from the offering will be used to fund working capital needs. Evidently, the previously mentioned revenue from the company's first AI customer isn't going to be lucrative enough or immediate enough to fund growth without shareholder dilution. Valuation Anyone following this ticker or my work likely knows Applied Digital is a company that I've covered several times. In my first article covering APLD for Seeking Alpha, valuation was a concern of mine. My biggest concern at this point is the share registration. Regardless of those share sales, the stock is overvalued again. Annualized Sales $146,400,000 Shares 95,908,964 Sales per share $1.52 Share price $7.05 Price to sales 4.62 Source: Author's estimates and calculations If we assume Applied Digital's annualized revenue includes an even distribution of the $180 million from the AI service agreement, we get $90 million in annualized revenue from that customer. And again, this assumes perfection pertaining to that agreement. The reality is we don't really know how much revenue that deal will actually provide Applied Digital over the next 24 months. It could be much less than $180 million. The remaining $56 million in that revenue estimate comes from annualizing the $14.1 million in pre-existing revenue from the prior quarter. At nearly 5 times sales, APLD certainly isn't cheap. Summary I sold some of my APLD shares following the AI revenue announcement on May 16th and then I sold a little bit more after seeing the prospectus and the shelf offering disclosures. I haven't sold it all. I'm still long APLD shares. But I suspect we're going to see a reversion back to previous share price levels and it could happen fairly quickly. APLD has benefited from momentum traders chasing the artificial intelligence narrative. Beyond that, the company's executives and insiders could be preparing to sell the rip. We're all likely familiar with the idea of following the leader. That kind of thinking is what ultimately pushed me to go long APLD shares back in March given what appeared to be high conviction buying from Wes Cummins. But now it looks like the leader could possibly be preparing to take some profit. It might be wise for you to do the same.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4605831-applied-digital-dont-be-greedy-when-up-320-percent-ytd?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12754425.jpeg
42393518,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biyhXz,1684435544,"Crypto Markets Turn Lower After Jobs Data, Hawkish Fed Comments","Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) fell to the bottom ends of their recent ranges, with economic data appearing to weigh on investor sentiment.  Thursday morning’s 8:30 AM ET release of initial jobless claims showed 242,000 Americans filing for unemployment benefits, down 22,000 from last week’s reading of 264,000 and lower by 12,000 than consensus estimates of 254,000.  Lower than expected initial jobless claims are likely to be bearish for asset prices in general and crypto prices specifically as it makes it less likely the U.S. Federal Reserve will pause an historic string of rate hikes at its next meeting in June. The Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has repeatedly signaled that looser labor markets are a prerequisite for lower interest rates.  Indeed, Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan later on Thursday indicated that current data points don’t yet justify a pause in interest rate hikes. “The labor market’s continued strength appears to be contributing to high inflation”, stated Logan.  In the minutes following the new jobs data, prices for bitcoin and ether modestly fell back on higher than expected volume.  Returning serve was movement on a potential U.S. debt deal being reached between Democrats and Republicans. The United States has essentially reached its $31.4 trillion debt limit. A deal would increase that limit, allowing the U.S. to incur more debt for the payment of its obligations.  Not increasing the limit would prohibit the U.S. from paying its bills, with markets anticipating that having a deleterious impact on both the economy and risk assets. A few bitcoin bulls would counter that idea, suggesting reduced confidence in the United States’ ability to pay its debts could lead to that crypto as being viewed as a more sound currency option.  “We can agree that it (i.e. default) would be bad news all around, but perhaps would be good for bitcoin and gold as fiat economy alternatives,” wrote Noelle Acheson in her “Crypto is Macro Now” blog.  Still, both President Joe Biden, and Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy expressed confidence that a deal will soon be reached.  McCarthy’s Thursday morning remarks on the debt deal appeared to push markets higher during the 10:00 AM ET hour, with bitcoin’s hourly chart showed an expansion in trading range as the crypto rose to $27,400  Crypto markets, however, turned decidedly lower in afternoon trade, with bitcoin tumbling to close to a one-month low at $26,580 on high trading volume.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/18/crypto-markets-turn-lower-after-jobs-data-hawkish-fed-comments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c91aafe8ada03ab074d019299b9e9a71a716843e-612x449.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The debate over cryptocurrencies continues, with supporters citing declining faith in fiat currencies and increased acceptance of cryptos, while opponents highlight regulatory challenges and intrinsic value concerns. Bitcoin's history of boom-and-bust cycles and its current bullish pattern since November 2022 suggest potential for another explosive rally in the coming months and years. After reaching a low in November 2022, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) recovered, reaching its latest high at just below the $31,000 per token level on April 14. Since mid-March, Bitcoin has primarily traded between $26,000 and $30,000, extending to the nearly $31,000 high and the recent low under the $26,000 level. At $27,100 per token on May 18, the price continues to consolidate at almost double the level at the November 2022 low. The Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) correlates well with Bitcoin and the asset class's overall market cap. Since its inception, BITQ has traded as high as $35.68 and as low as $3.20 per share. At the $6.90 level on May 18, BITQ has lots of room to appreciate if cryptos emerge from the current price consolidation on the upside. The debate over cryptocurrencies continues Emotional support and opposition surround Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency asset class. The supporting factors include: The declining faith and credit of fiat currencies are bullish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Technically, Bitcoin and other tokens found significant bottoms and boom-and-bust price action have been the norm over the past years. The November 2021 through November 2022 Bitcoin bust could give way to a boom if the historical patterns repeat. Bitcoin and other cryptos have gained more acceptance over the past years as payment and investment assets. A prolonged consolidation near the recent high could be a bullish sign for an asset. On the other side of the debate: Governments do not favor independent cryptocurrencies as they threaten the control of the money supply. Regulatory bodies have increased supervision and rules contrary to crypto's ideological thesis. Cryptos remain an uber-alternative asset class, and the volatility continues to scare away potential market participants. The intrinsic value of crypto tokens is a subject of significant debate. Value is in the eyes of the beholder, and Bitcoin and cryptos are the subjects of widespread debate. Supporters see cryptos as the technology that changes the financial world, while some opponents, like Charlie Munger, characterize cryptos as "" disgusting "" and contrary to the civilized world. A long boom-and-bust history Volatility is a paradise for traders embracing wild price swings, but wide price variance is a nightmare for passive investors. Action junkies have embraced Bitcoin and cryptos because of their penchant for boom-and-bust price action. Chart of Bitcoin versus U.S. Dollars Since 2010 (Barchart) The chart dating back to 2010 highlights a series of significant percentage gains and losses: In the first sustained boom period, Bitcoin rose from 5 cents in July 2010 to $1,135.45 in November 2013. The following bust took Bitcoin to a $172.45 low in January 2015. The next explosive rally took the leading cryptocurrency to $19,862 in December 2017. The price imploded to a $3,158.10 low in December 2018. Bitcoin recovered to $13,844.30 in June 2019 before falling to $3,925.27 in March 2020. In November 2021, Bitcoin reached its all-time peak at $68,906.48. Over the next year, it fell to $15,516.53 in November 2022. At the $27,100 level on May 18, 2023, Bitcoin could be poised for another explosive rally over the coming months and years. A bullish pattern since the November 2022 lows Over the past seven months, Bitcoin has settled into a pattern of higher lows and higher highs. Chart of Bitcoin versus U.S. Dollars since the November 2022 low (Barchart) The chart highlights Bitcoin's bullish path. Bull markets rarely move in straight lines, and selloffs are the norm. Meanwhile, the top cryptocurrency with a $525 billion market cap at $27,100 per token is back in boom mode in late May 2023. BITQ is a diversified crypto ETF The top holdings of the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF include: Top Holdings of the BITQ ETF Product (Seeking Alpha) BITQ holds Bitcoin and crypto-related companies, including trading platforms, miners, and other pick-and-shovel cryptocurrency businesses.

42393503,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biygYR,1684433324,"Elizabeth Warren’s Bill Won’t Stop Money Laundering, but It Could Ban Crypto","On Capitol Hill, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS), are pushing legislation that purports to close loopholes bad actors may exploit to launder money through crypto assets. But what the legislation – the so-called Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act – actually does is further a strategy to ban crypto by treating software developers and transaction validators as financial institutions, in effect rendering crypto useless. Warren, after all, says she’s leading an “anti-crypto army.”  Money laundering, the process of filtering ill-gotten gains through the traditional financial system, is illegal. There’s some laundering of money using crypto assets, although most occurs using fiat currencies. Law enforcement has proven adept at identifying and holding accountable those who break money laundering laws. All of these facts are true, but you wouldn’t know that listening to the debate on Capitol Hill. Proponents of this dangerous new legislation would have you believe that money laundering is a problem unique to crypto assets, occurring at an unprecedented scale. And law enforcement is incapable of stopping it because of outdated laws.  John Rizzo is senior vice president for Public Affairs at Clyde Group where he provides strategic counsel and communications. He most recently served as the senior spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury covering digital assets, fintech, climate finance, financial stability, domestic finance and economic policy.  Crypto assets and the underlying blockchain technology that they are built on are novel. Still, the legislative strategy used to advance legislation to undermine them permanently is as old as America itself. The authors of this legislation have identified an illegal act that has salience with the American public and is broadly opposed, money laundering. They further recognize that blockchain technology and crypto assets are new concepts to people nationwide.  So, they slap the label Americans know they don’t like on the brand they don’t yet know and pursue a long-term strategy of banning crypto under the guise of an anti-money laundering policy. It’s the legislative equivalent of a Trojan horse, and those who care about the future of crypto assets need to quickly mobilize to defeat the bill, which was first introduced in 2022 and may soon be introduced in this new Congress.  A fair assessment of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act clarifies that the legislation is both unnecessary and designed to further a policy banning crypto outright. Money laundering has long been illegal in the United States and throughout the world. Despite these prohibitions, there’s no question that the original attempts to stymie money laundering were imperfect, evidenced by subsequent Congressional and international efforts to strengthen anti-money laundering laws.  In assessing the Warren-Marshall bill, one must ask whether the legislation identifies legitimate gaps in the legal regime covering money laundering, whether the legislation does more harm than good, and if there are alternate ways to achieve the policy objective of cracking down on money laundering without undermining the very existence of crypto and blockchain technology.  On the first score, the idea that the Warren-Marshall bill identifies gaps in current anti-money laundering laws is undermined by the robust record of law enforcement's success in identifying, arresting, and charging those using crypto assets to launder money. These law enforcement actions have stopped illicit actions worth hundreds of millions of dollars and include successful efforts to stop suspected criminals from using crypto-mixing services to conceal the source of their funds.  Moreover, a recent report by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on illicit finance risks in DeFi is clear that while money laundering using crypto assets does occur, those engaged in illegal activity still prefer to commit their crimes the old-fashioned way – through fiat currency. And it’s not because would-be money launderers do not understand crypto; it’s because laundering money using fiat currency and opaque jurisdictions is easier and more likely to avoid law enforcement detection than a traceable blockchain. Even the terrorist group Hamas has called it quits on taking donations in crypto.  If the Warren-Marshall legislation fails the necessary test, does it do more harm than good? After all, money laundering is terrible. Shouldn’t the legislation be passed even if it only helps on the margins? Here is where the harms of the legislation, namely requiring those that develop software and validate transactions on a blockchain to register as financial institutions, are so problematic. The problem is these individuals can’t practically register as a financial institution. The authors of this legislation know this and further know that requiring software developers and validators to engage in the same kind of multi-million dollar compliance regime that banks do would collapse the crypto economy, which, after all, is the point.  While it’s clear that money laundering is not a problem unique to crypto and that the Warren-Marshall legislation would do more harm than good, there’s no question that the optimal amount of money laundering in the global financial system is zero. And to that end, there are steps Congress can take to reduce money laundering in crypto and traditional assets.  For instance, Congress can pass legislation to create a federal money transmission license to standardize projections or institute a supervisory regime for digital currency exchanges overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Increased penalties for money laundering of all types could serve as an increased deterrent. Finally, a leading study that examined how best to help law enforcement better crack down on crimes involving crypto identified multi-jurisdictional cooperation, tools, and training as primary needs, not anything remotely approaching the Warren-Marshall bill.  Despite all the problems with the Warren-Marshall bill, its backers are committed to pursuing it and likely looking for a moving legislative vehicle to attach their legislation to. The proposed legislation is unnecessary to counter money laundering, and it does more good than harm. But if you’re interested in leading an anti-crypto army and seeing the industry collapse, it might be just what you need.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,John Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/18/elizabeth-warrens-bill-wont-stop-money-laundering-but-it-could-ban-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b26fe8dbd653737f08a67e8c7c1f928e17063a82-1920x1238.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393523,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biyhiF,1684433033,How to Use Etherscan and Other Blockchain Explorers,"A lot of people mistake the anonymity crypto offers with transactions being private. But the majority of blockchains rely on public ledgers to work, and show each and every transaction and a host of data around those transactions to anyone who knows how to look.  Owing to this transparency, each transfer of cryptocurrency is available for the scrutiny of public observers. But raw blockchain data is a mess that needs sorting into a more readable and usable output. Thankfully, free websites called blockchain explorers trawl through this data and refashion it into a sprawling map of the cryptocurrency market. These vast public databases let you search for a wallet or smart contract and track any transfers it has made.  One of the most popular blockchain explorers is called Etherscan. It’s created to track the Ethereum blockchain, but similar sites exist for other chains, like BNB Chain’s BscScan, Blockchain.com for Bitcoin or Solscan for Solana. We’ll focus on Etherscan in this guide, but you can apply much of the learning to the other blockchain explorers.  How to get started with Etherscan  Etherscan is a popular blockchain explorer for Ethereum (ETH). It’s handy for tracking funds and it’s pretty powerful, too; it even lets you interact with smart contracts directly from its website. You can track the entirety of the Ethereum blockchain here, including ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Let’s start with what you can see on the front page.  The bottom left-hand column of the screenshot above displays all the latest blocks – batches of transactions that a blockchain validator processed all in one go. You can see how much ETH they earned for validating the transaction, how long it took and the block number (also known as the block height). The column on the bottom right displays information about individual transactions included within the latest blocks. It details who sent what to whom, how much was sent and when.  Of course, these columns only display the latest data. Dig deeper into Etherscan and you can see all transactions from every wallet and smart contract. Clicking on the latest transaction hash reveals more information about that transaction.  This includes how many confirmations it received – how many times validators approved the transaction on the blockchain. You can also see the “gas price” – how much it cost, in ETH’s smallest denomination, the Gwei, to send the funds between wallets. Although all Ethereum addresses start with “0x”, some wallets are labeled, which identifies who owns the wallet. You can click on the label to see what other smart contracts or data is connected to that address. For example, these are all the accounts claimed by NFT marketplace OpenSea.  See Also: How to Check Your Ethereum Transaction  You can also interact directly with smart contracts on Etherscan and check out the code. The following screenshot is of the smart contract code for Loot, a once-popular NFT project.  You can see the total supply of the NFT collection, how many people hold a token from the collection and the number of people that traded the NFT. You can also see the code for the smart contract, and even interact with it by clicking on “write contract.”  This page once let you claim Loot NFTs. They’re all long gone; the collection sold out within a few minutes during the summer of 2021.  Many crypto sites offer a prettier front-end website that makes it easy to interact with smart contracts, for instance, Uniswap. But while those sites make it easier, the permissionless nature of smart contracts means you can access them from anywhere, including Etherscan. So, instead of swapping tokens on Uniswap.org, you could do it on Etherscan instead.  Etherscan also allows for the tagging of certain wallets – which is very useful when you need to follow the money. For example, it’s possible to track the wallet that drained balances from FTX accounts shortly after the exchange went bankrupt. You usually can’t see transfers from exchanges, which largely do not process trades on blockchains but instead on internal matching engines. It’s cheaper for exchanges to avoid the blockchain because they do not have to pay gas fees. That said, you can see some interesting information about exchanges, such as how much ETH crypto exchange Kraken holds in one of its wallets.  Other blockchain explorers and tools  Although this guide has focused on Etherscan, other sites function much the same. Indeed, Etherscan has several system sites through its Explorer-as-a-Service (EaaS) product, which leverages Etherscan to replicate the site on other blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Its sister site, BscScan, for instance, looks pretty much identical:  Other explorers offer more bespoke analytics. Nansen is an advanced (and paid) explorer site that lets you track advanced statistics about the crypto market. Others, like Chainalayis, offer powerful tools to track the flow of money across several wallets. Again, unlike blockchain explorers like Etherscan, its tools are not free; indeed, law enforcement in the U.S. fork over millions of dollars to access its services, which help government agencies track down criminals.

12753523,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533791,1684432822,"Bitcoin Binary CDD Stays Low, Here’s What This Means","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) has stayed low recently. Here’s what this says about the current market. Bitcoin Binary CDD Has Remained At Very Low Levels Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, this indicator attained high values during the 2021 bull run. To understand the CDD metric, the concept of “coin days” needs to be looked at first. Whenever 1 BTC stays stationary on the blockchain for 1 day, it accumulates 1 “coin day.” If a coin that has remained unmoved on the network for a while, meaning that it has accumulated a certain number of coin days, is now suddenly transferred, its coin days counter would naturally reset back to zero. The coin days it had previously been carrying are said to be “destroyed.” The CDD indicator measures the total number of coin days being reset throughout the network on any given day. When this indicator has a high value, it implies that a large number of coin days are being reset in the market currently. Generally, this kind of trend is a sign of movement from the “long-term holders” (LTHs). This group includes investors that have been holding their BTC since at least 155 days ago, so these holders tend to accumulate large numbers of coin days. Because of this reason, whenever they make transfers, the CDD registers a spike. In the context of the current discussion, the CDD itself isn’t of interest, but a modified version of it called the Binary CDD is. This indicator basically tells us how the CDD currently compares with the historical average value of the metric. As is already obvious from its name, this indicator can only attain two values: 0 and 1. It has a value of 0 if the CDD is below the historical average, while it’s 1 when the metric is above it.

Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been low in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Binary CDD has had a pretty low value for a while now. This suggests that there hasn’t been any significant destruction of coin days in the market recently. Naturally, this means that the LTHs haven’t been making any moves out of the ordinary, despite the price observing a notable increase during the last few months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Whales Accumulate 84,897 BTC The LTHs are generally the most resolute bunch in the market, so transfers from them can have significant implications for the sector since they are a sign that even these holders may have been forced to sell. The Bitcoin bull run during the first half of 2021 saw the 7-day average Binary CDD stay near 1, implying that the LTHs had been selling in full force. As this hasn’t been the case in the rally so far, it appears that the current profits aren’t enough to move these diamond hands, and they are likely expecting better opportunities later on. These investors continuing to hold such a bullish conviction can be constructive for the price in the long term.

Here’s a closer look at what you should think about: Read the Bitcoin Casino Bonus Terms and Conditions Thoroughly review the terms and conditions associated with the bonus because this section outlines important details that can impact your gaming experience.

Welcome bonuses can come in the form of a percentage match bonus on your deposit, free spins on selected slots, or a combination of both. Deposit Bonuses are awarded when you make subsequent deposits after the initial deposit.

42393517,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biyhIb,1684430722,"Pakistan Announces Fresh Ban on Crypto, but Adoption as a Hedge Remains Popular","Pakistan's government has hardened its stance against cryptocurrencies, even as retailers continue to hedge their financial bets against a devaluing Pakistani rupee partly due to a volatile political situation in the nation.  Cryptocurrencies will “never be legalized in Pakistan,” said Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha to the country's Senate Standing Committee on Finance on Wednesday, according to local reports.  The minister said that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had set a condition that cryptocurrency will not be legalized to keep it off the international finance watchdog's so-called ""Grey List,"" according to one local news outlet, and another said Pakistan's stated position is because it goes against the conditions set by the FATF.  Pasha also reportedly said that the nation's central bank, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Information Technology Ministry have been ordered to initiate work on banning cryptocurrencies. In Jan 2022, the SBP declared it planned to ban crypto, its first clear position on the new financial technology, CoinDesk reported.  Meanwhile, Banks in Pakistan have started informing customers that cryptocurrency trading is illegal, at least two sources told CoinDesk.  ""As per regulatory instructions from the State Bank of Pakistan(SBP), any remittance of foreign exchange directly/indirectly outside Pakistan to overseas foreign exchange trading, margin trading, and CFD trading apps/websites/platforms through any payment channel is not allowed/permitted by SBP and such payments are inherently risky and illegal,"" said one message from a bank in Pakistan viewed by CoinDesk.  On April 30, 2023, Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reported that banks have formally warned customers against using debit or credit cards for crypto trading. But Dawn also said that cryptocurrencies are gaining increasing popularity in the nation with the annual trading volume for Pakistan-based wallets going up to $25 billion, up from $18 billion to $20 billion a year ago, according to Zeeshan Ahmed, country general manager at Rain Financial, a Gulf-based trading platform for cryptocurrencies.  This attempted ban comes at a time of political turmoil for Pakistan. Former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who was arrested last week after allegations of corruption and released just days ago after Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled the arrest unlawful, is in a ""tense standoff"" with police at his home in the city of Lahore.  Khan claims police want to arrest him again. The arrest has already led to massive protests in the country.  Pakistan's rupee slid 3.3% to an all-time low against the dollar of 300 per greenback last week, Bloomberg reported.  The political and financial instability has seen Pakistan retailers converting their salaries into stablecoins as a hedge, several sources told CoinDesk.  Ali Farid Khwaja, chairman of KTrade Securities and CEO of BlockTech Pakistan, told CoinDesk that people fear a sovereign default, particularly as the Pakistani government has not been able to secure International Monetary Fund support.  ""I suspect that many people are buying USDT on crypto platforms as a way to get exposure to the US dollar,"" he said. ""Even Bitcoin has performed well against the Pakistani Rupee. During the crypto run, reportedly more than 20 million Pakistanis had opened accounts on crypto platforms.""  A blockchain investor, Bilal Bin Saqib, noted that the Pakistani rupee's value has fallen a ""staggering"" 57.4% against the dollar over the past year.  ""For the majority of the population, stablecoins have emerged as the most convenient method to access the U.S. dollar, as the acquisition of physical dollars is hindered by import restrictions currently in place,"" he said.

Bitcoin Has Once Again Bounced Off This Support Line As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, if this line doesn’t break, then BTC should be able to continue its bullish momentum. The relevant indicator here is the “realized price,” which is a metric derived from a Bitcoin capitalization model called the realized cap. The realized cap calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency by assuming that each individual coin in the circulating supply is worth the same as the price at which it was last moved (which is unlike the market cap, which just uses the current spot price for this purpose). When this model is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the “realized price” emerges. The significance of this indicator is that it’s the price at which the average investor in the market bought their coins. While this realized price is for the entire market, the metric can also be defined for only parts of the sector. In the context of the current discussion, the group of interest is the one with the investors who have been holding their coins since between 1 month and 3 months ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Whales Accumulate 84,897 BTC Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for this particular group: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The 1-3 months cohort is part of the “short-term holder” (STH) group, which is one of the two main divisions of the Bitcoin market. The STHs include all investors that have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. As displayed in the above graph, the realized price of the 1-3 months group has been constantly going up recently. This trend naturally makes sense, as the price of the cryptocurrency has also been rising in the same period. Since these BTC investors only acquired their coins within the last 3 months, their cost basis would obviously follow the trend in the asset’s price, albeit with a bit of lag. Related Reading: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Whales Move Massive Amounts, Dumping Going On? What’s interesting, however, is the line’s interaction with the price. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency’s price was finding resistance here while the bear market was going on. The likely reason behind this pattern may have been that these investors, who would be in losses for the majority of the time in the bear market, would participate in mass selling whenever the price would touch their average cost basis (that is, their realized price), as it would appear as the ideal exit opportunity in such a period since they would at least be able to avoid losses that way. Since the start of the rally this year, though, the pattern seems to have flipped, as the realized price of the 1-3 months cohort has been providing support to the asset. It would appear that these investors are currently looking at their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity since they probably believe that the price would go up in the near future. Right now, the realized price of this group is around $26,600, which is the level that Bitcoin bounced off from yesterday. As the line still seems to be holding as support, this segment of the STHs looks to have not lost their bullish conviction yet. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,300, down 1% in the last week.

42393510,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biyh3D,1684428314,U.S. Hearing Highlights Stablecoin Rift in Competing House Bills,"U.S. lawmakers aren’t yet able to reach across the chasm between Republicans and Democrats’ very different ideas for how to oversee stablecoins, despite notes of hope from both sides evident in a Thursday hearing of the House Financial Services Committee’s digital assets panel.  One of the fundamental divides is a stronger position for state regulators in a version of proposed legislation advocated by Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), the subcommittee’s chairman, and a lead role for the Federal Reserve in the Democratic proposal pushed by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the overall committee. But Hill opened the hearing with a call-back to a previous statement from Waters that the lawmakers were “starting from scratch” this year after getting close to a compromise version last year.  “We're not starting from scratch,” Hill said. “The similarities between the two proposals are strong, and that's why we're not that far apart.”  Waters countered that “several critical positions” are missing from the Republican language, and Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), the top Democrat on the crypto-focused subcommittee, said, “It appears that we have shifted further apart.”  Stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC are tied to the value of steady assets like the U.S. dollar and have been a vital component of crypto markets. Both House Republicans and Democrats agree on common aims that include addressing risks to consumers and maintaining the U.S. dollar’s role in global commerce, which could be aided by dollar-denominated stablecoins regulated in the U.S.  If there’s a bright side for a crypto industry desperate for U.S. rules, it’s that this and other committees are showing that the stablecoin topic – and crypto more broadly – is important enough to have already warranted several congressional hearings in recent weeks. Most members in both the House and Senate seem to be advocating action, and if they can agree on a stablecoin compromise, it would be a major first step toward U.S. oversight of the industry.  However, any legislation has to move through the Senate Banking Committee, and its chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), has shown no signs yet that he’s interested in moving a bill.  Meanwhile, Hill also jumped into a related issue this week: the question of whether the U.S. should issue a digital dollar and follow other jurisdictions already experimenting with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Hill and Rep. Jake Achincloss (D-Mass.), partnered on a bipartisan bill to ban the Fed from issuing the government token, citing constituent worries “that Uncle Sam is going to use a central bank digital currency to surveil where they’re spending their money and how much, and ultimately block them from using the banking and payments system.”  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently signed a bill banning any U.S. CBDC from being accepted as “money” in the Sunshine State, though legal experts have told CoinDesk it wouldn’t actually do anything.

Liquidity pools serve a similar function in crypto markets as market makers in traditional finance. Users pool their money to enable the buying and selling of assets. Forward contracts specify the purchase or sale of an asset at a later point in time, often tied to parameters like price.  Such contracts are often used in hedging strategies, but in the Solid World case they can bring certainty to carbon credit projects with long horizons. The liquidity pool will bring key funding to the mangrove projects ""while providing structured inventory to distributors seeking to sell high-quality carbon credits,"" the press release said.

12751177,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533809,1684425653,"Internet Computer (ICP) Dips, Will Bearish Momentum Persist?","The price of Internet Computer (ICP) experienced a downward movement dropping by 41.98% to a low of $5.05 on April 26, 2023. This was after a significant surge from April 10 to April 19, when it started the downtrend. This price decline affected the market sentiment of Investors and traders. Since the beginning of this month, ICP has exhibited range-bound behavior. ICP price has fluctuated between $6 – $5, resulting in a sideway price movement. The question is whether the bearish momentum will continue or if there’s a chance for a reversal soon. Bears To Hold Current Trend, Or Will The Bulls Rebuild Momentum? According to data, ICP experienced a slight price increase, reaching $5.34, representing a 2.7% increase within the last 24-hour trading period. This increase suggests that demand has surpassed supply in the market. This might attract more buyers and also increase the overall market confidence. Related Reading: PEPE Unlikely To Be As Big As DOGE & SHIB, Says Santiment The total market cap of ICP is also up today by 2.58%, representing a value of over $2 million. The growth in market cap was potentially driven by an increase in demand or positive market sentiment. The 24-hour trading volume surged by 21.81% overnight, rising to about $19 million. The Internet Computer Fear & Greed Index is 50 based on investor sentiment and market psychology. A value of 50 suggests that neither fear nor greed is dominant among traders and investors. Based on the recent increase in the overall ICP’s price movement, the bulls are gradually taking control of the market. If this momentum persists, ICP might rise significantly in the next few weeks. ICP Technical Outlook Using Indicators The asset is trading above its 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This indicates a long-term bullish trend and presents a potential buy opportunity for traders and investors. While ICP’s long-term prospects are bullish, there may be potential short-term uncertainties that need to be considered by traders. For instance, the Relative Strength Index is showing 47.46. This shows that there’s market indecision between buyers and sellers. Also, the pressure currently in the market is neutral. Also, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicates a potential bearish trend as the MACD is trading below its signal line. Related Reading: Historical Crossover Suggests Ethereum (ETH) Top Is In Moreover, ICP is below its 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a bearish indication based on the short-term price movement. The current price trend, as indicated by the ICP chart, suggests a possibility of further decline in the short term. But it remains uncertain if this trend will continue or if the bulls will regain dominance as more developments on the network could spike adoption and usage. Internet Computer now trades between its direct support and resistance levels of $4.923 and $6.860. The next significant support level is $3.302, while the resistance level is $8.251.

Network activity is mixed. Raw address growth is strong, up 12% year to date. However, weekly active addresses are showing weakness. The DeFi footprint is minimal and still entirely reliant on the top protocol. Concerns include centralization and lack of transparency pertaining to team-held EGLD. Late last year , the Elrond blockchain was rebranded to MultiversX (EGLD-USD). In my view, this is a fairly large departure from what Elrond originally set out to be as ""eGold"" a few years ago. I first covered EGLD back in September and shared some of the technological elements that made MultiversX different from some of the other layer 1 blockchains. In this article, I'll explore updated network metrics of the blockchain and assess some general concerns that potential investors should be aware of. Key Network Metrics When I assess broad network activity, some of the things I generally like to look at include total addresses, active users, transactions, and token holder data. EGLD Addresses (explorer.multiversex) From a raw address numbers perspective, MultiversX now touts 2.2 million total wallets. This is up 12% year to date and is stronger growth than more well-capitalized alternative layer 1 networks like Cardano (ADA-USD) or Algorand (ALGO-USD). However, daily actives are noticeably well off the peak and also down over the last year. Weekly Active Users (Token Terminal) In the chart above, I'm showing how MultiversX compares to something like Cosmos Hub (ATOM-USD). For the sake of scalability, we can see two chains with similar levels of weekly active users. For Cosmos, that trend is higher over the last year, while for MultiversX is the opposite. Transaction Breakout (explorer.multiversx) As for the transactions on the network, the trend appears to be a bit more stable and actually growing in the NFT category. Token transactions are generally sideways. Taking all of these numbers together would seem to indicate fewer daily users on the chain appear to be using the chain more often. DeFi and NFT Activity Two of the more popular utilities for a public blockchain are decentralized financial transactions and NFT sales. For MultiverseX, we can observe each of these activities and get two very different tales. For the NFT component, we see a generally positive trend in sales according to data from MultiversX NFT exchange XOXNO: MultiversX NFT Sales (xoxno.com) Raw NFT unit sales increased 51% from an average monthly figure of 23,685 in the three months before the rebrand to 35,870 average monthly NFT sales in the three months following the rebrand. Though it should be noted that May is off to a slow start and the current month is pacing a year-over-year decline. For DeFi, the broader trend is rough: MultiverseX TVL (DeFi Llama) TVL has collapsed when measured in dollars. This is mostly explainable as a symptom of EGLD's 93% price decline from its peak of $541 per coin in November 2021. But even adjusting for the coin price variance, when measuring TVL in EGLD we see a 45% year to date reduction in TVL measured in EGLD. As was the case when I covered EGLD last September, the network is still completely dominated by one protocol. And the stablecoin presence is very minimal, with just $19 million in stables on the network. This puts MultiversX as the 34th largest blockchain for stablecoins. The lack of stables coupled with the large 63.7% staking ratio will likely result in continued difficulty in growing a notable DeFi footprint organically. Risks From where I sit, MultiversX has a fairly clear centralization concern. It looks and behaves less like a decentralized public blockchain and more like a centralized enterprise. Governance is somewhat opaque in my view. And we can see that offline governance is by design according to the network economics paper : The MultiversX governance model will be outlined in a future paper, to be released at a later stage, after the official launch of the MultiversX Network. Prior to that point, MultiversX will use a robust off-chain governance approach to ensure maximal speed and efficiency By itself, this is not unique to MultiversX. There are several public blockchain networks that could be considered centrally controlled and governed. Some of which I'm quite bullish . For me, there are two key differentiators for something like Polygon (MATIC-USD), which also went through a rebrand, and MultiversX. First, Polygon's network usage is robust in several different areas, rather than specialized for one niche. Second, Polygon has hitched its wagon to a proven Layer 1 chain rather than going it alone as an entirely separate ecosystem. Top 5 EGLD Holders (egldscan) There is another valid concern that was pointed out in the comments of my last EGLD article a few weeks ago. The MultiversX Protocol Treasury wallet is empty . We can see large fund flows from the treasury address to other wallets over the last year or so. Two of which are listed as ""unknown"" in the screengrab above and are 2 of the 5 largest addresses by EGLD holdings. While those addresses appear to be controlled by the MultiversX team, the lack of transparent labeling coupled with the optics of an empty treasury is not ideal, and that's me being generous. Summary MultiversX has a compelling network construction and a growing base of wallet addresses. The NFT community appears to be picking up steam, and I think we can reasonably attribute a large portion of that to the rebrand from Elrond to MultiversX. That said, there are clear concerns with this network. There is a large amount of competition in the NFT space, and the overwhelming majority of NFT communities aren't going to make it. The centralization level is higher than what might be acceptable for crypto investors, and the ""multiverse"" brand shift feels like a second attempt at scaling a blockchain that has failed to find broad adoption. The empty treasury wallet is also something that should raise an eyebrow or two. The bottom line is crypto is a risky industry.

42393512,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biyh8L,1684424969,Galaxy Executed Its First OTC Options Trade as Demand for On-Chain Options Ramps Up,"Galaxy Digital’s first over-the-counter (OTC) option trade, executed earlier this week, marks a tangible step toward bringing the conventional financial system onto decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure.  FTX’s blowup and the collapse of several crypto lenders brought attention to the risks of centralized finance (CeFi) – AKA trusting one’s money with a company, rather than a protocol – providing a tailwind for DeFi. Galaxy said in a statement that recent market events have highlighted the vulnerabilities of traditional bilateral options trading.  “One thing that 2022 has told us is that DeFi performed exceedingly well while CeFi and some traditional methodologies for transacting had some challenges,” Jason Urban, Galaxy’s global head of trading, said in an interview this week with CoinDesk TV.  Ribbon Finance’s options trading platform, Aevo, executed the Galaxy trade with crypto investment company CoinFund.  These options are a form of derivative that trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on an exchange. They tend to be a private transaction between the buyer and the seller. Derivatives are becoming a more important part of the crypto market, with its share of overall volume hitting an all-time high last month compared with spot trading.  The ability to trade bilateral options tied to cryptocurrencies with Galaxy removes credit risk, which is normally associated with traditional OTC options trades, Galaxy said in a statement. This is because users send their collateral to a smart contract rather than to a counterparty, making the user less exposed to the counterparty and what they might be doing with one’s collateral.  This is a big step forward in bootstrapping the liquidity needed to help DeFi derivatives continue to grow, according to Christopher Newhouse, an independent crypto derivatives trader. He added that Aevo OTC is a unique offering as it focuses on some of the popular altcoin options which are not traded on screens and are all OTC.  “As a more liquid options and derivatives market for altcoins continue to grow, we may start to see lower volatility in these tokens as well – which may drive further institutional interest in things outside of just BTC/ETH,” said Newhouse.  He noted that the market is still a long way off from traditional finance firms getting comfortable getting their crypto exposure through altcoins rather than the larger cap tokens like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/18/galaxy-executed-its-first-otc-options-trade-as-demand-for-on-chain-options-ramps-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/113d58c52252687aeefe422ee7f400387865a80d-6048x3402.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It has ordered new low-energy miners to make the most of its new low-cost electricity supply. Bitfarms now has mining sites in both hemispheres, giving it a sustainable competitive advantage. The Q1 2023 earnings call gave much information about the progress Bitfarms Ltd. ( BITF ) has made and was an opportunity for management to add detail to their plans for the coming years. Bitfarms is laser-focused on the next Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving that will take place in 2024; at that point, the reward given to miners when they place a block will halve from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins. The halving takes place approximately every four years. It has done so since the beginning of Bitcoin time and will continue as long as the Bitcoin blockchain is in operation. A maximum of 21 million Bitcoins are available, and new Bitcoins enter circulation through mining activity; the halving makes the 21 million figure a mathematical asymptote that will never be reached. Bitfarms Halving Plans Bitfarms is preparing for the halving by lowering its cost structure and reducing its debt. It hopes this will be enough to survive the halving event. The halving will likely severely disrupt the industry (unless the price of Bitcoin doubles). Miners will see significantly reduced income; many are already in a precarious financial situation with high debt and high operating costs. An industry shakeout is likely. Over the last 12 months, Bitfarms has reduced its General and Administration charges by 25% and significantly reduced its debt pile from $140 million to $19 million, reducing debt service costs from $6 million to $2 million per quarter. Bitfarms said in the call that the reduction in G and A would be sustainable. The only negative is that they continue to tap the ATM for around $5 million monthly. The balance sheet looks much better, with cash now higher than debt. Balance sheet over time (Author Database) Bitfarms Operations Bitfarms Miners Bitfarms' purchasing aim is to reduce the amount of energy needed by its equipment, as energy is its only significant cost. The recent call reported a current energy use of 39 joules per terahash, expected to fall to 30 joules per terahash when the miners it has on order are energized. That is a significant drop of 23% and will show up in reduced costs later in the year. Bitfarms continues to source its miners from MicroBT and Bitmain, the two pre-eminent market-leading manufacturers. Bitcoin miners have what should be a simple task. They buy mining computers, power them with electricity, and then collect Bitcoins. In practical terms, it is challenging to do this profitably; they must purchase the best miners, power them with the cheapest electricity and site them in Bitcoin-friendly jurisdictions. Bitfarms is buying the best miners and have an outstanding strategy for choosing the position of their mines. Bitfarms Mines Most Bitcoin mines are near renewable energy installations and act as grid-balancing machines. They sign power purchase agreements with the energy generating company that allow them to buy cheap energy when the grid does not need it and throttle back production when it does. The grid's demand for energy is driven by the seasons; when winter comes, homes need power, and electricity prices rise, so miners throttle back production or cease operations entirely. In a hot climate, a heatwave can drive increased demand for air conditioning and electricity, so the miners have to throttle back once again. Most renewable energy is also weather dependent; solar energy needs the sun to shine, and wind farms need wind. Bitfarms runs on 91% renewable energy using the following sites Bitfarms Sites (Q1 earnings call) The chart shows the growth in mining planned at each site, as reported at the earnings call. Bitfarms intends to more than double its capacity in the coming years. It probably has to do this to stay still, as the network difficulty (amount of power needed to complete a block) grows consistently. Bitfarms is the only miner I follow that has seriously attempted to solve the issue of seasonality and electricity price by placing its farms in North and South America or, more importantly, the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This strategy circumvents many of the problems other miners incur; when it is winter in one hemisphere, it is summer in the other, and at most, Bitfarms have to throttle back only half of their operation. A major storm in Texas might take out some miners' entire operations but will not affect the Southern Hemisphere mines of Bitfarms. It is an ingenious solution, they have had to work very hard to gain regulatory acceptance in Argentina, and they talked at length about acquiring miners and electricity there. However, the Argentina site is operating with a low base electricity cost; you can see from the table that Bitfarms intends the Argentinian site to be its biggest one and account for almost 50% of production in the longer term. Bitfarms have done a great job procuring electricity; they reported a figure of 5 cents per kWh for Q4 2022 and have signed new PPA contracts that will take it down to 0.3 cents later this year. That is one of the lowest in the industry, beaten only by the 2.7 cents reported by Cipher Mining Inc. ( CIFR ) and the 2.9 cents reported by Riot Platforms ( RIOT ). The Argentinian site will be moving down from 4.3 cents to below 3 cents, and as a percentage of production, it is moving from 5% to 10% this year and 50% in the longer term. The Canadian sites are the only black spot here, as costs have risen 6%. However, the new Baie site will reduce that average when and if the deal is finalized, we should hear about this next quarter. The Fair Value of BITF Stock Simplywall.st work out discounted cash flow calculations for all companies with sufficient analyst forecasts. The DCF works out the value of a company using only the cash it generates. In the case of Bitfarms, the DCF suggests that the company is overvalued by 1,162%. DCF fair value (simplywall.st) The DCF methodology does not work well for Bitcoin Miners because they are not trying to generate free cash; they are trying to use all of their free cash to generate Bitcoins and hold on to them, believing they will appreciate. The fair value of a miner must be generated from the bitcoins they produce and keep rather than the USD they generate. Bitfarms mine Bitcoins, sell some to fund operations, then add 30 to their treasury (Q1 earnings call). Although they have not always done this, we can use it to estimate how many Bitcoins they can accumulate up to 2030. Some key assumptions are needed The first is the halving, and we know the reward to miners per block will halve approximately every four years. Effect of the Halving (Author) Assuming that Bitfarms can keep the same market share, which will mean increasing their Hashrate on a more or less never-ending pathway, by 2030, they should have generated 1260 Bitcoins and stored them in the treasury but will have generated zero cash as they only spend the Bitcoins they need to fund the business. Next, we have to work out the price of a Bitcoin in 2030, an impossible task; I will use probability and the expectation theory to give us a reasonable guestimate. Expected Value of Bitcoin (Author) I have used Ark's big ideas 2023 to get my Bitcoin prices and to assign each one a probability. Ark has $1,000,000 as the bull case and $600,000 as the Base case. I have put all the percentages in the table; I think I have been more bearish than Ark even though I ended up with the expected Bitcoin price of $254,000 in 2030, an increase of 807% by the end of the decade. Using $254K as the value of the Bitcoins generated and adding it to the current market cap of Bitfarms, we get $581 million, an increase of 100%. I consider this to be a very conservative estimate for Bitfarms. They are reducing their costs for the halving and have spread their operation over the two hemispheres. Likely, some companies will not survive the halving, and operations in the Northern Hemisphere (especially Texas) may be curtailed more often if the extreme weather of recent years continues. If this happens, the network difficulty rate could drop significantly, increasing the number of Bitcoin Bitfarms mines. They could continue to HODL 30 Bitcoin per month, giving them 2,520 new coins by 2030 and a fair value $910 million, so a bull case target of 200% and a base case of 100%. Derivatives are always risky Bitfarms has begun hedging They appointed a VP of risk management at the beginning of the year and are attempting to use derivatives to remove the volatility of Bitcoin without losing the potential upside. I always listen to the earnings calls, and at this point, you could hear the lack of confidence the CEO had as he said: And the goal here, quite frankly, is the means of insulating and protecting our downside here. And right now, we're doing that primarily either by writing or by buying options in place here, though we're looking for some other more sophisticated instruments as we get more advanced here. And also to a degree on the upside, we do offset some of that premium cost by actually writing some dramatically out-of-the-money calls here. As a former derivatives trader (with the Bank of America in London), I can speak with some authority on this issue. Playing with derivatives is a risky business. Many companies have been brought down by not fully understanding the potential risk; the entire credit crunch was brought about by the banking industry not fully understanding the risk of the derivatives it was buying on mortgage-backed securities. If the banks can get it wrong, Bitfarms definitely can. Bitfarms want to minimize the downside and still capture the upside. In my opinion, you cannot financially engineer risk out of Bitcoin, and I think they will end up spending money on these derivative positions and on the staff to run the operation while probably reducing their income and leaving themselves open to a black swan event. I hope they don't get too deep into this; they are a Bitcoin miner, risk and volatility are fundamentally part of their chosen industry. Conclusion I am impressed by the steps Bitfarms has taken to prepare for next year's halving. They have reduced debt and costs, purchased new low-energy miners, and acquired low-cost electricity to power them. The new lower cost of electricity that will become effective this year puts them in line with the leaders in this industry. They have developed a significant and sustainable competitive advantage by placing their sites in both hemispheres, they are the only miner I follow to have made a success of this, and I think it will serve them well for many years. Their purchasing policy, buying the best miners to reduce energy use per terahash, is excellent. I don't like the derivative policy; it just adds another layer of risk to an already risky venture. Of the four smaller miners I have reviewed, Bitfarms would appear to be the best bet and have a realistic chance of doubling in value, so they get a buy rating.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4605760-bitfarms-strategic-genius-preparing-for-the-halving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12750744.jpeg

42393509,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biygsx,1684424168,Hector Network Fight Centers on Efficacy of DAO Governance,"Crypto’s “be your own bank” mantra has given rise to a new kind of company where investors are said to run the show. But can these so-called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) beat out the centralized, professionalized, corporate status quo?  That’s the question faced by Hector Network’s community as the decentralized finance (DeFi) project met on Discord early Thursday to discuss its possibly more centralized future. On hand was project leadership, a lawyer and tens of HEC token holders – many of whom were skeptical of a plan they feared would dilute their influence over how Hector runs. CoinDesk attended the call.  For more than an hour, members peppered the lawyer, who identified himself as Dali from the tech law firm Sparring, with questions about HIP 40, a proposal to wrap Hector Network within an offshore corporate structure that includes directors, supervisors and a management board. In other words: an organization with many of the centralized facets DAOs are supposed to replace.  After a year of what Dali called sloppy vision execution that has burned much of a treasury once worth $100 million, the only thing the Fantom-based fork of Olympus DAO can agree on is that something needs to change. But HIP 40 seems unlikely to provide that change in its current form: It is barreling to defeat by Saturday.  Hector Network’s governance dilemma is hardly unique. Across crypto, DAOs that once fashioned themselves as paragons of decentralization are running up against the hard reality that it’s difficult to succeed in business without really trying to be a real business. Throw in uncertain legal prospects, ominous tax implications and increasingly aggressive regulators, and their prospects grow still worse.  “Honestly, DAOs cannot be naïve to think, ‘Hey, we will be just a group of people who are buying tokens and then try to run an organization with tens of millions in a treasury without any expertise.’ That cannot work,” Dali said on the call.  What does work, he proposed, is a professional organization run and managed by people with expertise in specific areas who can dedicate their work weeks to an entity they work for. Dali said he drafted HIP 40 so that the “steering committee” at the heart of Hector Network functions as a day-to-day “workhorse” that delivers for the DAO. It would be staffed almost entirely by people currently employed by the official Hector Network team.  Some HEC holders bristled at that construction and questioned Dali if it is a conflict of interest to imbue the current leaders of Hector Network with formalized powers over its day-to-day operations. In response, Dali offered various reasons why DAOs such as Hector don’t really work unless they’re being run by those who invest their 100% of their time (not just their money). He said “checks and balances” such as community approval votes offset the risks of diluting investors’ direct power over the DAO.  “Even the steering committee is not some sort of overpowering body deciding everything – that is not the case at all. The steering committee always needs the backing of the community to work properly,” Dali said.  Idealism aside, there are very real and tangible reasons why Hector – and likely all DAOs – need some sort of legal wrapper, Dali said. Anything that involves the wider world – forming third-party partnerships, hiring contractors, nimbly navigating lawsuits – are all more feasible through formal organizational structure than through a DAO.  “We won’t be able to penetrate the markets that Hector Network would like to” if HIP 40 does not pass, Dali said, adding “the DAO would work somehow. But why not take advantage of having a proper structure and to be a reliable partner to non-Web3-native companies?”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/18/hector-network-fight-provides-clues-dao-governance-isnt-so-effective,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d48cf46242777a35f7256e1c472fe357ae7abe76-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto advisory firm Architect Partners expects further mergers and acquisitions in the custody industry due to several market factors, according to a new research note.  Architect Partners first analyzed the Ripple-Metaco deal, writing that Ripple “seeks to transform the $156 trillion cross-border payment market, has initiatives focused on the emerging opportunity for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and has aspirations to allow the issuance and settlement of any type of tokenized asset as that market develops.” The addition of Metaco custody technology and related services helps Ripple protect customer assets, control how the technology evolves and provides an “attractive new revenue stream.”  Further strategic deals will likely occur in the custody market due to a combination of regulatory and bear market factors, said the advisory firm. U.S. regulators have signaled that only registered Qualified Custodians (QCs) are allowed to custody digital and crypto assets, and there are few QCs currently in existence. Regulators have also suggested that the act of being an asset custodian has to remain operationally separated from execution activities, which is a setup more common in how traditional finance handles equities than in crypto companies.  Anticipate Traditional Finance Custodians Entering Crypto  Traditional finance custodians such as Northern Trust and BNY Mellon have been wary of entering the crypto market due to the regulatory and market risks, but Architect Partners expects that to change in the future, which would represent “both a threat and an opportunity for those building specialized digital and crypto asset custody businesses.” The crypto winter has also put pressure on custodians and has slowed or stalled growth of assets under custody, leading to flat or declining revenues and recruiting financial staying power and conviction that an upturn is coming,” according to Architect Partners.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/18/expect-ripple-deal-to-set-off-crypto-custodian-ma-says-advisory-firm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1db0659c8e759ff632ca397202e95f7ed52ac7c4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393500,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biygOB,1684423042,Where the SEC’s Proposed Custody Rule Comes Up Short for Crypto,"In February, the SEC proposed dramatic changes to a bedrock law governing the custody of assets. The original rule, Custody Rule 206(4)-2, was adopted by the SEC in 1962 which mainly focused on physical custody of client assets – stock and bond certificates – saying they were to be kept in a bank, segregated from advisor assets, and held in a “reasonably safe” place.  In 2003, the SEC amended the rule to keep up with technological advances in capital markets infrastructure, which have made virtually every aspect of the advisory industry more efficient. The modernized rule, which better defined custody and essentially removed any assumption of paper assets, has been serving advisors and clients well, allowing trusted, qualified custodians to provide custody and many other services to the industry.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Digital assets, most notably cryptocurrency, came just a few years later. The seeds of the digital asset industry were planted with the bitcoin whitepaper nearly 15 years ago as a novel way to send value natively across the internet without the need for a trusted third party. Five years after that, the Ethereum whitepaper was published. In the years since, an entirely new asset class has emerged, and advisors are now being asked to guide investors engaged with it.  Getting crypto in the asset mix  The proposed rule (you can read the whole 432-page document here) would expand the definition of assets in the advisor/client relationship to specifically include digital and crypto assets (from page 28 of the proposed rule): “…the proposed rule’s definition of assets would include investments such as all crypto assets, even in instances where such assets are neither funds nor securities.”  Most advisors are already applying their fiduciary obligation to the entire relationship with their clients, so at first glance this doesn’t seem like a big step. However, the new rule also narrows the scope of what an advisor could use as a “qualified custodian” of digital assets. This passage is from page 33-34:  “We believe it is important to extend the protections of the rule by explicitly including “discretionary authority” within the definition of custody. However, because we continue to believe more limited risk of loss exists when a qualified custodian participates in transactions, we are also proposing a limited exception to the surprise examination requirement of the rule. The exception would generally apply to client assets that are maintained with a qualified custodian when the sole basis for the application of the rule is an adviser’s (sic) discretionary authority that is limited to instructing the client’s qualified custodian to transact in assets that settle only on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis.”  Most advisors providing discretionary trading use the current exception to the surprise examination, but it wouldn’t be clear based on how crypto asset trades settle – either on an exchange order book, to even on-chain settlement, that the SEC will allow this exception to apply. This will cast more doubt on an already skeptical advisor population.  Where the rule comes up short  Some advisors assist clients manage their digital or crypto assets on-chain, including the increasing supply of real-world-assets, through various forms of wallet architecture. But this group doesn’t get any relief or clarity from the proposal either, despite a goal that “allows the rule to remain ‘evergreen’ as the types of assets held by custodians evolve” (page 78).  The proposed new rule will make it far more difficult for advisors to meet this rapidly growing demand for responsible advice and management of digital/crypto assets. This asset class trades 24/7/365, has unique characteristics, and doesn’t fit nicely with current regulatory or even product wrappers designed in the 1990s (e.g. ETFs).  However, many of the current products available through a traditional custodian such as the various trusts and few ETFs that provide a type of exposure to digital assets for clients won’t be impacted greatly by this proposal.  One effect the new rule could have: Since it doesn’t greatly impact advisors that use an assets under advisement (AUA) model – as opposed to an assets under management (AUM) with discretion model – it might push the industry more towards the former, particularly those advisors offering services and advice for digital assets. That shifts the burden of custody, and it’s an open question how many clients have the tolerance for such a future.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Matthew Kolesky,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/18/where-the-secs-proposed-custody-rule-comes-up-short-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a33dce2eb4ec2ca3f0e0cb7d396ac683783d466-3000x1687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One of the notable reactions came from the Ripple Labs CTO, David Schwartz, who disclosed that his lack of trust in the YouTuber goes far back in the past. BitBoy Accused Of Dumping BEN Token Armstrong allegedly sold off his BEN tokens, a newly launched crypto asset he controls. As reactions on social media platforms intensified, Schwartz revealed his dislike for BitBoy. Related Reading: PEPE Unlikely To Be As Big As DOGE & SHIB, Says Santiment The CTO responded to a tweet on May 18 implying that Armstrong operated as a scammer by selling off the tokens even when he promised never to do so. Schwartz boldly stated that, “I was hating on him before it was cool.” This indicated that Schwartz’s negative view of Armstrong dates back to the past, even before the recent incident. A Web3-based corporate attorney and the Founder and Principle lawyer of Givner Law firm, Ariel Givner, also shared a Twitter post about an interview with BitBoy on May 14. During the interview, Armstrong reportedly mentioned that he had no intention of selling BEN tokens. Givner disclosed how BitBoy expressed his trust and commitment to the BEN project. She also recalled that BitBoy revealed plans to maintain his holdings regarding his close ties with the project. Additionally, the YouTuber had earlier stated that he had not locked his BEN tokens intentionally. To him, it’s a means of pissing off his haters that believe he is dishonest, a scammer, and a grifter. But according to Givner, the YouTuber contradicted his words and sold all the BEN tokens in his holding. She alleged that Armstrong disposed of all his BEN tokens for approximately 45 ETH through multiple transactions. While providing proof of the transactions, Givner retorted that it’s “A tale as old as time.” I interviewed @Bitboy_Crypto the other day about $BEN. For over an hour, he stated this project meant something to him, that he was going to “lift crypto up” and had no plans to sell. Today he sold his $BEN tokens for roughly 45 $ETH. A tale as old as time. — Ariel Givner, Esq. (@GivnerAriel) May 17, 2023 BitBoy Denies Dumping The Tokens Armstrong has denied allegations of dumping the BEN project. The crypto influencer explained that he moved the tokens to generate funds for financing a deal that involves the BEN Foundation. Related Reading: Historical Crossover Suggests Ethereum (ETH) Top Is In The YouTuber said that the original backer of the deal was delayed, so he sold off his tokens to step in and support it. Meanwhile, BitBoy didn’t reveal the transaction, and his claims didn’t go down well with most proponents. However, the on-chain data provider, Etherscan, highlighted transactions from the wallet address connected to Armstrong. According to the data, the YouTuber swapped about 1 trillion BEN tokens for almost 45 ETH in three separate transactions.

42393506,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biygih,1684422000,"NFT Trading Volume on Track to Drop Below $1B, But Does That Metric Matter?","The non-fungible token (NFT) market is evolving, and measuring its success depends on which metrics you're looking at.  According to a new report released by DappRadar on Thursday, NFT trading volume for the month of May has reached $333 million so far, putting it on track to fall below $1 billion for the first time this year. In contrast, there have been 2.3 million sales executed so far this month and a notable increase in the number of weekly active wallets interacting with NFTs.  Sara Gherghelas, a blockchain analyst at DappRadar, told CoinDesk that the number of NFT sales appears to be on track to reach or surpass last month's numbers, as opposed to trading volume, which is significantly lagging behind last month's count. In her view, this could signal that there are more NFT traders in the market making smaller dollar-figure trades.  The number of unique active wallets linked to NFT activities grew by 27% in May, the report added, attributing the growth to the Miladys NFT collection – which received a notable pump from Elon Musk – as well as profits made from the hyped PEPE token that funneled back into the NFT market. This contributed to an uptick in on-chain activity, which sent Ethereum gas fees skyrocketing.  Overall, Ethereum (ETH) continues to lead the NFT market in trading volume, though other blockchains like Solana and Polygon have a higher number of NFT sales, with 26.9% of NFT sales taking place on Polygon and 13% on Solana, according to DappRadar.  ""When it comes to the number of NFT sales, Ethereum's [market] dominance slips to just 5.7%, indicating that the blockchain is primarily being utilized for conducting large volume sales, positioning it as the platform of choice for the 'NFT aristocracy,' the report says.  And finally, Blur and OpenSea remain at odds for NFT marketplace dominance, though both are excelling in different areas, DappRadar says. Blur wins by a significant margin in terms of trading volume, with around $181 million in trades this month, largely catalyzed by the release of its Season 2 rewards campaign and the launch of its lending protocol Blend. However, OpenSea continues to have a larger number of active NFT traders than Blur, suggesting that it continues to dominate with a mainstream audience.  Does trading volume even matter?  So what does this all mean?  Gherghelas told CoinDesk that trading volume remains an important metric for measuring success in the NFT market, though the number has the potential to be manipulated by wash trading, especially among collectors looking to earn rewards on platforms like Blur.  ""We saw the market manipulation that was happening on Blur,"" she said. ""People are using the platform to farm [Blur tokens] and participate in airdrops.""  She added that Blur is not as concerned about the number of active traders on its platform, since it caters to a smaller number of professional traders with large pockets and expansive portfolios.  ""Right now, if you go on Blur, you're using Blur to buy expensive NFTs and this is its target,"" she explained. ""[Pro platforms] need the big money flowing in and don't care about getting more users.""  Other data backs up Gherghelas' observations. Nansen tweeted in March that much of Blur's trading volume at the time came from just its top 100 NFT traders.  Still, she said trading volume remains an important metric, so long as you consider the context.  ""I think the trading volume, at some points, is a very important metric to see exactly how much money is moving through the NFT market,"" she said. ""During the bull market, huge trading volume meant that a lot of people were coming into the space and that people were enthusiastic. You could have made a lot of money.""  ""Right now, if the trading volume is down but the sales count is up, this means that we have the same amount of traders, but their behavior has changed.""  She added that it's important to consider what type of NFT you're looking at when considering trading volume. She cites the sale of parcels of land across metaverse platforms as different from sales of art-based NFT collections.  ""When we look at the trading volume for the metaverse, I think that's a whole different topic,"" she explained. ""The trading volume matters there because trading volume equals the utility of the land, which equals the profit that you can make. It's the whole ecosystem. It's a new economy there.""",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | BLUR,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/18/nft-trading-volume-on-track-to-drop-below-1b-but-does-that-metric-matter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/263d2d876eeb8de9cf5b269ed18eb04574afb4e1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A “whale” is a term used to describe individuals or entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. The identity of this prominent investor has been revealed as an early participant in Ethereum’s groundbreaking initial coin offering (ICO), which played a pivotal role in the platform’s inception. Related Reading: Conflux Network Partners With China Telecom For Blockchain, SIM Project – Details Ethereum Whale Resurfaces With 4,032 ETH Stake The Ethereum whale, who played a significant role in Ethereum’s early days, recently made headlines by staking an impressive 4,032 ETH, valued at approximately $7.4 million, according to Lookonchain, a reputable blockchain analytics platform.

Participating in the ICO, this investor was granted an astounding 60,000 ETH, a testament to its early belief and support for the Ethereum network. The ICO, held in July and August of 2014, involved a public crowdsale where individuals could purchase ETH by exchanging Bitcoin for the cryptocurrency, playing a crucial role in Ethereum’s growth and development.

Its 24-hour trading volume is down over 3% at press time, indirectly contributing to today’s price slump. TON traded at the $2 price level since January 1, 2023, slowly accumulating its gains. However, the bears forced a price decline to the $1.9 price level on May 9, 2023, where the asset trades today. TON’s Movement Suggests A Bearish Trend Ahead TON is in a downtrend, forming a red candle. It has dropped below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), confirming the bearish trend. Also, TON’s Moving average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line and shows a negative value, which is also bearish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 42.65, dropping out of the neutral zone as it approaches the oversold region 30. The indicator is also moving downwards, reflecting the pressure from the bears. Related Reading: PEPE Unlikely To Be As Big As DOGE & SHIB, Says Santiment TON’s price will likely decline till it rests on its nearest support level and the bulls rally again. Moreover, TON’s 200-day SMA shows a long-term bullish sentiment. TON is just above the $1.8422 support as the bears mount pressure. A decline below this level will cause a price drop to $1.7525, its next support level. The bearish pressure at the $1.9918 resistance led to the current price drop for the asset. TON will likely continue its downtrend in the short term. Recent Development Trends On Toncoin Network Likely To Influence Its Price The Ton Foundation announced the latest network developments in a blog post for community members. These developments could lead to a positive price action soon. Ton Wallet For KaiOS: Ton Wallet is currently available for KaiOS users. KaiOS is the world’s third largest operating system (OS), functional in over 160 million devices. This wallet enables users with low-specification phones to work on KaiOS, mostly Asian, African, and South American users. Ton.Ski Ecosystem: This consists of various applications combined on the network. Agorata helps users create TON DNS subdomains and build and host simple TON sites. Also, Nonstorage allows users to upload files to TON storage through a web interface, making contracts with storage providers. Monitoring Platform: This enables users to create projects, view messages, and add contracts in the TON community. Related Reading: Historical Crossover Suggests Ethereum (ETH) Top Is In EVAA Protocol: This is the first decentralized lending protocol on the network giving users access to borrow native or wrapped assets directly. Ton.app: It is an open-source marketplace for Ton apps already existing in the ecosystem. Also, users can submit proposals for projects to feature on this app. These innovations could help TON’s price action if more users adopt the tokens based on utility and value. However, there are no guarantees of a price increase since cryptocurrencies are volatile.

The raise was led by investment firm 1kx and included contributions from Maven11, Lattice Fund, CMT Digital, Daedalus Angels, according to an emailed announcement on Thursday.  Lagrange's work could entice more users to decentralized finance (DeFi) by allowing developers to build decentralized apps (dApps) that can operate across different blockchain simultaneously while alleviating the security threat that this may otherwise bring.  Sharing information across different chains requires an intermediary protocol, which can be prone to hacks and vulnerabilities.  ""These intermediaries also tend to be limited in the information they can pass on,"" Lagrange's founder Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh said. ""Modern DeFi applications require more sophisticated relationships between data on different blockchains, and we’re excited to see how our technology can unlock new multi-chain DeFi primitives.”  Lagrange has also hired Yale University's co-director of Applied Cryptography Charalampos Papamanthou as its chief scientist.

Kennedy and the author Michael Lewis.  Organizers of the conference, Bitcoin 2023, call it the “world’s largest Bitcoin gathering,” starting Thursday and ending with an exclusive afterparty on Saturday night. A general admission ticket costs $999 and an “Industry Pass” with exclusive access to the “Official Networking App” goes for $2,299.  More than 35,000 people attended last year, according to the conference website. Speakers included tennis legend Serena Williams, controversial psychologist Jordan Peterson and MicroStrategy (MSTR) co-founder Michael Saylor.  This year, the website says approximately 15,000 devotees of the dominant cryptocurrency – fewer than half as many as last year, likely a symptom of crypto winter – will descend on the Miami Beach Convention Center to listen to the U.S. presidential candidates Kennedy and Vivek Ramaswamy, along with Lewis and U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry, the North Carolina Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee.  Crypto conferences occupy an outsize role in the digital-asset industry, since many employees work remotely; the gatherings typically provide a crucial source of networking and in-real-life personal interaction. But the plunge in prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past year has prompted many firms to slash travel and marketing budgets, so attendance at crypto conferences has declined.  CoinDesk's own Consensus 2023 event last month also suffered a drop-off in attendance, to about 15,000 from 20,000 in 2022.  This week's Bitcoin conference in Miami, organized by BTC Inc. and BTC Media, LLC (owner of Bitcoin Magazine), will feature over 180 talks, with session names including “Boom to Bust: Wall Street & the FTX Aftermath,” “The Great Ordinal Debate” and “Bitcoin-Powered Nuclear Energy.”  “Bitcoin winter is heating up in Miami,” reads one banner on the conference website.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) has risen to about $28,000 from around $15,000 in November, but it’s still well off the all-time high around $69,000 reached in late 2021.  The market malaise has triggered a slew of corporate bankruptcies and failures in the crypto industry along with widespread layoffs, leading analysts and executives to describe the current phase of the business cycle as “crypto winter.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/18/miami-bitcoin-conference-flags-attendance-down-by-half-as-crypto-winter-drags-on,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25ad798076ac7f54e09ab9a0e964c1a1bee191f1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393519,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69biyhSr,1684417591,Litecoin Leaves Bitcoin and Ether Behind With Rally to One-Month High,"Bitcoin offshoot Litecoin (LTC) is having a moment amid a broader market lull, rallying 15% over the past seven days to a one-month high of $95 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk data. It's pulled back a bit to $92 as of press time.  The price rally puts LTC at number two on the list of the best-performing digital assets with at least $1 billion market capitalization. At the top of the list is the liquid staking solution Lido's governance token LDO, up 36%.  The dollar value locked in the number of open futures contracts tied to litecoin – sometimes referred to as ""silver to bitcoin's gold"" – has risen to $478 million, the highest since early December, according to data source Coinglass. A rise in open interest suggests an influx of new money into the market, although it is unclear if the leverage is skewed bullish or bearish.  Litecoin's bitcoin-denominated value, represented by the LTC/BTC trading pair listed on Binance, has increased by 15% in seven days, alongside a similar move in the litecoin-ether pair, data from charting platform TradingView show.  According to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, LTC benefitted from the recent congestion on the Bitcoin network that stemmed from the boom in Bitcoin Request for Comment or BRC-20 tokens, which are built with Ordinals and stored on the Bitcoin base blockchain. At one point, Bitcoin's blockchain showed nearly 400,000 unconfirmed transactions, a number greater than anything seen during the bull market frenzy of 2021.  A fork of BRC-20 appeared on Litecoin, called LTC-20, making Litecoin's network busier than ever. On May 10, the number of confirmed transactions and active addresses reached a record high of 580,000 and 830,000, respectively, per Messari.  ""Litecoin prices have rallied by +17% during the last week as Bitcoin transaction costs became temporarily expensive and traders sought cheaper alternatives,"" Thielen said in a note to clients on Thursday.  Pullback ahead?  Litecoin's price may decline in the coming weeks as the network congestion on Bitcoin is easing. Further, past data shows sellers tend to be dominant in 50 days heading into mining reward halving, a programmed code that reduces the pace of supply expansion every four years.  Litecoin's third reward halving is due in less than 80 days, per Matrixport.  ""Contrary to market participants’ assumptions, Litecoin prices declined leading into the previous two halvings with the ideal selling point 50 days ahead of the halving, which has seen LTC token prices drop by -38%,"" Thielen said.

In a tragic incident reported by Bloomberg, a Korean woman was kidnapped and subsequently killed in what appears to be a dispute arising from losses related to crypto. The gravity of the crime, which reportedly took place late March, has placed the spotlight on the efforts of lawmakers to expedite the country’s inaugural standalone crypto bill, which may soon undergo a parliamentary vote, potentially as early as this month. The incident has underscored the need for comprehensive regulatory measures to address the risks and challenges associated with the burgeoning crypto industry. Related Reading: Conflux Network Partners With China Telecom For Blockchain, SIM Project – Details On Focus: Virtual Asset User Protection Bill This event has prompted lawmakers to accelerate the passage of the nation’s inaugural standalone crypto bill, known as the Virtual Asset User Protection Bill, which consolidates 19 different crypto-related measures into a single comprehensive legislation. A draft version of the bill, obtained by Bloomberg, reveals that it aims to establish precise legal definitions for virtual assets and introduce penalties for offenses such as insider trading and market manipulation. Furthermore, the proposed legislation seeks to grant the Financial Services Commission in South Korea the authority to supervise cryptocurrency companies and oversee the custody of digital assets. Different Regulatory Paths For Crypto, Securities Tokens Under the new rules, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will be subject to the proposed regulations, while tokens categorized as securities by the government will continue to be governed by existing capital-markets laws. By establishing clear guidelines for digital assets, South Korea aims to fortify the resilience of the crypto industry and protect investors from potential risks. The bill’s provision for mandatory insurance coverage aims to provide a safety net for digital asset firms, shielding them from financial losses in the event of cyberattacks or breaches. Additionally, the stricter rules on reserve funds and account keeping seek to ensure greater transparency and accountability within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

According to Hogan, there would be an FND trial only if Ripple loses its case to the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) under the Section 5 violation. Hogan’s Opinion On The Fair Notice Defence Trial Hogan has supportively followed up on the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. In recent discussions, he noted that Judge Analisa Torres’ remark about the Hinman speech drafts suggests she has yet to rule on the FND issue. Related Reading: Conflux Network Partners With China Telecom For Blockchain, SIM Project – Details During the latest hearing on the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit on Tuesday, May 16, Judge Torres stated her decision on both parties’ request to seal summary judgment motion-related documents. However, for the XRP community, the most remarkable part of the judge’s order was the court’s denial of the SEC’s request to seal the 2018 Hinman speech drafts. While delivering her decision, Judge Torres said: “Whether the court relies on the Hinman documents in ruling on the summary judgment motions, they are judicial documents subject to the presumption of public access.” While commenting on the judge’s decision, Hogan noted that the first remarks suggest that she only denied the SEC’s motion to seal the Hinman documents or has not addressed the fair notice defense issue. The Controversial Fair Notice Defence Issue Part of Ripple’s defense in the ongoing lawsuit is that the SEC failed to issue a fair notice before suing it for securities law violation. In a previous hearing on April 11, the SEC filed a document supporting its motion for summary judgment against Ripple, citing its recent victory against Commonwealth Equity Services. Notably, the court deemed that a long-running precedent provides sufficient fair notice in the Commonwealth Equity vs. SEC case. Bringing it to the Ripple case, the SEC argued that the longstanding court precedent, which gave rise to the Howey test, gives Ripple a fair notice of what security is. Related Reading: Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Break Free From Limbo? Market Awaits Bullish Catalyst The regulator further stated that its litigation with Commonwealth is an additional authority for Rejecting Ripple’s Fair notice defense. Prominent XRP Influencer Worries Over Possible Negative Ruling for Ripple The latest remark by Judge Torres troubled the XRP community, including prominent XRP influencer Blockchain Backer, as to whether the court has ruled on the fair notice defense. Therefore, in a May 17 tweet, Blockchain Backer called Jeremy Hogan’s attention to the portion of Judge Torress’ remark that appears to weaken Ripple’s stance on the case. Related Reading: Conflux Network Partners With China Telecom For Blockchain, SIM Project – Details He attached a part of the ruling where the judge denied Ripple’s motion to seal its revenue with XRP sales, compensation paid to crypto exchanges to list XRP, etc. Following the influencer’s conversation with other XRP fans, he concluded the ruling suggests an unfavorable outcome for Ripple. But while responding to Backer’s inquiry, Attorney Hogan said he does not think the order will affect the summary judgment.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin is up on Thursday after gaining ground late Wednesday alongside a rally in U.S. equity markets on optimism that a debt-ceiling deal will be reached in the upcoming days. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value began its rise Wednesday after touching a weekly low of $26,500. At press time, BTC was trading at around $27,400, up 3% on the day. Following a meeting at the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden and Congressmen from both sides of the aisle emphasized their commitment to soon reach a deal to raise the federal government's debt ceiling.  Ripple is starting a central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform which allows central banks, governments, and financial institutions to issue their own digital currency. Using Ripple's platform, government institutions can manage and customize the entire life cycle of the CBDC, which includes minting, distribution, redemption and token burning. Financial institutions would also be able to manage and participate in inter-institutional settlement and distribution functions using the CBDC. Central banks can issue both wholesale and retail CBDCs, which can make offline transactions as well. The platform is an enhanced version of Ripple's Private Ledger, which was started in 2021 for issuing CBDCs.  Bitcoin Frogs, the newly-launched non-fungible token (NFT) fashioned after frogs, has become the most-traded collection in the past 24 hours, surpassing even prominent collections such as Bored Apes. Bitcoin Frogs, which launched in late February on Bitcoin Ordinals, reached a trading volume of over $2.2 million, data from CryptoSlam show. The collection describes itself as “10,000 unique frog collectibles minted directly on the Bitcoin Blockchain.” At the time of writing, each NFT was selling for 0.12 bitcoin (BTC), or more than $3,200. Buyers and sellers are paying trading fees ranging from $50 to over $1,200 as of Thursday.  Chart of the Day  Matrixport's Bitcoin Greed and Fear Index has improved to 39 in the week ended May 17 from 22 in the preceding week.  ""The latest reading of 39% is almost jumping above the 21-day moving average (44%) and flipping could signal that short-term traders could expect higher prices when this flipping occurs,"" Matrixport's daily note said.

DWF Labs Buying LADYS Trackers indicate that the market maker bought 1.9 trillion LADYS for 108 ETH worth roughly $196,000 at the time of the purchase. These purchases were made on Uniswap v3, a decentralized exchange allowing for trustless token swapping on several blockchains. While DWF Labs’ purchase could be worth watching, it is not immediately clear why they are buying the meme token that its creators say will be the “quintessential token for internet spirituality” in the days ahead. Related Reading: Crypto Nightmare: OFAC To Allegedly Place Milady Wallet Owners On Blacklist There are concerns that the market marker is trying the pump LADYS so that they can liquidate and profit later. On the other hand, DWF Labs could be genuinely interested in the project and want to speculate, riding on the meme culture that has gripped the cryptocurrency markets in recent weeks. LADYS is a meme coin that was created by the Milady creator, an NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain. Milady’s creator says the LADYS is a meme token with zero utility but is “self-organized” and a “drip currency.” There is also a disclaimer that the project has “no association with Charlotte Fang or her creation Milady Maker” but is simply “paying homage to an NFT collection we all love and recognize.” Meme Coin Activity Is Falling Considering the recent success of meme tokens like PEPE, LADYS has been flying higher, drawing attention despite the token’s lack of intrinsic utility. Even so, CoinMarketCap data on May 18 shows that LADYS has been cooling off in recent days, despite its overall market capitalization remaining decent at $69,219,733. With this, the token is ranked 324th in the market cap leaderboard. Part of this high market cap could be because the token is listed in some centralized exchanges besides Uniswap, where it is actively traded. CoinMarketCap data shows that LADYS actively trades on MEX and Gate.io, two popular periphery cryptocurrency exchanges. Related Reading: This Trader Has Over $10 Million Of PEPE And LADYS, But Can’t Sell Following the listing on these centralized exchanges, the meme token’s trading activity appears to have contracted in Uniswap. However, Etherscan data shows that 16,045 LADYS holders have generated over 123,000 transfers since launch. Still, there is a concern about the number of on-chain transfers over the past trading week. For instance, on-chain transfers peaked on May 11 at 40,247 before crashing to 4,708 on May 17. Notably, during this time, LADYS prices crashed 68% from May 11 highs of $0.0000002985 to $0.0000000922 on May 17.

It calls itself the ""largest airdrop ever."" The state copy means nothing because many of the important tokens on Ethereum are IOUs. The tech stack is unimpressive and the lack of a white paper is alarming. It's probably best to avoid PulseChain. Overall, this is a good reminder of where crypto's value actually comes from. PulseChain is a smart contract blockchain which very recently launched with a rather ambitious proposition. The narrative is that Ethereum (ETH-USD), the primary smart contract blockchain, requires optimization because it is unable to sufficiently service the numerous decentralized applications straining the network. PulseChain means to decrease transaction (i.e. gas) costs and increase throughput as a solution. The need for a more scalable blockchain is not a new narrative by any means. Since 2020, many projects have launched their own implementations of smart contract blockchains. Each of these alternative chains, or ""altchains,"" puts a different spin to approaching the scalability issue. Where PulseChain seemingly stands out is that it will copy the entire state of the Ethereum network and transfer that over to its own sovereign and better-optimized blockchain. This is functionally a hard fork of Ethereum. All smart contracts, addresses, private keys to addresses, and assets linked to those addresses on Ethereum will be copied over to PulseChain with the exact same access conditions. Ethereum users who had assets prior to the initiation of PulseChain would have copied assets on PulseChain. After the full Ethereum state is copied over, PulseChain will function independently from Ethereum based on the actions of its users. PulseChain's Twitter and other marketing materials tout that this is the ""largest airdrop"" ever. An airdrop is a promotional event used by many crypto protocols in which tokens are given to users, or ""airdropped."" This creates buzz on social media and garners more interest in the project. PulseChain's ""Largest Airdrop"" on Twitter (Twitter) In reality, copying the state means very little. Value on Ethereum derives mostly from a link to something off-chain, in the form of an IOU. For example, a number of fungible (ie. ERC-20) tokens are stablecoins. The two biggest are Tether (USDT-USD) and US Dollar Coin (USDC-USD). Both are tokens which can interact with smart contracts and be sent between Ethereum addresses. Both tokens are supposed to be backed 1:1 with dollars held in a reserve. Procuring 1 USDC token to the issuer of USDC entitles one to receive $1 from the issuer. The USDC token is then removed from the supply of USDC to reflect the removal of that $1 from the reserve. Another major ERC-20 token is Wrapped Bitcoin, or wBTC. wBTC is issued by BitGo , a company which holds real BTC and ensures that wBTC can be used to claim real BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain. wBTC, like USDC and USDT, is functionally an on-chain IOU compatible for on-chain trading on Ethereum. But it goes even deeper. Most of the utility on Ethereum is based on moving these on-chain IOUs around. For example, the largest decentralized exchange, Uniswap (UNI-USD) is a protocol for trading tokens. Some of the most liquid markets on Uniswap include wBTC, USDC, USDT. Other protocols and decentralized applications tell the same story. If any of these three issuers decided to not honor their commitments, the on-chain activity on Ethereum would most likely suffer a dramatic decrease as users stop moving around their now-worthless IOUs. So the problem with PulseChain copying Ethereum's state is simple: copying an ""I owe you"" does not copy the actual thing owed. Ethereum's state has value because there are a lot of IOUs on it. In order for the PulseChain copies to have value, and for PulseChain itself to benefit from this value, the IOUs issuers must default on their commitments to Ethereum-based IOUs and honor the PulseChain copies as the ""true"" IOUs. The additional value of PulseChain that comes from copying Ethereum's state scales with the probability this will happen. Personally, I think the probability is extremely close to 0. And if it doesn't happen, then PulseChain's value will rest solely on its potential as an altchain to address the scalability issue. Why An IOU Default Probably Won't Happen Let's go over why it is very unlikely that any of the issuers will switch over to honoring the PulseChain copies and default on their ERC-20 commitments. First, there is a large downside in the form of legal and reputational issues. Stablecoin regulations and general scrutiny are getting tougher all over the world. A decision to suddenly default on obligations will be a horrible public relations move on the part of any IOU issuer. It would attract much more negative attention and turn many stablecoin supporters and users against the issuers. Because the on-chain economies are an integral component of the business model, issuers will not risk something like this. Second, there is very little upside. Switching over to PulseChain does not have a feasible positive impact on the bottom line of issuers. Even if all Ethereum users just picked up and switched to PulseChain, it doesn't mean more stablecoins will get issued. It is the same amount of users, using the same amount of assets. One could argue that if PulseChain was a much more efficient chain it could prompt capital inflows into the ecosystem. This might lead to more IOUs being issued. But the flip side of this is that a more efficient chain decreases the need for a higher money supply because the velocity of money can be much faster. This would decrease the amount of IOUs and hurt the bottom line of issuers. So the benefit of switching is pretty unclear while the downsides are large. Why would the issuers switch to PulseChain? PulseChain Doesn't Offer A Whole Lot As An Altchain Either It is obvious that copying Ethereum's state most likely does nothing for PulseChain. But what about PulseChain's tech stack as a scalability solution? If it is much better, then perhaps that alone can be bullish for PulseChain. Unfortunately, PulseChain doesn't have a lot to offer in this area either. A cursory glance at its website indicate that all it really offers is higher speeds, proof-of-stake (which Ethereum already is, although when PulseChain was first conceived Ethereum was proof-of-work), and lower fees. There are some mention about burning fees, which implies a deflationary token model. Burning fees or tokens is basically a share buyback. People contribute to the protocol's top line by purchasing the tokens to pay fees and this money is immediately distributed to the shareholder (in this case, tokenholder) by removing the tokens from the supply. Burning and deflation are not new in altchains. Ethereum does a similar thing too. What is more concerning is that PulseChain does not seem to have a white or lite paper. Such documents are pretty standard in crypto. After all, Bitcoin started off with a white paper and all the major projects have something similar which outlines purpose, technology, implementation, roadmap, or mathematical concepts. PulseChain's lack of a white paper is a bit of a red flag. Where Does Crypto's Value Come From? PulseChain is probably meaningless in the long run. Lots of other altchains are special in their own ways, and they probably will not go anywhere either. This case study is a useful reminder for where crypto's value originates, and this is a question people have been trying to answer for a while. It's not complicated. Value comes from providing utility to people. Crypto's utility comes in a few different forms. Coins which aim to be money must excel at providing monetary utilities. Otherwise people can and will use fiat currencies instead. Smart contract blockchains should support the creation of various useful smart contract applications. Right now, most of this utility is focused on price speculation of tokens. The problem with the smart contract business model is that price speculation necessitates a concentration of liquidity. A vast multitude of separate blockchains which each facilitate price speculation in their own way will result in a poor trading experience for all users due to the fragmentation of total liquidity. The alternative solution for token speculation is just a centralized crypto exchange like Binance which aggregates liquidity across blockchains into a single trading venue. And today, this is exactly what we see in crypto: most people are turning away from the on-chain solutions in favor of centralized solutions. Furthermore, the present state reveals an incongruence between crypto today and decentralization in the strictest sense. The stablecoin is paramount to smart contract blockchains because speculation PNL requires a fiat-based unit of account. For instance, no one denominates their earnings in BTC, but a lot of people will use USD to measure value. This requires an ""on-chain USD"" or stablecoin, which results in IOUs. These IOUs are in fact an element of centralization, which partially hurts the decentralization narrative of crypto. The only parts of crypto which stand independently from a reliance on IOUs are coins which attempt to be money on their own. These are stuff like Bitcoin, Litecoin ( LTC-USD ), Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ), and Monero ( XMR-USD ). These assets are no one else's liability.

While answering queries about the firm's new wallet recovery service, Ledger Support sent a couple of tweets that likely did little to assuage its users' concerns, suggesting that it could make its customers' assets vulnerable in any way it wanted to, but has – thus far – not done so.  ""You have always trusted Ledger not to deploy such firmware whether you knew it or not,"" the company said in the tweet. ""It's important to understand that at the end of the day, any hardware wallet solution a user chooses to go with will always require that person to trust this developer to build and maintain a secure device to store your assets.""  After erasing the tweets, Chief Technology Officer Charles Guillemet tweeted in an attempt to clarify the situation and downplay the initial tweets. A Ledger spokesperson also reached out to CoinDesk to say that the company can't extract users' keys and any action related to keys needs to be approved by the customers first.  ""Any action that interacts with a user's keys needs to be approved by the user through their Ledger. We cannot extract their keys, and will not extract keys,"" the spokesperson said.  Ledger's ""Recover"" service was met with consternation from the crypto community earlier this week on grounds that it undermines the firm's brief of privacy and security. The optional recovery service would allow users to backup their seed recovery phrase (a random string of words) through encrypting it in fragments with third parties.  Users fear that splitting the key between third parties could leave it vulnerable, effectively negating the main purpose of a hardware wallet against other storage options.  Ledger has argued that this sort of backup option is in fact popular as the possibility of assets becoming irrecoverable simply by mislaying a random set of words could prove a deterrent to investing in crypto.  ""This is what future customers want,” CEO Pascal Gauthier said during a Twitter Space. “This is the way that the next hundreds of millions of people will actually onboard to crypto.”  Justin Sun, founder of Tron and stakeholder in crypto exchange Huobi, also defended Ledger, describing the company as a ""reliable partner time and time again,"" in a Twitter post.

Bitcoin Whales Have Been Growing Their Holdings Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, when whales last accumulated like this, the price jumped about 34%. The relevant indicator here is the “BTC Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount (as well as the percentage) of the Bitcoin supply that each wallet group in the market is holding currently. The addresses on the network are divided into these wallet groups based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balances at the moment. The 10-100 coins cohort, for instance, includes all addresses that are holding at least 10 and at most 100 BTC currently. Naturally, if the Supply Distribution is applied to this specific group, it would measure the amount of the supply that wallets satisfying this condition are holding as a whole. Now, in the context of the current discussion, the Bitcoin cohort of interest is the “whale” group. Whales are humongous entities that carry at least 1,000 BTC ($26.8 million at the current exchange rate) and at most 10,000 BTC ($268 million) in their wallets. This means that the 1,000-10,000 coins group is of relevance here. The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for this particular cohort over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been on the rise in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for the whale group has observed an overall uptrend recently. During the last five weeks, these humongous investors have added around 84,897 BTC to their holdings, which is worth around $2.2 billion. Related Reading: PEPE Unlikely To Be As Big As DOGE & SHIB, Says Santiment Generally, the behavior followed by the whales can be something to watch out for, as their massive holdings mean that they have the potential to cause noticeable ripples in the market through their moves. An example of this can be clearly seen in the chart. In the leadup to and during the rally back in January of this year, the whales displayed a trend of accumulation and grew their supplies by around 71,690 BTC. While this accumulation occurred, the price of Bitcoin started its surge and had risen by more than 34% by the time the whales slowed down their buying spree. This trend highlights how the buying pressure from this cohort can help the price go up. Related Reading: Historical Crossover Suggests Ethereum (ETH) Top Is In Since the whales have started their latest accumulation cycle, however, the price has only declined or moved sideways so far. But given that these holders are continuing to expand their reserves, it suggests that they think the current relatively low prices provide a good buying opportunity. It’s unknown when this bullish conviction held by the whales might translate to the price, but the trend could be a positive sign for the long-term sustainability of the rally.

This suggests that the cryptocurrency will likely maintain its sideways pricing pattern for the foreseeable future. It seems unlikely that Dogecoin will reach the coveted $0.10 mark in May unless a major catalyst occurs. Source: Coingecko Dogecoin, currently priced at $0.0741 according to CoinGecko, has experienced a modest 0.7% rally in the past 24 hours, indicating a slight upward momentum in its value. Over the course of the past week, DOGE has seen a 3.0% increase, further contributing to its overall positive performance in recent days.

42410733,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdga2w,1684406112,Absence of Retail Investors Could Stand in the Way of Pepecoin's Rise to Top Meme Coin: Santiment,"Retail traders were mostly absent from Pepecoin’s (PEPE) stellar rise to $1.5 billion market cap in a few weeks, even as the token snagged billions of dollars in daily volumes and a host of copycats.  This comes from a new report by on-chain analytics firm Santiment. Santiment compared the liquidity and trading metrics for pepecoin against shiba inu (SHIB) and dogecoin (DOGE) – tokens themed after the popular Shiba Inu dog breed that was once worth a cumulative $160 billion at peak.  Santiment said that while dogecoin and shiba inu hit trading volumes of $70 billion and $40 billion respectively at peak, pepecoin managed a comparatively lesser $2 billion.  A big factor here, however, is that pepecoin raked up such volumes in the midst of a bear market – one that’s marred with generally lower liquidity as key market makers scaled back crypto trading plans. This opens up the potential for future growth when overall market conditions are better.  “Although PEPE's trading volume is significantly lower, it leaves room for growth and untapped potential,” Santiment said.  “However, it also means that the liquidity and retail participation in the market for PEPE is far less than what DOGE and SHIB experienced in previous years. In fact, it seems the retail landscape has changed dramatically, with retail participation appearing nearly nonexistent,” the report added.  Such a scenario has resulted in “dwindling volumes” for meme coin projects among retail traders – ones who exist outside of Crypto Twitter, which may not represent the actual popularity or impact of a token in the real world.  ""Conversations continue, but it appears that the interest and investment from retail traders have significantly diminished,"" Santiment said.  However, despite the differences in trading volume and liquidity, PEPE's social volume within the crypto media is on par with DOGE and SHIB during their peak periods, Santiment noted.  Social volume is a measure of participation on social media, such as tweets or posts, which may indicate the number of people actively discussing any certain token.  Pepecoin believers, meanwhile, continue to hold a fairly bullish view of how the token may perform in the coming years.  “I'm not over-stressed from dips and FUD and hodling strong because I'm pretty sure pepe will give a fight to SHIB and DOGE and in a bull market that could pay off big time,” said one pepecoin holder @AdamMetaverse in a direct message to CoinDesk.  @AdamMetaverse cited the popularity of pepecoin among influential Crypto Twitter users, the popularity of Pepe the Frog memes among the general populace, and rapid listing of PEPE on crypto exchanges as some of the reasons behind this rationale.  “I'm holding more than $1M in $PEPE and overall I'm extremely bullish,” he added.",NEUTRAL,DOGE | SHIB | PEPE,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/18/absence-of-retail-investors-could-stand-in-the-way-of-pepecoins-rise-to-top-meme-coin-santiment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d926ee9442131cd638550762d158c8b43fe1132-2684x1510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Visa Is Experimenting In a tweet on May 17, 2023, Sheffield said that Visa would continue researching and experimenting with account abstraction and EIP-4337 in the days ahead. His comments were confirmed by a team member who said that the payments company is actively exploring the potential of smart contracts and the future of programmable money and payments. As part of its experiment on the Goerli testnet, Visa will look at how it can further take advantage of EIP-4337 in deploying a functional paymaster smart contract to evaluate its utility. The paymaster is a smart contract account that Visa says sponsors transaction fees for contract accounts. These trials are on Goerli, a public testnet on Ethereum for users to test decentralized applications (DApps) without paying gas fees. Specifically, the payments technology company will be channeling efforts to look at how best it can deploy the paymaster smart contract to serve its client base. Interestingly, Visa will investigate whether its clients can pay as fees using alternative tokens like USDT and not ETH. According to Visa, this will help solve real-world problems and enhance the user experience when posting on-chain transactions. EIP-4337 Could Open Up Ethereum To More Possibilities EIP-4337 is an improvement proposal recently approved by Ethereum developers and set for mainnet integration. The proposal defines an account abstraction standard for the Ethereum blockchain. Account abstraction is the idea of separating the logic behind deployed decentralized applications from account management. Implementing this proposal introduces a “smart account” entirely governed by code. This code manages the social recovery of private keys, for example, or appending multi-wallet signatures. In this way, more possibilities can be opened up, driving usability. Subsequently, this may accelerate adoption by releasing features such as passwordless login or one-click transactions. Analysts say the ideas proposed by EIP-4337 will introduce flexibility for entities or individuals designing Ethereum and token wallets. Developers will also be allowed to be more creative while launching wallets that don’t compromise on security or ease of use. This is not the company’s first foray into the blockchain as Visa has been actively developing Ethereum-based products and even investing in blockchain companies. In March 2023, the payments company launched a crypto advisory service for its clients. The service is meant to advise companies on the benefits and risks of cryptocurrencies, helping them make informed decisions. In February 2023, Visa invested in Anchorage Digital, a crypto custodian.

While this may seem like a period of relative stability, on-chain intelligence platform Glassnode co-founder Yann Allemann suggests that it could indicate an impending price movement. In the past, similar consolidation periods have often been followed by price swings, and investors are closely watching for any signs of where the market might be headed. While some investors may be nervous about the recent consolidation, others see it as an opportunity to buy in before the next big move.

Related Reading: Conflux Network Partners With China Telecom For Blockchain, SIM Project – Details Factors Indicating A Positive Outlook For Bitcoin Price Amidst the current state of the Bitcoin market, several factors have been identified by Allemann on Twitter, which contribute to the prediction of a positive future for the cryptocurrency.

At the time of writing CoinGecko shows Bitcoin’s price stands at $27,372, reflecting a modest 1.9% increase over the past 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that the cryptocurrency has also experienced a slight decline of 0.2% over the course of the previous seven days. Source: Coingecko Nonetheless, Allemann highlights that this pattern often serves as a precursor to upward movements in the market. One compelling observation is the resilience of Bitcoin’s price in maintaining levels above the 50 and 200 Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which now serve as robust support levels that have proven their strength through five separate tests. These technical indicators not breaking down further signify a positive trend in the market and add to the overall optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s future performance. Debt Ceiling Uncertainty Could Impact Bitcoin Price Another factor that could potentially impact Bitcoin’s price in the coming days is the ongoing debate surrounding the debt ceiling in the United States. The debt ceiling is a limit on the amount of money that the US government can borrow to fund its operations. If the government fails to raise the debt ceiling, it could result in a default on its debt obligations, which could have serious consequences for the global financial system.

The group's finance ministers and central bank governors have already discussed crypto regulation in a meeting last weekend, and is set to reiterate their support to tougher crypto rules globally at the summit.  The FATF has urged countries to implement its controversial ""travel rule"" that requires crypto service providers to collect and share information on transactions above a certain threshold, designed to curb money laundering and the financing of terrorism through digital assets.  ""Around the globe, countries have made progress in implementing most of the standards; however, progress on implementing FATF’s updated requirements on crypto assets has been relatively poor,"" Kumar said, adding that 73% of countries are still ""non-compliant or only partially compliant"" with the watchdog's standards.  ""Countries need to take urgent action to shut down lawless spaces, which allow criminals, terrorists and rogue states to use crypto assets,"" Kumar said.  Although analysts estimate around 0.1% to 15.4% of crypto transactions to be unlawful, the FATF has said these may be too low.  G-7 countries taking the lead in ""fully and effectively implementing FATF’s global standards is crucial to our collective success,"" Kumar said.

The deals showcase the apparent rebound in the mining industry, which is trying to rise after a rough 2022. Last year's crypto downturn led to a lot of major miners going bankrupt, including Compute North, which was originally running the three USBTC sites.  The three bitcoin mines are in Kearney, Nebraska, as well as Granbury and Upton County, Texas. Energy investment firm Generate Capital bought Compute North's stake in two of the sites, one in Nebraska and one in Texas, whereas the Upton County facility is owned and operated in a 50-50 joint venture with NextEra Energy (NEE).  Foundry, Sphere 3D (ANY), Decimal Group, and TeslaWatt are among USBTC's new hosting clients. Foundry is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.  USBTC is in the middle of a merger with Canadian Hut 8 Mining (HUT), one of the biggest consolidation moves in the industry.  While USBTC has seen positive developments in its operations, as it also reached an agreement with the city of Niagara Falls to continue operating its bitcoin mine there, Hut 8 has been facing operational difficulties.  USBTC declined to comment on the estimated value of the hosting deals, citing merger disclosure rules.

The complaints target the FTX insiders, Embed CEO Michael Giles, and several other former Embed equity holders.

SHIB metaverse advisor, Marci Jastrow, also answered questions regarding the project, noting that users can access the metaverse via PC, mobile phone, and Virtual Reality (VR). Another interesting development is that the Web3 shopping platform, UQUID, recently integrated the Shiba Inu payment options into its services. This integration will add real-world utilities to Shiba Inu, allowing SHIB holders to use their coins for several purposes, including airtime top-up, online shopping, and more. The Shiba Inu team is also collaborating with Tangem, a blockchain tech firm, to roll out cold wallets exclusive to the Shiba Inu community. According to reports, users can visit Tangem’s official website to preview the wallet’s features and pre-order the SHIB-themed wallet pending completion.

42410731,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgZzd,1684397624,Crypto Observers Decode Large Block Trade in Ether Options,"On Tuesday, a large ether (ETH) trade involving call options expiring in June and September crossed the tape on Deribit, sparking discussions in the trading community about the nature of the flow.  Per data tracked by Amberdata, On Tuesday, a single entity booked a large block trade that involved the purchase of over 57,000 contracts of ether's June expiry call option at the $2,200 strike price and the sale of an equal amount of contracts of September expiry call at $2,200.  Singapore-based options trading giant QCP Capital was the market maker for the trade processed over the counter (OTC) and reported to Deribit. Block trades are large transactions negotiated outside of the open market to ensure minimum impact on prices and are considered a proxy for institutional activity.  A bet on volatility  According to Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, the bi-legged trade represents a ""calendar spread"" strategy designed to make money from a large ether price move away from the spread's strike price, i.e., $2,200.  ""This week, a large ETH calendar spread of almost 60k contracts was traded OTC and reported to Deribit via our block trade tool. The investor most likely expects volatility to increase or the price of ETH to increase after the June expiry, which are the key reasons to trade calendars,"" Strijers said.  Expectations for price turbulence in ether, as measured by Deribit's ether volatility index, recently hit a record low. Volatility is said to be mean reverting. Thus, unusually low readings often have traders betting on mean reversion or setting strategies that benefit from renewed wild price swings.  A trader with a short call calendar spread is not without risks and could, in theory, suffer an unlimited loss if the underlying asset remains steady.  Rollover of existing position?  Per Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, the block trade processed OTC does appear like a calendar spread at first but could be a ""rollover"" of ""covered call"" strategy from June expiry to September expiry.  The covered call strategy involves selling a call option against a long position in the spot market, allowing coin holders to generate additional income. The strategy is taken when holders do not expect a significant price rally in the near term. A rollover means carrying forward the options position, in this case, a short call, from the near-term expiry to contracts with longer expiry.  The covered call trader instantly receives a premium or compensation for selling a call option and for being obligated to deliver shares to the call buyer at a set price on or before the option's expiry date. The trader retains the entire premium received if the underlying asset remains below the strike price at which the call is sold. The premium retained constitutes extra income on top of the spot market holding. If the underlying asset rallies, the entity is hedged since it has effectively locked in the sale price of the stock by selling a call option, but misses out on extended rallies.  Per Griffin, the market participant, an ETH holder, likely set up a covered call strategy sometime early this year by selling June expiry calls at $2,200. On Tuesday, the trader bought back the June expiry calls and sold September expiry calls through the calendar spread, effectively rolling over or moving the covered call position to far-month expiry.  ""It looks as though the entity sold a calendar spread, but actually, it rolled over a covered call,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""After the trade, open interest in the June expiry $2,200 call decreased while open interest in September expiry increased, which means the trader rolled over the position from June to September.""  Open interest refers to the number of open options positions at a particular strike price.  ""Judging from the behavioral characteristics of this trader, he should be a whale holding coins, most likely a miner,"" Ardern added.  Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, voiced a similar opinion, saying the strategy could generate double-digit returns in annualized terms.  ""It could be a fund or someone naturally long,"" Thielen told CoinDesk. ""I probably get 15% to 20% annualized by selling covered calls.""  Note that selling or writing calls, whether as a standalone (naked) position or against coin holdings, represent a bearish view on volatility. Options are hedging instruments and demand for options depends on the degree of historical and expected price turbulence.  Selling volatility is fast becoming a preferred source of yield in the crypto market, according to QCP Capital.  ""With the collapse of the borrowing and lending markets in crypto last year, selling volatility has become a robust source of yield. We’ve seen interest to sell covered calls or puts structurally to earn yields. In this approach, investors earn a yield on assets, but the option seller takes on the risk of the option getting exercised,"" QCP Capital told CoinDesk.

42410728,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdgZpi,1684393200,"UK Lawmakers' Bid to Regulate Crypto as Gambling Could Be a Political Problem, Invites Industry Wrath","The House of Commons Treasury Committee’s opposition to the government’s plans to regulate crypto like a financial service has generated an instant backlash from the industry – and lawmakers’ views, though non-binding, may represent an extra bump in the road to the U.K.’s crypto plans.  A Wednesday report from the panel of lawmakers, led by the Conservative Party’s Harriett Baldwin, warned that consumers could be lulled into a false sense of security if unbacked crypto such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were regulated like other investments – and that it should instead be regulated like gambling.  The country’s finance ministry, the Treasury, is adamant that it will press ahead with its plans to regulate crypto using existing financial legislation, as crypto’s risks are similar, a spokesperson from the government told CoinDesk.  That may prove crucial given that, in practice, it’s the government that generally proposes new laws in the U.K. Lawmaker skepticism hasn’t prevented other crypto rules from passing relatively smoothly, including new measures on financial promotions – but many in the crypto industry see the latest intervention as unhelpful.  Hub  Last year, Rishi Sunak – then finance minister, now prime minister – said he wanted to make the U.K. a crypto hub. The Treasury still says it wants to promote innovation, even if ministers have quietly backtracked on the flashier elements of the announcement, like plans to mint a non-fungible token.  A February Treasury consultation proposed some rules of the road that were broadly welcomed by the industry – but now lobbyists are more concerned.  “This latest Treasury Select Committee report goes against the grain,” Mark Foster, the Crypto Council for Innovation’s European Union (EU) policy lead, told CoinDesk. “It misunderstands and misrepresents digital assets. There are practical use cases around remittances, payments and pathways for greater financial inclusion.”  Adam Jackson, director of policy at Innovate Finance, said that the Treasury's approach guarantees quality and consistency with other jurisdictions – with the EU recently legislating a new set of crypto rules similar to those for other financial instruments.  “Financial services are rigorously regulated in the U.K., and the application and adaptation of these existing rules to crypto assets will therefore provide for a high level of protection,” including protection of vulnerable consumers, Jackson said.  Ian Taylor, board advisor at lobby group CryptoUK, appeared to agree, saying consumer risk can be mitigated by education and regulations. “Equating cryptocurrency with gambling is both unhelpful and untrue,” he said.  The committee’s plans veer from the finance-based approach the U.K. has taken so far. The country’s crypto anti-money laundering regime is already run by the Financial Conduct Authority, which is also responsible for regulating traditional services like consumer credit and payments. Extra proposed powers to regulate crypto are contained in its Financial Services and Markets Bill, which appears to be nearing agreement, having already passed through the House of Commons, the parliament’s lower chamber.  Spanner  The committee is a scrutiny body, and its views aren’t binding on the Treasury – but they could nonetheless throw a spanner in the works as a result of parliamentary procedures, lawyer Diego Ballon Ossio told CoinDesk in an email.  After the FSMB is passed, the detailed law that brings crypto within the regulatory fold will need to be actively agreed by a vote in both chambers of the U.K. Parliament, said Ballon Ossio, who is a partner in Clifford Chance’s London practice.  While in theory, Sunak’s party has a majority in the Commons, he has clearly failed to convince party members such as Baldwin. However, lawmakers usually can’t amend those secondary regulations like the recent crypto promotions amendment, and in practice rarely reject them, according to think tank the Institute for Government.  But the committee’s opposition, while not fatal, may represent one more political challenge to the government’s plans.

However, in the past 24 hours, the altcoin managed to experience a 1.5% increase, indicating sideways movement. On the weekly chart, LINK showed a 4% upward movement. Despite these gains, the technical analysis indicates that the bears still control the price action. Both demand and accumulation levels remain low, although there has been a slight increase in buying activity on the daily chart. Nonetheless, sellers still dominate the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Whales Move Massive Amounts, Dumping Going On? The decline in Bitcoin’s price below $27,000 has caused uncertainty among altcoins, preventing them from making decisive moves on their respective charts. Following a period of consolidation, a price breakout is possible. While the technical outlook suggests bearish strength, there are also signals of a potential reversal. However, for LINK to initiate a price recovery, it will depend on broader market strength, as indicated by the decline in the LINK market capitalization, reflecting weak buying power. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day At the time of writing, the price of LINK was $6.78, as it attempted to break its sideways trading pattern while remaining below its resistance level of $6.90. A successful breakthrough above $6.90 could potentially trigger a rally toward $7.20. Conversely, if the price falls from its current level, it may decline to $6.30. A breach of the $6.30 support line could push the price below $6. On the other hand, as long as LINK remains above the local support line at $6.60, it has the potential to continue its recovery on the chart. The volume of Chainlink traded in the previous session was positive, indicating buyers were starting to reemerge in the market. Technical Analysis Following sustained selling pressure, LINK is now trying to attract buyers back into the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been trending upward, nearing the halfway point. However, at the present moment, sellers still outnumber buyers. Additionally, LINK is attempting to trade above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating a renewed demand in the market. Despite the coin’s recovery attempts, sellers still drive the overall price momentum. A buy signal emerged as the price and buying strength of LINK aimed for recovery. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a tool that reflects price momentum and potential trend reversals, formed a green signal bar aligned with a buy signal.

Related Reading: Crypto Assets Flow From Ethereum To BSC, Are Users Escaping High Gas Fees? Polkadot And Uniswap Partnership Signals New Era For DEX Uniswap’s arrival on Polkadot is a significant development for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, as it adds visibility and momentum toward developing a new world of decentralized financial products and services on the Polkadot network. With Uniswap’s proven track record in the Ethereum ecosystem, the following opportunities will open up on the DeFi sector: Increased liquidity: Uniswap’s arrival on Polkadot is expected to increase liquidity across the ecosystem, as more users can trade a wider range of assets on the platform. This will likely attract more liquidity providers and traders to the ecosystem, further enhancing liquidity. Interoperability: Polkadot’s unique architecture enables the creation of customized blockchains, or parachains, that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of different applications. With Uniswap’s arrival on the Polkadot network, developers will have access to a proven DeFi infrastructure that can be leveraged to create new and innovative products. This is expected to stimulate innovation in the DeFi space while facilitating the seamless asset transfer between Ethereum and Polkadot. Trustless, permissionless, and non-custodial access to tokens: Uniswap provides users a trustless, permissionless, and non-custodial way to access tokens. Its arrival on Polkadot is expected to provide users with a more secure and decentralized way to access tokens, which will likely attract more users to the ecosystem. Improved scalability and security: Polkadot’s high performance, scalability, and security will benefit Uniswap’s users, who can trade on a more secure and scalable platform. Furthermore, according to Osama el-Sayed, Global Head of Growth & BD at ParityTech: Polkadot is a strong fit for Uniswap, whose users can discover the network’s high performance, scalability, security, and interoperability. Polkadot’s DeFi ecosystem benefits from a marquee name in the space. What Is The Moonbeam Network? The Moonbeam Network is a Polkadot parachain that provides full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and native interoperability and prioritizes secure cross-chain integration solutions. It has seen impressive user growth over the last year, and the initiative to bring Uniswap to Polkadot and Moonbeam, led by the University of Michigan’s Blockchain Group, has successfully passed Moonbeam’s governance processes today following strong community support.

Bitcoin and ether stand unwavering, shrugging off the potential turbulence from the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and its ripple effects on crypto.  Bitcoin is opening the Asia trading day up 1.3% to $27,403, while ether is down 0.1% to $1,822.  In the U.S., debt ceiling negotiations continue, with President Biden declaring that the country will not default on its debt.  On one hand, crypto doesn’t seem to care. With liquidity as tight as it is, it takes a lot to move markets. And this just isn’t it.  But on the other hand, crypto does seem to care. Tether announced Wednesday U.S. Time that it's diversifying its reserves away from government debt and into crypto as it pledged to use around 15% of its profits to buy Bitcoin for its stablecoin reserves. Almost in parallel, Circle said that it is diversifying the reserves supporting its $30 billion USD Coin (USDC), including $8.7 billion in overnight repurchase agreements managed by BlackRock, to fortify against potential U.S. government debt default risks.  Diversification into bitcoin away from the dollar? It’s a maxi’s dream! But bitcoin just isn’t moving on the news.  As the clock moves closer to the debt ceiling deadline, we’ll see if any of this actually moves the needle on crypto.

This is great because it might finally lead to answers to a question that has gone nagging for years.  In 2018, William Hinman, who was serving as the director of corporation finance at the SEC at the time, made a game-changing announcement for the crypto world during a speech at the Yahoo Markets Summit: Ether is not considered a security.  But how did he come to this conclusion? Any speech made by a senior official is heavily shopped around, with plenty of stakeholders giving their opinions.  CoinDesk tried to get the Hinman emails via a Freedom of Information Act request in November.  But the SEC, at the time, withheld emails and notes from the public, arguing they should remain confidential due to privacy concerns and their preparation in anticipation of litigation.  It also noted that the release of the documents would constitute an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”  While we weren’t able to see the contents because of redactions, what we got back was an extensive email thread that revealed that multiple high-ranking SEC officials, including then-Chair Jay Clayton, contributed to the drafting of William Hinman's pivotal 2018 speech on ether's status.  All of this potentially undermines the SEC's claim that the speech was Hinman's personal opinion and not official guidance.  The industry needs to see these emails to understand the thought process behind Hinman’s statement.  SEC officials can come together and offer guidance on Hinman’s speech, so why can’t they give the same guidance to the industry?  Important events.

12733008,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533652,1684369839,Unveiling the Mystery: Trillions of SHIB Flow Into Accounts of Large Shiba Inu Holders,"In the world of cryptocurrencies, strange and unexpected events are not uncommon. The latest puzzling development revolves around Shiba Inu (SHIB), as trillions of these tokens have mysteriously found their way into large holders’ accounts, often called whales. The influx of SHIB tokens into these wallets has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts, sparking curiosity and speculation about the motives behind these substantial transfers. Interestingly, regardless of this activity, SHIB has only continued to move in a downward trend. Large Shiba Inu Holders Record Large Inflows According to data provided by the crypto intelligence portal IntoTheBlock, the past day has witnessed an unprecedented surge in the number of SHIB tokens flowing into the addresses of large Shiba Inu holders. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Faces Tough Resistance, Risk Of Uncharted Lows – Here’s Why The total inflow recorded amounts to a staggering 20.1 trillion SHIB tokens. To put this into perspective, this activity level has not been observed since March 23 and January of this year, suggesting that something significant may be unfolding within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Interestingly, previous instances of such massive inflows were accompanied by similarly large outflows. The recent surge is no exception, as more than 20.16 trillion SHIB tokens were observed to flow out of these large wallets within the same 24-hour period. Though the exact reason behind these anomalous activities remains unclear, it is suggested that it could result from redistribution between exchange wallets. Meanwhile, renowned crypto tracking platform Whale Alert has also reported consecutive transactions involving five trillion SHIB tokens each, totaling $43.6 million. While the scale of these transfers might suggest internal transactions within a major crypto exchange, it is important to note that similar large SHIB transactions among Binance’s crypto wallets have been confirmed. SHIB Remains In Red Despite the intriguing influx of SHIB tokens into the accounts of large Shiba Inu holders, it is worth noting that the token’s price has experienced a continuous downtrend in the past week. This raises questions about the impact of these whale movements on the overall market dynamics and investor sentiment toward Shiba Inu. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Remains In Red Despite Whales SHIB Buying Spree Over the past 7 days, Shiba Inu has continued to move downwards, particularly in the meme coin market. The token has plummeted nearly 6% in the past week, down from a high of $0.00000911 seen last Wednesday to $0.00000871 at the time of writing. The supposed Dogecoin Killer has also recorded a huge loss in its market capitalization in the past month. SHIB’s market cap has plunged 23% over this period, from a cap-high of above $6 billion to $5.1 billion. It is worth noting this plummet in the asset’s market cap can be attributed to the hype in the frog-themed meme coin PEPE, which took the spotlight away from several meme coins, including SHIB.

12732442,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=533638,1684368053,Is Bitcoin Headed For Another Crash? Here’s What The Data Says,"Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been trading in a sideways trend since its drop from the $28,000 level. As of the time of writing, BTC is currently valued at $26,800, having experienced significant declines across all time frames. The question on everyone’s mind now is whether this downturn will continue or if Bitcoin is headed for another crash. Related Reading: Crypto Assets Flow From Ethereum To BSC, Are Users Escaping High Gas Fees? Can Bitcoin Holders Expect Another 40% Drop In The Coming Weeks Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders closely monitor Bitcoin’s performance after its recent price drop. According to Miles Deutscher, an experienced cryptocurrency analyst, Bitcoin typically experiences a temporary rally after a decline, followed by a new low 5-8 weeks later. Deutscher’s analysis shows that in 2020, Bitcoin’s price dropped by 56% within 59 days after rallying initially. Similarly, in 2021, Bitcoin’s price dropped by 24% within 47 days, and in 2022, Bitcoin’s price dropped by 42% within 40 days. With this said, with BTC trading at $26,800, if it experiences a 20% drop, its price will likely fall to $21,440, while a 30% drop would bring it down to $18,760. A 40% drop would result in a price of $16,080, potentially taking Bitcoin back to the lowest point of the 2022 bear market. 2023 Is Set To Be The Best Year For BTC Yet? On the other hand, according to cryptocurrency analyst Adrian Zdunczyk, historical data suggests that pre-election years are the best-performing years on record for Bitcoin, with a 98.8% chance of a bull run in 2023. Even though the worst six months of the year usually begin with May, Zdunczyk believes a bullish trend will likely emerge in the coming months. Looking at the weekly chart, Zdunczyk notes that Bitcoin is currently experiencing a complete throwback to the 200-week trend, completing the mean reversion. While a strong correlation (0.42) exists between Bitcoin and the S&P 500, the critical support near $25,000 has been defended. However, if this support level breaks, traders could see prices fall into the lower $20,000 area. Furthermore, Zdunczyk believes more downside is possible if Bitcoin stays below $30,000. However, after a successful retest of the 200-day baseline, the support level has been confirmed by multiple techniques. Meanwhile, there has been a deterioration in the 50-day average volatility, and the long-term trend has been temporarily exhausted. Related Reading: US Prosecutes Russian Hacker For Orchestrating $200 Million Crypto-Ransomware Attacks Zdunczyk’s analysis suggests a clear head and shoulders pattern has been completed, with a technical breakout target of $22,000. However, if the pattern fails to break, it could trigger a cascade rally beyond $35,000. As seen in the chart above, the local resistance is currently at $28,000, backed by the BirbicatorPRO (BPRO) analysis. The bears maintain control until there is a powerful close above this level. Bitcoin bulls must wait for a decisive breakout above $30,000 to ensure a more reliable upward trend.
