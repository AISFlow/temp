42408288,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0v5,1715296368,EigenLayer's EIGEN Airdrop Might Signal Demise of Once-Popular 'Points',"What is perhaps the most-hyped crypto airdrop ever is set to kick off on Friday, but not necessarily with the kind of enthusiasm that its builders may have hoped for.  EigenLayer, a restaking platform on Ethereum, accrued $16 billion worth of crypto deposits within its first year of opening up to users – even prior to its official launch last month. When most of that money came in, the project was little more than a glorified blockchain wallet on the Ethereum blockchain – a non-functional lockbox that dangled the prospect of future rewards but didn't yet have any actual features. (Although the project did ""launch"" its pooled security service in April, many mission-critical features remain missing).  But it's the details around the token distribution that have generated the bulk of criticism on X and other social-media platforms. The tone has gotten so negative that some industry officials wonder whether it will lead to the demise of the wildly popular crypto incentive system known as ""points"" rewards.  Read more: As Crypto 'Points' Farming Grows, So Does Risk of Vague Promises  The EIGEN airdrop  As its primary incentive model, depositors into EigenLayer were rewarded with points – tallies tracked by EigenLayer and other third parties that accumulated according to how much a person deposited into the project, and for how long. The points weren't themselves crypto tokens, but most depositors expected them to eventually be convertible into them – an expectation that followed from months of lookalike programs from other upstart crypto projects.  In addition to earning points by depositing into EigenLayer, some people began trading them outright on platforms like Pendle, which offered as much as ""40x leverage"" on points trading.  EigenLayer's points program helped it attract users and lure in billions of dollars, but when the airdrop of the EIGEN token was finally announced last week, the project's community erupted with anger.  First, there was the revelation that the tokens would be non-transferable until some yet-to-be-determined future date – meaning users would need to wait even longer to cash out on their investments.  ""Although there purposefully wasn't any communication saying that the token would be transferable on day 1, the fact that the EigenLayer points program has been going on for nearly a year certainly led to the expectation that depositors would be able to claim their tokens on day 1,"" said Luxas Outumuro, who leads research at IntoTheBlock, a blockchain market intelligence firm. ""It's understandable that they want to decentralize their token further, but it was a mismanagement of expectations that wasn't properly addressed.""  Read more: Why Eigenlayer’s Airdrop Is Controversial  More blowback revolved around EigenLayer's decision to restrict its airdrop to users from select regions – even though the project had placed no geographic restrictions on users making deposits and earning points. Users from more than a dozen countries, including the U.S., Canada and China, will be barred from the airdrop.  ""There was so much 'wink, wink' going on around points and how they were making an infinite sum game and everyone's gonna win and all of this shit. And then they basically cut off two-thirds of potential users and airdrop recipients,"" said one EigenLayer venture investor who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. ""I think it's completely fine to cut off the U.S. from an airdrop, but then don't let them use it in the first place.""  Other criticisms came down to the token's ""Season 1"" distribution plan, which will place EIGEN tokens into the hands of some point earners but will force others to wait for a ""Season 2"" airdrop that hasn't been detailed. This means users who deposited into EigenLayer via some liquid restaking services and other third-party platforms don't yet know how many EIGEN tokens they'll receive – despite the fact that these services are responsible for a lion's share of overall EigenLayer deposits.  ""EigenLayer chose to allow others to, sort of, rehypothecate and play all these crazy games. They could have just said, 'No, don't do that. We're not making any commitment that we're going to honor those points,'"" said Mike Silgadze, founder of liquid restaking platform Ether.Fi.  EigenLayer revised its token plans in response to the community backlash, but it's unlikely that the changes will be enough to place EigenLayer back into the crypto community's good graces.  The problem with points  EigenLayer isn't the only recent project that's struggled to meet the expectations set by a points program.  Renzo, a liquid restaking protocol on EigenLayer, faced similar backlash last month when its point system failed to meet investors' expectations. Blur, one of the originators of crypto points, received criticism for repeatedly extending its points window and changing the rules around when and how tokens would be airdropped.  Some point programs have converted into airdrops with little controversy, but more and more of them – particularly larger projects, like EigenLayer – have led to disappointment.  Many investors are beginning to think that the practice – which has become ubiquitous among crypto startups – may finally be nearing its end.  Silgadze explains that points were a way to ""encourage protocol activity in advance of the token launch."" This improved upon the old system, where users would ""farm"" for an airdrop by interacting with a blockchain protocol, but didn't know exactly what sorts of activities would ultimately lead to airdrops. Point-based systems ""give much more clarity to people about what the protocol wants you to do,"" said Silgadze.  While point systems are a great way to entice would-be users, they also exist as the result of regulatory protection. Crypto companies are hesitant to directly sell tokens initial coin offering (ICO)-style, since doing so could place them in the cross-hairs of regulators.  But when it comes to protecting investors and offering transparency, Robert Leshner, the founder of Compound and Robot Ventures, an investor in EigenLayer developer Eigen Labs, thinks points are the worst of all worlds. ""The entire root of investor protection is making sure that there's not an information asymmetry between the investors and the sponsors. And points create the largest information asymmetry that exists in crypto,"" he said. ""Everything is at the team's discretion, and users and investors are just praying that they get treated right by the team.""  Leshner thinks the litany of points failures of the past year will eventually lead to a dying-out of the practice.  ""When you see one of the largest, most ambitious, most genuine projects in all of crypto, EigenLayer, f_ck up a points program – If EigenLayer can't do this correctly, who can? No one can.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | AIRDROP | TOKEN SALE,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/09/eigenlayers-eigen-airdrop-might-signal-demise-of-once-popular-points,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef8532b36c7b99a708c95d2d9d64200daa24331c-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The US presidential elections could pose a turning point for regulations and adoption that could affect the industry worldwide. On Wednesday, Donald Trump, former US president and Republican candidate, stated his support for the industry and criticized Biden’s administration for its stance on digital assets. MAGA (TRUMP), the Trump-inspired memecoin, saw its price skyrocket 63% in the following hours. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Discuss Why Memecoins Have Been 2024’s Most Profitable Narrative Trump’s Stance On Crypto The Republican candidate held a gathering on Wednesday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Holders of NFTs bearing Trump’s name and likeness attended the Trump Cards NFT Gala. During this event, the former US president strongly criticized Biden’s administration and its hostility towards the sector. He revealed he is “fine” with crypto and wants to make it a “solid” industry. Trump claimed he’s the best option for those who are in favor of cryptocurrencies: (…) I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid and everything else. But I’m good with it. And if you want, if you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for me. Moreover, the Republican candidate asserted that “crypto is moving out of the US because of the hostility towards it,” something he alleges he doesn’t want to continue and promises to stop. i asked donald trump how he’s going to keep crypto businesses in america. sounds bullish 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/rvuztPmQ8P — Malcolm (33.3%) (@macdegods) May 9, 2024 When asked what he would do to stop the exodus of digital asset businesses, he stated that to embrace them, they would have to let them be in the country. To achieve this, the candidate promised a more welcoming regulatory framework for crypto. As part of his jab at the current administration, Trump mimicked US President Joe Biden, claiming he would be clueless if asked about cryptocurrencies. He further added, “The Democrats are very much against it.” TRUMP Flips BODEN As Price Soars After Trump’s declarations, two memecoins inspired by the politicians saw a price reaction. Jeo Boden (BODEN) soared 23.5% in the following hour, going from $0.34 to $0.42. Since then, the price has retraced to hover between the $0.35-$0.36 range. BODEN is trading at $0.3492, representing a 15.1% increase in the last 24 hours. The token’s daily trading volume also saw a significant 35.7% surge, with over $20 million traded in the past day. Despite benefiting from the Republican candidate’s jab at its inspiration, BODEN Still displays red numbers in the longer timeframes, with a 29.9% and 59.8% weekly and monthly decrease.

However, it has since retraced some of its gains and is currently testing the $61,000 support level.

The anticipation of a price increase has also historically driven increased demand for Bitcoin leading up to Halving events. However, Pantera Capital acknowledges that the impact of each subsequent Halving on price may diminish as the reduction in the supply of new Bitcoin from previous Halvings becomes less significant. Moreover, the firm notes that, on average, the Pantera Bitcoin Fund has nearly doubled in value for eleven years. Based on this historical performance, Pantera Capital envisions a scenario in which the price of Bitcoin reaches $117,000 by 2025. Bullish Bitcoin Price Predictions Renowned crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has recently taken to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share bullish predictions for the Bitcoin price. With forecasts ranging from $75,000 to $110,000, Titan of Crypto highlights various factors and patterns that could potentially drive BTC’s growth. According to Titan of Crypto, a price rise to $110,000 for Bitcoin is “programmed.” While the analyst did not elaborate on the specifics of this programming, it suggests a strong conviction in BTC’s potential to reach that level. Titan of Crypto also identifies a current head-and-shoulders pattern in the Bitcoin price chart. If this pattern holds, the analyst suggests that BTC could rise to the $75,000 mark. If confirmed, this pattern could signify a bullish trend reversal and further support the projection of Bitcoin reaching higher price levels.

Lastly, based on his analysis, the analyst suggests a conservative price prediction of $108,000. However, Titan of Crypto believes that BTC’s price may exceed this projection, indicating a more optimistic outlook.

However, Ethereum on its own seems to possess more bearish fundamentals compared to Bitcoin, leading crypto analysts to believe that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap will fall further from here. Ethereum Poised To Crash Further A crypto analyst known as Shin Forex took to the TradingView website to share an interesting analysis of the Ethereum price. The analysis, which focused on the ETH/BTC chart, unveiled some concerning developments in the ETH price. Related Reading: Fundstrat CEO Predicts When Bitcoin Price Will Reach $150,000 And $500,000 The analyst explained that during this time, the liquidity in Ethereum has been dwindling. Instead of flowing toward altcoins like ETH, it is instead flowing toward Bitcoin. This suggests growing disinterest in Ethereum from investors and as liquidity flows to Bitcoin, Ethereum has nothing propping it up at this time. Furthermore, the crypto analyst explains that the ETH/BTC pair has now broken below its support of 0.05. Now, this drop below its support level is important given what has happened each time that it broke. Shin Forex points back to the last two market cycles, one in 2016 and one in 2019, of the ETH/BTC breaking below its support. Both times that this has happened, a crash in the price has followed, before it can rally again. The crypto analyst does not expect this time to be any different and believes that ETH/BTC will fall below 0.04. If this happens, it will send Ethereum spiraling and the analyst has set a price target of around $2,500 for this. Can ETH Price Survive The Crash? In the short term, the Ethereum price doesn’t look to good, especially as the altcoin is currently trending downward inside its current channel, according to the crypto analyst. However, zooming out to the larger timeframe can help give an inkling of how the ETH price could perform after the crash. Looking at Shin Forex’s chart of the last two times that a formation like this occurred, it has also set a precedent for money to flow back into Ethereum. In November 2016, the price had crashed but in a few months, there was a massive recovery as ETH/BTC rose to a new all-time high. Source: TradingView.com A similar thing happened the next time in 2019, with the crash coming ahead of a market rally, albeit a bit slower at this time. So, if this trend holds, then the ETH crash is inevitable. However, a recovery is expected that will likely kickstart the beginning of another massive rally.

This change is directly tied to fluctuations in the network’s hash rate, which has dipped below 600 EH/s following the recent halving event. The adjustment, which marks a 5.7% fall in mining difficulty, brings the level down to 83.1 trillion, according to data from Bitbo. This most substantial adjustment since December 2022 reflects broader shifts within the Bitcoin mining landscape. At that time, Bitcoin’s price hovered around $17,000, contrasting sharply with current levels. Notably, the mining difficulty, a metric that determines how challenging it is to find a new block, adjusts approximately every two weeks, or every 2016 blocks. This system ensures that block discovery remains consistent at around every 10 minutes, irrespective of the number of miners. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits ‘Danger Zone’: Peter Schiff Warns Of ‘Do or Die’ Scenario Impact On Miners And Market Dynamics The recent decline in mining difficulty came after a 10% drop in the network’s hash rate from a seven-day moving average of 639.58 EH/s to 581.74 EH/s. This decrease in hash rate led to longer average block times of about 10 minutes and 36 seconds, up from the standard 10 minutes, before the difficulty adjusted downward at block height 842,688. The reduced hash rate also contributed to a new low in the hash price, which fell to roughly $0.049 per TH/s per day. This decline impacts miners’ profitability, as the hash price, a term introduced by Bitcoin mining firm Luxor, represents the earnings a miner can expect per unit of hashing power per day. However, today’s negative difficulty adjustment may provide some relief for miners, making it easier to mine blocks than in the previous two weeks. Bitcoin Market Reactions And Investment Trends The adjustments in mining difficulty and hash rate come when Bitcoin’s price also shows signs of volatility. After reaching a peak above $73,000 in March, the price has fallen by 16% and is now trading around $61,376. This decline mirrors the broader trend in the mining difficulty, suggesting a possible correlation between these metrics.

42408277,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0O1,1715284452,How the U.S. Should Regulate Stablecoins,"In arecent podcast, Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, painted stablecoins as a dangerous threat to the banking system and, ultimately, to the public at large. In her view, stablecoins could destabilize banks and eventually require a government bailout.  Her comments come amid a new push in the U.S. Congress for regulating stablecoins at the federal level. Although the chances of any stablecoin bill being enacted into law in a year of presidential elections are slim, Allen is concerned that these bills are “giving public backing to stablecoins.” For her, “stablecoins serve no important purpose and frankly just should be banned.”  Marcelo M. Prates, a speaker at Consensus 2024, is a financial policy and regulation expert writing about money, payments, and digital assets.  Are her concerns valid? Only for those who are against competition and don’t like regulatory clarity. What Allen depicts as a scary and useless fad is an upgraded version of one of the most revolutionary financial innovations in the last 25 years: electronic money, or simply e-money, issued by non-banks.  In the early-2000s, the European Union decided it was about time for more people to have access to faster and cheaper digital payments. With that in mind, E.U. legislators developed a regulatory framework for e-money and allowed start-ups making the most of technology, the so-called fintech, to provide payment instruments in a regulated and safe way.  The idea behind it was simple. As banks are complex institutions providing multiple services and are subject to higher risks and increased regulation, opening a bank account to make digital payments was usually difficult and costly. The solution was to have a separate licensing and regulatory regime for non-banks focused on one service: transforming cash they received from their customers into e-money that could be used for digital payments either through a prepaid card or an electronic device.  In practice, e-money issuers work like narrow banks. They are legally required to safeguard or insure the cash they receive from their customers so that e-money balances can always be converted back to cash with no loss of value. As they are licensed and supervised entities, customers know that, aside from gross regulatory failure, their e-money is safe.  It's thus easy to see that thevast majority of existing stablecoins, those denominated on a sovereign currency like U.S. dollars, are just e-money with a kick: as they are issued on blockchains, they are not restricted to a national payments system and can circulate globally.  Instead of a scary financial product, stablecoins are really “e-money 2.0,” with the potential to keep delivering on the original e-money promises of increasing competition in the financial sector, lowering costs for consumers, and advancing financial inclusion.  But for these promises to be fulfilled, stablecoins do need to be properly regulated at the federal level. Without federal law, stablecoin issuers in the U.S. will continue to be subject to state money transmitter laws that aren’t uniformly designed or consistently enforced when it comes to segregation of clients’ funds and integrity of assets kept in reserve.  Considering the decades-long experience of the European Union in e-money and improvements brought by other countries, an effective stablecoin regulation should be built around three pillars: granting of a non-bank license, direct access to central-bank accounts, and bankruptcy protection for backing assets.  First, it’d be contradictory to restrict stablecoin issuance to banks. The essence of banking is the possibility of holding deposits from the public that aren’t always 100% backed, which is traditionally known as “fractional reserve banking.” And that happens so that banks can make loans without using only their capital.  For stablecoin issuers, on the other hand, the goal is that each stablecoin is fully backed with liquid assets. Their sole job is to receive cash, offer a stablecoin in return, hold safely the cash received, and return the cash anytime someone comes with a stablecoin to redeem. Lending money isn’t a part of their business.  Stablecoin issuers, much like e-money issuers, are meant to compete with banks in the payments sector, especially in cross-border payments. They’re not supposed to replace banks or, worse, become banks.  That’s why stablecoin issuers should be granted a specific non-bank license, as happens for e-money issuers in the E.U., U.K., and Brazil: a simpler license with requirements, including capital requirements, that are proportionate to their limited activity and lower risk profile. They don’t need a banking license, nor should they be required to get one.  Second, and to reinforce their lower risk profile, stablecoin issuers should be able to have a central-bank account to hold their backing assets. Transferring the cash received from their customers to a bank account or investing it in short-term securities are typically safe options, but both can become riskier in times of stress.  Circle, a U.S. stablecoin issuer, had a hard time when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed, and$3.3 billion of its cash reserves (almost 10% of the total reserves) that had been deposited with SVB were temporarily unavailable. And several banks, including SVB, that were holding U.S. treasuriessuffered losses after interest rates rose in 2022, and the treasuries’ market price declined, leaving some of them short on liquidity and unable to face withdrawals.  Read more: Dan Kuhn - What Visa’s ‘Organic’ Stablecoin Report Misses  To avoid problems in the banking system or the treasuries market spilling over to stablecoins, issuers should be required to deposit their backing reserves directly with the Fed. This rule would effectively eliminate credit risk in the U.S. stablecoin market and enable real-time supervision of stablecoins’ backing — no need for deposit insurance and no bailout risk, just like e-money and contrary to bank deposits.  Note that central-bank accounts for non-bank institutions wouldn’t be unprecedented. E-money issuers in countries like theU.K, Switzerland and Brazil can keep users’ funds safeguarded directly with the central bank.  Third, customers’ funds should be considered by law segregated from the issuer’s and not subject to any insolvency regime if the stablecoin issuer were to fail — for example, because of the materialization of operational risks, like fraud.  With that additional layer of protection, stablecoin users could quickly regain access to their funds during a liquidation process, as general creditors of the bankrupt issuer wouldn’t be able to seize customers’ funds. Again, something like what’s consideredthe best practice for e-money issuers.  In the public debate about stablecoin regulation, alarming takes might impress a distracted audience. But, for those paying attention, balanced arguments based on successful examples and experiences from around the world should prevail.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Marcelo M.

42408276,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0Ki,1715283916,Will Biden Get the Final Say Over a Controversial Crypto Accounting Rule?,"A little-known rule proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that is disliked by vast numbers of the finance firms — particularly banks — and vehemently opposed by the majority of the crypto industry is essentially getting revived by President Joseph Biden.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The House on Wednesday approved a decision to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 in a majority vote. In the normal course of events, the measure would then move to the Senate, but, in an unexpected twist, Biden has warned he will veto the bill.  “This move makes such little sense that it's highly likely the White House doesn't even understand the issues at stake, and is just going along with a certain limited and unreasonably biased yet influential faction,” Noelle Acheson, author of the “Crypto is Macro Now” market research newsletter, said on X. “Just who is the government serving here? Who is it protecting?”  Acheson’s incredulity is perhaps justifiable. Critics have called SAB 121 “obscure,” a “diktat” and a “pernicious weed.” Since 2022, when the bulletin was posted, digital asset custodians have had to treat the assets they’re holding on behalf of clients as a liability on their own balance sheets and hold additional capital to offset those liabilities.  Crypto advocates see the rule as onerous and capital intensive, and, interestingly, so do banks and other financial incumbents. In February, major banking and securities industry bodies including the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), American Bankers Association (ABA), Financial Services Forum (FSF) and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) wrote a letter to the SEC asking for amendments to the bulletin’s requirements.  “SAB 121 will have a chilling effect on banking organizations’ ability to develop responsible use cases for distributed ledger technology (DLT) more broadly,” the letter states. Custody is already a fairly low-margin business, and asking institutions to hold a dollar for every asset in custody, as an extra insurance on top of, just being able to keep the assets safe is a bit much.  But it’s not only industry participants that are complaining. In 2022, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigated SAB 121 and found that the measure warranted a congressional review because they skipped over the necessary public review and comment periods. In other words, the SEC tried to pass off a rule as a lowly memo.  This argument was then picked up by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Reps. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) and Mike Flood (R-Neb.), who posted matching resolutions to revoke the rule.  ""The SEC issued SAB 121 without conferring with prudential regulators despite the accounting standard’s effects on financial institutions’ treatment of custodial assets, and the SEC issued SAB 121 without going through the notice-and-comment process,"" Rep. Flood said at the time. ""In the face of overreach by a regulator, it is the role of Congress to serve as a check.""  House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) also picked up the baton to criticize an overzealous SEC, saying “because they called it staff guidance, the SEC could avoid public comment and the rulemaking process governed by the Administrative Procedure Act or APA.”  It was Flood and Nickel’s bill that Biden threatened to veto, in what is being seen as a promise to back SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. “Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty,” the Biden administration wrote in a Wednesday statement.  See also: House Votes to Erase SEC Crypto Policy While President Biden Vows Veto  SABs are not enforceable securities law, but instead guidance for both industry participants and the SEC itself when making legal interpretations – though they do not reflect consensus among the SEC’s five commissioners. They also generally do not go through a review process, which was the problem at hand.  Speaking at a two-day ""SEC Speaks"" event last month, Commissioner Hester Peirce commented::  ""Nobody can challenge the diktats because they're not final agency action, but compliance is mandatory for anyone who is trying to avoid SEC delays, denials and enforcement and examination scrutiny. So everybody silently complies,” Peirce said.  ""The bottom line is that rules of such broad effect should be set by the full commission, not by the staff that reports only to the chairman.""  In a better world, that may be true. But this time it seems like Biden may get the final word.

Taking to X, one analyst shared on-chain data that paints a more nuanced picture than a simple loss of confidence in recent weeks. Bitcoin Open Interest Remains Low: Bullish? The analyst, pointing to CryptoQuant data, observes that leveraged traders on perpetual trading platforms like Binance appear to be closing their positions more than opening new ones. The analyst notes that the reading is at -20% at the monthly change in Open Interest. At this level, it shows that more traders are closing more positions than opening new ones. This development suggests that most traders adopt a strategic wait-and-see, watching prices evolve. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Lose Interest, Is This A Precursor For A Crash To $50,000? Despite the decrease in positions opening, it’s important to note that this is not a sign of BTC’s downfall or the invalidation of a potential surge. The analyst interpreted this contraction as a strategic move by traders, who are cautiously optimistic and not exiting the market due to bearish expectations. In a separate post, the analyst added that the Bitcoin market needs the current wave of liquidation and “negativity” for accumulating short positions. All short positions opened at spot levels bet that BTC will continue trickling lower, even breaking below $56,500. However, the more short positions there are, the higher the possibility of a “short squeeze” forming. When this happens, there will be a sudden price spike, liquidating shorts and forcing sellers to buy back into the market to prevent further damage. BTC Inside A Trade Range: Will $60,000 Fail? Despite the potential upside hinted by on-chain data, prices remain confined within a narrow range. Last week, bulls failed to close above $66,000, confirming the impressive march from May 3. Bitcoin found resistance and is moving lower toward the psychological $60,000 level. From price action, losses below this line might fast-track the collapse toward $56,500 registered in early May. Going forward, traders will closely monitor how prices evolve after the all-important Halving on April 20. Considering the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the involvement of institutions, some analysts expected prices to shoot higher immediately.

The app allows users to save, spend and invest in digital assets on-chain.  The move comes as one of the firm's biggest shareholders is urging investors to vote against the reappointment of CEO Jonathan Steinberg given his strong push into crypto.  WisdomTree's digital asset app, which offers users access to bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} as well as dollar and gold tokens, on Thursday became available to customers in New York, even as CEO Jonathan Steinberg is under pressure from shareholders as a result of the investment company's push into decentralized finance.  The app, called WisdomTree Prime, launched in 21 states in July and received a charter to operate as a limited-purpose trust company under the New York Banking law in March.  It lets users save, spend and invest in digital assets on-chain using the Stellar and Ethereum blockchains, which share ownership records.  ""Since we first entered app stores in select states last summer, we have exhibited strong momentum across all fronts, including new digital fund launches, payment capabilities, and collaboration with regulators,"" Will Peck, head of digital assets at the firm, said in a press release.  WisdomTree's digital asset plans, however, have caused headaches for Steinberg, the Financial Times reported earlier this week.  The firm's biggest shareholder, Graham Tuckwell, chair of ETFS Capital, doesn't agree with the firm's strong push into DeFi and has urged investors to vote against the reappointment of Steinberg.  According to the FT, Tuckwell told shareholders that Steinberg's initiatives in DeFi have been a ""massive distraction and utterly unsuccessful."" The Australian businessman became an important shareholder of WisdomTree in 2018 when the firm acquired the European arm of ETF Securities which Tuckwell founded in 2005.  WisdomTree has become a dominant TradFi player in crypto since 2019 when it launched its first bitcoin exchange-traded product on Swiss stock exchange SIX.

The crypto founder alluded to certain factors that could spark the flagship crypto’s rise to such heights. Bitcoin Could Rise To As High As $265,000 Young Ju mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “Bitcoin’s network fundamentals could support a market cap three times its current size compared to the last cyclical top.” He added that this development could help BTC rise to $265,000. The fundamental that the crypto founder was alluding to was the Hashrate/Market Cap ratio. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 350% Surge For Shiba Inu – Here’s The Target Source: CryptoQuant The accompanying chart that Young Ju shared showed that Bitcoin’s hash rate is currently more than three times what it was at the last market cycle top. Meanwhile, BTC is still at the price level it was during that period. As such, the CryptoQuant CEO believes that Bitcoin could also see a 3x increase in its price, just like the Hash rate. Young Ju’s prediction provides a much-needed bullish outlook for Bitcoin, especially given the flagship crypto’s recent decline and talk that Bitcoin may have already attained the market top for this cycle. Tom Lee, co-founder of research firm Fundstrat, also recently shared his bullish sentiment towards BTC, stating that the crypto token will still reach $150,000 this year. Meanwhile, similarly to Young Ju’s prediction, crypto analyst MacronautBTC had previously stated that Bitcoin could rise to $237,000. The crypto analyst made this “conservative” calculation based on BTC’s demand outpacing its supply in the long run, especially with the halving further reducing Miners’ supply. A Rise To $265,000 Not Ambitious Young Ju’s prediction of $265,000 for Bitcoin is far from ambitious when considering that Samson Mow, the CEO of JAN3, predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million this year. He explained that this unprecedented rise was possible due to the impressive demand that Bitcoin was currently enjoying. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Reclaim $4,000? Fragile Fundamentals Threaten To Send ETH Crashing Pseudonymous crypto analyst PlanB also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that BTC hitting $1 million is possible, although he suggested that could happen in 2025 rather than this year. He made this prediction based on the Bitcoin stock-to-flow (STF) indicator, which hints at $500,000 being the average price level for Bitcoin in this market cycle. As such, the analyst believes that $1 million could be the market top for this bull run. Meanwhile, PlanB mentioned that Bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year was “inevitable.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,700, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42390838,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdOhHr,1715275579,Influencer-Investors Get Perks to Pitch Tokens: Inside Crypto's 'KOL' Economy,"Members of crypto's influencer class are writing checks for countless startups and then promoting them on social media.  In return, these so-called key opinion leaders get discounted valuations and options to sell sooner than other early investors – sometimes right when the token launches.  ""KOL rounds"" are an increasingly popular way for founders to market their projects without spending anything out of pocket, unlike the old model of paid promotion.  KOL arrangements aren't always disclosed to the investing public, several insiders said.  Crypto founders have long relied on Silicon Valley-style investors to fund their risky ideas. But in the last few months, venture capitalists and angel investors have given way to a new breed of influencer-turned-investor: the KOL.  Key Opinion Leaders flood the social media feeds of global crypto users with ""alpha"" about which protocols to watch and invest in. They can be as pseudonymous as a cartoon penguin or as recognizable as a YouTube personality.  A CoinDesk review of KOL fundraising found a budding economy of influencers who write checks for crypto startups and then promote them to thousands of retail traders on YouTube and X (formerly Twitter). Projects are betting KOLs will help attract users and, critically, eager buyers before they issue their tokens.  ""The further they are gonna shill their bags, the further the token might go, which is super-good for the project and super-good for price action,"" said Vlad Svitanko, the CEO of marketing firm Cryptorsy, which helps organize KOL rounds.  KOL rounds are a twist on the paid shills of earlier crypto cycles, those high-flying influencers like Ben Armstrong (aka BitBoy Crypto) who charged tens of thousands of dollars to promote tokens to massive online audiences. Instead of billing projects for their services, KOLs now put money in them – albeit on very generous terms. Those terms include discounted valuations and options to sell tokens sooner than other private investors are allowed to.  Crypto's upper class is acutely aware of how these ""KOL rounds"" operate, CoinDesk found in over two dozen interviews with founders, developers, investors and other insiders who insisted on anonymity to discuss fundraising from influencers.  It's less clear how well retail investors (the ones being influenced) understand the KOLs' financial relationship with the projects they're boosting. Many KOLs don't disclose their paid deals. Failure to do so could violate U.S. consumer-protection laws, according to a lawyer familiar with these arrangements.  ""When influencers fail to disclose such arrangements, they mislead their audience, many of whom rely on these endorsements to make financial decisions,"" said Ariel Givner, an attorney who runs a crypto law practice near Philadelphia. ""This lack of transparency undermines the trust that is essential in digital commerce and can lead to significant financial losses for unsuspecting followers.""  KOLs' prominence is only poised to grow as the multi-billion-dollar ""creator economy"" reshapes online life. Crypto may be supercharging the trend.  ""It's a massive thing. It's circumventing not only VCs, it's also circumventing marketing,” said one well-connected person who works with KOLs. “People are going to say they don't even need marketing – they get capital from distribution.""  Humanity Protocol  One startup that turned to KOLs recently is Humanity Protocol, a competitor to Sam Altman's billion-dollar digital identity project Worldcoin.  Far-smaller Humanity Protocol raised $1.5 million from a combination of angel investors and KOLs in early March, according to an investor presentation.A document titled ""Humanity Protocol's Alignment form for KOLs"" assigned influencers six months of social media homework: ""like"" and comment on three tweets a week, write three tweet threads about Humanity Protocol, join at least one of Humanity Protocol's Twitter Spaces a month, among other requirements.  The project gave content-specialist influencers granular missions. Trader KOLs should publicly buy Humanity Protocol's yet-to-be-announced tokens ""after the launch to demonstrate commitment,"" one document said. It directed YouTuber KOLs to create two ""speculative videos about Humanity Protocol being a main Worldcoin competitor and about the Airdrop.""  ""We're tracking all activities and will void the SAFT and refund KOLs who aren't keen on supporting the project,"" the Humanity Protocol document said. SAFTs (simple agreements for future tokens) are the contracts through which crypto startups pledge their potentially valuable tokens to backers, including VCs, angels and KOLs.  Flashback to 2017 | SAFT Arrives: 'Simple' Investor Agreement Aims to Remove ICO Complexities  A spokesperson for Humanity Protocol declined to comment.  In one recentvideo, a presenter for the YouTube channel Altcoin Buzz, which has 419,000 subscribers, touted Humanity Protocol's ""huge competitive advantage"" over Worldcoin. Altcoin Buzz employee Shitij Gupta shared the video in a private Telegram channel maintained by Humanity Protocol (dubbed ""Humanity Protocol - KOLs""), two eyewitnesses said. KOLs are asked to join the channel after filling out an ""alignment"" form that CoinDesk reviewed.  Contacted by CoinDesk, Gupta said ""Altcoin Buzz has not invested in Humanity,"" and that he is in the private KOL channel on Telegram ""because we want to get information on the project.""  He did not rule out receiving future compensation (""not yet,"" he said, when asked about pay) but said Altcoin Buzz would disclose any ""sponsorship.""  Crypto companies often give their VCs and angels equity. KOLs seldom get shares in the company. Instead they get tokens: a stake in the decentralized crypto network that the company is building.  Tokens are where the money is in crypto, anyway. Humanity Protocol wrote in its undated KOL document that its rival Worldcoin had a fully-diluted valuation (the sum total of all its WLD tokens) of $80 billion.  Tokens are also easier to sell than equity. Among crypto startups' private investors, few have a faster path to selling them than KOLs.  Evolution of KOLs  Influencers began monetizing their followings BitBoy-style years ago. The old pay-to-play model still hits.  ""KOLs can charge tens of thousands just for one tweet,"" a general partner at one VC said. ""They are probably one of the most lucrative businesses"" in crypto.  The startup world is a haven of ""angels"": deep-pocketed (often well-known) investors who write small checks for startups, lending cash and credibility. They're influencers – KOLs in their own right. Sometime last year angels and KOLs began to converge. Then the convergence accelerated.  By 2024, it wasn't just headliners joining KOL rounds but ""anyone with a pulse"" who had many thousands of followers, quipped one high-ranking employee at a crypto startup.  ""The funny fact is that 75% of more-or-less well-known TGEs that took place since the beginning of the year had KOL rounds,"" estimated Stacy Muur, an influencer with 46,000 followers who, over text messages, said she does not engage in these deals. (TGEs are token generation events).  According to research conducted by market intelligence firm The Tie, which tracks token prices as well as KOL activity on social media, influencers regularly move the crypto markets.  ""They definitely have an impact,"" CEO Joshua Frank said of KOLs, adding they likely have outsize influence on cryptos with smaller market caps.  'A quick buck'  KOL rounds have essentially become a vehicle for projects to fund their marketing without having to pay for anything out of pocket. Instead, they bring dozens of influencers to their cap table.  ""I think it's better kuz then the influencers have real skin in the game, they buy their share,"" one prolific investor with tens of thousands of followers wrote in a text message.  Their incentive alignment isn't always built to last. Participants in KOL rounds often get a good chunk of their tokens unlocked on token launch day, meaning they can sell as soon as the token debuts.  ""Right now the trend is that nobody accepts more vesting than 12 months,"" said Matas Čepulis, an executive at the car-focused metaverse project OBS World and associate at the marketing firm KOL HQ. ""Everybody wants to make a quick buck.""  An AI-focused crypto project called Creator.Bid is letting its KOLs access as much as 23% of their BID token allocation on May 15, when the public gets its airdrop, according to terms circulating among investors. A second called Veggies Gotchi is giving KOLs the same number of tokens as its selling to the community, according to its documents. Neither project commented.  Citizend, a token launch platform that's about to hold a community token sale, is giving KOLs a less favorable unlock and vesting period than retail buyers, said Julian Leitloff, an advisor to the project. In a text message he said Citizend requires its KOLs to promote the project but leaves disclosures up to them.  ""That is their obligation and nothing we enforce contractually,"" he said.  'Heavy loss for retail'  KOL arrangements are ""a win for protocols, a win for KOLs, but a heavy loss for retail,"" said Muur, the influencer who said she doesn't take these deals. ""These deals are not properly disclosed in most cases, so the community doesn’t know about KOL rounds and its vesting terms,"" she lamented, expressing a sentiment echoed by other insiders.  Because most crypto projects don't consider their tokens to be securities, they don't follow the transparency rules that apply to promoters in stock markets, people in the KOL industry said.  U.S. securities law aside, many KOLs could be violating Federal Trade Commission rules requiring ""clear and conspicuous disclosures,"" said Givner, the Philadelphia-area lawyer. ""The core of the matter is, if you’re receiving compensation to shill about something, it MUST be disclosed so as to not mislead consumers.""  The arrangement leaves retail traders in the dark about KOLs' financial stake and their ability to sell tokens to very people they've been hyping up for launch day.  ""You obviously make your community exit liquidity,"" Muur said.  Weeding out 'garbage'  The KOL economy is only becoming more efficient at extracting value. Multiple crypto marketing agencies said they compiled lists of hundreds of KOLs. For a fee, they link influencers to projects where they can make the most impact.  KOLs, too, are evolving. Smaller ones have started forming into syndicates through which they can leverage better deals in KOL rounds, two people familiar with the practice said.  To be sure, not every crypto project runs a KOL round. One KOL marketing executive said 95% of teams get cut for being ""random bulls**t."" Only the upper tier of projects can raise from influencers, he said. He chalked this up to credibility: If influencers promote obvious flops, they'll lose their audience's trust.  Still, that upper tier floods prospective KOLs with near-incessant pitches. One prolific investor said he gets offers to join KOL rounds ""10x a day."" Virtually all of them require promotions, he said. Almost none of them require disclosures.  Projects themselves can afford to be picky about who they use to promote their wares. Or at least, to try.  ""We curated 100 KOLs, really took our time to weed out the garbage,"" said an executive at one well-known crypto project that recently held a KOL round. ""End result, most not all, just want their token to pump and sell as quickly as possible.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/09/inside-cryptos-kol-economy-influencer-investors-get-special-treatment-in-token-deals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0942b10edf5e8c8248e73bef34f1bd2bd7520e5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390830,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdOgXh,1715275351,Reimagining Female Empowerment in the Age of Digital Influence and Crypto,"In an era where digital natives reign supreme, Gen-Z women are navigating a landscape vastly different from any preceding generation. Born into a world where social networks are as essential as the air they breathe, these individuals wield technology with finesse, utilizing it not only to communicate their identities, engage with others but also to sculpt their public personas.  However, amidst the allure of infinite opportunities and the tantalizing prospect of global connectivity lies a paradox: while Gen-Z women are adept at leveraging technology to enhance their personal brands, they may be inadvertently neglecting a crucial opportunity to effect positive change in society.  Stefania Barbaglio is the founder of public and investor relations company Cassiopeia.  For many young women of this generation, the digital realm serves as both a canvas and a stage. Social media platforms offer a medium through which they can curate their image, projecting an idealized version of themselves to the world without the need for physical alteration. With the rise of influencer culture, these individuals find themselves thrust into the spotlight, their online personas meticulously crafted to garner attention, recognition and status.  Yet, in the pursuit of visibility and validation, are they overlooking the broader implications of their digital influence?  The proliferation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has only served to amplify this phenomenon. For some young women, their digital avatars or profile pictures serve as more than just a representation of self; they are symbols of status within specific online communities. However, in their quest for belonging and recognition, are they sacrificing genuine connections for fleeting virtual validation?  Indeed, the sense of community fostered by online interactions can be both empowering and isolating. While digital networks offer the promise of global connectivity, relationships formed in this virtual realm may lack the depth and authenticity of their real-world counterparts. As interactions become increasingly mediated by screens, the nuances of human connection risk being lost in translation.  Moreover, while the digital landscape presents boundless opportunities for self-expression and entrepreneurship, it also reflects and perpetuates existing disparities. Women remain underrepresented in industries such as finance and technology, and the world of crypto is no exception.  Despite the democratization of technology and access, systemic barriers persist, hindering the full participation of women in these male-dominated spaces.  See also: Women Who Web3  Amid these challenges lies a unique opportunity for Gen-Z women to rewrite the narrative. With the power of technology at their fingertips, they possess the tools to dismantle patriarchal structures and create a more inclusive future. The time is ripe for them to seize this opportunity, to harness their collective voices and drive meaningful change.  However, as we navigate this pivotal moment in history, it is essential to ask: do Gen-Z women truly grasp the magnitude of the opportunity before them? Are they cognizant of the power they wield as agents of change, or are they too preoccupied with crafting the perfect Instagram post?  While the allure of digital influence may be intoxicating, it is imperative that Gen-Z women recognize their capacity to effect real-world change. By leveraging their online platforms not only to cultivate their personal brands but also to advocate for social justice and gender equality, they can redefine what it means to be empowered in the digital age.  The women of Gen-Z stand at a crossroads, poised to shape the future in ways unimaginable to previous generations. It is incumbent upon them to embrace their potential as catalysts for change, to transcend the confines of virtual validation and embark on a journey toward meaningful impact.  For in the convergence of technology and empowerment lies the promise of a more equitable and inclusive world for all.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Stefania Barbaglio,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/09/reimagining-female-empowerment-in-the-age-of-digital-influence-and-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06df9cfae619b4740aafef430173350f528cfa2c-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This significant event could catalyze notable shifts in market dynamics, steering the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in the near term. Notably, Options contracts in the crypto sphere allow traders to hedge against price volatility or speculate on future price movements without directly holding the assets. Typically structured as either calls or puts, these contracts enable buying (call) or selling (put) at predetermined prices within a specified timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Make-Or-Break Moment: Trading Guru Predicts Rally Amid Market Uncertainty As the expiry date approaches, movements within these contracts tend to introduce heightened volatility into the market, given the adjustments traders make to hedge their positions or capitalize on anticipated price movements. Market Mechanics And Sentiment Indicators The mechanics of options trading offer insights into market sentiment, primarily through analyzing the put/call ratio. This ratio gauges the market’s bullish or bearish stance, depending on whether the volume of call options (betting on price rises) outweighs put options (betting on price drops) or vice versa. Presently, the put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin stands at a relatively low 0.5, suggesting a bullish sentiment as more traders bet on rising prices with the maximum pain point—a price level causing maximum trader losses—at about $61,000 and a notional value of $1.4 billion. In contrast, Ethereum’s options market is also teeming with activity, marked by the upcoming expiry of contracts valued at around $1 billion. With a put-to-call ratio of 0.37, the sentiment leans even more bullish than Bitcoin, indicating stronger trader confidence in Ethereum’s price performance. Ethereum’s designated maximum pain point sits at $3,000, aligning with key psychological and technical support levels.

This is attributed to the large-scale repositioning by institutional and retail investors in anticipation of or in response to the expiry outcomes.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin appears to be recovering from the recent downturn with a 5.4% increase in the past day, momentarily piercing the $60,000 mark, signaling a potential resumption of its upward march. Similarly, Ethereum has shown resilience, climbing above the $3,000 threshold with a modest 3% gain. These upticks coincide with broader market analyses like that of Marco Johanning, a well-known crypto analyst and founder of The Summit Club, suggesting that foundational bullish sentiments remain intact despite recent corrections.

42390839,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdOhCj,1715274000,"Math Olympian in Shadow of John Nash Tries to Solve Blockchain, AI Trust Dilemma","In mathematics, Jasper Zhang figures to be a sort of Zeus. He says he won gold medals at math olympiads in China and Russia, and it took him just two years to get a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley.  Now he's trying his hand at solving a key problem at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing but most complicated areas – blockchain and AI.  Jasper Zhang is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus Festival, May 29-31, in Austin, Texas.  Hyperbolic, the two-year-old startup that Zhang leads focused on decentralized AI computing, said Thursday that it is introducing a protocol called “Proof of Sampling (PoSP),” aimed at addressing challenges with trust in decentralized AI networks.  Hyperbolic was co-founded in 2022 by Zhang and Yuchen Jin, who holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Washington.  The concept for the new protocol was created in conjunction with researchers from Berkeley and Columbia University, according to the team. It combines math, computer science and economics, deploying “advanced sampling methods and game theory to incentivize integrity and minimize computational demands across decentralized networks,” Hyperbolic shared in a press release with CoinDesk.  Zhang, 28, said in an interview with CoinDesk that he sees PoSP as the next iteration of verification for decentralized networks.  “People in the beginning thought there's only one way to do verification, which is with consensus,"" Zhang said. ""Later on people discover optimistic proving and then ZK proofs.”  Now there's PoSP, he said, and it can not only be applied to AI, but also to rollups, a type of layer-2 blockchain, as well as so-called actively validated services (AVSs), which are protocols secured by restaking protocols like EigenLayer.  A research paper on the Proof of Sampling Protocol by Zhang and several co-authors was submitted on May 1 to arXiv, an open-access repository hosted by Cornell University for scientific papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed.  According to the paper, the design relies on a ""pure strategy Nash Equilibrium."" That refers to a game theory concept attributed to the Princeton University-educated mathematician John Nash, who was the subject of the 2001 Oscar-winning film A Beautiful Mind, directed by Ron Howard and starring Russell Crowe.  Here's a figure from the paper illustrating the architecture:  As part of the release, Hyperbolic is introducing “spML,” an implementation of PoSP built specifically for AI verification.  ""SpML leverages the foundational principles of PoSP to create a verification mechanism that is not only faster and more secure but also economically feasible,"" Zhang said in the press release.

42390829,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdOgcp,1715272064,Prometheum's Contentious Answer to Crypto Compliance Is Running Late,"Prometheum has fallen several weeks behind the date it said the business would open for crypto custody, and its CEO said the company is trying to finish technology related to its wallet system before launching.  The firm has said it'll begin holding crypto securities for clients before starting its trading operations.  Much of the crypto sector has been apprehensive about the ribbon cutting on Prometheum's custody and trading operations, which the firm said will fully comply with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) demands. The doors have so far stayed shut well past the target date, but the company explained it's still finishing a process for auditing smart contracts.  ""We expect completion soon and will move towards the launch of our custodial services for institutional clients imminently thereafter,"" said Prometheum Inc.'s co-CEO Benjamin Kaplan, in a statement to CoinDesk.  Prometheum is a crypto-native startup that's the first to get a special-purpose broker dealer approval under SEC regulations and is now licensed to hold, trade and clear transactions in crypto securities. Its executives had originally said they'd have a custody operation rolling in the first quarter of this year – a date now more than five weeks past. But Kaplan said the firm is ""excited to be nearing the public launch of its custodial services for institutional clients.""  ""Building proprietary technology subject to federal securities laws requires us to meet the high standards set by our regulators and expected by our clients,"" he said. ""We have been finalizing a rigorous smart contract auditing process conducted by a leading auditing firm.""  A spokesman, who declined to name the auditing firm, said Prometheum's wallet system uses smart-contract technology. He said ironing that out represents the only significant holdup before opening.  Every week that Prometheum delays is another week that existing businesses wait to find out whether a crypto custodian and broker dealer can hold and trade tokens by treating them – including the marquee asset of Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} – as securities. So far, the SEC hasn't blocked the company's progress through its chain of registrations, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler has even referred to its efforts as a sign of progress.  Prometheum said it intends to provide custody for ether, the second-largest token by market share, and when asked what other tokens the company may handle, the spokesman said the firm doesn't yet have any further asset names to announce.  The wider crypto industry has been embroiled with the SEC in legal battles raging across several federal courts, in which digital assets exchanges and other companies are insisting that the regulator is wrong about its position that most tokens are securities. Prometheum, the first firm to get the special broker-dealer license, represents the contrarian view that Gensler and his agency are right, and many industry insiders and their allies among Republican lawmakers have chastised the company's executives and accused Prometheum of being an SEC pet project.  If Prometheum is correct, it could become a live demonstration of Gensler's view on cryptocurrencies as securities, which he argues belong under the jurisdiction of existing U.S. securities law and SEC oversight. Issuers of securities must be registered with the agency and submit to an array of disclosures and examinations, and the securities themselves must also be registered – requirements that many industry proponents say crypto companies and decentralized organizations would find impossible to meet.  Prometheum's leaders say they intend it to be a one-stop shop where investors – institutional and retail – will one day be able to keep their digital tokens, trade them on its alternative trading system (ATS) and deal in the future of tokenized assets.  It's not yet clear who the company's first customers will be.  ""We cannot say anything regarding specific clients now, but as always Prometheum Capital expects to be used by all ranges of institutions who require compliant access to digital asset securities including institutional investors and traders, asset management firms, family offices, hedge funds, registered investment advisors (RIAs), banks, and financial institutions,"" according to the spokesman.  The company had said its trading operation – the more high-profile test of its business model – was supposed to get started as soon as this second quarter of 2024, though it's unclear whether the custody delay will push off that timeline, too.  Brothers Benjamin and Aaron Kaplan have shared leadership of the company. Co-CEO Aaron Kaplan is set to appear at the Consensus 2024 event later this month.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/09/prometheums-contentious-answer-to-crypto-compliance-is-running-late,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de797788eacd1a9d5d86b901dc9f43759744d7a9-1357x763.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fine compares with the $4.3 billion the crypto exchange agreed to pay U.S. authorities.  Canadian regulators hit Binance with a C$6 million ($4.3 million) fine on Tuesday, alleging the crypto exchange committed two separate “administrative violations” of the country’s financial regulations.  In a Thursday press release, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), the country's financial intelligence unit and top financial regulator, said Binance failed to register as a foreign money services business despite being provided with “several opportunities” to do so.  FINTRAC also said that, between June 1, 2021 and July 19, 2023 Binance failed to report 5,902 crypto transactions bigger than $10,000 and their attached know-your-customer (KYC) information to the regulator. The agency discovered the violations using blockchain explorer tools.  The fine comes just six months after Binance agreed to pay U.S. regulators a $4.3 billion fine for violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws, and a week after former Binance CEO and co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao was sentenced to four months in U.S. prison for failing to set up an adequate KYC/anti-money laundering (AML) program at the exchange.  Binance is also battling financial regulators in Nigeria, where it has been accused of taking Nigerian naira and charged with money laundering and tax evasion. An American Binance executive, Tigran Gambaryan, the head of financial compliance for the exchange, was taken into custody in February and charged with the same crimes.  Earlier this week, Binance CEO Richard Teng called on the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan, and wrote in a blog post that, back in January before Gambaryan’s arrest, “unknown persons” had requested a “significant payment in cryptocurrency” to make the charges go away.

In a letter to shareholders on Tuesday, the firm said Grayscale accounted for $156 million of its first quarter revenue. Thanks to sharp rises in the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}, that amount was about flat from the previous quarter despite heavy redemptions and a reduced management fee following the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.. “While Grayscale expected outflows alongside increased competition under the ETF wrapper, Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC nevertheless exceeded our expectations,” the company said.  Two other DCG notable ventures, crypto mining pool Foundry and investing platform Luno, saw revenue increases of 35% and 46%, respectively.  “The first quarter of 2024 was marked by several exciting developments for our industry, including the approval of Grayscale’s GBTC and spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and bitcoin prices reaching all-time highs in March. Against this backdrop, we are pleased to showcase a strong start to the year for DCG,” the company told shareholders.

While billions flowed into the new vehicles, GBTC, whose management fee of 1.50% was more than 100 basis points above its competitors, experienced billions in outflows.  While the company said that it would eventually lower its fee, it has yet to do so. In the meantime,, Grayscale in March filed for a new product called the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF, which would carry a much lower fee than GBTC.

27406428,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607213,1715270455,Analyst Narrows Down Timeline For Bitcoin Peak This Bull Cycle,"Rekt Capital a popular cryptocurrency expert has set aside the potential timeline that Bitcoin, the largest crypto asset is expected to peak in the ongoing bull cycle, citing historical price trends. Rekt Capital’s analysis examines the current price action of Bitcoin and how it aligns with previous bull cycle peaks following the Bitcoin Halving event. Bitcoin Peak On The Horizon Today, May 9, BTC’s price witnessed a drop below the $61,000 price level, demonstrating a potential move on the downside. However, Rekt Capital is unshaken by this move as he believes the more Bitcoin consolidates between current price levels and $70,000 following the Halving, this cycle will slow down and resynchronize with its regular historically recurrent Halving cycle. As a result, given the price movements of past trends, he expects BTC to see a bull market top between the middle of September and October next year. Related Reading: Historical Trends Unveil Bitcoin Peak Timing in Current Bull Cycle Furthermore, he noted that due to Bitcoin’s current two-month consolidation period, the present rate of cycle acceleration has dropped from 260 days to 210 days. The analyst highlighted that about 518 days after the Halving in the 2015-2017 cycle, BTC reached its market peak. Meanwhile, in the 2019-2021 bull cycle, it took the digital asset approximately 546 days after the Halving to top out. Thus, in the event that BTC reiterates these trends and the next bull market top takes place between 518 and 546 days post-Halving event, Bitcoin’s peak this cycle might occur during the aforementioned timeframes. This is the reason why the expert is confident that the more time Bitcoin takes to stabilize, the better off it will be for bringing this cycle back in alignment with the customary Halving cycle. Possible Retracement Before An Uptrend While the analyst anticipates BTC to experience a retrace large enough to persuade investors that the bull market is over, he urges investors not to be shaken out as it will turn around eventually to resume its upward movement. According to Rekt Capital, fortunate investors understand that there are moments to panic and moments to accumulate and that the two often go hand in hand. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is moving on the downside after a slight recovery on Wednesday. BTC’s price has now fallen close to $60,700 as it was unable to break above $65,500 once more. Related Reading: Bitcoin Peak Pre-Halving Doesn’t Guarantee Further Gains: Analyst At the time of writing, the digital asset in the weekly timeframe is demonstrating a positive momentum, while in the daily timeframe, it is trending on the downside.

42390837,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdOh7b,1715270400,"Crypto for Advisors: DeFi Yields, the Revival","In today’s Crypto for Advisors newsletter, Crews Enochs, from Index Coop discusses the revival of of DeFi Yield and how it will be organic this time. DJ Windle answers questions about DeFi investing in Ask an Expert.  - S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  2024's Revival of DeFi Yields: This Time It's Organic  In past cycles, yields in DeFi have largely been paid in novel, valueless and inflationary governance tokens. The result was initial bursts of unsustainable activity on new protocols and gains for early entrants. Everyone else was left holding the bag.  As digital asset yields have soared in recent months – stablecoin and ETH yield rates hovered above 20%, far exceeding the base rate in traditional finance – some have evinced skepticism about this new cycle of yield farming. But while inflationary dynamics impact current points farming trends, overall the increasing rates are driven by organic and more sustainable demand than in past cycles.  Up until early 2023, liquid staking yield was the benchmark rate for digital assets and the only organic yield left, as borrowing demand dried up during the bear market. While the liquid staking rates exceeded federal funds rate for much of 2022, rate hikes last year rendered liquid staking unattractive. Nevertheless, liquid staking remained a solid organic option for digital asset users who didn’t want to move their capital off-chain.  As market conditions began to improve in Q1, digital asset yields began to climb. At the end of April, enterprising digital asset users could earn over 31% APY on Ethena, Maker moved the DAI savings rate up to 15% and lending protocols Aave and Compound offer 6-10% to lenders.  While these opportunities are undeniably attractive, digital users who recall previous cycles may wonder where these yields come from.  For the most part, stablecoin and ETH yields are sourced from interest paid to lenders by overcollateralized borrowers. Stablecoins in particular are the most liquid and in-demand asset in the digital asset ecosystem, and users are borrowing them to lever up exposure to their favorite asset.  On the higher end of the risk/reward continuum, some of the biggest opportunities come from points speculation. The enthusiasm for EigenLayer points, most notably, has driven up yield rates for lending ETH, as speculators anticipate an EIGEN token airdrop later this month. Interest in a potential Ethena drop has driven demand for stablecoins. While airdrop speculation is undeniably inflationary, borrowers are paying real interest in stablecoins or ETH that lenders can realize as profit now. Read more about Airdrop points here.  Digital asset users who are interested in lending directly to EigenLayer and Ethena points farmers can utilize protocols like Gearbox. Given the extreme enthusiasm for points farming, borrowers are not cost-sensitive and willing to pay upwards of 30-40% to fund their leveraged points farming.  Users who are uncomfortable lending against exotic new assets, like Ethena’s sUSDe or liquid restaking tokens,can lend via tried-and-true protocols like Compound and Aave. The Ethena and EigenLayer assets have not been onboarded as collateral for Aave and Compound, where ETH, staked ETH, and USDC remain the primary forms of collateral. Nevertheless, Aave and Compound have enjoyed the second-order effects of the interest in points farming, as well as overall price improvements in Q1.  Regardless of platform or protocol, all lending in crypto is overcollateralized, mitigating risk for lenders. That said, lenders do run the risk that borrowing could dry up on whatever protocol they use, resulting in lower yields.  Overall, market watchers anticipate that speculative fervor will drive borrowing demand through the next few quarters. Given the cost-insensitivity of borrowers participating in leveraged points farming and other speculative investments, the opportunities for lenders are significant. While conservative digital asset users are understandably concerned about unsustainable yields, current lending infrastructure better isolates risk. For digital asset users who are uncomfortable engaging directly with novel primitives, lending offers an opportunity to benefit from borrower enthusiasm.  –Crews Enochs, Ecosystem Growth Lead, Index Coop  Ask an Expert  Q. How might new government regulations affect DeFi investing?  As DeFi platforms mature, government oversight is expected to increase. This could lead to the implementation of standardized regulatory frameworks, which may include stricter KYC and AML policies. While these measures are designed to protect investors and prevent illicit activities, they could also limit the anonymity and flexibility that many DeFi users currently enjoy. For the average investor, this means a safer but potentially more cumbersome investment process.  Q. What changes with traditional banks' get involved in DeFi?  The involvement of traditional financial institutions in DeFi could bring a blend of innovation and stability to the ecosystem. Banks can provide expertise in risk management and access to a broader customer base, which could lead to more capital flowing into DeFi. However, this might also result in lower yields due to the conservative nature of traditional banking.  Q. Do DAO's impact DeFi yields and security?  DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are integral to the governance of many DeFi protocols, offering a level of transparency and community involvement not seen in traditional finance. They allow stakeholders to vote on key decisions, including those affecting yield rates and security measures. This can lead to more aligned interests between users and developers, potentially resulting in more robust and user-centric platforms.  - D.J.

If the SEC denies approval of spot ether ETFs it will likely face a legal challenge and lose, the report said.  JPMorgan said the lack of approval this month is not a huge disappointment as it was widely expected by the market.  The Well’s Notice issued to trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should not pose an obstacle to the eventual approval of spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs), JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  The popular trading platform received the notice – a preliminary warning from the regulator about potential enforcement action – on May 4, the company said in a filing on Monday. The notice should be viewed as a “continued attempt by the SEC to reinforce its position that all crypto tokens outside bitcoin and ether should be classified as securities,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  JPMorgan said the SEC's legal actions against crypto exchanges appears to be an attempt by the agency to influence U.S. policy makers and legislators, who will be responsible for passing crypto market regulations at some point.  “The Wells Notice against Uniswap and Metamask makes it clear that decentralized platforms are not exempted from the SEC’s objective to eventually supervise most of the crypto industry,” the report added.  The bank noted that Robinhood offers trading on 13 crypto tokens outside bitcoin and ether. The trading platform reported strong first-quarter earnings yesterday driven by a surge in crypto trading. This fueled a 40% year-on-year jump in revenue.  The lack of approval of a spot ether ETF this month is unlikely to be a huge disappointment to markets as it was expected, and this is implied by the significant discount to net asset value (NAV) of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), the report said.  “The template is likely to be similar to bitcoin {{BTC}}: with futures based ether ETFs already approved, the SEC (if it denies the approval of spot ether ETFs) is likely to face a legal challenge and eventually lose,” the analysts wrote.

This led to less ETH being burned, thus reversing its status as a deflationary asset.  Ethereum's recent Dencun upgrade, which was designed to reduce fees and help scale the network, has caused ether {{ETH}} to revert back to an inflationary asset -- potentially reversing one of the key benefits of the 2022 Merge.  A CryptoQuant report reveals that Dencun has made transaction fees on Ethereum on average four times lower than they were before, but this also means that the amount of ETH getting burned has declined to one of the lowest levels since the Merge and supply is growing at the fastest rate since 2022.  The Merge in 2022 saw Ethereum transition from a proof-of-work blockchain to proof-of-stake. This worked in tandem with a prior London upgrade that implemented a mechanism that burned a portion of transactions fees (the base fee), this effectively removed ETH from circulation and caused deflationary pressure.  Dencun, the most recent upgrade, implemented ""danksharding,"" which improved block storage and made layer-2 networks cheaper.  Ether was a deflationary asset following the Merge, with the total supply of the token dropping from 120.491 million to 120.097 million since September 2022. However, the total amount of fees burned decoupled from network activity following Dencun, meaning that the natural increase in supply is outpacing the amount burned in fees.

This 6,350% spike in long liquidations is likely due to XRP’s recent price action, highlighting the general sentiment in its ecosystem. $1.27 Million In Longs Get Liquidated Data from Coinglass shows that $1.27 million in long positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours. This is massive in comparison to the $19,220 liquidated in short positions during this period. This occurrence was likely due to the 3.85% drop in XRP’s price, as the crypto token dropped to as low as $0.51 in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Suffers Massive Outflows Amid Crypto Market Uncertainty, Tops $284 Million XRP’s price decline during this period is believed to have been caused by the sharp correction in Bitcoin’s price, with the flagship crypto dropping below $62,000 again. However, there also seems to be a bearish sentiment in the XRP ecosystem, as data in the XRP derivatives market shows that trading volume has dropped by over 26%. Meanwhile, options trading volume has also dropped by over 46%. These figures suggest that XRP investors are choosing to remain on the sidelines, seeing as the bears look to have the upper hand at the moment. However, the bright spot is that there has been an uptick in open interest, which means some bulls are still willing to bet on the crypto token. These bulls might have a good reason to gamble on the crypto token, seeing as crypto analysts are predicting significant moves for XRP. Specifically, crypto analyst Jonathan Carter recently predicted that XRP could rise to $0.93 and further to $1.68. There is also the feeling that a rally is long overdue for XRP and could be anytime soon. When The XRP Rally Could Come An XRP rally could be on the horizon with the legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple almost coming to an end, with a ruling expected soon enough. Crypto analyst JackTheRippler predicted that the crypto token could rise to as high as $100 once this case ends. Related Reading: Fundstrat CEO Predicts When Bitcoin Price Will Reach $150,000 And $500,000 While this price level is undoubtedly ambitious, XRP could still make a significant move to the upside, considering that it also enjoyed an upward trend on the back of Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling that the crypto token wasn’t a security.

Dogecoin (DOGE) prices dipped this week after news broke of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issuing a Wells Notice to Robinhood, a popular crypto exchange. The notice, a precursor to potential enforcement action, alleges Robinhood violated multiple securities laws. This sent shockwaves through the crypto community, with many investors, particularly those holding large amounts of DOGE (often nicknamed “whales”), pulling their funds out of Robinhood. Related Reading: $20 On The Horizon For XRP? Unpacking A Potential 650x Surge And What It Means The most significant outflow involved a whopping 164 million DOGE, worth roughly $25 million at the time, being transferred out of the exchange. This mass withdrawal by a whale investor likely contributed to the market jitters surrounding DOGE. 🚀🐕 Another 164M $DOGE, worth $25M, have been transferred out of Robinhood. These transactions occurred after the platform received a Wells notice from the SEC. #DOGE #Robinhood #CryptoNews Source: MartyParty pic.twitter.com/oKxW1S8pTD — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 8, 2024 DOGE Price Wobbles: Short-Term Blues Or Long-Term Woof? The price of DOGE tumbled 5.8% in the 24 hours following the Robinhood news. However, analysts caution against a knee-jerk reaction. While the legal troubles undoubtedly cast a shadow on Robinhood, the DOGE outflow, including the 164 million transfer, might not be the sole culprit behind the price dip. Transferring cryptocurrency from an exchange to a personal wallet is often seen as a bullish move, indicating an intention to hold for the long term. Dogecoin And Bitcoin: A Tale Of Two Blockchains Another factor influencing DOGE’s price is its tight correlation with Bitcoin (BTC). Both currencies operate on the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which some see as outdated compared to newer, energy-efficient models. The recent pullback in the broader crypto market, especially in Bitcoin, likely played a role in dragging DOGE down as well. DOGE market cap currently at $20.7 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Rocky Road To $0.20? DOGE Faces Support Hurdle DOGE enthusiasts were eyeing a price target of $0.20, but the recent drop presents a roadblock. The memecoin dipped below the crucial $0.15 support level, raising concerns about a further decline. Analysts point to a potential support zone between $0.143 and $0.146, but a fall below that could trigger a more significant price correction. Bullish Signs Amidst The Dip Despite the short-term pessimism, there are glimmers of hope for DOGE. The buy orders for DOGE currently outweigh sell orders by a significant margin, suggesting continued investor interest. Related Reading: Forget The Price Dip: Ethereum Network Activity Hints At Imminent Takeoff Additionally, the memecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a neutral 47, indicating there’s room for new buyers to enter the market. Furthermore, DOGE managed to maintain a weekly price increase despite the daily drop, hinting at underlying resilience. Doge Day Delayed, But Not Doomed The coming weeks will be crucial for Dogecoin. The outcome of Robinhood’s legal battle with the SEC and DOGE’s ability to regain lost ground will determine its short-term trajectory. However, long-term forecasts for the memecoin remain cautiously optimistic.

The tokenization of real-word assets has been gathering momentum in recent months.  AgriDex, a Solana-based tokenization platform, said it raised $5 million to bring agricultural commodities on-chain.  The pre-seed funding round included investments from Endeavour Ventures, sub-Sarahan African agricultural group African Crops and South African vineyard group Oldenburg Vineyards, the company said by email on Thursday.  AgriDex allows various crops to be bought on its marketplace. When finalized, deals are then secured by minting a non-fungible token (NFT) recording the key transaction details.  The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is an area of the crypto industry that has been gathering momentum in recent months. A report by CoinGecko found RWAs to be the second most profitable narrative in first quarter, offering 286% in returns, albeit a distant second to the 1,313% offered by meme coins.  Tokenization of RWAs has generally been more focused on assets such as stocks, bonds and metal commodities like gold.

27374369,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607175,1715259615,EU Watchdog Considers Crypto Integration Into $12.88 Trillion Investment Market,"Europe’s securities regulator is seeking input from stakeholders on the potential inclusion of crypto assets in a potentially massive market. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing financial markets within the European Union, has recently initiated a comprehensive review of the regulations surrounding the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Eligible Assets Directive (EAD). This move could potentially enable the integration of cryptocurrencies into a vast investment market valued at approximately €12 trillion (roughly $12.88 trillion). On May 7, 2024, ESMA released a Call for Evidence seeking input from various stakeholders to assess the viability and implications of allowing UCITS to include a broader array of asset classes, notably cryptocurrencies. The UCITS framework, central to EU retail investment, accounts for around 75% of all retail investment in collective funds within the region. With its global reputation for strict regulation and investor protection, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies could represent a transformative shift in the investment landscape. The Next Big Catalyst For Crypto? ESMA’s review aims to address the evolving financial landscape, where the number and variety of financial instruments have expanded significantly since the UCITS framework was established nearly two decades ago. This expansion has led to uncertainties in determining asset eligibility, causing divergent interpretations and applications of the directive across member states. Sean Tuffy, a financial regulation expert, underscored the significance of this development to DL News, stating, “If ESMA is convinced, it would be the final step in mainstreaming crypto assets in Europe,” referring to it as a potential “game changer.” This sentiment is echoed by industry experts who believe that the inclusion of crypto assets could provide a robust alternative to traditional investment options, potentially enhancing portfolio diversification and returns. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Discuss Why Memecoins Have Been 2024’s Most Profitable Narrative The Call for Evidence targets a broad audience, including investors, consumer groups, UCITS management companies, self-managed UCITS investment companies, depositaries, and trade associations. These stakeholders are invited to share their insights on market practices, interpretative issues, and practical application concerns related to the eligibility criteria and other provisions of the UCITS EAD. One of the critical areas of focus is the transversal consistency of key notions and definitions used in the UCITS EAD with other pieces of legislation in the EU Single Rulebook. This alignment is crucial to ensure that any new asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies, are integrated smoothly and consistently across all regulatory frameworks. Andrea Pantaleo, a lawyer specializing in crypto regulation, highlighted several potential benefits and challenges. He told DL News, “UCITS funds have specific investment limitations depending on the type of assets. We won’t have a 100% crypto UCITS fund, but hopefully many investment funds could hold 1-2% of their liquidity in crypto.” Related Reading: This Week’s Crypto Watchlist: Top Coins Poised For Gains However, he also pointed out a significant obstacle: the coordination of custody regulations, which must align with the EU’s upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA). MiCA is set to establish stringent rules for the segregation of assets and policies for their safekeeping, which will be pivotal in the custody of crypto assets. The potential inclusion of cryptocurrencies in UCITS comes at a time when other major economies, such as the US and Hong Kong, have begun integrating crypto assets into their financial products, notably through the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. These developments have not only validated the financial viability of cryptocurrencies but have also spurred significant investment inflows into the sector. The ESMA consultation process is set to conclude on August 7, 2024, after which the watchdog will compile the feedback and develop its technical advice to the European Commission. This advice will play a crucial role in determining whether cryptocurrencies will be included in the UCITS framework, potentially heralding a new era for crypto investment in Europe. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.202 trillion.

The firm has doubled its loan book since November 2022.  The rise was attributed to spot bitcoin ETF approval in the U.S.  Crypto lending firm Ledn processed more than $690 million in loans in the first quarter, its most successful quarter since the company's inception in 2018, almost five times the value of the previous three months.  The vast majority, more than 84%, was directed to institutions, with demand ballooning after the approval of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January as several hundred million dollars worth of loans was issued to ETF market makers, Ledn said in a press release. In fourth-quarter 2023, the firm issued $140.3 million of loans, 90% of which went to institutional borrowers.  ""The first quarter of 2024 has set the tone for a promising year for Ledn, as we've not only doubled our loan book since November 2022 but have also solidified our leading position in the market by adapting to the increasing demand for digital asset financial products,"" CEO Adam Reeds said in a statement.  The crypto lending sector imploded in 2022 alongside dwindling asset prices, spurring lenders including Celsius, BlockFi and Genesis to file for bankruptcy. Centralized lenders such as Ledn are only just starting to shake off negative sentiment left by their demise. Lending in decentralized finance (DeFi), meantime, continued to boom, with the likes of Aave accumulating $10 billion in total value locked (TVL).  Among other centralized lenders, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said loans to institutional customers grew to $399 million in fourth-quarter 2023. That was before the ETF approvals. Ledn said it loaned $100 million to retail customers in the first quarter, $40 million of which was refinanced from the collapse of Celsius.  In December the firm rolled out a crypto-backed loan product that allows customers to receive a loan by pledging crypto as collateral, which is then custodied by BitGo.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/09/ledn-first-quarter-loans-top-690m-as-lending-market-snaps-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/583f838387ecc43c3a3cd1fd9eb8ad3c7c0b3e29-4562x2566.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell below $61,000 on Thursday as the crypto market continued its downward movement that has persisted throughout the week. BTC dipped to $60,815 at around 11:00 UTC, trading about 2.25% lower than 24 hours before. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the performance of the broader digital asset market, meanwhile has sunk by about 2%. Ether is trading just below $3,000, down 0.9%, while SOL has declined by nearly 3%. The crypto market could also soon be faced with a wave of supply events delaying a return to upward movement, with nearly $11 billion worth of BTC set to be distributed to creditors of Gemini's Earn program and the long-defunct Mt. Gox, according to cryptocurrency analysts K33.  VanEck subsidiary MarketVector has started an index based on the performance of the top six meme coins. The MarketVector's Meme Coin Index, which trades under the symbol MEMECOIN, is up 195% on a yearly basis. For comparison, the CD20 is up 97% during the same period. MEMECOIN tracks Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, dogwifhat, Floki Inu and BONK, which account for nearly $47 billion of the total meme coin market cap of $51 billion, according to CoinGecko. While they unashamedly represent the lighter side of the cryptocurrency market, some commentators believe that meme coins could continue to show impressive returns due to low fees on Solana allowing traders to make small bets for potentially large profits.  The 'Boden' meme coin surged on Wednesday following a throwaway comment from former President Donald Trump. Jeo Boden (BODEN), the joke crypto token referring to a misspelling of President Biden's name, jumped after Trump said he didn't like it as an investment. The Republican challenger for the White House was hosting an impromptu Q&A session at the Trump Cards NFT Gala in Florida when he was asked about BODEN. The token jumped as high as $0.42 before retreating below $0.40 over the ensuing hours. At the time of writing, it is priced at around $0.36, up nearly 16% in the last 24 hours. Trump also said he intends to start accepting donations for his presidential campaign in cryptocurrency.  Chart of the Day  The table shows bitcoin and ether's correlation with major equity indices, the dollar index and the VIX index.

27374367,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607179,1715254212,"Bitcoin Whales Lose Interest, Is This A Precursor For A Crash To $50,000?","Movement and accumulation from crypto whales are two of the catalysts for Bitcoin price increases. Although major whales are still buying the dip, on-chain data indicates a general waning accumulation momentum which suggests their conviction might actually be waning. According to IntoTheBlock, an on-chain analytics firm, Bitcoin whale accumulation volumes have declined substantially in each buying cycle over the past month. This decline in whale accumulation could be worrying for investors, especially as the price of Bitcoin is now trying to hold above $60,000. Whale Appetite For Bitcoin Dips According To On-Chain Data Whales, or large investors holding over 1,000 BTC, have accumulated strongly since the beginning of the year, especially during market dips. This accumulation has largely helped to keep Bitcoin in bullish sentiment and prevented huge price declines. However, IntoTheBlock recently revealed an interesting pattern between these whale wallets in each accumulation phase. Related Reading: Cardano Entry Of A Lifetime: Analyst Predicts 5,600% Rally To $25 The largest accumulation occurred between March 5 and March 7, when these wallets acquired over 120,000 BTC. Every succeeding price dip has, however, seen less accumulation than the one before it. Particularly, Bitcoin’s recent dip to $56,000 failed to attract notable whale accumulation. This drop in buying and selling activity indicates whales may have lost some interest or appetite for accumulating more Bitcoin in the short term. Whales are buying the dip, but is their conviction dwindling? 🛍️Addresses holding over 1000 BTC have accumulated strongly in recent months, especially during dips. 📈Prices have increased shortly following every accumulation. However, note that each spike in accumulation by… pic.twitter.com/OkbekJr5NC — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) May 6, 2024 Precursor For A Crash To $50,000? The waning conviction among Bitcoin whales has raised the question of whether Bitcoin could reverse back into a full bearish momentum. These concerns are particularly valid, considering some analysts are of the notion that Bitcoin might’ve reached its peak in this cycle. As IntoTheBlock noted, prices have increased shortly following every accumulation this year. While the lower whale buying activity could stall price increases in the short term, it is not a sure sign that Bitcoin is headed for a major price crash. However, if the trend continues for several more months, it could signal lower demand and a weakening bull market.

A drop below this range again would push 552,220 addresses into losses. In fact, while a drop to his level would be painful for many holders, most crypto analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,488. The crypto recently rebounded around $57,500 and is up by 7.4% in the past seven days. According to analyst Marco Johanning, $57,000 is an important support level for Bitcoin. He noted that while a break below $57,000 could lead to further declines into $52,000, the crypto market is still very bullish for Bitcoin.

The team had submitted a report identifying manipulation of various tokens by Binance client DWF Labs.  Binance fired a member of staff who uncovered evidence of market manipulation at crypto investment firm DWF Labs, one of cryptocurrency exchange's clients, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing interviews with Binance employees past and present, documents, emails and other industry participants.  The former staffer and his colleagues on Binance's market-surveillance team had been hired to winkle out signs of market manipulation and other nefarious activities as part of the exchange's efforts to clean up its act in the face of scrutiny from financial regulators.  The team found that ""VIP"" clients – those trading more than $100 million per month – were engaging in pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading that were prohibited by Binance's terms and conditions, according to the WSJ article.  DWF Labs, which was making more than $4 billion in monthly trades, emerged as a prolific investor in crypto projects in early 2023 when it was at the center of a stream of funding rounds in an otherwise sedate market. Differing from the traditional venture capital model, the firm, whose founders made their money as crypto high-frequency traders, generally bought millions of dollars worth of a project's token at a discount and benefited when the price rose.  The Binance investigators submitted a report alleging DWF had manipulated the price of several tokens on the back of $300 million of wash trades in 2023, but Binance deemed there was insufficient evidence of market abuse, the WSJ said. A week after the report's submission, the head of the team was fired, according to the newspaper.  Binance told the WSJ it rejected claims it had permitted market manipulation, and the person was dismissed after an inquiry found the allegations against the client weren't ""fully substantiated.""  After the article was published, DWF Labs said in a posting on X that the allegations about it were ""unfounded and distort the facts.""  Binance also responded, without relating to the member of staff's dismissal. ""We do not tolerate market abuse,"" it said in an X post. ""Over the last three years, we have offboarded nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of more than $2.5 trillion for violating our terms of use.""

27349536,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607189,1715251064,Binance Megadrop vs. Traditional Airdrops: What’s the Difference?,"In the world of cryptocurrencies, the allure of obtaining digital assets at no cost is a powerful draw. Airdrops, a concept as intriguing as it sounds, serve as one of the primary methods through which crypto projects distribute their tokens freely to a broad audience. These events not only enrich individual portfolios but also enhance the token’s distribution and visibility across the market. However, as the crypto landscape evolves, so too do the methods of engaging users and distributing tokens. Enter Binance Megadrop, an innovative approach pioneered by one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, Binance. This new platform reimagines the traditional airdrop mechanism by integrating it with features that enhance user engagement through tasks and deeper interaction with the projects involved. Binance Megadrop’s inaugural project is BounceBit , a platform that marks a significant departure from conventional airdrops. BounceBit introduces users to a BTC restaking chain with a comprehensive CeDefi framework, aiming to transform BTC from a passive asset into an actively managed stake within the ecosystem. But how Binance Megadrop and Traditional Aidrops compare? Let’s dive deeper. Understanding Traditional Airdrops A traditional airdrop in the cryptocurrency world involves the free distribution of new tokens to the wallets of existing cryptocurrency holders. These airdrops serve multiple purposes: Help to drive awareness Increase the distribution of the new token Broadens the user base and increase liquidity Generate buzz and attract new investors to the project Types of AirdropsStandard/Raffle Airdrops These are the most basic form of airdrops, where tokens are randomly distributed to the community members who sign up or fulfill certain simple conditions, such as joining a Telegram channel or following the project on social media. The appeal of standard airdrops lies in their simplicity and the minimal effort required from participants. Bounty Airdrops Unlike standard airdrops, bounty airdrops require participants to perform specific tasks, which may include content creation, social media promotion, or technical contributions like bug reporting. This type of airdrop aims to foster more significant engagement and contribution from the community, making the airdrop part of a broader campaign to build the project. Holder/Exclusive Airdrops These airdrops target existing holders of a particular cryptocurrency. Tokens are distributed based on the amount and duration of holding another specific token. This method is used to reward loyal supporters and maintain or even increase their holdings without requiring additional investment. Benefits and Drawbacks for Recipients and Developers Benefits for Recipients: Free Tokens : The most apparent benefit is receiving free tokens, which might appreciate in value over time. Exposure to New Projects : Airdrops provide an opportunity to explore and invest in new projects without financial risk. Incentive to Learn : For newcomers, airdrops can serve as an incentive to learn more about how cryptocurrencies and wallets work. Drawbacks for Recipients: Tax Implications : In many jurisdictions, receiving airdrops can be considered taxable income, complicating the recipient’s tax situation. Security Risks : Participation often requires sharing wallet addresses and sometimes more sensitive information, which can be a target for phishing attacks. Benefits for Developers: Marketing Tool : Airdrops can be a powerful marketing tool to boost a project’s visibility and increase token distribution. Community Building : By rewarding the community, developers can foster loyalty and encourage community members to promote the project actively. Drawbacks for Developers: Costly : Distributing free tokens can dilute the value for existing holders if not managed correctly. Short-term Interest : Airdrops might attract participants who are only interested in free tokens and may sell them immediately after receiving them, which could lead to increased volatility or downward pressure on the token price. Introduction to Binance Megadrop Binance Megadrop is a novel token launch platform designed by Binance to transform the conventional airdrop experience. It seamlessly integrates functionalities from Binance Simple Earn and the Binance Web3 Wallet, providing users early access to select Web3 projects before they are officially listed on the Binance exchange. This innovative platform not only facilitates token distribution but also encourages user engagement through a variety of interactive activities and educational content, making it a more immersive experience compared to traditional airdrops. How Binance Megadrop Differs from Traditional Airdrops Binance Megadrop introduces several key innovations that set it apart from traditional airdrop methods: Engagement and Education Unlike traditional airdrops that often require minimal user interaction, Megadrop engages users through interactive tasks and educational content related to the projects. This engagement is designed to ensure that participants are not only passive recipients but also active contributors and learners in the ecosystem. Integrated Platform Megadrop is deeply integrated with other Binance services like Simple Earn and the Web3 Wallet, allowing users to earn additional rewards by staking or locking their assets, and connecting their wallets to participate in Web3 activities. 3. Merit-based Rewards Instead of distributing tokens purely based on chance or basic eligibility criteria, Megadrop rewards users based on their level of participation and the tasks they complete. This merit-based system aims to distribute tokens more fairly and to those who are genuinely interested in contributing to the project’s success. 4. Enhanced User Experience: The Megadrop platform is designed to be user-friendly, providing a clear and straightforward path for users to follow from the moment they log in to when they complete tasks and receive rewards. This simplifies the process and enhances the overall user experience. Integration with Binance Simple Earn and the Binance Web3 Wallet One of the standout features of Binance Megadrop is its integration with Binance Simple Earn and the Binance Web3 Wallet. This integration provides a dual benefit: Binance Simple Earn : By subscribing their BNB or other cryptocurrencies to Binance Simple Earn’s locked products, users can earn interest on their staked assets while simultaneously boosting their score in the Megadrop program. This score determines the quantity of the new tokens they receive, effectively linking their investment to their reward. Binance Web3 Wallet : Participation in Megadrop requires the use of the Binance Web3 Wallet, which facilitates interactions with decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. This requirement ensures that users are equipped to engage with the broader Web3 ecosystem, preparing them for more complex interactions beyond basic token transactions. How Binance Megadrop Works To participate in Binance Megadrop, users must first ensure they are eligible. Eligibility generally depends on several factors, including the user’s jurisdiction and compliance with specific regulatory requirements. It’s crucial for participants to check the Megadrop announcement on the Binance website for details about restricted countries and any other eligibility criteria. Detailed Explanation on How to Access Megadrop on Binance Accessing Megadrop involves several straightforward steps on the Binance platform: Log into Your Binance Account : Users need to have a verified Binance account. If you don’t have one, you will need to create one using this link and verify your account first. Navigate to the Megadrop Section : Once logged in, go to the “More” menu on the Binance interface and find the “ Megadrop ” option. This section will list all the ongoing and upcoming Megadrop projects. Select a Project : Choose a project that is available to view more details about it, including the participation period, reward distribution, and specific conditions for participation. Steps to Participate, Including Locking BNB and Completing Web3 Quests Participation in Binance Megadrop is more interactive and engaging compared to traditional airdrops. Here are the steps involved: Lock BNB in Binance Simple Earn : Navigate to the “Simple Earn” section and find the “Locked Products” options. Choose the amount of BNB you wish to lock and the duration. Locking durations can vary, but longer periods typically provide higher rewards and increase your Megadrop score. It’s advisable to lock BNB for at least 120 days as this not only maximizes your potential rewards but also stabilizes your investment and enhances your commitment to the project. Complete Web3 Quests : After locking your BNB, return to the Megadrop project page and check the available Web3 quests under the “Quest” tab. These quests can range from simple tasks like connecting your Web3 Wallet to more complex activities such as interacting with a project’s protocol or dApp. Follow the instructions for each quest. This might involve reading materials, interacting with smart contracts, or completing specific transactions. Verification and Reward Allocation : After completing the quests, ensure you tap on the “Verify” button on the quest details page. This step is crucial as it confirms your participation and logs your completion of the task. Rewards are calculated based on the total score, which is a combination of your locked BNB score and the points from completed quests. The higher your score, the greater your share of the total token distribution. Monitoring Your Participation : Keep track of your participation and scores through the Megadrop interface on Binance. This dashboard will provide real-time updates and feedback on your activities and the corresponding scores. Receiving Your Tokens : Upon the conclusion of the Megadrop event, tokens will be distributed directly to your Binance spot wallet based on the final calculated score. BounceBit – The First project on Binance Megadrop BounceBit is a pioneering project featured in the Binance Megadrop, designed to enhance the utility of Bitcoin through a restaking chain that leverages a CeDeFi (Centralized Decentralized Finance) framework. The platform offers several core functionalities aimed at enhancing user interaction and the token’s utility: Staking : Users can stake the platform’s native token ($BB) to participate in the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This not only secures the network but also provides stakers with periodic rewards based on their contribution. Protocol Incentive : Validators who help maintain the network integrity by validating transactions and blocks are rewarded with $BB tokens. This incentive ensures that the network remains secure and efficient. Gas : All transactions and smart contract executions on the BounceBit platform require payment of gas fees in $BB tokens, similar to Ethereum’s use of ETH for gas. Governance : $BB token holders can participate in governance decisions, such as voting on protocol upgrades and changes. This democratic approach allows the community to shape the project’s future direction. Currency : Beyond its utility functions, $BB can also be used as a medium of exchange within the platform, facilitating transactions and services between users. BounceBit’s Unique Selling Propositions BounceBit introduces several innovative features that distinguish it from traditional crypto projects: CeDeFi Framework : By blending the best elements of centralized and decentralized finance, BounceBit aims to offer the security and user-friendliness of CeFi along with the transparency and trustlessness of DeFi. This hybrid model is designed to attract a broader range of users, from crypto novices to experienced traders. Dual-Token PoS : Unlike traditional single-token systems, BounceBit’s dual-token PoS mechanism allows for more flexible and robust participation. Validators can receive and stake two types of tokens, which can help diversify the staking rewards and reduce volatility. Liquid Custody : BounceBit also introduces the concept of liquid custody, which allows users to retain liquidity even when their tokens are staked or otherwise engaged. This is achieved through the issuance of custody tokens that can be traded or used for other purposes while the underlying assets are locked. Economic Details: Token Distribution, Supply Details, Megadrop Allocation Token Name : $BB Total Supply : 2,100,000,000 $BB Initial Circulating Supply : 409,500,000 $BB (19.5% of total supply) Binance Megadrop Allocation : 168,000,000 $BB (8% of total supply) The token distribution is carefully planned to support long-term development and community engagement: How to participate in Binance Megadrop with BounceBit This section provides detailed instructions on how to participate in the BounceBit Megadrop on Binance, highlighting the steps involved and the benefits of each action. Stake BNB in FIXED Staking: Benefits of Staking for 120 Days Staking BNB in FIXED staking products on Binance offers several benefits, particularly when opting for a 120-day lock-up period: Higher Interest Rates : Typically, longer staking periods come with higher interest rates, meaning more earnings over the lock-up period. Increased Megadrop Score : For Megadrop participation, the amount of BNB locked and the duration significantly influence your total score, which determines the quantity of rewards you receive. Staking for 120 days maximizes your score potential. Price Stability : Locking your assets can help mitigate the urge to sell during volatile market conditions, potentially leading to better long-term financial decisions. To stake BNB for the BounceBit Megadrop: Navigate to Binance Simple Earn and select “Locked Staking.” Choose BNB from the list of available cryptocurrencies. Select the 120-day option to maximize your potential Megadrop score and confirm your subscription. Keep BTC and BNB on Spot: Importance and Advantages Keeping BTC and BNB in your spot wallet on Binance is strategic for several reasons: Readiness for New Opportunities : Having assets in your spot wallet ensures you are ready to participate in new trading opportunities or other investment options without delay. Flexibility : Easily move your funds between different Binance services, such as trading pairs, without needing to wait for withdrawal and deposit processing times. Participation in Promotions : Binance frequently runs promotions and events that require users to have quick access to certain coins in their spot wallets. Completing Tasks: Participating in Web3 quests and completing tasks as part of the BounceBit Megadrop can significantly enhance your rewards: Task Variety : Tasks may range from social media promotions to more technical activities like interacting with smart contracts or participating in testnets. Earnings Multiplier : Completing these tasks not only contributes to the project but also multiplies your earnings by boosting your Megadrop score. Learning and Engagement : By engaging with these tasks, you gain a deeper understanding of the project and the broader blockchain ecosystem. To complete tasks: Visit the BounceBit page within the Megadrop section. Review available tasks under the “Quests” tab and select one to participate in. Follow the detailed instructions provided for each task to ensure proper completion and verification. Once a task is completed, verify your participation as instructed to ensure your additional earnings are accounted for in the final reward calculation. Summary Binance Megadrop represents a significant evolution in the concept of cryptocurrency airdrops. Unlike traditional airdrops that typically distribute tokens based on simple eligibility criteria like holding a specific cryptocurrency or signing up, Megadrop introduces a more interactive and engaging approach: Engagement and Education : Megadrop requires participants to engage in educational and interactive tasks that deepen their understanding of the project and blockchain technology. Merit-Based Rewards : Rewards in Megadrop are based on the completion of tasks and the duration of asset staking, ensuring that the most engaged and committed participants are rewarded the most. Integration with Binance Services : Megadrop is seamlessly integrated with other Binance services like Simple Earn and the Web3 Wallet, offering a holistic experience that leverages the full ecosystem of Binance. The Impact of Such Innovations on the Crypto Ecosystem The introduction of platforms like Binance Megadrop could have profound implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Increased User Involvement and Retention : By involving participants in tasks that require learning and engagement, Megadrop increases user investment in the success of the projects, leading to higher retention rates and more sustained interest in the crypto projects. Enhanced Market Education : The educational component of Megadrop helps demystify cryptocurrencies for the broader public, potentially leading to increased adoption and understanding of blockchain technologies. Innovation in Token Distribution : Megadrop’s approach could set a new standard for how tokens are distributed, emphasizing active participation and contribution over passive receipt. This could lead to more sustainable project launches and healthier long-term token economics. Binance Megadrop not only refines the process of token distribution but also enriches the participant’s experience by making it more rewarding and educational. Such innovations are crucial as they not only foster a deeper connection between blockchain projects and their communities but also enhance the overall health and maturity of the cryptocurrency market.",POSITIVE,BTC | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | ICO | BNB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/binance-megadrop-vs-traditional-airdrops-whats-the-difference/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/27349536.jpeg

A surge in crypto trading contributed to the 40% year-on-year increase in revenue.  Positive momentum continued into April with a record $5 billion in deposits, the analysts said.  Trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) reported strong first-quarter earnings yesterday as a surge in crypto trading fueled a 40% year-on-year jump in revenue, leading some analysts to upgrade their earnings estimates and price targets.  KBW raised its price target to $21.50 from $20, while maintaining its market perform rating. Rival broker JMP raised its price target to $30 from $28 and reiterated its market outperform rating. The shares, which closed yesterday at $17.85, rose over 4% in early trading on Thursday. They have gained over 40% this year.  A “solid beat in the quarter to us and consensus as stronger than expected crypto trading revenues drove earnings per share (EPS) higher, with lower expenses also contributing a penny to the $0.05 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) beat,” KBW analysts led by Kyle Voigt wrote.  Crypto transaction revenue more than tripled from the year-earlier quarter.  Two other key takeaways were the strong reception by customers to new products such as the platform’s Gold Card, and the business’ EBITDA margin expansion, KBW said.  JMP noted the company “delivered record net new deposits of $11.2 billion (a 44% annualized rate), including positive net flows from every major brokerage, and also 75% of deposits coming from customers that have been on the platform for over one year.”  The popular trading platform added 500,000 new accounts in the quarter, more than in all of last year and the highest quarter for new accounts since first-quarter 2022, JMP said. Positive momentum has continued, with a record $5 billion in deposits in April versus the monthly average of $3.7 billion in the first quarter, the broker noted.  “We expect further acceleration in deposits and new customers, with enhancements to the Gold offering also increasingly contributing,” JMP analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote.  Bernstein said it expects Robinhood “to put up a strong fight against the SEC and not back down on its crypto business.” Robinhood received a Wells Notice – a preliminary warning from the regulator saying it believes it has enough information to bring an enforcement action – on May 4.  “We continue to expect continued customer traction in crypto trading, while regulatory clarity takes its course,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.

42390844,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdOhhV,1715249080,Meme Coin Demand Is Stronger Than Ever With Fast Money Chasing Pepe and WIF: Analyst,"CoinMarketCap registered a record 138 meme coins in April, according to pseudonymous analyst Crypto Coryo.  Fast money has been chasing PEPE and WIF.  The meme coin season continues to march forward, undeterred by the stalled rally in bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Data tracking website CoinMarketCap listed a record 138 meme coins this April, extending the parabolic rise from April 2023's tally of just 18, according to pseudonymous analyst Crypto Coryo. The number could be much higher, as CoinMarketCap reportedly lists only 10% of all tokens, Crypto Coryo said on X.  At press time, 2,229 meme coins were listed on CoinMarketCap, boasting a combined market capitalization of over $50 billion, nearly matching investment banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and U.S. electric car maker Tesla's (TSLA) market value.  That's an impressive feat, as meme coins are often criticized for lacking utility or actual use case and considered a proxy for pure speculation.  ""In principle, people participate in meme coins because (i) the value might go up, (ii) they feel democratic and open for anyone to participate, and (iii) they are fun,"" Vitalik Buterin, founder of leading smart contract blockchain Ethereum, which is also the home to several popular meme coins, said in a blog post.  Arthur Hayes, a co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX and chief investment officer at Maelstrom, favors a deeper understanding of meme coins as a driver of blockchain ecosystem growth.  ""You can poo-poo these things as stupid and valueless, but if it brings attention and more engineers to the space, it's positive value for the chain itself,"" Hayes said in an interview with Real Vision on March 30.  Programmable blockchain Solana, being cheaper and faster than its rival Ethereum, has become the new home for these tokens since late last year. At one point in the first quarter, the meme frenzy led to record network activity on Solana, pushing SOL's price above $200 for the first time since November 2021.  ""Due to high gas fees, degen activity has moved (partially) away from Ethereum. We've seen it with Bonk on Solana and Bald on Base. But Solana is now the home of meme coins,"" Crypto Coryo noted.  Fast money chasing PEPE  Bitcoin's recent dour price action has speculators chasing a popular meme token pepe (PEPE). The token has risen nearly 17% in seven days, becoming the ninth-best-performing cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap's list.  Besides, it has the second-highest perpetual futures open interest (OI) to market capitalization ratio, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko. Dogifwhat (WIF), also a meme coin, has the highest OI-to-market cap ratio.  ""Pepe (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) exhibit twice the ratio relative to other altcoins. A higher ratio indicates that the derivative market positioning for an asset is large compared to its market cap, making price discovery for these tokens more concentrated in perpetual futures markets,"" Kaiko said in the weekly newsletter.

This brought about a lot of talk among traders as they now look at safer options like Rollblock (RBLK). Analysts hint that this Stage 1 presale star could be the next $0.5 token in 2024 and one of the best cryptos to buy. Michael Saylor: Ethereum ETF Will Never Come One of the top crypto coins, Ethereum (ETH), has been in the headlines recently. MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, predicted that the US SEC will dismiss spot Ether ETFs listing and trading applications. Saylor said that he expects this decision because the US CFTC will not be able to supervise Ethereum as a commodity but as a crypto-asset security. This Ethereum news may trigger a bear run for this crypto. Nevertheless, the Ethereum crypto value jumped 60% in the past year alone while its market cap soared to $369B. Additionally, 11 technical indicators are flashing buy signals for Ethereum. Thus, market analysts predict Ethereum will reach a value of $4,137 before Q2 of 2024 ends. Charles Hoskinson Responds to Michael Saylor’s Cardano (ADA) Comments In that same speech, Michael Saylor stated that many other top crypto coins, such as Cardano (ADA), will be treated as crypto asset securities as well. However, the co-founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, responded to this claim. He claims that Michael Saylor is a Bitcoin maximalist who constantly bashes anything that is not Bitcoin. When it comes to the Cardano coin value, it saw an 18% growth in the past 12 months while its market cap held at $16B. Not only that, Cardano is now trading above its 200-day EMA. As a result of all this bullish Cardano news, experts believe it is still a good crypto to buy. They foresee a surge to $0.57 within Q2 of 2024. Pro-Ripple (XRP) Lawyer Bill Morgan Responds to Michael Saylor Michael Saylor also stated that the Ripple (XRP) crypto will be deemed a security. XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has criticized Michael Saylor’s understanding of the cryptocurrency market in response to Saylor’s comments about altcoins. Differentiating between Ripple and XRP, Morgan noted that a court has already ruled that XRP is not a security. This Ripple news may cause a bullish rally for this crypto. In terms of the Ripple coin value movement, it surged 17% on the YTD chart. Furthermore, there are now 15 technical indicators in the green for Ripple. Therefore, market analysts foresee Ripple hitting a value of $0.62 before Q2 of 2024 ends. Rollblock (RBLK): Among the Best Cryptos To Invest In Michael Saylor’s remarks have also led traders to talk about Rollblock (RBLK) as a safer option in this volatile crypto market. Rollblock is a community-driven GambleFi protocol that combines decentralization with centralization in online gambling. Thus, Rollblock has tremendous potential to become a dominant force in this $450B market. Although this market is flourishing, it also has many issues plaguing it, such as high entry barriers and intrusive sign-up KYC checks. Rollblock removes these problems by requiring no additional downloads and installations. Users can now just sign up using an email address and begin playing the casino games in complete anonymity, as no KYC checks are needed. The RBLK utility token will be the backbone of this innovative platform. Holding this token entitles you to obtain a portion of daily profits generated by Rollblock. Additionally, staking this token will bring you extra passive income and immediate rewards, which can be used in the casino or saved. Currently, one RBLK costs only $0.01 as it is in Stage 1 of its presale. However, demand is high as over 9M tokens have already been sold. This is because as the presale advances, so will its value. The RBLK price is expected to increase 1200% in the presale alone. Prominent market analysts foresee a potential surge to $0.5 once a Tier-1 CEX lists RBLK in Q3 of 2024 – making it the best crypto investment. Will Rollblock Leave Ethereum, Cardano and Ripple in the Dust? Rollblock has a small market cap of $10M, but has a high probability of seeing a much higher % return than Ethereum, Cardano and Ripple. For its price to skyrocket, it needs fewer new funds than these competitors. With this advantage, RBLK can become one of the best cryptos to buy.

27349212,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607153,1715243448,Bitwise Heralds Coinbase (COIN) As The ‘Next Amazon’: Price Targets,"In a recently published report by Bitwise, the leading crypto index fund manager, a striking comparison has been drawn between Coinbase and Amazon, highlighting a significant yet under-reported aspect of Coinbase’s business — the Base Layer 2 network. Titled “It’s All About That Base (and Other Thoughts on Coinbase),” the report authored by Matt Hougan and Juan Leon delves deep into the financial and strategic shifts underpinning Coinbase’s latest successes and potential future. Amazon Of Crypto? Bitwise Projects Stellar Future For Coinbase Coinbase’s latest financial results have been a revelation, demonstrating robust growth and operational efficiency. The company reported $1.6 billion in net revenue, marking a 116% increase year-over-year, significantly surpassing Wall Street’s expectation of $1.36 billion. Profits were equally impressive, reaching $1.2 billion with total cash reserves swelling to $7.1 billion. Each of Coinbase’s business lines showed notable growth: consumer trading revenue rose by 93%, institutional trading by 105%, stablecoin revenue by 15%, blockchain rewards by 59%, and custodial services by 64%. Related Reading: Coinbase Sees Largest USDC Inflow Ever, What This Could Mean For Bitcoin Despite these strong numbers, the stock has trended downwards, suggesting that the market may not fully appreciate the depth of the company’s strengths. However, Bitwise highlights a less conspicuous but potentially transformative element of Coinbase’s portfolio: the Base Layer 2 network. Launched in August atop Ethereum, Base aims to enhance the blockchain’s throughput while lowering costs. It operates similarly to a bar tab, aggregating transactions and settling them in batches, thereby reducing transaction costs to under $0.01 and speeding up processing times to less than one second. The adoption rate of Base has been staggering. The network saw a 74% increase in transactions quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter, with a 40% increase in April alone compared to the entire first quarter. The exponential growth in the number of developers using Base, which increased eightfold, underscores the network’s rising significance and the broader industry’s interest. From a financial perspective, Base has been lucrative for Coinbase. In the first quarter alone, the network generated $27.4 million in transaction fees, of which Coinbase retained $15.5 million. This high-margin revenue stream continued into April, adding another $11 million to Coinbase’s profits. Given these trends, Bitwise predicts that Base could soon be contributing $10 million to $20 million in monthly profits to Coinbase. The analogy with Amazon is rooted in the transformation potential of Base. Just as Amazon evolved from a simple online bookstore into a retail giant and later a dominant force in cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS), Coinbase could similarly evolve from a crypto brokerage to a fundamental infrastructure provider for the crypto industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Returns To Neutral: Buying Push Already Over? This shift could redefine Coinbase’s role and impact within the market, positioning it as a central infrastructure entity in the crypto ecosystem, akin to how AWS underpins much of today’s web services. The report concludes by reflecting on the significance of Base for Coinbase’s strategic direction. “[T]he early returns on Base suggest that Coinbase could end up becoming something even greater: a core infrastructure provider to the crypto ecosystem. And that would be a very big deal indeed.” COIN Price Analysis Analyzing the technical landscape, the price of Coinbase (COIN) currently faces a pivotal moment. After dropping to $211.20 (as of press time), down 11.4% from a weekly high of $235.79, the stock is testing significant resistance and support levels that could dictate its short-term trajectory. The Fibonacci retracement tool, applied from a low of $31.62 to a high of $429.52, identifies critical price points. Presently, COIN is contending with the $230.57 level (0.5 Fibonacci level), which acts as the primary resistance. The 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) provides crucial support at $199.35, with the stock recently bouncing off this level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56.10, suggesting a balanced dynamic between buying and selling pressures, with a slight tilt towards buying. The recent price behavior, characterized by a candlestick with a small body and longer wicks, reflects the ongoing uncertainty and cautious sentiment among traders.

Once a high-flyer, XRP has seen its price plummet amidst a protracted legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But even as dark clouds loom, some analysts see a silver lining, predicting a future surge for the digital asset. Related Reading: Forget The Price Dip: Ethereum Network Activity Hints At Imminent Takeoff A Legal Tug-of-War Dampens XRP Price The SEC lawsuit, filed in December 2020, alleges that the altcoin is an unregistered security. This classification, if upheld, could severely restrict XRP’s trading and dampen its value. The legal wrangling has taken its toll, with its price dropping a staggering 85% from its 2018 peak of $3.41. The recent months haven’t offered much respite, with XRP experiencing a near 18% decline in the last month alone. Technical Indicators Flash Red In The Short Term Technical analysis, a method used to predict price movements based on historical data, paints a concerning picture for XRP in the immediate future.

Legal Clarity & Partnerships will Boom pic.twitter.com/fv2WlkuNHk — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) May 7, 2024 Pantoja bases his bullish prediction on several factors. He points to XRP’s historical performance, highlighting its meteoric rise in 2017, where it surged over 650 times to its peak. This, according to Pantoja, serves as a precedent for future growth. Institutional Adoption Another factor fueling optimism is Ripple’s growing list of partnerships with established financial institutions. Integration with giants like Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada could significantly boost the altcoin’s value by increasing its utility and mainstream adoption. Recent collaborations with HashKey DX and SBI Ripple Asia further bolster the case for institutional acceptance, potentially propelling XRP’s price upwards. XRP market cap currently at $28.7 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Upgrades To The XRP Ledger Ripple hasn’t been sitting idle either. Through its development arm, RippleX, the company has introduced key upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the technology that underpins XRP. Notably, the XLS-68d specification allows platforms to cover transaction fees for users without distributing free coins. This simplifies the onboarding process and could attract new users to the XRP ecosystem. Market Trends And Community Optimism Pantoja also emphasizes broader market trends that could benefit XRP. The increasing demand for efficient financial services could create a perfect storm for XRP’s adoption. Additionally, Pantoja anticipates a legal victory for Ripple, paving the way for further partnerships and market expansion.

Meanwhile, the spot market volume suffered a relatively measured drop of 32.6% to $2.01 trillion.  “This decline followed unexpected macroeconomic data, an escalation in the geopolitical crisis in the Middle East, and negative net flows from U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, leading to major crypto assets retracing the gains they made in March,” CCData said in a report shared with CoinDesk.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell nearly 15% to under $60,000 last month, snapping a seven-month winning trend. The sell-off came as an overheated bull market ran into broad-based risk aversion characterized by renewed tensions in the Middle East, dwindling probability of rapid Fed rate cuts this year and strength in the dollar index.  The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the most liquid digital assets, traded nearly 20%, and the total crypto market capitalization slipped by 16.8% to $2.177 trillion.  While Binance remained the largest crypto exchange by volume, its combined spot and derivatives market share fell to 41.5%. The exchange’s spot market trading volume tanked 39.2% to $679 billion in April, recording the first decline since September 2023.  “The decline in Binance’s market share also coincided with the news that its founder and previous CEO, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to four months in prison for the violation of U.S. money laundering laws,” CCData noted.  Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ"" Zhao stepped down after pleading guilty to U.S. criminal charges in November and was replaced by Richard Teng. Since then, Binance’s spot market share has increased from 30.8% to 33.8%, CCData said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/09/crypto-monthly-trading-volume-drops-for-first-time-in-seven-months-to-658t,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81396a0e233b991253940c9e6741b9bb137d0151-1335x610.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LTC could continue to rise if it clears the $84.00 resistance zone. Litecoin is showing positive signs from the $75 support zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $85 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $83.00 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $83-$84 resistance zone. Litecoin Price Aims Higher After a steady decline, Litecoin found support near the $75.00 resistance zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. LTC price started a recovery wave above the $78.00 and $80.00 resistance levels. It even cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $88.49 swing high to the $74.59 low. The bulls even pumped the price above $82.00, but the bears were active near the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $83.00 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. Litecoin is now trading below $85 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $83.00 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $88.49 swing high to the $74.59 low. The next major resistance is near the $84 level. If there is a clear break above the $84 resistance, the price could start another strong increase. Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price is likely to continue higher toward the $88.50 and $90.00 levels. Any more gains might send LTC’s price toward the $95.00 resistance zone. Are Dips Supported in LTC? If Litecoin price fails to clear the $84 resistance level, there could be a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $80.00 level. The next major support is forming near the $77.80 level, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $75.00 support. Any further losses may perhaps send the price toward the $70.00 support. Technical indicators: 4-hour MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. 4-hour RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LTC/USD is above the 65 level.

Tron price is now trading above $0.1220 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $0.1250 level. Source: TRXUSD on TradingView.com The first major resistance is near $0.1275 or the 1.618 Fib extension level of the downward move from the $0.1239 swing high to the $0.1181 low, above which the price could accelerate higher. The next resistance is near $0.1320. A close above the $0.1320 resistance might send TRX further higher toward $0.1365. The next major resistance is near the $0.140 level, above which the bulls are likely to aim for a larger increase toward $0.150. Are Dips Supported in TRX?

The first major support is near the $0.1195 level or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours), below which it could test $0.1180.

Even the flimsiest kind of publicity.  Jeo Boden (BODEN), a joke crypto token referring to a misspelling of U.S. President Joe Biden's name, surged as much as 25% Wednesday after his Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, responded to a fan's question about it.  The real estate mogul, reality TV star and populist firebrand was hosting the Trump Cards NFT Gala for holders of the digital collectibles that bear his name and likeness. A few hundred people were in attendance at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.  ""I don't like that investment,"" Trump said at an impromptu audience Q&A after an attendee described BODEN to him and said it had a $240 million market capitalization.  After peaking at $0.42, BODEN fluctuated and at press time was trading at $0.40, still up about 15% from when Trump made his comment (such as it was).  Trump crypto donations?  Trump's presidential campaign is not currently accepting donations in cryptocurrency, but he said at the impromptu gathering he intends to.  When asked, ""Can we donate using crypto?"" the almost-certain GOP nominee responded, ""If you can't, I'll make sure you can.""  Meanwhile, on Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market platform, trading remained flat Wednesday in the contract ""Will Trump mention $boden before July?""  The contract defines a ""mention"" as either ""a verbal usage of the word 'boden' specifically in reference to the cryptocurrency"" or ""any written usage of the word 'boden' published through Trump's social media or other official communication channels.""  His quip didn't fit the bill, and ""yes"" shares in the contract, which will pay out $1 if he utters the word ""Boden"" by July 1, were little changed at $0.05 – meaning traders are giving 5% odds that he will say the word.

Bitcoin Hashrate/Market Cap Ratio Could Reveal Ceiling For Cycle In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has talked about what the network fundamentals could reveal about how much more market cap Bitcoin can sustain. Related Reading: Cardano Offering Better Buying Window Than Other Top Coins, Santiment Reveals BTC is a cryptocurrency that runs on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, meaning that validators called miners compete with each other using computing power to get the chance to add the next block to the blockchain. Miners have to pay constant electricity costs to run this computing power. Generally, these chain validators do so by selling their block rewards. These rewards are fixed in BTC value and given out at a more or less constant rate, so the main variable in miner finances is the asset’s USD value. Mining-related economics are very much related to the cryptocurrency’s price. A metric central to the miners is the Hashrate, a measure of the computing power this cohort has connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average value of this BTC indicator over the past year. The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: Blockchain.com As the graph shows, the Bitcoin Hashrate has been riding an uptrend during this period, largely due to the rally that the asset’s price has enjoyed in this window. To relate this fundamental metric with the price of the asset, the CryptoQuant CEO has referred to the “Hashrate/Market Cap Ratio,” which is an indicator that keeps track of how the market cap (that is, the total valuation) of the cryptocurrency compares against its Hashrate. Here is the chart shared by Ju that shows the trend in this metric over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been at relatively low levels recently | Source: @ki_young_ju on X The graph shows that the Bitcoin Hashrate/Market Cap Ratio has been at low levels compared to the highs the metric achieved during the 2021 bull run. This is despite the fact that the asset’s price is currently at similar levels to back then. The reason behind this trend is that the network’s Hashrate is now more than three times what it was then. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Move $21 Million Worth Of Coins – Here Are The Destinations If the ratio’s high from the previous cycle top is where the cycle peak will also be observed this time around, then it means that the asset’s market cap could increase over three times from its current value.

27307345,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607113,1715216454,Render Soars 50% In 1 Week: Whales Accumulating As Apple Jumps In,"Render is on the move. Price statistics show that the coin is on an uptrend, rising by 50% in the last week due to surging trading volume. The uptick is primarily due to increased whale interest, which appears to be accumulating, moving RNDR from exchanges. At the same time, bulls are finding tailwinds following Apple’s decision to leverage Render in its Octane X rendering software. Whales Accumulating RNDR, Token Moved From Binance Lookonchain data on May 8 shows that the RNDR leg up follows massive token withdrawals from Binance, one of the leading crypto exchanges. The analytics provider notes that one address, 0x15CF, withdrew 748,898 RNDR tokens (worth approximately $5.3 million) from Binance between April 30 and May. Of note, Lookonchain analysts note, is that the address boasts of a remarkable track record with RNDR. The whale has profited on RNDR in six out of seven trades, raking over $3.5 million in profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Suffers Massive Outflows Amid Crypto Market Uncertainty, Tops $284 Million Besides this, other withdrawals include 364,586 RNDR (worth over $3.68 million) by 0x1Cb7, who has previously made $480,000 on RNDR. Additionally, another transfer of 181,922 RNDR ( worth over $1.81 million) by 0xCA9C from Binance. Usually, transfers from centralized exchanges to external, non-custodial protocols or wallets are seen as bullish. This is because on Binance, for instance, RNDR or any other token holder can swap the token for another or cash, essentially liquidating and increasing supply. This is harder on non-custodial protocols because liquidity is challenging due to the absence of other crypto or fiat ramps. Apple Integration Boosts Demand RNDR prices also rose following news that Apple would feature Render Network in its Octane X software. Octane X is a GPU renderer for macOS users. In a keynote, Apple said this software will empower artists with high rendering capabilities. Most importantly for RNDR holders, Apple content creators will leverage Render’s decentralized computing power whenever they need to process complex scenes and high-definition animations. By tapping into Render, artists will benefit from faster rendering times and lower costs typically incurred when producing high-quality videos or 3D modeling. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Weighs In On ETH/BTC Pair’s Recent Decline On Apple’s side, integrating Render and easing activity on its iCloud services helps reduce server workload, boosting efficiency. Additionally, analysts said developers might gain access to Render via Apple’s developer tools. Subsequently, they can create more demanding models or files without expensive hardware. At spot rates, RNDR prices are firm, extending gains. It is up 50% from May lows as bulls target March highs of $13.
