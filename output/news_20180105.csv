42428391,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7glh,1515189600,Texas Regulator Orders BitConnect to Call Off Token Sale,"The Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) has ordered the blockchain-based financial system startup BitConnect to cancel a token sale it had planned to start on January 10.  According to a news release published on the regulator's website, BitConnect was claiming to offer tokens with 100% annual returns, which the TSSB determined qualify as unregistered securities.  In addition, BitConnect was looking for recruiters to promote its token, which the Texas agency determined qualify as agents who are not registered to sell securities in Texas.  Sales agents were ""targeting Texas residents,"" as well as residents of other states, the TSSB said.  BitConnect announced on Jan. 1 that it would be launching an initial coin offering (ICO) called BitConnectx on Jan. 10. And notably, the startup had conducted a previous token sale in 2016.  The Texas order, though coming from a state-level authority, highlights another instance where regulators in the U.S. are scrutinizing cryptocurrency projects that may be seen as issuing unregistered securities through the token offering process.  Previously, the Securities Exchange Commission halted a token offering from Munchee, after which the project provided refunds to investors.  In addition, the release from TSSB went on to state that BitConnect has not shared any information about its financial status, how it will earn a profit or even its exact location.  However, this has not stopped the company from claiming to be a safe investment, according to the release.  BitConnect's existing token, dubbed BCC, currently is trading just over $400 with a market cap of $2.5 billion as of Friday, data from CoinMarketCap show. The coin has been declining in value over the past week from a high of $460 on Dec. 30, 2017.  The Texas release also included a warning against cryptocurrencies in general:  “Investing in cryptocurrencies ... carries significant risk because of regulatory and legal actions, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and the extreme volatility in the price of many cryptocurrencies.”  BitConnect did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing this week that the holder of a warrant had exercised its right to buy $100 million worth of shares. Although the filing did not identify this investor, Byrne told CoinDesk it was the Quantum Fund, managed by billionaire George Soros.  Of the $100 million Overstock received, Byrne said he anticipates $20 million will fund DeSoto Inc., the blockchain property rights joint venture he is working on in partnership with economist Hernando DeSoto.  As for the other $80 million, Byrne said he intends to invest the funds across Overstock's flagship e-commerce platform (which accepts bitcoin for payments) and the other blockchain ventures that are part of its Medici Ventures subsidiary.  Yet, Byrne indicated he sees those two businesses working more closely in the future.  ""Maybe it’s about time we stop seeing Overstock as two separate businesses,"" he said. ""Our retail platform had 40 million unique people come to it last month. So as we’re developing these blockchain applications, these blockchain companies, the retail business is an extremely valuable retail business to have in terms of bringing awareness and traffic to the blockchain properties that we anticipate developing.""  Byrne continued, telling CoinDesk:  ""By having the retail business involved, what we can really create is the wormhole between the two universes, the universe of conventional and the universe of crypto.""  Quantum Fund did not respond to requests for comment by press time, but the Soros-controlled vehicle disclosed its purchase of a warrant to buy Overstock shares in November.  Byrne mentioned tZERO, Overstock's blockchain development platform for capital markets, as another area where some of the proceeds would be headed. But none of the Quantum investment will be used to purchase any of the crypto tokens issued in an initial coin offering (ICO) by tZERO in December.  Separately, however, Overstock itself is buying $30 million worth of tZERO tokens with other funds, Byrne told CoinDesk.  During the initial phase of its ongoing ICO, tZERO received $100 million in commitments from investors interested in purchasing the crypto tokens.  Generally speaking, Overstock will be hiring people ""across Wall Street with expertise in risk management,"" Byrne said.

According to a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission on Jan. 5, Long Blockchain Corp, the publicly traded company that was rebranded from Long Island Iced Tea, is in the process of purchasing 1,000 units of AntMiner S9 manufactured by the China-based Bitmain.  This move came just weeks after the firm announced its business pivot, which caused its stock price at the U.S. exchange NASDAQ to surge nearly 200 percent. Similar trends in market euphoria were also seen for other public stocks that announced business strategy shifts to areas related to blockchain.  In a press release, Long Blockchain said the mining facilities would be located in a Nordic country, without specifying which one. But the agreement included in the SEC filing includes a hint: It states that the vendor will notify the purchaser when the products arrive in Iceland.  Further, the purchase price will be $4.2 million, which includes $2.9 million cash as well as an issuance of 260,000 shares of Long Blockchain's common stock. It is not clear from the filing whether Long Blockchain is buying the equipment directly from Bitmain or from a third party.  According to the document, this purchase is scheduled to close by Jan. 31 only if Long Blockchain Corp. is able to obtain the required financing before that.  As such, Long Blockchain announced in the same document it is issuing additional 1.6 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $5.25 per share, aiming to raise approximately $7.7 million in net proceeds.  Philip Thomas, CEO of Long Blockchain Corp. said in the announcement:  ""We view this transaction as an important and validating initial step in the Company’s progression into blockchain technology.

The company will refund any remaining balances, as well as card order fees for anyone who purchased a card after Dec. 1, 2017.  According to BitPay:  ""Yesterday our European BitPay Card issuer WaveCrest Holdings, Ltd. received direction from Visa® to immediately close all accounts of its prepaid Visa® debit card programs.

Unfortunately, WaveCrest was unable to provide us or cardholders with more time to prepare for this change.""  Similarly, payment providers Cryptopay and Bitwala announced they would be ceasing their services and returning remaining funds.  Berlin-based Bitwala said on Twitter that its team was holding an emergency meeting to discuss the issue. However, London-based Cryptopay announced in a subsequent tweet that it had already begun negotiating with another card issuer.  Similarly, BitPay said in its statement that it was “already in discussions with potential alternative issuers.”  Notably, the shutdowns is limited to European consumers. BitPay stated that U.S. customers would not experience any disruptions.  In a statement, a Visa Europe spokesperson said WaveCrest had lost its membership with the payments company ""due to non-compliance with [its] operating rules."" As a result, all Visa cards issued by the company were closed.  Other Visa card issuers can continue to issue cryptocurrency-based cards.  Less than a year ago, BitPay announced it was expanding to 131 countries at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference. Its cards allow users to fill their balances with cryptocurrencies, but spend in euros, British pounds, or U.S. dollars.

The tweet, which did not identify the partners, comes as XRP has rallied to overtake ethereum as the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market cap while Ripple has been criticized for its fairweather and sometimes opaque way of talking about the token.  Part of the criticism stems from Ripple having scored more than 100 financial institutions to use its xCurrent product, a messaging platform that does not involve XRP, and many new investors mistaking that for XRP support by those institutions.  Before Thursday, only one enterprise – Mexican financial services firm Cuallix – had announced its use of XRP for cross-border money transfers.  But the company tweet, and comments to CoinDesk from Asheesh Birla, vice president of product at Ripple, earlier this week, suggest that more will be added this year.  In another tweet late Thursday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse responded to a New York Times article casting doubt over XRP’s usage by sharing comments he said were from banks and payment providers who examined or tested the cryptocurrency.  Referencing Ripple’s xRapid product, which puts XRP on top of the company's xCurrent messaging platform, Garlinghouse wrote:  ""Over the last few months, I’ve spoken with actual banks and payment providers. They are indeed planning to use xRapid (our XRP liquidity product) in a serious way.""  Despite its recent run to nearly $4 per coin, XRP is down on the day, following a statement by Coinbase that it does not have plans, at this time, to list the cryptocurrency (or any other new ones) on either its flagship exchange or its GDAX platform.

42380216,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTYV,1515161788,Ripple Eyes Retreat After Record Price Highs,"Ripple's XRP token may have found a short-term top and there's potential for a sustained pullback in prices, price charts suggest.  As per data source OnChainFX, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market value is down 15 percent from a record high of $3.84 set yesterday. Over 24 hours, XRP is down 10 percent.  A look at the top 10 ripple markets shows that the sharp retreat from the yesterday's high is mainly due to losses in the XRP/KRW (Ripple-Korean won) pair. Also, profit taking in XRP/BTChttps://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=XRP_BTC (Ripple-bitcoin) may have played a role in dragging down XRP.  While the price action looks toppy, the technical charts indicate there is scope for a deeper pullback. As of writing, XRP is trading below $3.00 on western exchanges, while, in Asia, the price is still well above $3.50 levels.  Ripple chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitstamp) shows:  A doji candle indicating bull market exhaustion.  A potential bearish doji reversal. A close (as per UTC) today below $2.512 (previous day's low) would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  The relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows bearish price RSI divergence (lower highs on the RSI) and falling tops as represented by the descending trendline on the price chart.  Meanwhile, the rising trendline could offer support at $2.35 levels.  View  Yesterday's doji candle indicates Ripple may have found a short-term top.  Confirmation of a bearish doji reversal (close today below $2.51) would open doors for a break below $2.35 (rising trendline support on the 4-hour chart). XRP could then test support at $1.7785 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) and $1.61 (Dec. 31 low).  Only a close (as per UTC) below $1.4154 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement + daily rising trend line support) would be read as long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Bullish scenario: XRP could set fresh record highs over the weekend if prices hold above $2.59 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement) in the next 24 hours.  XRP/BTC  The topping pattern seen on the XRP/BTC chart adds credence to the bearish case put forward by XRP/USD (discussed above) and the rise in bitcoin seen today.  The close today below BTC 0.00016276 (yesterday's doji candle low) would confirm a bearish doji reversal and could yield a pullback to sub-0.00010 BTC levels.

As detailed in an SEC filing dated Thursday, Altucher has invested in a seed round for a Delaware company called Bitzumi, Inc., which intends to offer a forthcoming newsletter product and exchange service. The firm plans to raise up to $10 million, with a minimum raise of $1 million.  While Altucher is described as a co-founder both in the text and on the company's website, in emailed statements, he backed off of this categorization, calling himself just an investor and supporter of the firm. Affiliation aside, the filing indicates Bitzumi plans to use the new funds to grow its business into other verticals.  ""Bitzumi Publishing's goal is to dominate search engine traffic in the cryptocurrency industry and drive traffic to both our Bitzumi exchange and other product offerings, such as subscription-based newsletters,"" the filing states.  Notably listed in the filing are a number of competing companies, among them some of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase's GDAX offering and Bitstamp.  Looking further, the venture foresees that it will even offer customer cryptocurrencies to clients. In the short-term, however, it intends to focus on a publishing business. Bitzumi has an affiliate deal with investment newsletter service Agora Financial, LLC to ""market and sell"" a newsletter created by Altucher.  According to the filing, Scot Cohen, an oil and gas industry entrepreneur, will serve as CEO, while David Briones and Glenn Pollack will take the roles of CFO and director, respectively. The firm has registered as a money services business in 50 states, FinCEN indicates.  For more on Altucher's outlook on bitcoin, view our most recent interview here.

Seven bitcoin exchanges in the nation including Unocoin, Zebpay and CoinSecure are seeking clarity over how their businesses might be classified under GST rules, and are planning to approach the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) – the government body that decides on the applicability of tax rates – over the matter, the Economic Times (ET) states.

The official said:  ""The tax department is currently researching the concept as bitcoins are a very complex subject.""  Under the GST rules, if bitcoin is considered to be a currency, there would not be any taxes applicable, ET states. However, if it is recognized instead as a good, GST at 18 percent could be applicable, or, in the case of it being deemed a service, 12 percent.  Abhishek A Rastogi, a partner at law firm Khaitan & Co, told ET that there is ambiguity for bitcoin exchanges over whether GST is applicable on total revenue or merely on margins earned. He continued to say, ""the tax authority must give clarity on whether bitcoin exchanges are selling goods and services, or are mere trading platforms that earn margins.""

Combined with a high risk of fraud, investing in cryptocurrencies is not for the faint of heart.""  Cryptocurrencies are susceptible to cybersecurity breaches or hacks and the high volatility of such investments makes them unsuitable in sizable amounts for many investors, the note stated.  The Department of Finance also reminded investors to keep an eye out for common red flags of investment fraud, including unsolicited offers, unlicensed sellers and guarantees of high returns.  The state of Alaska has also released a statement urging the public to view cryptocurrency investments with caution.  Kevin Anselm, director of the state's Division of Banking and Securities, said that cryptocurrencies ""aren't a typical investment."" She emphasized that people have to understand the risks of investments, such as hacks or fraud, and what the offerer is giving in return, a local news media report said.  Anselm added that there has been a rise in reports of Alaskans being asked to buy new cryptocurrencies.

42380214,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTVz,1515150018,Off the Leash? Bitcoin Looks North After Breaking $16K,"Bitcoin is gaining altitude today, amid a sharp drop in prices of some alternative currencies.  Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index jumped 7 percent to an intraday high of $16,181 in the last two hours. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 10 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, Ripple's XRP token has depreciated by 9 percent in the last 24 hours, having soared to new heights on Jan. 3.  Other alternative currencies like NEM (XEM), Cardano (ADA) and Stellar (STR) are down at least 12 percent each. More importantly, the XRP/BTC (ripple-bitcoin) pair has taken a beating in the last couple of hours. XEM/BTC, ADA/BTChttps://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ADA_BTC, ETH/BTC (ethereum-bitcoin) and LTC/BTC (litecoin-bitcoin) are also losing altitude.  So, bitcoin (BTC) seems to have caught a bid wave at $14,848.10 (07:29 UTC), tracking the weakness in the cross cryptocurrency pairs (ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, XRP/BTC) – that is, money made from the altcoin rally is likely being channeled back into BTC.  Price chart analysis also suggests BTC could extend the rally to $18,000-$18,600 in the short-run.  4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  An inverse head and shoulder breakout. As of writing, BTC is trading well above the neckline hurdle of $15,550, so the bullish breakout is pretty much a done deal. Prices could rise to $18,600 (target as per the measured height method) over the weekend.  Other factors – including a breach of the falling trendline, a bullish break of the falling wedge, higher lows as represented by the rising trendline – also favor further upside in BTC.  The relative strength index (RSI) is above 50.00 (in the bullish territory) and rising, indicating scope for a rally in prices.  View  BTC could cut through resistance at $16,490 and move towards $18,000–18,600 mark over the weekend.  Bearish scenario: A failure to hold above the neckline support (former resistance) of $15,500 followed by a break below $14,230 today would open the doors for a drop to sub-$12,500 levels.

42380209,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTKf,1515146758,Bank of England Has 'No Plans' to Launch Cryptocurrency,"The Bank of England has dropped plans to launch its own digital currency amid concerns about its impact on the financial system.  The U.K.'s central bank told FTAdviser that it has ""no current plans"" to launch its own cryptocurrency, but will continue to research the topic.  The announcement comes just days after the central bank had said that one of its research unit is investigating the introduction of a cryptocurrency linked to pounds sterling. The research team was expected to report back within the next 12 months.  The BoE indicated it dropped the plans over concerns that the public might stop using commercial bank accounts and move on to BoE's digital payments system for transactions and purchase of goods. A mass move to the BoE cryptocurrency might lead to commercial banks running out of cash to lend, causing ""turbulence"" in the economy, it said.  The BoE also suggested that the demand for paper money is ""elastic"" and can be controlled with interest rate changes. However, it is unsure whether this would continue with the growth of digital currencies, which could potentially weaken its power to use interest rates to manage financial stability.  The central bank recently restated, however, that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin do not pose a threat to global financial stability. The bank's head, Mark Carney, said last month that the digital currency's recent meteoric price gains are ""significant"" and more like an ""equity-type risk.""

42380199,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTBr,1515142811,Jeff Garzik Is Reworking the Segwit2x Code,"The controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x may have been officially called off this August, but that doesn't mean its former lead developer is giving up on plans to keep its codebase alive.  In fact, Jeff Garzik, better known as the CEO of blockchain startup Bloq, now believes his prior work could be revived in a way that promotes interoperability between the increasingly fragmented set of protocols bearing the bitcoin name (see: bitcoin, bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold). And in a new interview, he revealed that he is working on forthcoming updates to the software, called BTC1, with this goal in mind.  While he admits he's not sure how successful the effort will be, Garzik nonetheless framed it as one aimed at unifying a bitcoin developer community that saw no shortage of infighting in 2017.  Garzik told CoinDesk:  ""I hope that bringing multiple chains together in one software will, in some small way, bring multiple developers from multiple communities back together.""  Still, the development is notable given the software's history in achieving the opposite.  After all, the BTC1 code is most associated with Segwit2x, a failed attempt by business and miners to change the rules of the bitcoin protocol. Forged at a meeting in New York in May, the agreement called for the block size parameter to be raised to 2MB, while also pushing for an upgrade called Segregated Witness, designed to both improve and expand bitcoin's block size.  However, while SegWit was enacted, the block size increase, formally coded in BTC1, was officially called off not weeks before it was supposed to go live amid significant pushback and criticism from developers.  'Bitcoin cousins'  But while a handful of new cryptocurrencies have been created out of new bitcoin software versions over the past few months, Garzik stressed that the goal of the new BTC1 iteration is not to create a new currency.  ""It's not a new chain. That's the key innovation of BTC1,"" he told CoinDesk.  Instead, Garzik's concept relies on developing a new version of the Bitcoin Core software – the most popular implementation of bitcoin – though one in which the code can support multiple different cryptocurrencies. In this way, BTC1 will follow whatever changes are added to Bitcoin Core.  Garzik went on to compare the software to ethereum, which allows new cryptocurrencies to be issued on its blockchain, something that's possible on top of bitcoin, though perhaps not as easy as it is on competing protocols.  ""The focus will be on multi-coin support of 'bitcoin cousins,'"" he said, defining ""cousins"" as coins with software that shares 97 percent or more of the code with the original bitcoin software the Core developers manage.  With BTC1, as Garzik envisions it it, users won't have to download one litecoin node, one bitcoin node and one bitcoin cash node. Rather they just download one BTC1 full node and it supports all of the chains simultaneously.  As far as what coins (of the more than 1,300 total coins that have sprung up over the years, many with code nearly identical to bitcoin's) will be supported by BTC1, Garzik plans to be choosy, at least at first, adding only ""successful"" networks that have attracted significant attention from users. In his eyes, at least so far, litecoin, zcash, and maybe bitcoin cash meet these criteria.  He added:  ""Since six bitcoin forks were created in December alone, it's not realistic to support all of them.""  And he's being strict with this stance, arguing for neutrality, saying that it even applies to United Bitcoin, a recent bitcoin fork for which Garzik serves as chief scientist.  ""I would like to see United Bitcoin adopted, but by my own metric, it's not there yet,"" he said.  Beyond the coin  Garzik also plans to take the idea beyond cryptocurrencies.  Taking inspiration from Red Hat, a Linux company that Garzik worked at for more than a decade, he sees Bloq using the new BTC1 software to bridge the corporate and open-source worlds. Just as the open-source software Fedora feeds into the Red Hat product, Garzik believes an open-source BTC1 software can feed into Bloq.  In this way, Garzik claims Bloq developers won't be the only developers working on BTC1. Garzik plans to open development up to anyone that wants to participate, including a ""handful"" of developers that worked on Segwit2x.  Although this idea sounds very different from the code's original intent, Garzik argues this was always his plan – to move the BTC1 software forward whether Segwit2x succeeded or not.  He said:  ""BTC1 was always supposed to be longterm. Segwit2x was always supposed to be a one and done. And BTC1 was always supposed to be the entity that continued even after Segwit2x's success or failure.""  Yet, the new iteration of the codebase also has benefits for Bloq – which recently announced it'd be launching a cross-blockchain cryptocurrency called metronome – as well.  According to Garzik, many of the software implementations that forked off bitcoin, especially older coins, have vulnerabilities within them because they aren't as heavily developed as bitcoin, for instance. These bugs can cause serious issues for Bloq's current enterprise customers, and so the company would benefit from having open-source code that supports the development of different cryptocurrencies simultaneously.  To that end, Bloq and some of its customers (which will be announced in the next 60 days) are funding at least 50 percent of BTC1's future development, Garzik said. Interoperability between coins is something many crypto enthusiasts are interested in, envisioning a future which Garzik calls a ""multi-coin universe.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Bloq and helped organize the Segwit2x agreement.

Announced on Jan. 3, the fund was granted by Health2047, a technology incubator company launched by the American Medical Association (AMA). The platform, called Akiri Switch, will be a “network-as-a-service” tool meant to securely transfer private healthcare data including patient records across the U.S. healthcare system.  According to the announcement, the network is designed to validate both the source and destination of a data transaction by combining a blockchain base with other privacy and routing tools to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access.  James Madara, the AMA’s chief executive, said the healthcare field should adopt technologies which could change existing systems.  ""The data liquidity problem that physicians and other healthcare stakeholders currently face needs to be solved because it's one of the biggest barriers to improving the patient-physician relationship.""  Such initiative is seen as the latest that aims to apply the blockchain technology to the healthcare industry.  In August last year, the Medical Society of Delaware also announced a proof-of-concept proposal which would create a ledger for patient records accessible by healthcare providers and insurers.  Some experts also believe blockchain-based platforms can also answer administrative needs in healthcare. A lead IT architect for the US Health and Human Services Department, Debbie Bucci, said payment records can be put on a blockchain, along with other records accessible both publicly and by officials.

Aptly in a Facebook post, Zuckerberg outlined what he called personal challenges for the year ahead, noting that one is to study the ""positive and negative aspects"" of cryptocurrency and encryption.  Zuckerberg went on to note that his theme for this year is to focus on ""fixing important issues"" in technology, media and government. ""I'm looking forward to bringing groups of experts together to discuss and help work through these topics,"" he wrote.  Still, it's his comments on decentralization that have the blockchain world astir.  Lauded for its ability to create valuable, global peer-to-peer networks, Zuckerberg called cryptocurrencies one of the most interesting questions in technology right now. He added that today, many have lost faith that ""technology would be a decentralizing force.""  He said:  ""There are important counter-trends to this – like encryption and cryptocurrency – that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands...I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.""

42380215,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MTXF,1515123027,"ICOs: The Tech Is Here, But Where Are the Standards?","Nick Cowan is CEO of the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange and the Gibraltar Stock Exchange Group, which operates the Gibraltar Stock Exchange.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Let's face facts: initial coin offerings (ICOs) have done more this year to encourage the adoption of blockchain technology, as well as its activity, invention, debate and reaction, than just about anything else in the industry.  Many technological purists are skeptical about this. They roll their eyes. They look forward to a more sophisticated future for blockchains. This is very understandable, but it's also short-sighted. Tokens and ICOs are a ""killer app,"" a truly great use case that will spur adoption.  Of course, it's still early days, and there's a lot more work to do. For the purists, at the very least, it is undeniable that the extraordinary increase of interest in ethereum, in particular, and the fiat price of ETH, has coincided with the ICO phenomenon.  Many regard this first wave of tokens as similar to internet 1.0, and they are more interested in, so to speak, ""tokens 2.0."" Everyone else wants better technology, too, but the importance of innovation in standards or culture should not be underestimated. White papers, posts to GitHub and blog posts about token investment criteria are all part of what we might call ""best practice 1.0.""  Entering 2018, the blockchain community must review ""best practice 1.0"" from the last year and, alongside technology, begin working toward ""best practice 2.0.""  Consumer satisfaction  True to the spirit of blockchains, the ICO phenomenon this year has been very decentralized.  Projects across all sorts of areas and all over the world popped up. Anyone was free to launch a project and anyone was free to participate. Again, true to the spirit of blockchains, people have experimented for themselves, created and launched projects, committed their ETH and done so with very few obligations or expectations beyond the execution of the smart contract.  In many ways this was very liberating, but a lack of obligation or expectation too often meant a lack of responsibility or accountability, principally toward ICO participants. Many participants did focus on the technological promises of the projects to which they committed their ETH. Many also saw ICOs as a path to financial gain… and this is where everything began to get difficult.  Technology is just one part of a successful project. Organization, management, a well-considered plan, risk mitigating measures, communication and full and fair explanations about what someone can expect are also important. ICOs began to run into difficulty because there have not been clear standards and delivery on a project in line with expectations.  For example, some projects attracted a lot more for their ICO than either expected or planned for. Questions arose about how to deal with that excess:  Which participants get how many tokens?  Is it fair to keep the excess or should it be returned?  Do you issue more tokens?  These are just some of many questions.  Even worse, some projects have attracted attention for straying from the plans they set out in their white papers. With no preparation, there were no answers. This has meant many ICO participants were left dissatisfied.  Ethical considerations  Regulators are primarily concerned with protecting the integrity of the market and protecting investors.  Something in the form of ICOs, that was unexpected and not initially technically well understood, thus set off many warning signals and in some cases resulted in real loss and grievance. The reaction has been very understandably to err on the side of caution. The string of bans, warnings, statements and even lawsuits which began in September should have been entirely predictable.  Many in the blockchain community compare the stage of development and adoption to the early days of the internet.  If we are in 'internet 1.0,' or 'token 1.0,' or 'best practice 1.0,' then we should consider what other lessons we can learn. When popular use of the internet first started, very few people thought about, predicted or understood that there might be ethical, rather than technological issues, that we'd have to try to figure out. These were issues like privacy, intellectual property violation, identity theft, internet bullying. Recent fears about state propaganda and election interference were certainly not anticipated.  What will the concerns of the future be when it comes to cryptocurrencies, blockchains and ICOs?  It will likely take some time and it is very likely that we won’t predict them. However, we can certainly start thinking differently. Technological innovation is only one half of what the community needs to consider.  We must also give serious thought to standards, or cultural, or ethical innovation.  Regulation isn't a panacea  Regulation and new laws may be a welcome start, but they are also not a complete solution.  Although bitcoin was originally started with the intention of taking aim at the traditional financial sector, there are lessons we can learn from the past. There are many good ideas, standards and best practices which we can review and adapt. There is no reason not to keep the best that traditional financial services had to offer, to keep what was good and worked, and adapt it for the best fit with the realities of new technology.  After all, regulators themselves only have so many resources, whether that’s time or expertise. They also often have mandates not to act in ways which hinder new business and innovation. They often make very reasonable efforts. The reason we have seen bans and warnings is not that regulators are against innovation. They just don't want to be caught out by it.  Yet, regulators can only provide so much of the answer. For example, the way that hedge funds became mainstream was by developing their own industry norms and standards which acted in a complementary way to regulation. These kinds of standards reduced the risk for investors, created reliable expectations and ultimately allowed that industry to flourish.  We should expect to see these kinds of standards and industry practices begin to take shape next year for ICOs. Instead of being shut down indefinitely, the blockchain community must take some responsibility for itself. That is how the industry can figuratively grow up and it’s how we can move forward and increase adoption. If you want to go ""to the moon"" then that’s how you get there.  The good news is that over the last year there have been some very encouraging signs.  The Government of Gibraltar, which has experience in fostering the growth of online gaming, announced that it would introduce a new ""Distributed Ledger Technology Regulatory Framework"" which is due to pass into law in 2018. Instead of acting prescriptively and prohibitively it instead sets principles for conduct of business.  In the U.S., there is a team developing EDGAR-style rules for ICOs. Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) rules are information-filing standards that were originally intended to increase fairness in the securities market.  The SEC has issued some guidance about what kind of tokens can be classified as securities and which are not, and issued guidance on celebrity endorsements. The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has started a supervisory regime for cryptocurrency exchanges.  Toward best practice 2.0  These are all great signs that, whether they understand it or not, or whether it's particularly coordinated, market participants are in the early stages of building best practice 2.0.  If we want the next year to be better and a clear improvement on the last, these are some of the most important questions we must answer:  What criteria do we use to decide whether a token is a security?  What standards should apply to non-security “utility” tokens?  Who should be allowed to issue tokens?  How do you identify a good service provider?  Who should be able to buy what kind of token?  What can I say about my project?  What are good technological, governance, risk management, planning, and commercial standards?  Who do we hold accountable for what?  The blockchain community has an opportunity to be proactive and to start answering some of these questions themselves. Too often a raising of standards or change of practice is a response to what should have been a completely avoidable disaster. The fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, the same crisis which led Satoshi Nakamoto to create bitcoin in the first place, is an apt example. This past year has already seen law suits filed and the SEC start to file its first fraud charges. There are rumors of more charges to come and of regulators investigating with the intention to prosecute..  There is an opportunity for the blockchain community to reassess, reorganise and act to prevent rather than to cure.  Over the next year, we should look to exchanges to lead the way. In traditional financial services they compete with each other but otherwise, theoretically and practically, they sit neutral to other market participants. This is because the point of an exchange is to sit centrally as a common venue for the bringing together of buyers and sellers. It is an exchange’s job to set standards to help ensure the smooth, orderly running of their marketplace. Exchanges make decisions about who can participate and under what conditions. Confidence in the market is key – it’s what allows participants to conduct business and for industries to grow.  We should expect the same in the blockchain community.
