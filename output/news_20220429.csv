With 218 ayes, the house voted in favor of the bill containing cryptocurrency tax reporting requirements. And with US President Joe Biden&apos;s signature, it became a law. This move by the US government has shaken the industry, which was earlier deemed as a crypto-friendly nation. The consequences - it made that market turn red and continues to stay bearish even in 2022.

This is the same with traditional finance where lending and borrowing remain a big part of the ecosystem. However, there has not been an intersection of these three.

42407281,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSPB,1651272765,Why We Need Crypto Payments to Work,"Crypto has always held out the promise of a payments revolution. But that revolution never happened.  We're 13 years into the Bitcoin age, and there’s only one store in my neighborhood in downtown Montreal that advertises that it accepts bitcoin (BTC). I was passing by that store the other day and noticed that a vandal had crossed out the bright orange ₿ written on the storefront, adding a ""non"" in protest.  Why? The vandal didn't provide us with more information. But if I had to guess it probably had to do with their opinions on the environmental implications of bitcoin's security method, proof-of-work. Proof-of-work requires huge amounts of electricity, and in an age of global warming there's no place for such an awesome display of energy consumption.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week series.  This small example is illustrative of the crypto payments challenge. It's tough enough for crypto to gain acceptance as a payments network. The medium’s inherent volatility and novelty are huge hurdles. Add to that concerns about crypto’s effect on the environment, and getting the payments ball rolling becomes even more of a challenge.  But even normies who don't care about crypto should want it to succeed as a payments medium.  Cash is rapidly disappearing as a payment medium. The big winners are the Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) card oligopolies. Every time someone deserts cash, the card networks get a little more powerful. As consumers we don't often notice the few cents that the card networks extract from us when we pay with our debit or credit cards, but it leads to fantastic profits for them. Visa and MasterCard's returns on equity – 40% and 120% respectively – give testament to their wide oligopolistic moats. (The average company's return is a meager 10-15%).  There are a number of solutions to oligopolies, one of them being competition. If there are more payment networks fighting for market share, we consumers (and the retailers we frequent) can at least choose the cheapest one.  And that's why it would be nice if crypto worked for payments.  Alas, crypto usage has been mostly confined to the relatively small confines of the speculative crypto economy, only leaking out once in a while to serve as a normie payments medium. These leaks may be slowly plugging up, too. Over the last year or so, activists have been trying to push the small advance that crypto has achieved in the payments realm into retreat.  My neighborhood store is just one example. The storekeeper's internal dialogue might have gone after seeing their store window vandalized: ""Why bother accepting the odd bitcoin payment when it attracts such negative attention?""  Last month, hundreds of long-time Wikipedia editors asked the Wikimedia Foundation to stop accepting cryptocurrency, the most popular reason put forth being its environmental sustainability. A few months before, Discord – a popular messaging platform – quashed rumors of a cryptocurrency integration after pushback from users concerned over energy use.  The Wikipedia editors' vehemence stands in contrast to the tiny amount of crypto that Wikimedia has collected. According to Wikimedia, just 0.08% of its donations have been in crypto, mostly bitcoin. The Wikimedia Foundation has little reason to say no to the activists. At 0.08%, crypto isn't proving to be very useful for accepting payments. Why bother pushing back?  Had the activists campaigned for Wikimedia to stop accepting Visa, for instance, it'd be a complete non-starter. Visa has an advantage over crypto. It’s already big, likely accounting for a decisive percentage of Wikimedia donations.  That you can’t say no to Visa, but you can say no to crypto, illustrates the crypto payments dilemma. Retail payments networks are notoriously difficult to bootstrap. It's the classic chicken-and-egg problem. For an individual to adopt it, a new payment option needs to be already useful (by being widely available and spendable at shops), but it can't be already useful if no one wants to try it in the first place.  Making this paradox worse is that the card networks already have firm footholds. People have grown used to their plastic, and the incumbents use dirty tricks to enforce lock-in, like card reward points and no-surcharge policies. The nut is made even harder to break by crypto's incredible volatility. Risk-averse new users are reluctant to try it.  But the crypto world has evolved a response to volatility. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to traditional fiat money, which makes them less intimidating for people to use. And so where regular crypto comes short, stablecoins at least stand a fighting chance against the MasterCard and Visa oligopolies.  Unfortunately, stablecoins are built on energy-intensive proof-of-work blockchains, which opens them up to the growing environmental critique. Given the already difficult chicken-egg payments problem being faced by stablecoin issuers, the last thing they need is for card users to come up with one more excuse not to give stablecoins a try.  Mozilla's recent reappraisal of its crypto acceptance policy provides a good example of how I hope the debate evolves. In January, Mozilla – the nonprofit organization that makes the Firefox web browser – decided to temporarily pause cryptocurrency donations to see how crypto ""fits with our climate goals.""  This month Mozilla announced its new policy. Rather than closing the door on crypto, it came up with a more nuanced solution. Mozilla won’t accept proof-of-work coins, but it'll accept proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies it sees as ""less energy intensive.""  If Mozilla's more welcoming policy is emulated, and one hopes it is, it offers stablecoin issuers a window. But this window comes at a price. If stablecoins are ever going to compete in a meaningful way with the card networks, they need to dissociate themselves from proof-of-work. That may mean avoiding expansion to proof-of-work blockchains. At the worst, it means helplessly waiting while the proof-of-work chains on which they already exist, like Ethereum, switch over to less energy intensive security methods.  Removing as much ammunition as possible from critics will make the already difficult chicken-and-egg payments problem a little easier for stablecoins to solve. We need them to win, though. Visa and MasterCard aren't getting any less dominant.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/29/why-we-need-crypto-payments-to-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/970f47af5be514a06e111aebba3e1970be12c1b5-512x262.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420802,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcCj,1651266334,Please Don’t Buy a ‘KYC’d’ Wallet for the Bored Apes Team’s Otherside Mint,"For the past few months, the puppetmasters behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token (NFT) collection have been gearing up for their biggest product launch yet: a mysterious new service called Otherside.  So far, all signs point to Otherside being a competitor to “metaverse platforms” like Decentraland and The Sandbox, or online social spaces in the vein of Second Life. And while there’s still no approximate timeline for the platform’s debut, Otherside is facing its first major test this coming weekend in the form of a massive sale of NFTs.  A consequence of the buzz is that Ape fans are trying to charge each other for the privilege of being an early investor in these NFTs, offering to sell specially registered Ethereum wallets connected to strangers’ personal information.  Of course, buying access to a random person’s crypto wallet is extremely risky for a few reasons, not least of which is that – in this case – it almost certainly constitutes fraud.  Read more: For $200, You Can Trade Crypto With a Fake ID  Otherside’s “land sale”  As with Decentraland and The Sandbox, the economy of Otherside seems to revolve around scarce plots of digital “land.” Metaverse platforms are usually structured as massive grids – once you buy the deed to a patch of land as an NFT, it’s yours to play around with until you decide to sell.  The difference with Otherside’s land system is that, at least for this initial crop of investments, you’ll need to fork over some identifying information before you can buy in.  It works like this: Otherside’s plots, known as “Otherdeeds,” cost 305 ApeCoin (APE) each, which is about $6,600 at today’s prices. ApeCoin is sort of like a blockchain-backed version of company scrip – the official coin of Yuga Labs, the corporate entity behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Otherside. There are 55,000 Otherdeeds, all of which will go on sale on Saturday, April 30.  In March, Yuga Labs began asking people to submit their Ethereum addresses (along with that personal information) via a form on a mysterious website, somethingisbrewing.xyz. If you registered your wallet on this site before April 25, you’re eligible to mint some of those Otherdeed NFTs when they launch on Saturday. Yuga Labs is limiting mints to two per registered address, so you’ll need about $13,200 in ApeCoin to fully juice each one.  Know your… chimp?  Crucially, the submission system on somethingisbrewing.xyz was free. Because any curious trader could simply connect a wallet to the site for a shot at registration, there are probably a lot more registered wallets than traders who actually have the requisite $6,600 in ApeCoin.  And thanks to that personal information now associated with each registered wallet (the site asked for a passport, national ID or driver’s license, along with proof of residence), those registered wallets are also fully “KYC’d.”  “KYC,” an acronym for “Know Your Customer,” refers to a set of requirements imposed on anyone trying to interact with most financial services companies. In the U.S., these companies are regulated by the government – it’s why you need to submit your driver’s license if you want to move your money out of a centralized crypto exchange like Coinbase.  In the world of traditional banks, KYC-ing customers (it’s a verb, too) is standard practice, a useful tool for combating money laundering. In crypto, though, it’s something of a dirty word. Bitcoin was built around the idea that transactions could stay pseudonymous; to crypto purists, KYC feels like a vestige of an outmoded surveillance system.  And yet, the system isn’t without loopholes. The glut of KYC’d addresses has created a kind of secondary market on Twitter: Enterprising traders are attempting to sell these KYC’d Ethereum addresses to anyone who wants a shot at the Otherside mint.  It might not make sense for a Bored Ape “whale” – someone who owns an Ape or two, and can afford the $13,000+ buy-in – but for the army of strivers who just happened to register their wallet on that website before April 25, it’s an opportunity to make a quick buck.  A Twitter user called clav.eth told me he’s selling his KYC’d address for exactly that reason.  “It helps fund my passion for NFTs, I can’t afford to mint @ 305 APE,” he wrote in a direct message on Twitter.  Twitter is full of calls to sell these addresses, and even though many are nonspecific and potentially unserious, respondents are definitely biting.  Why this is a bad idea  Setting aside the obvious legal and ethical problems with using someone else’s identity to access a financial service, when you buy one of these wallets what you’re really getting is a “seed phrase.” This is an ordered set of words that functions like a password for a given wallet. But even if you buy someone’s seed phrase, you can’t erase it from that person’s memory (or, more likely, their phone’s notes app).  Buying the seed phrase for a wallet is like buying yourself administrative privileges without demoting the first administrator – it’s not a transfer of control as much as an addition. And because the seller will always control the wallet they’re selling, they can reclaim its holdings at any time. Or, the seller might code a bot to automatically drain the wallet once the NFTs are in there.  Also, as the entrepreneur Scott Lewis pointed out, a scammer could easily offer the same seed phrase to multiple buyers.  Clav.eth said that while “in theory” he could do this to any prospective buyer, he “wouldn’t.”  Another Twitter user – the charmingly named cockwaffles3000 – explained that he’s been asking sellers to reveal their personal information (“selfie including passport + note stating kyc address”) before going ahead with any transaction.  But even then, he admits, it’s “hard to put it past them that they’ll resist stealing” the $13,000 in NFTs, once minted.  Frontier justice?  When I asked cockwaffles why he would ever trust a stranger with that responsibility, he offered a somewhat menacing response:  “If they’re doxxed you can find them... Not hard to intimidate someone when that much $ is on the line (prob 6 figs+ down the line upon launch).”  Still, scammers abound. One trader, after teasing that he’d successfully pawned a KYC’d wallet, told me I’d need to cough up 0.1 ETH (about $300) if I wanted any more details for this article.  Meanwhile, neither clav.eth nor cockwaffles appear to have had any luck actually closing a deal.

Most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) underperformed bitcoin on Friday, indicating a lower appetite for risk among traders. For example, ether (ETH) was down by 5% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 4% dip in BTC and a 6% drop in Avalanche's AVAX token over the same period.  Just launched!

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin lagging so far this year  Bitcoin is underperforming the S&P 500 and gold year to date, but is slightly ahead of long-term Treasury bonds as shown in the chart below. There has been a persistent risk-off theme so far this year, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical risk.  Typically, investors reduce their exposure to speculative assets such as stocks and cryptos during times of uncertainty – and bond returns fall when rates rise. In contrast, gold and other commodities typically outperform when inflation rises.  BTC has traded in a choppy range over the past year, with midpoint at $40,000. Despite negative year-to-date returns, the cryptocurrency is still up 16% from its Jan. 24 low around $33,000, compared with the S&P 500, which is trading lower so far this year.  Crypto's sea of red  The chart below shows CoinDesk 20 asset returns so far this month, which is negative across the board.  The CoinDesk 20 filters thousands of cryptocurrencies and digital assets to define a core group of 20 by market cap, trading volume and other factors. These assets constitute roughly 99% of the market by volume at eight of the largest and most reliable exchanges, according to CoinDesk.  Dogecoin's DOGE token outperformed the CoinDesk 20 in April after experiencing a 20% price rally earlier this week. The move was partly driven by Twitter's (TWTR) acceptance of a takeover bid from Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. The dog themed meme-coin erased most of its gains over the past few days, although it was still well ahead of Shiba Inu's SHIB token's 18% loss over the past 30 days.  ETC, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum Classic, a blockchain project that was created in 2016 when Ethereum’s blockchain split into two separate chains, was the worst performing crypto in the CoinDesk 20 in April, falling from its top spot in March.  Meanwhile, BTC and ETH experienced less selling pressure than other alternative cryptos in April. Typically, altcoins underperform in down markets because of their greater risk profile relative to bitcoin. That suggests a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders.  Seasonally strong May  Will April showers bring May flowers?  The chart below bitcoin's average historical return by month in the top panel. And the second panel shows the percentage of times when the cryptocurrency generated a positive return in each month over the past nine years.  Historically, bitcoin has generated an average return of 17% in May. Stocks are also trading in a seasonally strong period, which could provide an opportunity for buyers to enter the market after three months of sideways trading.  Still, historical returns are no guarantee of future returns. For example, technical indicators point to a period of stabilization, albeit with limited upside in price. And sentiment among crypto derivative traders remains mixed.

However, each trader values their Bitcoin asset depending on different factors in the current and future markets. Price compression is where market players rely on predicted asset prices to set a high value for their assets under existing market conditions. The idea is that the projected prices will be a justifiable reason to trade in the current market at future rates. The proactive strategy by traders to engage in Bitcoin trading activities based on price compression has pros and cons. The pros are evident with the justification of the trades when predicted conditions come to pass. They include: Supply and Demand Trends of Bitcoin are Favorable The laws of demand and supply stipulate that increase in demand with constant supply leads to high asset prices. Increasing supply when demand is constant will lower asset value due to a lack of extra interest. The law applies to the valuation of Bitcoin in the crypto market. The nature of Bitcoin mining is that the number of new coins joining the blockchain keeps diminishing with time.

42407301,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxdYE,1651264140,5 Questions for Chris ‘Crypto Dad’ Giancarlo,"J. Christopher Giancarlo, aka ""Crypto Dad,"" earned his stripes in the crypto industry as one of the more knowledgeable, sensitive and forward-thinking regulators of digital assets back when he led the influential Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He was still chairman of that organization when he (and fellow pro-innovation reg Daniel Gorfine) began advocating for a ""digital dollar.""  Today, about three years later, Giancarlo is still on that track – and his arguments have likely never been more pertinent. The Federal Reserve (along with a supermajority of central banks worldwide) is currently studying the feasibility and potential benefits of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  Giancarlo's Digital Dollar Project argues that a U.S. CBDC could bring the country and the world's economy into the 21st century. The effects could be widespread: simplifying taxation, reducing costs across the financial system and making the U.S. more resilient and better able to respond to economic shocks (like the coronavirus pandemic).  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week series.  Though Giancarlo wants to bolster the U.S. government, he is still a free-market advocate. The Digital Dollar Project argues that a CBDC should be a public-private endeavor, with banks or crypto companies helping to build the technology that would make it possible. (His pro-market perspective helps explain why the former regulator was quick to find employment as an advisor in the crypto industry.)  See also: The Revolving Door Is Good for Bitcoin  Still, there are potential problems with a CBDC. First, a government sponsored digital dollar, and its accompanying infrastructure, might compete with the banking or crypto sector. There are also privacy concerns.  In this conversation, Giancarlo addressed some of those privacy concerns, restated the need for monetary innovation and discussed what in crypto can still capture his attention after all these years. It has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.  Would CBDCs conflict with crypto adoption?  The best protection consumers have would be to have a choice between a digital currency that is sovereign, or backed by the government, and non-sovereign, or backed by a private company.  Should a digital U.S. dollar, minted either by the Fed or the Treasury, have the same exact privacy assurances as cash?  A customer’s ability to gather information [about their transactions] should be their private business. Similarly, people may feel that where they spend their money – it shouldn't be mined by social media companies nor should it be mined by the government, provided it's legal.  But it depends on how it's designed. I believe in absolute privacy, not just for consumer transactions, but for non-consumer transactions, like charitable contributions. If I do them in cash, it should be my business.  But if it's done with a digital dollar as the Fed proposes, with the intention to only protect consumer transactions, the question remains whether the government has the right to monitor those transactions.  For those who say therefore the government can't be trusted, let's outsource money to the private sector. I'd say consider what we've outsourced in the public square to the private sector, in terms of surveillance and censorship.  Where do you think the CFTC's role ends and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s begins? Could you draw a clear line for us?  The SEC’s primary role is oversight of markets for capital transfer and capital formation. That means somebody with a great idea, but doesn't have the money to realize it can go and [raise capital from] somebody who has money, with the aim of making a return on that money. That may be in bonds, debt or in equities.  Read More: PayPal’s Blockchain Chief on the Future of Crypto in Payments  The CFTC is a market regulator for markets involving risk transfer and risk pricing. Its oversight includes companies that may be exposed to the risks of rising or falling commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.  That company, say a factory, that has the risk of rising energy prices, can find someone who's willing to take on that risk in return for a fee. It’s a way of transferring risk from those who have it but can't bear it, to those that don't have that risk, but are willing to take it on in return for a fee.  The United States is the only major economy to have a separate regulator for both risk transfer and capital formation.  Is there something about U.S. regulation and law that impedes efficient oversight of markets?  New technology. When we invented a new technology for transportation – from the railroads to air travel – we came up with a new regulatory system, a new form of technology.  Because crypto is a new architecture confirming ownership and transfer of value, based on new technology, we need a new, customized regulatory regime.  Who do you think has benefited most from crypto so far?  Certainly long term crypto holders.  But more broadly, the potential for financial inclusion [using crypto] is much greater. The shortcomings with the existing system now is that it’s slow, expensive and exclusive.  Read More: Crypto Payments: When the Tech Fades to the Background  It's slow because somebody's got to confirm [a great deal of] information. It's expensive in terms of fees associated with financial tools like credit cards. That's why when you send money around the globe, it costs anywhere between 7%–17%. It's exclusive because if you can’t provide credentialed identity, then you can't use the system.  When people ask what is digital currency? What is cryptocurrency? What is central bank digital currency? It's a breakthrough on all those shortcomings.  Suddenly, money is no longer slow, expensive or exclusive.

42420807,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcEn,1651263459,Juno Blockchain Community Officially Votes to Revoke Whale’s Tokens,"In a decision with fraught implications for decentralized governance, the Juno blockchain community officially voted to confiscate millions of dollars worth of tokens from a single user’s wallet.  A much-talked-about governance proposal in March gained a plurality of Juno’s community voting to drain the user’s wallet, but this vote basically amounted to a straw poll – a way to gauge community sentiment without touching any funds. This week a new vote officially revoked the user’s tokens.  The JUNO holder in question – dubbed a “whale” due to his massive quantity of tokens – stood accused of gaming a JUNO airdrop to claim more tokens than his rightful allotment. That holder, who has revealed himself to be a 24-year-old Japanese national named Takumi Asano, said the funds belonged to a community of individuals who invest with him.  Since the original “Proposal 16” passed in March, drama in the Juno ecosystem has only intensified. Within a few short weeks, a smart contract attack of unknown origin threw the Juno blockchain offline for several days, the JUNO token price tanked by over 60% and Asano made repeated appeals to the community that it refrain from revoking his tokens.  In what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to save his funds, Asano claimed in a tweet on Wednesday that some of Juno’s lead developers were secretly selling off large quantities of JUNO tokens under the community’s nose. According to Asano, it was these sell-offs that led to JUNO’s precipitous drop in price – meaning these developers, not Asano, were the real threat to the Juno community.  Whatever the veracity of Asano’s claims, they appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Juno Proposal 20 passed on Friday with over 72% voting to revoke all but 50,000 of Asano’s JUNO tokens.  As a result of its passage, the proposal will automatically upgrade Juno’s blockchain to move the revoked funds into a community-controlled smart contract. From here, the Juno community will be able to vote on what to do with the tokens next.  After the vote passed on Friday, Asano explained to CoinDesk that he might consider pursuing legal action, depending on what the community decides to do next.  “If this lock is based on the assumption that the asset will be returned to our clients, we do not intend to do any legal action,” he wrote. “On the other hand, if it is based on the premise of a [b]urn or permanent lock, we are considering taking legal action against each validator.”  Prop 20 in context  Juno is not the first, nor will it be the last, blockchain community faced with a decision on whether to revoke a user’s allegedly ill-gotten gains. It is, however, the first prominent case of such a decision being made via a community vote.  The highest-profile case of a blockchain working to dilute a single user’s funds took place in 2016 with The DAO attack on Ethereum, where a hacker ran away with around 5% of the network’s native ether (ETH) token. Ethereum famously chose to execute a “hard fork” of its blockchain – essentially spinning up a new chain where the exploit never took place and leaving the old chain to wilt away in the hands of a small group of die-hard supporters. (That chain is known as Ethereum Classic.)  While The DAO hack shared some similarities with the Juno airdrop, the Ethereum community did not directly vote to revoke funds from the hacker. The choice to fork was made by Ethereum’s core developers, and they left it up to the broader community to decide whether they wanted to continue using the old chain.  The intentions of the Juno whale were not as clear-cut as those of The DAO attacker. Asano did not actively “exploit” a smart contract. Instead, he had – likely by coincidence – structured his holdings on another blockchain in a manner that benefited him disproportionately in the JUNO airdrop.  The Cosmos ‘stakedrop’  Juno is part of Cosmos, an ecosystem of blockchains that are purpose-built to interoperate, meaning they can easily communicate and recognize some of the same on-chain assets. In February, a few months after the Juno blockchain was introduced, its creators used a familiar tactic – an airdrop, or giveaway, of the chain’s native JUNO token – to attract users from the wider Cosmos community.  As its eligibility criteria, Juno’s “stakedrop,” as this airdrop was called, rewarded JUNO tokens 1:1 for ATOM tokens “staked” on the Cosmos Hub blockchain – the one which serves as a steward for overall Cosmos ecosystem development. Staking tokens means lending them out to be used to secure the network. On Juno and the Cosmos Hub, staking also confers users the right to vote on protocol governance proposals.  The architects behind Juno’s airdrop set a cap of 50,000 JUNO for any individual wallet. The cap was meant to ensure no one person would amass too much sway over Juno governance, but it failed to account for someone like Asano, who had around 50 different wallets staking ATOM tokens.  As the leader of an “investment group” in Japan called CCN, Asano’s stake included ATOM pooled from a large number of different investors – enough to claim 10% of JUNO’s total token supply in the airdrop.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, Asano said he split the ATOM funds across numerous wallets “for security purposes.” His plan, he says, was to eventually disburse the Juno tokens back to his investors. But his outsized stake became apparent once he consolidated his JUNO from more than 50 wallets into one.  Proposition 20 contended that CCN was an “exchange service” ineligible for the airdrop, but it appears unlikely that Asano deliberately gamed the system.  Some contradictory language in the original Proposition 16 governance proposal showed its authors struggling to grapple with this nuance around Asano’s intentions: “The facts are that the Juno genesis stakedrop was gamed by a single entity. Willingly or unwillingly is not relevant to this matter” (emphasis added).  Community values  The Juno case represents not only a test of the limits of blockchain-based governance but also a test of one blockchain community’s values.  Jack Zampolin, a member of Juno’s founding team, was initially against revoking Asano’s funds. Zampolin told CoinDesk that he urged other validators – third parties who stake tokens and deploy “nodes” to secure the network – to vote against the original Proposal 16. But over time, Zampolin said, he came to recognize that the broader Juno community has a different opinion on core blockchain tenets like immutability – the idea that a blockchain’s history should never be changed or erased.  “There's this strong libertarian freedom perspective in blockchains. That … governance shouldn't target any individual accounts or actors within these systems,” noted Zampolin.  “However … what we're seeing on Juno is the community is overwhelmingly saying, ‘We think that this value of not having large accounts, which was codified in the airdrop, is a core value of this community, and we're willing to take governance action to protect that.’”  Asano shared his own thoughts on this in a statement to CoinDesk:  “When a public chain's governor rewrites a block's data, will that chain still have anyone to support it? Will hardcore blockchainers still exist in the community? We'll have to wait and see where this issue ends up.”",NEGATIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | AIRDROP | FORKS,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/29/juno-blockchain-community-officially-votes-to-revoke-whales-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a1bea2a11cfde1c367168c3f72582f3fc955721-1440x776.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421597,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiA1,1651257764,Wall Street’s Latest ‘Market Manipulation’ Scandal Should Be a Wake-Up Call for Crypto,"This week saw the dramatic arrest and criminal charging of Bill Hwang, the former manager of the private hedge fund Archegos Capital Management. You may remember that Archegos blew up last March. Banks that had lent it money for huge, leveraged trades wound up losing $10 billion dollars.  There’s a fascinating discussion to be had about whether what Hwang did was full-blown fraud, but I won’t bother trying to outdo Matt Levine on that front. Instead, I want to focus on the financial mechanics of what Archegos was up to, and why it’s extremely important for cryptocurrency holders or traders to understand.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The nut of it is simple: Archegos borrowed a lot of money and used it to buy very large amounts of roughly 10 different stocks. That buying itself helped push the stocks up, giving Archegos paper profits that it could use to borrow more money – which it then used to buy the same few stocks, pushing them up further. The leverage play produced incredible results for a time: Hwang reportedly launched Archegos with just $200 million in 2013, but by its peak, the fund’s paper value topped $30 billion, a 1,400% return in eight years.  But it was a tactic with a limited shelf life. Archegos over time accumulated utterly absurd positions in several major stocks. According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Archegos came to own as much as 45% of the outstanding shares in Tencent and over 50% of ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) shares. One of the pillars of the fraud case against Hwang is that he lied to banks about these levels when borrowing money. And the way things played out shows why banks don’t often or willingly lend into this sort of concentration.  ViacomCBS was the pin that popped the Archegos bubble. The stock ran from about $35 in January of 2021 to nearly $95 by March. I’m speculating, but it seems very plausible that Archegos’ own aggressive buying (read: alleged market manipulation) contributed to the insane runup that motivated the sale of new stock. Either way, nearly tripling your money is good!  Except when it’s not. The runup motivated ViacomCBS execs to issue new shares, which in turn deflated the stock, which dropped 30% in three days. With its high levels of concentration and leverage, that 30% drop in a single stock wound up being enough to earn Archegos the world’s worst margin call. With the paper value of its holdings dropping against its outstanding loan obligations, Archegos was forced to liquidate – ultimately nuking the entire fund.  See also: What Does Liquidation Mean and How to Avoid It?  But – and this is the really, really important part – there still wasn’t enough to pay back its lenders.  Crucial warnings  Archegos shows what might happen to any number of crypto assets that are leveraged or backed in certain ways. The key term here is exit liquidity, and one takeaway is the danger of backing or holdings concentrated in a few assets which can collapse suddenly in a liquidity crisis. In many cryptocurrency ecosystems, token holders are in much the same position as the banks that lent to Hwang: at risk of being trapped in a token as it burns down around them.  I wrote last week about the potential for an unwind of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin, which by the most generous interpretation is currently “backed” by a single asset, LUNA. The Luna team is working to diversify that backing to avoid the kind of concentrated risk that nuked Hwang, but their current goal would get them all the way up to three different assets by adding BTC and AVAX. Hwang wound up being too fragile while holding closer to 10 big positions.  Another suggestive parallel here is with the mechanics of crypto valuations in general, particularly when it comes to founder rewards, pre-mines or other large pools of tokens held in relatively static blocks. As many have pointed out, the “market cap” metric touted by many tokens is rendered pretty meaningless by these large allocations, which are essentially not on the market, and often never have been. The same might be argued for the lockups in certain lending and staking protocols.  See also: Lex Sokolin: The Fundamentals of Crypto's $2T Market Cap | Opinion  These big blocks of untraded tokens inflate the total market value of coins in a way quite similar to how Archegos inflated its portfolio. Though pre-mine and staking effects are subtler, both create a misleading perception of the scarcity of or demand for an asset. And both, though for different reasons, can lead to retail investors getting their faces ripped off: If you saw ViacomCBS spiking in March of last year and bought in, you wound up being Bill Hwang’s exit liquidity as he torched it from $97 down to $48 in just seven days. You could probably have a very therapeutic chat with a SafeMoon holder.  And let’s not forget the poor banks (heaven forbid!). Credit Suisse, for instance, shouldered the bulk of Archegos lender losses, eating $4.7 billion. That was in turn enough to knock nearly 18% off Credit Suisse’s stock price in a matter of days after Archegos fell. The bank was already troubled before this incident, and its stock has not recovered in the year since.  Bill Hwang may be a criminal, or he may have simply been playing the Wall Street game according to a set of unwritten but accepted rules – after all, in this day and age, cheating and lying are practically qualifications for working in high finance. Crypto has the distinct advantage of transparency – Hwang couldn’t have caused as much damage if he hadn’t concealed his levels of concentration and leverage. In most cases, similar behavior by a layer 1 or other protocol would be much more visible.

42395454,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxBQR,1651256786,"Labor Costs Jump by Most in 2 Decades, Adding to Inflationary Surge","U.S. employment costs jumped by the most in two decades, adding pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep inflation in check and possibly opening a new chapter in the bitcoin (BTC) market narrative.  The employment cost index (ECI), a lesser-known economic indicator that tracks wages and benefits, rose by 1.4% in this year's first quarter, according to a report published by the Labor Department Friday.  Labor costs increased 4.5% compared to a year ago. Analysts had expected a 4.3% jump.  This means that employers are paying workers 1.4% more on average than three months ago, signaling a tight labor market. Higher wage costs might add further pressure on inflation, already at at four-decade high of 8.5% – that has so far largely been blamed on supply-chain disruptions and commodity-price increases due to COVID-19 restrictions and, more recently, the Ukraine-Russia war.  Bitcoin traders and analysts monitor inflation because the largest cryptocurrency by market value is considered by some investors to be a hedge against inflation, or as a risky asset whose price can rise or fall depending on Federal Reserve monetary policy and the U.S. dollar's strength in foreign-exchange markets.  The labor market is currently at or near full employment, meaning that nearly everyone who wants to work has a job. There were 11.3 million job openings in February but only 5.4 million people were looking for a job that month.  The ECI is widely watched as an indicator of the current labor market situation. In essence, it measures inflation in wages. Especially during the Alan Greenspan era of the Fed, the ECI was seen as the most reliable measure to track labor costs.  Another index published Friday by the Commerce Department was the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred measure to track inflation.  The PCE, which tracks inflation in a more comprehensive way than the widely followed consumer price index (CPI), climbed 6.6%, up from 6.4% in February, a fresh 40-year high.  The Fed is widely expected to raise the benchmark U.S. interest rates by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) at its May meeting next week. In a panel hosted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that “it may be that the actual [inflation] peak was in March, but we don’t know that, so we’re not going to count on it.” He added that it might be appropriate to “move a little more quickly” in tightening monetary policy to keep inflationary pressures in check.  With the ECI growing at such a fast pace and PCE at a fresh high, analysts are increasingly expecting the Fed to raise its interest rate by 75 basis points in June, according to data from the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Market-implied odds of a 75 basis point increase in June are currently 99.1% versus 15.9% a month ago.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/29/labor-costs-jump-by-most-in-2-decades-adding-to-inflationary-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/579ac83cda935d874edca2f79b462705f8f5fe77-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407307,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxdol,1651255968,How Crypto Could Spearhead Retail Payments in 2022,"Since the release of the 2008 Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi, not one platform has actually achieved a significant impact in providing the underlying value proposition of bringing alternative payments into real everyday buying experience for the average customer.  There has been some movement, with Starbucks (SBUX), Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft (MSFT) among the big-name brands that started accepting cryptocurrencies in 2021. Many more retailers are attracted by crypto’s reduced fees, faster and safer transactions, and ability to extend customer choice over payments. Swiss firm AXA Insurance, for example, started accepting crypto payments after learning nearly a third of respondents it surveyed had or were interested in crypto investments.  Sesie Bonsi is the founder and CEO of payment platform Bleu. This article is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week.  The blockchain market size for retail is set to reach $4.6 billion by 2028, as more industry professionals see its value and strive to meet customer demands. Yet, large-scale corporations won’t be the only ones fueling this growth. Small and medium-sized businesses also reported a 75% increase in customers and suppliers asking for cryptocurrency as a payment option.  With the overwhelming majority of retailers being small businesses, which contribute 43.5% of the U.S. GDP and create two-thirds of new jobs yet hold little liquidity in expenses, and 70% of which anticipate taking financial aid, the case for crypto is clear. With inflation soaring, small businesses including retailers cannot just save by holding dollars and should look to cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin (BTC), as a scarce asset that can be safely secured. Bitcoin’s value grows faster than inflation and makes a strong alternative savings vehicle and allows businesses to have sufficient savings for their ability to cover large unexpected circumstances. For small businesses and retailers alike, it is imperative that they should accept crypto as an alternative form of payment from a purely economic perspective alone.  A changing demographic  Crypto went from niche to mainstream last year and is by no means slowing down. The adoption of cryptocurrencies is propelled by a wider cultural shift. As older people retire and younger generations enter the workforce, the buying preferences of this new cohort will shape the future of retail and finance.  Millennials turning 40 years old were some of the hardest hit by the previous decade’s financial crisis, but in aggregate have worked hard and invested savvily to reduce the wealth disparity incurred from their disadvantaged position.  Those born between 1981 and 1996 are also the largest number of digital asset investors, with 45% of this cohort owning crypto in 2022, compared to roughly 30% in the same period the year before.  And Gen Z is not far behind them. The soaring popularity of non-fungible tokens (used as profile pictures on social media) is one illustration of tech-native younger generations who, having invested in the digital sphere, are looking for more ways to use their wealth and display assets.  Read more: Bitcoin Payments Remain in Their Infancy but There Are Green Shoots Everywhere  Customer-centric experiences  All retailers want to keep their customers loyal. One way to do so is to cater to customer preferences with various payment options. Accepting only cash in 2022 feels like an almost deliberate retro-shoutout.  Providing crypto payments is one way to improve customer experience. It is especially significant for the 93% of crypto owners who say they would consider using crypto to make a purchase (while 57% have already made at least one crypto purchase in the last year).  Secure, in-store networks, mobile payments and biometric authentication may completely eradicate the need for traditional checkouts. Payment requests to a customer’s mobile device make paying in crypto as easy as with Visa (V), PayPal (PYPL) or any preferred digital payment option.  Stores of the future will be designed around these types of fluid, mobile-first and customer-centric experiences, so there’s no surprise nearly three-quarters of businesses surveyed see accepting new forms of payments as fundamental to their growth.  Conserving risk  Offering crypto payments comes with both pros and cons for merchants. Accepting cryptocurrency requires a certain amount of effort, whether by modifying retailers’ existing point-of-sale (POS) terminals or redesigning their entire shop floor.  Likewise, the volatility of cryptocurrencies make them a risk, and they can be subject to complicated tax rules and regulations.  This complexity often forces retailers to be specific in their terms and conditions and to have impeccable book-keeping – a benchmark that should be set across the industry.  Crypto isn’t alone in having structural problems: Fraudulent credit card transactions and ID theft increased by 35% during the coronavirus pandemic and small, independent businesses remain some of the greatest affected. Mobile device crypto payments could be a step towards security there: because they are customer-led transactions, rather than routing through third-parties, crypto reduces the attack vector for fraud opportunities.  In addition, blockchain transactions are final – both a blessing and a curse. Retailers may manage their cash flow better but also need to keep track of how much exactly each customer has paid in case of a refund.  Read more: The Lightning Network Is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin  Retail-led  Retail’s adoption of crypto will be driven mainly by customer demand, however, retail crypto-managers could help reshape the payment industry like social media managers previously transformed how we perceive and interact with brands online.  Early retail adopters at the forefront of establishing industry standards can help improve current best practices. While intimidating for some, those who invest early are more likely to reap the rewards of a loyal and passionate crypto-customer base.  Crypto is spearheading the future of retail payments by refocusing stores on creating fully immersive customer journeys. Never before in retail have communities been built based on payment type preference and now brands can reach new customers and tap into crypto communities by creating shopping experiences around community values.  Cryptocurrencies are already accepted online or at some traditional points of sale. Next, demand for further use will push retailers to redesign stores and checkout experiences with consumer preferences in mind.

42421174,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd54v,1651255599,Alex Adelman: The Rewards of Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22 is fast approaching. It will mark the 12th anniversary of an annual celebration of Bitcoin and a solemn parable for the virtue of HODLing. (Laszlo Hanyecz spent 100,000 bitcoin (BTC) on two pizzas, crypto that’s now worth upwards of $4 billion.)  A decade ago, Bitcoin was considered a digital payment system (rather than the store of value narrative today), and Bitcoin enthusiasts would spend hundreds of bitcoins (then worth only couple of bucks) on everyday items like coffee and pizza.  But times have changed. These days bitcoiners typically want to acquire as much bitcoin as possible – or “stack sats” as they call it. And what could be an efficient way of stacking sats? Alex Adelman, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin rewards company Lolli, thinks he’s unlocked the answer. Lolli lets people earn up to 12% back in bitcoin when they make purchases using U.S. dollars from companies like Nike, Adidas, eBay and many more.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  Adelman has a long track record in e-commerce. In 2017, he was selected to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for the retail and e-commerce category. So his journey to launching Lolli is anything but a coincidence. He was previously the CEO and co-founder of Cosmic (acquired by PopSugar, then Ebates), an e-commerce infrastructure company. At Cosmic, Adelman and his co-founder invented the ""buy button,” which has now become a common piece of online architecture.  As an economics major, he was influenced by Muhammed Yunus’ microfinance experiments in Bangladesh, which demonstrated (among other things) how access to mobile phones can empower the poor. Adelman’s approach to Bitcoin comes from a similar conviction: The idea that Bitcoin as a software is a powerful financial force that could unleash trickle-up economics. And for that reason, he’s passionate about creating a way for people to get their hands on their first bitcoin – or satoshis (sats) – that doesn’t involve investing, which tends to turn off plenty of risk-averse people.  Adelman, a speaker at CoinDesk’s Consensus festival in June, spoke with CoinDesk from Miami, Florida, where he attended the Bitcoin Conference 2022.  So right now, you’re in Miami because of the Bitcoin Conference. Do you see Miami becoming the Bitcoin city as Mayor Suarez hopes it to be?  Miami's definitely compelling. There's a lot of really nice parts of Miami, but I think Miami has some catching up to do with New York.  But I think a lot of the young kids, the 20 to 30 year olds, are moving to New York overwhelmingly. It's impossible to get a lease right now in New York, and all these builders want to live in a cool, fun, young city. I think there's so much going on around Web 3, Bitcoin, crypto, and NFTs. That's happening in New York because it's such a cultural hub. A lot of investors or people who have already made money are moving to Miami, but I'm not seeing the true builders – the engineers, the founders – move there overwhelmingly.  The sad thing is that New York, on a regulatory side, has been a laggard. It's probably the worst place to build, on a regulatory standpoint, a company. But then, from a talent perspective, there are so many brilliant people, executives and hard working individuals that have deep experience in financial technology, engineering and security that I think New York is still the best place to scale a financial company – a fintech company. I think that e-commerce, retail, everything is in New York.  I have a hard time thinking about moving the company to Miami, but there's a lot of really interesting things happening in Miami and, clearly, things like conferences, everybody flocks here, and it seems really great. But I personally love being in New York, and I love having a presence in North Carolina as well, which is where I'm from.  It's interesting to think how cultural factors can be more important when it comes to making a decision on where to be based rather than macro considerations, like political, regulatory factors.  Yeah, it's really tough to be building. We're pushing regulators to really make New York a more Bitcoin-friendly state, and New York City a more Bitcoin-friendly city. I think (Mayor) Eric Adams has big plans to make it a hub of innovation, but it has a long way to go. They have to get rid of BitLicense.  I think that New York has a long way to go to get to a point where it is attracting businesses to be started there because right now we're losing out to other [places]. Wyoming and specifically, Miami, are doing a really good job of attracting this next wave of people. It's going to be like a flag theory type approach, where every state is going to compete to have the best talent. And states that don't, will get left behind. I think it's gonna be interesting to see how that develops.  What about North Carolina, your home state?  North Carolina is kind of in between. We're working with regulators in North Carolina as well, but they're just slow moving. There's not a lot of tech-world leadership in North Carolina. We're constantly educating people. The Research Triangle has this amazing talent if you treat it as one city. It has more Ph.D.s per capita than any place in the country, and it's such a hub of innovation. And we're just gonna keep losing people if we don't actually be a crypto-forward state, and specifically, a city. Personally, I think North Carolina has everything to gain and everything to lose. I've been pushing regulators to be more forward-thinking. And I might just have to get more involved in politics in order to actually create real action there!  How was the Bitcoin Conference this year? Last year, there were lots of weird clips or anecdotes from the Bitcoin Conference, right? I mean, we had this dogecoin guy who went up on stage. We had Max Keiser who yelled “f**k Elon” and a bunch of other stuff. Like, none of it happened this year, or maybe it didn't make it to Twitter – was that your experience as well?  Yeah, I wonder if security was tighter or something like that, but it was massive. There were so many people. I don't know the final count, but I heard it was estimated at 40,000 people. I have been going since they started the Bitcoin Conference, and it's just night and day. Just amazing to see how many more people joined, and it was way less, to your point, chaotic in a really nice way. It was just a very well organized conference and just a lot of really good people.  Another really cool thing about the conference this year is that a ton of bankers were there, merchants were there, and traditional investors. I had never seen so many legitimate people from the outside industries who were there, and looking to partner with Bitcoin companies. That was really cool and very different.  When did you start going to the conference?  I believe 2018 was their first conference, and we had just launched Lolli – the first Bitcoin rewards company out there – and the immediate reception was amazing. The Bitcoin community was incredibly welcoming. I think that a lot of bitcoiners are constantly looking for a use case for bitcoin, outside of just store value. Lolli created a very innovative way of talking about bitcoin, and making bitcoin a part of everyday life. Now, we’re part of the ecosystem.  We’re in a market slump right now. Do you find it to be ironically bullish for Lolli because now people have more purchasing power, so they get more bitcoin for their buck?  Yeah, there's kind of a meme internally in our community where it's a “stack the dip,” that’s what a lot of people say. When bitcoin is down, it's “stack the dip,” and then when bitcoin is up, a lot of people will talk about their earnings doubling or increasing 5%, 10%.  And with most cash back systems, you get your $5 in cashback, and it's $5 – you're not even accounting for inflation. When you get $5 in bitcoin, and it goes up, people get really excited about it. More and more people talk about the rewards and how much they've gone up. We've even had this phrase that our users call “the Lolli effect,” and it's when the reward is paid for the item you bought. The item becomes free because your purchasing power is so great with bitcoin that you've accumulated. Since we launched, bitcoin is up about 9x as of today, a lot of people have already had their items mostly paid for with their bitcoin rewards.  Do you feel like Lolli helped onboard people onto Bitcoin, or is it the bitcoiners who use your product, and so you’re kind of preaching to the converted?  I think over 50% of our users, from what we can tell, never had bitcoin before. They're looking at Lolli as a risk-free way of getting into bitcoin. And the nice thing about the natural user experience is that, because people shop all the time, people don't really invest all the time. But everybody shops and everybody does it all the time.  The other nonobvious thing about our product is that we're bringing merchants that never touch crypto into the space as well. I estimate less than 10 of our 1,100 partners actually accept crypto. We have over 1,100 partners today. For a lot of merchants, we’re their first interaction with bitcoin.  Would it be a trade secret if I asked how you managed to convince all those big players like eBay to partner with Lolli?  Great question! I previously started a company called Cosmic, and we built a buy button technology. And that company sold primarily to merchants in North America. I made these merchants a lot of money. When I was starting this company, I had already sort of built their trust. I came in and asked for a lot of favors, and was able to get 500 merchants to launch. Then the data started coming back, that we were really doing well to drive sales and increased conversion rates, so the merchants ended up really loving what we were doing.  And you studied economics at Chapel Hill. Which is funny, right, because people who study economics don’t often end up being bitcoiners since it’s a very doctrinal discipline. Would you say your economics training maybe make it hard for you to be “orange-pilled”?  The way my brain works is, I question everything, I’m very skeptical of things, and I don't take experts as truth. A lot of my teachers were Keynesian – very classic, old-school economists. I felt like a lot of the things that they were teaching were outdated. I didn't really agree a lot of times or really understand, to be honest, monetary policy. I felt like it was sort of this black box that they tried to rationalize with 60% accuracy. I was more curious with the 40%: What was happening in the unknowns, what were the behavioral sides, and how are we basing monetary policy on these sort of archaic beliefs?  Fast forward a little bit, I just felt like I was constantly questioning a lot that was going on at university. And then I really got into microfinance and everything that the Grameen Bank was doing in Bangladesh. Muhammad Yunus was working on this experiment that I was studying, where he gave the poorest woman in every village a cell phone and saw the trickle-up economics that would occur from that initiative. It was really impactful for me in my learnings, and I've been building technology since I was 12 – professionally, since I was 16. I kept thinking, “Okay, well, what do I want to build that's going to contribute to giving people - everybody – technology that's going to enable them?”  I ended up starting a company with this idea for Cosmic in college and then started really working on it after college. Then, we built the first dynamic “buy button” that lets merchants sell their products in different channels, anywhere, trying to open up and democratize commerce for merchants.  In 2013, I ended up learning about Bitcoin when I was crashing on couches, and I ended up getting really excited about the idea that you could connect 4.5 billion people with an internet connection through money. And it brought me back to the early days of learning about economics and seeing a monetary policy that everybody had the same rules on. And everybody understood, it was dead simple.  It didn't take an economics degree or Ph.D. to understand what was actually happening – it was like, there's only 21 million of these things. Everybody that you know can see the code base, everyone has the same rules, and it's actually way simpler than the monetary policy that I was learning that fiat institutions were built on for the last few decades.  There's this liberating power of cell phones in some of the poorest parts of the world, isn’t there? Did you perhaps also see Bitcoin as a financially liberating software – like how a cell phone is as a hardware.  Absolutely. Going back to the example of the Grameen Bank, giving the poorest woman in every village in Bangladesh a cell phone is not too different from giving somebody a Bitcoin wallet. You give someone a Bitcoin wallet, and that person now has access to a bank – they now have access to hold their own money, to hold their own keys.  That sort of financial empowerment, I think we're going to see this trickle-up economics where now, 100% of people that have an internet connection immediately have a bank; they have a right to a bank, and no one can take that away from them. That is so incredibly powerful, it's going to do so much good for the world, and there’s no stopping anytime soon. I'm incredibly excited for that future and it's really not too different from the initiatives of the Grameen Bank back in the day.  You said you found out about Bitcoin in 2013. That was a time when people would enthusiastically spend bitcon on coffee or pizza. And now the irony is, people don’t want to spend their bitcoin! And at Lolli, you’re in the business of getting people to spend fiat, and earning bitcoin in return. Funny contrast from the time you first found out about bitcoin, isn’t it?  It's a really cool contrast. It's also kind of questioning everything, right? Reading the original white paper of Bitcoin was incredibly inspiring for me, and what I think it will eventually do. But it was a hypothetical of a future world where we lived on a bitcoin standard, and people were able to pay for things with bitcoin – we don't live in that world.  My extrapolative interpretation of the Bitcoin paper was very different from most people, where it was like, “How do we get there? How do we fill in the gaps?” I think a lot about behavioral psychology and behavioral economics, and how do you study what people are doing every day? And then how do you get somebody to change their behavior? It's incredibly difficult.  Before we started Lolli, there were no bitcoin rewards companies. It was just people buying bitcoin as an investment. And so I was like, if you're just doing it as buying, and you're just doing it as payments, no one wants to pay with something that's going up.  Like, you're not going in paying with your Apple stock, right? You're buying Apple stock, you're holding it, because it's life changing and hypothetically, it will go up as the market goes up, and you're making an investment. No one thinks to use that as a payment mechanism. That's how everybody was thinking about Bitcoin for most of the time.  There was no business case for merchant payments, so I was powering a lot of these cashback rewards coupon companies, with my last company being a buy button technology. I was listening to their problems and also listened to a lot of their successes.  Wait you mentioned this before, so I have to ask: what does it mean to be the inventor of … buy button?  My co-cook, Matt Senter, and I were the creators of the first dynamic buy button, and PayPal created a payments button that lets you pay on a merchant site. But my definition of a buy button – I think most people's definition of a buy button – is being able to buy anywhere. In order to do that, you needed to create an abstraction of that payment outside of the site. PayPal never did that, no one ever did that. What we did is … we created that. For the first time, a merchant through APIs could create a direct connection into their back end and sell an actual product backed by actual inventory outside of their site. That was what we really created.  Also, keep in mind this is 2011. Now, buy buttons are everywhere. But before Instagram, Pinterest, Google, nobody was buying outside of each other's sites, right?  Alright, since we talked a lot about Bitcoin and also mentioned the white paper … a hard question for you: Who’s Satoshi?  Who invented Bitcoin is a controversial and complex question. To be honest, I like this idea that it doesn't matter who made it as long as that wallet never moves. I think that there are a lot of conspiracy theories out there of “Who did it? Why did they do it?” So far, that wallet hasn't moved in a very long time. And it doesn't quite matter because proof-of-work is working, it's just an incredibly distributed network of miners and nodes and everything. The best part is that we don't know who Satoshi is. And it doesn't matter at this point who he is or who they are.  I have my theories, but I think those theories matter very little of who it would possibly be. And what they actually created and put out in the world was this near-perfect financial system and the start of a revolution of data and money.  It would be an absolute chaos if those Satoshi wallets suddenly moved one day though, right? Like, the worst day in crypto kind of situation.  It would probably be pretty crazy if someone moved those wallets. It's always interesting to kind of think in hypotheticals, like what would happen? It's fascinating, but I think it’s for the best that no one touches it and it doesn't move.  Okay before Bitcoin and before that long journey in e-commerce, a long time ago, you worked as a cook, didn’t you? Crypto and food are my two passions, so I’m gonna have to ask you for some culinary “alpha leak” as a former kitchen professional.  Oh my god, I love cooking! It's my favorite pastime. I love throwing dinner parties. My first job, when I was 15, was as a cook – my first real job. I was building software on the side. But my parents were like, “Okay, go get a real job at a restaurant”. And yeah, I started working as a cook and had a really good time, learned a lot about cooking. My family really loves cooking and it was a really cool experience.  Let’s see, some alpha ... I'm not typically a cookbook person, but I got a really good cookbook that I've learned a lot from, it's ""The Food Lab"" by J. Kenji López-Alt. It's very digestible – no pun intended – molecular gastronomy. It teaches you the science of cooking, which gives you this really good understanding of everything. It teaches you the basics of where proteins break down, and how to cook eggs and mother sauces.  I think it teaches you the basics, so that you can extrapolate into other things and get really comfortable in the kitchen. Because once you know the science of cooking, I think it makes all cooking and sort of the experimentation behind cooking really easy. Thank you for asking that! What do you like to cook?  Oh, I mostly cook Turkish stuff – I’m originally from Turkey – and I also like Asian stuff like Thai or Sichuanese. And also lots of French classics.  Turkish food - amazing. Too late in my life, I learned and started to enjoy Turkish breakfast!  And in Thailand of all places! There was this Turkish family that opened up an incredible Turkish restaurant outside in Phuket, and I had been eating Thai food for two weeks. This place was highly reviewed randomly, I went there and just had one of the best meals in my life. And then the people there were so kind and so friendly. Their Turkish family was visiting, it was just a really cool, communal event. And I was like, “Oh, wow, I have to get into Turkish food.” So now I'll go and I'll seek out Turkish breakfast if I see a good spot.  That's amazing. So an American trying Turkish food in Thailand. That's globalization for you, right?  Exactly. Yeah, it's pretty crazy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/29/alex-adelman-the-rewards-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60296ddecf9dbd6d62923ff7a6a64df9724a64b5-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421608,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiGD,1651254533,Crypto’s Diversity Problem: It’s Complicated,"We all know the stereotype: The archetypal cryptocurrency fanatic is the “crypto bro,” a white, male software engineer or finance professional who has suddenly come into an unreasonable amount of money.  In reality, there’s much more nuance and variety among the cast of quirky characters who make up the crypto community than that simplistic one-dimensional portrayal allows. Yet, it would still be a glaring mistake to deny that crypto has a diversity issue.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Surveys routinely show that at least twice as many owners of cryptocurrency are men than are women. And while this recent one from BlockFi pointed to a pickup in interest among women, there’s no undoing the fact that it was predominantly men who got in on the ground floor when BTC, ETH, SOL, et al. were priced at a sliver of where they are now.  Power, in terms of resource allocation, is even more biased in this space. You’ll see in it any cursory glance at the “team” page of most leading crypto projects’ websites. The CoinDesk events programming team is reminded of it every day as it struggles to achieve gender and racial diversity among the speakers at our Consensus Festival in June. My podcast co-host, Sheila Warren, alludes to it this week in describing the occupants of the flight that took her to the SALT-FTX conference in the Bahamas this week. It’s a fact: White men dominate crypto.  To critics of this movement, the monochrome appearance of the community offers a weapon with which to rebut the “crypto for good” language around financial inclusion, empowering underserved people and democratizing money.  Yet, that surface-level assessment misses some striking new adoption trends that aren’t easily apparent to mainstream commentators. Minorities and various other marginalized groups are turning to crypto as a tool and developing unique, new innovative uses for it – often at a faster pace than communities that have traditionally had more privileged access to resources. This experience demands a careful approach to fostering diversity. We must not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  Decentralized progress  The current rate of new crypto adoption in Africa and Latin America is phenomenal, and by some measures outpacing the West. It’s matched with new hubs of crypto innovation in developing countries such as the Philippines, where the Axie Infinity boom saw the expansion of play-to-earn gaming models.  Similarly, crypto usage by Black Americans is booming as a new ethos around “Black Bitcoin,” the title of Isaiah Jackson’s influential book, starts to emerge. Last year, a USA Today/Harris poll found that 23% of Black Americans and 17% of Hispanic Americans owned cryptocurrencies, compared with only 11% for white Americans.  At the same time, artists of color are embracing the non-fungible token market, adding weight to the thesis that previously marginalized classes of creators are using NFTs to bypass traditional funding intermediaries such as film studios, record labels and art galleries and set the terms of their own success.  Meanwhile, minority-focused decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) are springing up with the goal of giving certain people a leg up through collective bargaining power. One example is the UnicornDAO founded by Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova, which calls itself ""a feminist movement aiming to tackle patriarchy in Web 3"" and plans to solely invest in female, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ artists in Web 3.  These stories of growth and innovation are a direct outcome of crypto’s disintermediating capacity and its model of permissionless development. There are no gatekeepers telling minority developers, business people or creators what to do; the builders will just build whatever they want. It’s why each story is unique, an experience that’s tailored to the needs of specific communities – a direct reflection of decentralization.  Finding balance  In discussing these successes on this week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast episode, our guests Susan Joseph, executive director of fintech at Cornell University, and Cleve Mesidor, executive director of the Blockchain Foundation, agreed that any efforts to further diversify the industry must not come at the expense of enabling this kind of open innovation.  It would also be a mistake to conclude that these stories imply we should do nothing at all to address diversity in crypto – as might be claimed by those in the crypto space who subscribe to an absolutist laissez-faire economics.  That’s because while there’s diversity in the growth and innovation occurring at the application or product/service layer – where African developers provide payment solutions to local users, for example – the situation is very different at the base protocol layer. There, power – as measured by value held in base tokens such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) – remains concentrated in white, male hands.  This matters because that ownership defines the governance structure of the crypto ecosystem built upon those protocols. This power concentration is especially problematic with proof-of-stake consensus algorithms such as Solana, Algorand and others. And we know from the Bitcoin block-size debate (circa 2015) that owners of cryptocurrency wield ultimate power over proof-of-work systems as well.  This matters because the code that runs these protocols’ algorithms is not some neutral factor upon which users can simply “trust in math, not humans.” Rather, it reflects the interests of those who get to define how that code is written. It contains their biases.  So, if these systems are to one day evolve into overarching, society-wide frameworks for finance and economic value transfer, it’s vital they are governed by as wide a group as possible.  How we get there is another issue.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | SOL,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | SOL,Michael J.

The token peaked at $3.64, just 13% off its all-time high in February. The token increased by nearly 60% in the space of a few hours after Binance's listing went live earlier Friday. Nexo has since retreated to trade at around $2.33, but is still up 6% over the last 24 hours. The token's market capitalization is $1.3 billion.  Pablo Jódar, financial products manager at Storm Partners, a systems provider for the cryptocurrency space in Europe, said Nexo got a positive tailwind from the recent partnership announcement with Mastercard (MA). The credit card company unveiled a crypto-backed payments card that allows users to spend without having to sell their digital assets, and offers customers 2% cash back on their transactions.  “This partnership puts Nexo a step closer to becoming a crypto bank to help retail clients access the digital space,” Jódar said.  “This was also a positive week for the crypto-lending space, as Goldman Sachs [GS] announced [it] executed the first fiat loan” backed by bitcoin (BTC), Jódar said.

Crypto markets are too small and their regulation too immature to move ahead, the Paris-based watchdog said, after being asked by the European Commission whether to expand an existing regulatory toolkit for macroprudential risks to areas like cyber security, climate change and crypto.  “The EBA considers it premature to introduce new macroeconomic tools to address the systemic aspects of these risks at this stage,” the EBA said. “The EBA emphasizes the need for monitoring of the crypto-asset sector, in particular identifying old and new mechanisms, vulnerabilities and risks that can make crypto assets a source of systemic risk or threat to financial stability.""  Noting growing consumer interest and the emergence of stablecoins, and with a new European Union law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) set to be finalized soon, the EBA said it will map crypto-asset activities within the bloc – potentially leading to further regulatory action. Macroprudential policy gives powers to ban banks from overexposure to particular sectors if they worry there could be a wider impact on the economy.  The suggestion from the EBA, which in March warned consumers to think twice before staking money on crypto, follows comments from officials at the Bank of England that it is also considering extending macro measures to cover virtual assets.  The commission’s idea has previously got a mixed reception from among the EU’s 27 member countries.  In a letter dated March 17, Swedish authorities said it wasn’t clear if existing rules were enough to tackle crypto risks. Just four days later, the Italian central bank suggested keeping the focus on more traditional policies that look at individual banks, as crypto exposures are “currently tiny ... the use of crypto assets for payments is limited to niche groups.""

The guidance is the first of its kind from the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement, also known as the J5. Founded in 2018, the J5 is made up of representatives of tax agencies from Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the U.S., and is tasked with sharing information and coordinating operations to fight international tax crime.  Scams and fraud abound in the crypto markets, and NFTs are no different. Various crimes and bad behavior, from wash trading to forgery to money laundering to straight-up theft, have become increasingly common in the NFT markets.  In the document released Thursday, the J5 listed 24 “red flags” for NFT marketplaces, split between “strong” and “moderate” indications of potential fraud.  In the J5’s “strong” indicators of potential fraud, law enforcement is encouraged to watch out for phishing scams, fake token giveaways, social media impersonation and other signs of potential wash trading and money laundering, such as “NFTs being sold for large sums and reacquired from the same party or a third party for smaller amounts.”  The “moderate” indicators include things such as non-existent contract addresses, missing information in the project’s description fields and re-used code within the NFT. The document notes that all these indicators have appeared in real projects, and are not alone indications of crime. However, they should be taken into consideration when deciding whether a project is legitimate.

The ETH2 deposit contract was established in November 2020 and presently accounts for around 10% of the overall circulating supply of ETH. The Beacon Chain is the first significant progress in Ethereum&apos;s shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Despite numerous delays during the past year, the largest Beacon Chain contract, valued at $34.5 billion, illustrates the strong demand and confidence in the future ETH2.0 network. To be a validator in the ETH network, you&apos;ll need 32 ETH tokens. Alternative techniques for depositing via liquidity pools do, however, provide smaller staking intervals for individuals who lack access to 32 ETH coins.

This is due to a growing demand for interoperability between blockchains; as well as the continued development and adoption of Polkadot itself. Polkadot&apos;s developers are working hard on ensuring that the platform will be able to support a wide variety of transactions, including those involving multiple blockchains. This is a complex task, but if successful, it could make Polkadot the go-to platform for blockchain interoperability. As more people and organizations begin to use Polkadot, its price is likely to continue to rise. If Polkadot can successfully become the standard for blockchain interoperability, we can expect to see it consistently trade for over $1,000 in the next few years. What is Polkadot (DOT)? Polkadot is a new blockchain network that aims to improve the scalability and interoperability of blockchains. It will allow different blockchains to work together, regardless of their underlying design or consensus algorithm. This could help create a more decentralized internet by allowing multiple blockchain networks to be connected through Polkadot. Polkadot was founded by Gavin Wood, the former co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) of Ethereum, and his team at Web3 Foundation.

42407289,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSpd,1651242531,How to Spend Your Crypto Using Bitrefill’s Gift Card Platform,"There’s still a long way ahead of us until we can pay directly with cryptocurrency for everyday purchases at the grocery store, in a coffee shop or on our vacations.  For crypto enthusiasts who want to live off their digital assets, Bitrefill is a possible solution.  Bitrefill and its gift cards are one of the oldest players facilitating crypto payments. Founded in 2015 by Sergej Kotliar, Michael Grünberger and Michel Gustavsson, the company’s goal is to enable people to spend cryptocurrency to buy everyday items online and in stores as well.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week.  What you can buy with Bitrefill?  Bitrefill sells gift cards that you can use as vouchers to buy electronics, groceries, clothing, phone refills – even accommodations and flights for your next vacation.  To be clear, these gift cards are not physical cards, but rather a voucher you’ll receive via email which you can redeem when paying for products at partnered merchants.  Currently, there are more than 4,500 merchants in 186 countries integrated in the network, according to the company’s website, including major brands such as Amazon, Airbnb, Domino’s, Netflix, Nike, T-Mobile, Walmart and many more.  There are two key product groups in Bitrefill’s offering:  Gift cards for vouchers.  Prepaid phone refills.  Akin to a credit card, every time you buy a gift card or a phone refill, you earn at least a 1% cashback reward, but some merchants offer rewards as high as 10%.  One thing to note is that you’ll receive these rewards in the form of the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC). This allows users to accumulate bitcoin and later redeem their savings for purchases, if desired.  Bitrefill uses Bitcoin’s secondary payment layer called the Lightning Network, which settles transactions instantly and virtually free of charge.  The platform is also integrated into Strike, the payments application that uses the Lightning Network. Those who pay for Bitrefill vouchers with Strike can get a 5% cashback in bitcoin.  Read more: What Can You Buy With Bitcoin?  How to buy gift cards with Bitrefill  There’s no need to open an account at Bitrefill to get a gift card – you just need an email address.  Here are the simple steps to get a gift card:  Pick a merchant on Bitrefill’s website where you want a gift card/phone refill from.  Select the amount and select the currency or crypto you want to pay with.  Type in the email address you want to receive the voucher.  Scan the QR code and send the payment to Bitrefill.  The method is pretty much the same if you want to refill your phone. Pick your merchant, select the refill amount (in some cases, you have to choose from set amounts) and currency, and you will get the voucher in your inbox.  It’s also possible to purchase a voucher as a gift. For that, click the ""Buy Gift"" button on the product page and fill in the required fields, choose between instant or scheduled delivery time and then click on “add to cart.”  Bitrefill accepts a bunch of traditional fiat currencies such as U.S. dollars, euros, Indian rupees and more. It also allows users to pay for products with the following cryptocurrencies:  bitcoin  ether  litecoin  dogecoin  dash  tether (USDT)  When you use fiat currencies for payment, the service provider charges a small percentage fee to convert the amount into cryptocurrency. As an example, the service fee for a $10 purchase is 60 cents.  Read more: How to Gift Bitcoin, NFTs and Other Crypto  How to use Bitrefill rewards  After every purchase, you can get back 1% to 10% of your payment as a reward in satoshis, the smallest fraction of bitcoin.  While gift card purchases only require an email address, users will need to create an account if they want to redeem the rewards.  For signing up, you will need an email address and a password.  Once you have collected enough rewards, you can use them for payments. Here’s how:  First, make sure you are logged into your account to access the rewards.  Go to the product page, pick an item you want to buy and add to the cart.  When you pay for the cart, change the payment method to Rewards Balance.  Then confirm the payment method on the payment page.  If the amount of your rewards isn’t enough to fund the whole purchase, it’s possible to combine them with another payment method.  For a step-by-step guide, visit Bitrefill’s tutorial.

42411117,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gizUX8,1651239098,How to Build Decentralized Twitter,"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s bid to acquire Twitter (TWTR) has resurrected longstanding discussions in the cryptoverse regarding, at least to date, a largely theoretical product category: “decentralized social media.”  Just as bitcoin (BTC) is censorship-resistant money, the theory goes, so, too, can we use bitcoin-like infrastructure to run censorship-resistant social media applications! While creating a social media app is trivially easy, running a successful social media business is extraordinarily hard.  Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. A version of this article originally published on Byrne's website.  I should know: Back in 2014, Casey Kuhlman, Tyler Jackson and I proposed a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) called “Eris” that was basically a distributed version of Reddit that could run on a blockchain – Ethereum POC 3, to be precise. That project failed for a number of reasons – not least because in 2014 the market couldn’t tell the difference between a smart contract and a Pop Tart – as most decentralized social media projects have and will.  The problems with attempts to “decentralize Facebook” are both technological and legal. For one, decentralized applications rarely scale. Facebook generates over 4 petabytes of data per day. That is simply too much information for any serious number of nodes to bother mirroring. Even federated platforms like Mastodon, which ride the line between decentralized bitcoin and centralized Facebook, run into bottlenecks.  Blockchains solve the problem of censorship at the edges, but are likely too-overbuilt and redundant to manage massive, global communications platforms. Likewise, it’s essential to be able to delete posts – from the inane to the hotheaded – from platforms like Twitter.  See also: Elon Musk Shouldn't Lead Twitter | Opinion  Where things get really messy, however, is where technology intersects with the law. Decentralized social media is likely possible, but the form it takes will be shaped by existing statutes, regulations and norms.  Social media companies, as it turns out, are subject to a bevy of regulations. These rules govern the destruction and reporting of illegal content, copyright issues, data protection and mandatory disclosure of subscriber records, among other things. They also vary country by country. All these factors need to be accounted for in any “decentralized” social media application’s design.  Unlawful content  One obstacle for decentralized applications is the problem of “unlawful material.”  In the United States and across the world, the most uniformly illegal content is child sexual abuse material – or CSAM, as it is referred to by law enforcement. Despite the fact that the penalties for knowingly hosting this material are extreme, ranging from heavy fines to lengthy terms of imprisonment, the crypto industry’s response to this very longstanding internet problem has more or less been to completely ignore it.  Reddit, Twitter and Facebook, which host user content, take a proactive approach to eliminating this type of illegal material. Federal law requires “electronic communication service providers”– likely including both blockchain node operators as well as traditional, centralized service providers – to remove CSAM on discovery, securely preserve it for 90 days and then destroy it.  Overseas, where there is no such thing as the First Amendment, even broader categories of “unlawful content” exist. See, for example, the German Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, or “NetzDG,” which requires operators of social media services to register with the government and, after reaching a certain scale, to abide by takedown requests; the French Law no. 2020-766 against hate content on the internet, which imposes fines for failing to remove unlawful content, including “terrorist” content, within one hour of posting; or Section 5 of the Defamation Act 2013 in the United Kingdom, which has a notice-and-takedown procedure for alleged defamation similar to the U.S. DMCA.  Where services like Reddit and Facebook are very responsive to all the above requests and requirements; blockchain-based services, like StorJ or Sia, to my knowledge, have no such controls. They permit the storage of encrypted data without the creation of a subscriber record or the means for the service provider – in this case, the node operator – to ascertain what data is being stored.  It is probable, and I would suggest even likely, that decentralized data storage services are currently being used to host unlawful content, likely without the knowledge of the node operator hosting it. This level of willful blindness would be a complete non-starter for a “decentralized” social media app, which must be designed in such a way that an otherwise law-abiding user can participate in the network while being secure in the knowledge he or she is not violating local law.  See also: Porn, Mastercard Moderation and How Bitcoin Doesn't Fix It | Opinion  So far, no blockchain solution with a storage component even attempts to address this issue. It must be, for nobody will run a node for a decentralized service if doing so risks imprisonment.  Intellectual property  Similarly, our intellectual property regime is not well suited to use in decentralized fashion.  Social media node operators – being entities “offering the transmission, routing or providing of connections for digital online communications … of material of the user’s choosing, without modification to the content of the material as sent or received” – are “service providers” for the purposes of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and publishers under the Copyright Act.  They therefore need to consider their own exposure for hosting material which might give rise to a copyright infringement claim. At minimum, addressing this issue will require a decentralized implementation of the DMCA’s notice-and-takedown procedure for any third party content hosted on a node.  It’s also possible copyright trolls will ravage node operators in repeated bad-faith attempts to extort small dollar settlements. This might result in decentralized applications that do not support images or video – being the types of copyrightable subject matter which is most often used by vexatious copyright enforcement law firms – at all.  It is difficult to speculate what kind of infringements and enforcement one might encounter in a communications medium which does not yet exist. Judging from what we see in Web 2, however, the presence of copyright trolls in Web 3 is a virtual certainty as soon as it becomes profitable for them to be there.  Data protection and disclosure  A further issue arises when we consider that a person participating in a decentralized network may, in the course of operating his or her node, acquire large quantities of subscriber data.  Node operators may be seen as “providers of an electronic communication service” for the purposes of the Stored Communications Act and therefore may be required to hand over records on their computers to the government without a warrant – at least, to the extent that those records pertain to third parties that are within a node operator’s possession and control.  Users are unlikely to want to run a network that invites this degree of intrusion into their personal lives. Applications will need to be designed so that they hold as little third-party data as possible on their nodes.  Some rough conclusions on the design of a future decentralized social media network  All of the issues identified above share one factor in common: Social media requires a degree of censorship and deletion – not immutable, globally-shared pools of information. Decentralized tech like Bitcoin is designed in such a way as to render deletion impossible or prohibitively expensive. A decentralized Twitter will not, therefore, look anything like Bitcoin.  The need for content removal and moderation – whether due to criminal liability, civil liability or simple usability – will be the single most important factor in the design of any decentralized social media system. At minimum, the centrality of content moderation to the social media user experience means that simply dumping everything on the blockchain, as Bitclout does, and then replicating it across every single node of the network, as Sam Bankman-Fried may want, with on-chain pointers to IPFS for everything else, is simply not going to work.  See also: IPFS, Filecoin and the Long-Term Risks of Storing NFTs | Opinion  My hunch is that the first truly successful “decentralized” social media system will not try to be an all-singing, all-dancing world computer but rather will have its users replicate the absolute bare minimum viable information required for the network to function. The “blockchain” piece, if any, should be relegated to providing a register of usernames and associated public keys, and very little else.  It will also likely limit the kind of data users host to plaintext, for the most part. This is a low-liability proposition from the perspective of criminal, copyright and data protection law. It is also much lighter on bandwidth and will be easier to transmit peer to peer.  Video and image hosting, simply due to the sheer quantity of data involved, will likely be outsourced anyway, much as it is now. There are plenty of third-party platforms (Bitchute, Cozy, Odysee) that have lax, but not non-existent, content moderation policies for video content. These could address the gap in the market currently served by establishment outfits like YouTube.  All a decentralized social media system would need to do to serve that content is not block links to those services.  What moderation exists would be up to the users – they could control what content they see by operating their own whitelist/blacklist of third-party content providers (libs could block all the right-leaning sites, and the cons could block all of the lib media, for example). The decentralized system would then become just another source of referral traffic to these websites.  I could be wrong, of course. Some wunderkind somewhere could, as we speak, be writing a 6,000-word blog post on a “Zk-Dork proof-of-shark sharding” social media proposal to be built on some all-singing, all-dancing, Ethereum-like Rube Goldberg machine that will solve all scaling problems by magic. My hunch, however, is that simpler answers are more likely to be the right ones. “Decentralized social media” is likely to be more like RSS than Ethereum.  Whilst this sketch describes an imperfect solution to the censorship debate, an imperfect solution might nonetheless be a sufficient one. Most of the politically motivated “censorship” that occurs on Twitter and Facebook is not of images and videos, but of links to third-party websites, the plain-text expression of wrongthink, and of digital identities themselves (see the unpersoning of Alex Jones).  See also: Why Crypto Networks Should Preserve Russian Propaganda | Opinion  A solution to the censorship problem likely needs to ensure mainly that text, links and identity are uncensorable – the text and links by being self-hosted and the identity by being immutable. If we frame the problem to that limited set of issues I think a usable version of decentralized Twitter is achievable in the very near future.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Preston J.

We came up with this Stellar price prediction based on a number of factors, including market predictions and fundamental analysis. In addition to an expected increase in the usage of the platform; the coin became more popular. In addition, the development team is constantly working on improving the platform and adding new features. This will also contribute to the appreciation of the stellar price. What is Stellar Lumens (XLM)? In short, Stellar is a decentralized protocol that enables you to send and receive money in any pair of currencies. Decentralized means there&apos;s no central authority like a bank or government controlling the network. In practice, this means anyone can build applications on Stellar without getting permission first. Stellar is also unique in that it allows you to send any currency to anyone else in the world, instantly, for almost no cost. This means that if you want to send euros to a friend in Japan, you can pay your friend directly using dollars. Your friend won&apos;t have to exchange the dollars for yen on an exchange, and you won&apos;t have to pay any fees. All of this works because the Stellar network uses something called an anchor to hold each currency.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin eyes monthly loss. The Federal Reserve is likely to raise rates by 50 basis points (half-percentage point) next week.  Chartist's Corner: The tech cycle suggests more pain ahead for bitcoin.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Anatoly Yakovenko, CEO, Solana Labs  Will Evans, managing director Americas, CEX.IO  Philip Davis, prime minister of the Bahamas  Jorn Lambert, chief digital officer, Mastercard  Market Moves  Bitcoin traded lower early Friday and appeared on track to end April with a 12% monthly loss as the weak tone in equity markets and caution ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting overshadowed positive news flow.  The biggest cryptocurrency by market value slipped below $39,000 after facing rejection above $40,000 on Thursday.  The decline came even as investment banking giant Goldman Sachs announced its first bitcoin-backed lending facility in a sign of increasing crypto adoption on Wall Street. Further, China's Politburo pledged economic support offering a lifeline to risk assets.  U.S. stock futures slipped, led by losses in technology shares after Amazon reported its first quarterly loss in seven years.  The Fed is likely to raise the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points (half-percentage point) next week, accelerating the pace of monetary tightening that began last month with a 25 basis point hike. The central bank is also expected to start the process of shrinking its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet next week. Thanks to the record money printing to cushion the economy and markets from the coronavirus pandemic, the balance sheet has more than doubled in two years.  Policy tightening is widely considered bearish for risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC).  ""The Fed's response to COVID increased the money supply by over 40%, directly providing stimulus checks and indirectly growing capital reserves through quantitative easing,"" IntoTheBlock's research head Lucas Outumuro said. ""Now that the 'money printer' is expected to slow down, markets have been anticipating a hangover from the excessive stimulus provided, weighing down on valuations of both stocks and crypto.""  Rate hike priced-in?  The fed funds futures showed a 50 basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate is pretty much a done deal for the Fed's upcoming policy meeting on May 3-4.  Bitcoin has remained under pressure throughout the month despite bullish crypto news. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index has dropped over 8% this month. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, has rallied to 20-year highs.  In other words, various corners of the financial market appear to have priced in the impending 50 basis point hike and balance sheet runoff announcement. Besides, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently put bigger rate hikes on the table, preparing markets for an eventual move.  So, risk assets could bounce back post-Fed meeting in a classic sell the rumor, buy the fact trade.  ""The market was already expecting a 50-basis point rate hike before Jerome Powell’s announcement last week, so this news has already been priced in to a large extent,"" said Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock.""This could lead to a buy-the-fact event on the day of the FOMC meeting on 3rd-4th May.""  Joe Haggenmiller, head of markets at leading crypto finance firm XBTO Group, said bitcoin's recent resilience to continued macro uncertainty might fade if the Fed delivers a bigger-than-expected rate hike.  Focus on the dollar  The post-Fed uptick in bitcoin, if any, should be viewed with caution if the dollar continues to rise. That's because the inverse correlation between the two has strengthened in recent weeks.

Creating demand for the dollar around the world by giving more people access to it is a win-win for the U.S. and global economy.  – Will Reeves, CEO and co-founder of Fold  Crowd wisdom and the perfect stablecoin  Having multiple fiat currencies introduces a huge amount of friction into the world economy via conversion costs, restrictions on purchases and lost value. At a time when daily data output is measured in exabytes and transmitted via Starlink, janky fiat currencies only survive by coercion.  It’s possible, however, we might crowdsource a better option. In 1906, Sir Francis Galton observed that the median guess of a crowd of 800 people betting on the weight of an ox was correct within a 1% margin of error. This has become known as “the wisdom of crowds.”  To some extent, crypto today is a global attempt at putting brain power towards guessing the best money. All the better that “guess the best stablecoin” is supercharged by the fact that people are financially invested in the conclusion – they have skin in the game.  Jeff Booth, author of “The Price of Tomorrow,” has said that “Intelligence is error-correction.” Fiat currencies are like a global dementia, introducing tiny errors into the trillions of financial decisions the world makes every day. Converging on a single stablecoin would be like a shot of NZT: every decision would be fractionally smarter, summing up to a huge boost to our collective intelligence.

They have a balance sheet, they have accounting, they have rules they have to abide to. It’s really complicated to have crypto on your balance sheet, so they tend to prefer stablecoins from that perspective. They’re very open to keeping stablecoins on their balance sheets because then they can turn around and pay their employees, pay their providers across borders and essentially have something from a settlement point of view. That’s much more powerful than having cash in a bank account.  – Joao Reginatto, vice president of product at Circle, speaking during a CoinDesk “Payments Week” Twitter Spaces event.  No more Visa or Mastercard  Stablecoins that are asset-backed and audited seem to present a good solution that combines the authority of a government and the value of tangible assets to preserve financial value. The more exploratory area of stablecoins involves complicated algorithms and financial incentives – like the decentralized network Terra. Whichever becomes the dominant solution, both offer the opportunity to transfer an amount of money relatively instantly at a very low cost without middlemen. That means no more need for Visa or Mastercard to process payments.  The key to making crypto payments successful is enabling everyone to own crypto and pay with crypto easily. Having salaries paid in USDC, a cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar, or another stablecoin would help catalyze industry growth as people wouldn’t need to “on-ramp” into crypto. Additionally, point-of-sale systems need to accept crypto as a form of payment by default.  Today, most stablecoins track the value of fiat currencies but we might see the adoption of coins pegged to valuable assets like gold. These might, in reality, prove to be the best for when “paying with crypto” due to possibly being inflation-resistance. But for day-to-day transactions – whether using BTC, ETH, SOL, etc. – transaction and conversion costs will be important. The cost of paying for goods and services would need to be less than the average 3% transaction fees imposed by large credit, debit and app payment processors to prove valuable to merchants.  – Kyle Zappitell, CEO of Neon  Returning to Bitcoin’s roots?  Satoshi described Bitcoin as “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” or a digital money as private and free as the notes in your wallet. It’s a compelling vision given that payments today are a mess of incompatible national standards. Systems like SWIFT, which are useful only to large institutions, are rent-seeking intermediaries whose profits push up the cost of nearly every transaction on the planet.  The journey from technical breakthrough to mass adoption has been long, and requires overcoming multiple challenges before the dream of replacing the rickety old financial system with its gatekeepers and built-in surveillance can be realized.  But, simply said, crypto isn’t a viable end-to-end payments product – yet. It will be a while before there’s a crypto offering with a serious chance of success against the likes of Visa or Apple Pay.  Bitcoin, ether and other “native network tokens” are still too volatile for serious real world payments, and transaction fees on most chains are too high for all but the largest payments. The [user experience] is often still poor, and integrations with the wider business and the financial world are held back by technical and regulatory uncertainty. Nobody wants to integrate with something that might be dead in a year’s time.  See also: Why Haven't Crypto Payments Taken Off? | Opinion  But progress is being made and the future looks brighter. UX is improving by the day, and faster, more efficient blockchains and scaling layers with lower fees are coming thick and fast. Stablecoins make payments a possibility, like Satoshi envisioned, even with the underlying volatility of crypto. And regulators are showing signs that they might clarify the rules around stablecoins (making like more like banks) and allow the industry to move forward.  – Barney Mannerings, founder of Vega  More immediately useful  Stablecoins solve the problem of crypto price volatility while granting businesses access to Web 3-enabled liquidity and capital markets, and we’re making strides in navigating a big hurdle to adoption – regulatory clarity. In fact, the U.K. Treasury recently announced that it will begin regulating stablecoins as part of a wider plan to turn the nation into a hub for digital payment companies. This is part of a rising tide of governments and regulators recognizing the potential value of stablecoins as reliable, asset-backed financial instruments designed to enable high-volume, daily payments.  Read More: UK Crypto Industry Hopes for More Clarity From Planned Stablecoin Rules  Stablecoins’ usefulness may be old news for experienced decentralized finance (DeFi) proponents, but big regulatory moves like this provide much-needed legal clarity and awareness for legacy businesses interested in future-proofing their existing payment processes and delivering more value to their customers. This is why the growing acceptance of stablecoins is so important – because these assets are more immediately useful to businesses and consumers than other more experimental protocols and Web 3-based thought experiments.  At the end of the day, crypto entrepreneurs need to keep in mind that distributed ledger technology and cryptocurrencies are just a means, not an end, to addressing the real-world challenges businesses and ordinary consumers face.  – Antoni Zolciak, co-founder of Aleph Zero  Making finance personal  Thanks to NFTs, stablecoins can be bundled together with other tokens and currencies, and users will be able to imprint music, video or images onto or within their transactions. Payments already value in themselves, but now can make their personal meaning more known, more apparent, more literal. We are on the cusp of seeing this NFTs/stablecoins combination to create an entirely new emotional and economic model in crypto and – more significantly – personal finance.  Imagine sending to your husband a currency transfer jointly with a video of your newborn child? Or sending 100 USDT with a CryptoPunk? People will spend in different ways, but also design their bundles for each occasion. Perhaps some stablecoins will even be pegged to the value of an NFT along with fiat or some algorithm. This bundle allows stablecoins to integrate into art and finance, creating infinite possibilities to advance our culture.  – Alexander Mitrovich, CEO of Unique Network  More from Payments Week:  Crypto Payments: When the Tech Fades to the Background  The evolution in interest among TradFi, which was once dominated by diehard crypto skeptics, from crypto curiosity to crypto commitment is perhaps the industry’s most important move yet.

Sometimes the risk is financial; other times it’s just bad publicity.

Despite the short history of ILV cryptocurrency trading, market participants are now deciding the fate of the next medium-term price movement. The fact is that the ILV price from January 2022 is consolidating over the global liquidity range of $485. The importance of this range is obvious. However, the weak rebounds of the ILV price from this range are alarming and suggest the idea of ​​updating the historical low in the near future. https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbeMkxHr/ The best-case scenario for ILV investors at the moment is the continuation of price movements in the wide consolidation range of $485-$643. To do this, buyers need to actively start the first week of May and take the initiative in the market into their own hands. At $643, buyers will have a chance to break the shackles of consolidation and start a new growth wave. However, if trading volumes near the $643 range are low, you should get rid of ILV coins and expect the price to fall with the final target of $350. It is from this point that buyers will try to regain control of the market and begin preparations for the formation of a new growth wave.

42412225,MOJk0DFaTUQXthCtpVrjgZ,1651235109,"Layer 2, Decentralized Exchanges Show Strong Growth on Ethereum in Q1 2022","Growth of some applications and services built on the Ethereum network have more than doubled in the first quarter of this year compared to last year, even as other blockchains gained favor among investors, research shows.  Value locked on layer 2, or scaling services built atop Ethereum, increased 964% to $7.3 billion in Q1 2022 compared to $686.9 million in Q1 2021, analysts at Bankless wrote in a report. Activity on Arbitrum and Optimism, two popular layer 2 networks, generated just over $15 million in fees for the Ethereum network.  The circulating supply of stablecoins grew 188% to $122 billion, while spot trading volumes on decentralized exchanges exceeded $3.9 trillion in the past year. Much of this came from tether (USDT), whose supply increased from $50 billion to $83 billion, as per CoinGecko.  Volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEX), which rely on smart contracts instead of third parties to process user trades, grew 667%. DEX volumes for spot assets increased as much as $3.9 trillion traded over the past year, while futures volumes increased by 2,704% from $7.4 billion to $209.1 billion. Part of these trades came from layer 2-based DEXs, such as dydx and Loopring.  However, the number of active addresses interacting with the Ethereum network on a daily basis rose by just 4%. This could imply most existing activity on Ethereum came from prior users instead of new market entrants, some analysts said.  ""While Ethereum ticked massive growth in the most important aspects, growth was conservative in terms of Daily Active Users which surged by a mere 4%,” said Egor Volotkovich, director at cross-chain solutions tool EVODeFi. “This does not mean users were priced out of Ethereum in Q1 as we saw no significant price surge in the cryptocurrency within this time frame.”  Volotkovich explained the lower activity could be attributed to the growing competition around the Ethereum network, such as Terra, BNB Chain and Avalanche.  “The number of competitors is notably rising, and rather than stick to Ethereum only, investors are choosing to diversify their portfolio in order to get the best from the growing world of DeFi, NFTs, and Web 3,” he said.",POSITIVE,USDT,BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | USDT | ARB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/29/layer-2-decentralized-exchanges-show-strong-growth-on-ethereum-in-q1-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3c823273bb21114ce54a801c6bb5084d959d97f-1439x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Because they are generally conditional, many open orders are liable to delayed executions because they are not market orders. An order may potentially remain open due to a lack of market liquidity for a particular security. As Binance Futures supports open order modifications to provide flexibility for traders, users can modify the price and quantity of open orders on their Coin- Margined contracts.

Liquidations in the crypto market occur when a trader has insufficient funds to fund a margin call, which is when an exchange asks for extra collateral to keep the trading position funded.  APE prices jumped to more than $27.50 on Thursday evening from $19 on Wednesday, before profit-taking saw the tokens decline to as low as $20.48 in Asian morning hours on Friday. Such movement occurred in an otherwise little-changed crypto market, with bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) moving just 2% in the past 24 hours.  APE has more than doubled from mid-April's levels of around $11, with the volatility leading to an increase in trading volume on the token's futures. Liquidations have increased in parallel: APE futures have racked up millions of dollars in losses – higher than usual – for their traders several times in the past weeks.  Thursday’s volatility came ahead of virtual pockets of land going on sale in the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) ecosystem, confirming rumors from last week. The virtual land will be sold for a flat price of 305 APE, developers confirmed in a tweet on Friday, which may have contributed to the demand for APE among traders. The land was initially planned to be sold in a Dutch auction.  Most of the liquidations on APE in the past hours arose from short traders, or those betting against higher prices. Some $24.88 million worth of shorts were liquidated, data show, compared with $11 million in longs.  Crypto exchange OKX saw $10 million in liquidations, the most among all exchanges, followed by Binance at $9 million and Bybit at $7.98 million.  The higher-than-usual liquidation activity on APE was comparable to $37 million on ether futures, making them one of the most traded crypto futures in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin futures, however, continued to lead with in excess of $66.29 million.  CORRECTION (April 29, 12:21 UTC) Corrects fourth bullet to say land pockets will be sold for a flat price.

Past Performance of SYS SYS coin price maintains a long-term downtrend under the influence of a bearish trendline resulting in a drop of 45% since February 2022.

Guided by such principles, the CoinEx token-listing team always prioritizes the listing of quality cryptos and is never blindly after quantity. Such a rigorous funnel-shaped screening process not only allows users to identify first-rate assets and stay ahead of peers but also earns CoinEx a great reputation, which has brought win-win results for both the platform and users.

During its previous earnings call in February, DBS said that it plans to launch a retail crypto trading desk by the end of 2022. However, in early April it did a complete flip on the plans citing regulatory worries.  CEO Piyush Gupta did not explicitly rule out the retail crypto plan and said the bank wants to focus on its accredited and institutional offerings in order to mature the technology and scale it.  “We already have a large, affluent, accredited investor crypto base that we can scale,” Gupta said during the call. “We won’t do any retail crypto in Singapore this year.” Gupta added that the technology to create a retail exchange is “taking a bit longer than expected.”  DBS’s current crypto offering is open to accredited investors in Singapore, which are defined as those that have SGD 2 million ($1.5 million) in assets.  Gupta said that during the last quarter trading activity ""slowed a bit"" but volume continues to grow. DBS' exchange now has almost SGD 1 billion ($724 million) worth of crypto in custody.  Singapore, with its population of 5.6 million, is home to over 526,000 people with a net worth of over $1 million and 4200 people that have a net worth of over $30 million.  While the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has created a licensing regime that is considered productive for institutional crypto, it is opposed to retail involvement in the asset class.  “We have taken quite a tough line on unfettered access to retail public because retail investors should not be dabbling in cryptocurrencies.
