The head of the Swiss-based firm appeared earlier this week during an event hosted by Thomson Reuters. In remarks, Mercuria chief executive officer Marco Dunand revealed that he had been engaging with stakeholders on the technology and that, in his belief, it could have a major impact on how commodities are traded and exchanged.  According to Reuters, Dunand told attendees:  ""I've seen sufficient bank presentations to believe the technology is there and it's solid. And I believe we’re going to see a digital transformation of the oil and gas industry.”  Dunand’s comments are the first from the oil trading giant, which earned as much as $300m in oil trading profits during 2015, according to Bloomberg.  During the event, Dunand speculated that blockchain-based payments could help significantly cut costs.  ""[Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk] for instance is a market that has a limited amount of participants, that requires a reasonably solid balance sheet. You could see this type of market going to blockchain payments within the next 12 months,"" Dunand said. ""We think this could reduce costs, certainly on payments, by 30 percent.""  At the same time, adoption won't happen quickly unless more firms come together to collaborate on the development of any future blockchain networks tied to the oil market.  ""We could adapt it fast, but you need a certain amount of participants in the industry to get it going,"" he told attendees.  Commodities exchanges worldwide have already begun looking at how they can apply blockchain to their own operations. Organizations like the CME Group and Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, for example, have spent much of the past year testing the technology in a bid to cut costs and improve how their markets work.

42378904,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mMGH,1476461176,The Russian Government is Testing Blockchain for Document Storage,"An anti-trust agency within the Russian government is testing a blockchain-based document management system.  Dubbed “Digital Ecosystem”, the project is aimed at developing tools that can “increase the speed, reliability and quality of interaction during document exchange”.  The country’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) is working alongside Sberbank to develop it. Other companies, including Aeroflot, Russia’s largest airline carrier, are also involved, Sberbank said today.  In statements, FAS deputy chief Andrey Tsarikovsky said that the project points to a potential reduction in the cost of managing and exchanging documents.  He was quoted as saying:  “This decentralising approach cuts costs because data processing centres are not required and the requirements for equipment protection are lowered. It is noteworthy that Russia is one of the first countries in the world where the state and market participants are looking at these innovations as a way to simplify business operations.”  The trial is one of the most notable to emerge from the country to date, coming amid continued debate within the government on the subject of regulating so-called money surrogates, a designation which would include bitcoin.  But that hasn't stopped government offices on both the local and national level from testing the tech, as shown by the FAS trial. In August, the Moscow government said that it was looking at blockchain as a possible means to prevent voter fraud.  The project is also the latest signal that Sberbank, one of the largest financial institutions, is taking a serious look at the technology.  The bank is a member of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain project, and in the past has indicated its interest in collaborative blockchain efforts alongside other companies in Russia as well. Last year, a venture fund backed by Sberbank said it was keeping an eye out for possible investments in the blockchain space.

42378890,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mM7T,1476453835,Russian Payments Firm QIWI Joins R3 Blockchain Consortium,"Russian payments firm QIWI has joined the R3 blockchain consortium.  Announced earlier this week, the move is the latest for the firm that made waves earlier this year when it announced its plans to pursue the creation of a digital currency. QIWI has since outlined how it plans to potentially replace aspects of its core infrastructure using the technology, a process that it said could play out over the next five years.  In statements, the company expressed hope that some of the in-house projects it has developed can be applied to some of work being conducted among R3's global banking membership.  QIWI CEO Sergey Solonin was quoted as saying:  ""We believe that blockchain projects that we are currently working on can be applied on one of the R3 platforms and have great potential to be favorably perceived by regulated financial institutions.""  Launched last year, the R3 consortium has more than 60 financial institutions among its ranks. To date, members have pursued a series of distributed ledger tests focused on areas like trade finance and the exchange of commercial debt.

42378914,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mMRb,1476446196,ACI is Paving the Way for Central Bank Blockchains,"What will it look like when central banks are on the blockchain? ACI is hard at work modeling an answer to this question.  The international payments firm already enables more than 5,000 credit unions, processors and banks to transact $14tn daily through its suite of software-as-a-service tools, and now it's seeking to uncover how blockchain could play a role in its delivery.  Constructed on a five-node network that runs on servers in Omaha, Nebraska, and Norcross, Georgia, ACI has built a blockchain proof-of-concept specifically designed to simulate how a central bank and four financial institutions could transact on a blockchain.  While that might not be an indicator on its own, ACI has long counted central banks among its customers. Last month, for example, it announced a plan with partner VocaLink to build a payments infrastructure for clearing houses and central banks.  Chief architect Roger Oliphant explained that it took about a month to integrate an undisclosed blockchain into its real-time electronic payments network, Universal Payments (UP). But, while there's still a long way to go, he believes clients are interested in learning more about blockchain applications.  Oliphant told CoinDesk:  ""Our job, how we see ourselves at ACI, is to provide the technological mechanisms to our customers to do what makes most sense for them.""  Launched in 2013, the UP provides retail payments, transaction banking services and payments risk management in over 80 countries, and it's into this framework that Oliphant said ACI intends to make its blockchain services available.  Eventually, he expects the integration to include multiple blockchains, with implementation assistance from industry consortia.  ""Our strategy is that we will provide multiple implementations to allow us to talk to a Ripple network, to work with ethereum,"" he said. ""That's what the majority of our customers are interested in working with.""  Plans to integrate  However, Oliphant believes ACI's customers will demand the technology handle at least 2,000 transactions per second, a figure that's a long way from the results it was able to achieve today.  In its proof-of-concept, ACI was able to clear and settle transactions every five-to-seven seconds, or an order of magnitude faster than the one-to-three days required by its current system.  But the same transaction timeframe wasn't enough for payments. Consensus computations, he said, are too slow when compared to the millisecond range its existing system achieves.  In spite of the technological limitations, though, Oliphant said the tech demonstrated some of the benefits blockchain could provide a central bank and the wider financial system.  Had the test been conducted in a real-world situation, Oliphant argues a central bank would be able to view ""all the settlement positions and all the institutions"" while monitoring transactions.  ""They could see all the transactions from each institution,"" said Oliphant, adding:  ""The Central Bank, the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve can now see the real time complete of some of their members.""  Potential customers  The comments shed light on how ACI could become an important player should interest in blockchain increase.  In the past, ACI has helped set up the UK Faster Payments, Singapore FAST and the upcoming New Payments Platform in Australia, expected to be operational in the second half of 2017.  But it is the payment firm’s current work with central banks that Oliphant said makes the prototype particularly meaningful.  Earlier this year, ACI even commissioned a report from financial research firm Celent on the impact blockchain technology could have on central banking. The reporthttps://www.aciworldwide.com/-/media/files/collateral/trends/banks-retailers-and-fintech---reimagining-payments-relationships--the-bank-perspective.pdf suggested central bank-issued cryptocurrencies could be seen as early as 2018.  ACI’s prototype also follows an uptick in interest in blockchain at global central banks, meaning it might have identified the right market at the right time.  Earlier this month, the US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the US central bank was ""paying close attention"" to blockchain technology regarding its potential benefits to payments, clearing and settlement.  But, there's not yet broad agreement on what this interest means, and so far different central banks have different ideas.  The Dutch Central Bank revealed its plans to see if an entire financial market could be written with blockchain smart contracts, while the Bank of England cautioned that any “extreme revolution” wouldn’t happen anytime soon.  On the horizon, however, Oliphant expects changes.  He noted that technology is being developed that promises to be able to transact 1 million transactions per second, citing in-development advances like ethereum's Raiden Network.  Oliphant concluded:  ""We’ve been waiting for is that kind of velocity.""
