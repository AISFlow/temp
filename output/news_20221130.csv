This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk‚Äôs daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  ""Since the start of this year, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors have weighed on financial markets. This resulted in significantly lower trading volumes and fewer client sign-ups,"" Kraken said in a blog post.  The crypto market has sunk this year, with bitcoin (BTC) losing 63% of its value since the end of 2021 and the total crypto market cap down by more than two-thirds in the past 12 months.  Companies that ramped up staffing levels during the preceding boom years have had to cut back during the decline. This month alone, publicly traded exchange Coinbase (COIN) trimmed 60 positions, and Unchained Capital, a bitcoin financial-services firm, shed more than 600.  As recently as June, Kraken said it was looking to expand as other companies laid off staff, flooding the market with experienced labor, saying it wanted to hire another 500 people.  Other News  Crypto prices rise: Bitcoin (BTC) cracked the $17,000 threshold for the first time since the early part of November. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $17,060, up 3.6% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands just below $1,300, a 6.6% gain from Tuesday, same time. Other cryptos were largely moving upward, with UNI, the token of the smart contracts-based Uniswap platform, up more than 6% and popular meme coin DOGE rising more than 3%.  But November is dismal: Bitcoin fell in value by more than 18% for the month and ether tumbled 21% amid the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and the ensuing fallout. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection little more than a week after CoinDesk reported irregularities on the balance sheet of its trading arm Alameda Capital, and other companies with exposure to FTX have been forced into survival mode. Still, a few tokens soared above the mess, including BAND and LTC, which jumped 57% and 38%, respectively.  Equity markets enjoyed a memorable day as investors, buoyed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs dovish remarks at the Brookings Institution‚Äôs Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy on Wednesday, sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq up 4.4%, and the S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 3% and 2.1%, respectively. Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, sank 0.2%.  Altcoin Roundup  A key tone shift in crypto markets during the month was just how dramatically they diverged from the path of traditional markets. Stocks rose as investors processed speculation that the Federal Reserve might slow the pace of interest rate hikes as soon as December. The S&P 500 is up 2.2% in November, while gold climbed 7.8%.

4985583,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4561531-sell-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1669848544,Sell Bitcoin,"Summary The 9/29/22 article predicted the price of bitcoin would decline due to the weakness of the business cycle. The business cycle continued to deteriorate due to a sharp slowdown. Bitcoin declines when the business cycle slows down. THE BUSINESS CYCLE (The Peter Dag Portfolio Strategy and Management) The 9/29/22 article correctly predicted ‚Äú The tightening of the Fed and the inventory correction will force commodities and Bitcoin prices to continue to decline .‚Äù Let us see if monetary and economic conditions have changed enough to alter the downtrend of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The business cycle is in Phase 4. This is the most treacherous phase for the economy, the financial markets, and investors. This is the time when all the excesses created in Phase 1 and Phase 2 are corrected. In 2022, for instance, the generous stimulus programs and the Fed‚Äôs aggressive injection of liquidity were followed by record breaking growth of the economy. M2 and GDP (FRED, The Peter Dag Portfolio Strategy and Management ) The money supply M2 soared 26.9% y/y and real GDP responded with a lag of several months with an unsustainable growth of 12.5% y/y (see above chart). Commodities responded promptly to the strengthening economy. Copper and crude oil soared in response to the extreme demand caused by government and Fed stimulus programs. CPI (The Peter Dag Portfolio Strategy and Management, FRED) Inflation quickly rose because of the stronger economy and sharply higher commodities (see above chart). As inflation started to impact real income, consumers‚Äô sentiment collapsed. This was the signal the business cycle entered in Phase 3. This trend was further reinforced by a sharp slowdown in M2 (see first chart) and flattening of the yield curve (10s/2s). Business, however, continued to increase production responding to the sharp increase in demand following the lockdown. Inventories were accumulated at a double-digit pace when real inventory growth has historically been expanding in the 3%-6% range. Production is now slowing down as companies need to reduce the huge inventory levels. The business cycle is now in Phase 4. As mentioned above, this is the phase when all the excesses must be brought under control to reestablish consumers‚Äô purchasing power. Inventories must be liquidated. This is achieved by reducing production and lowering prices. Raw material purchases are reduced, placing down pressure on commodities. Borrowing is curtailed as programs to improve or increase capacity are delayed with the immediate effect of facilitating lower interest rates. Phase 1 will begin when M2 starts rising again, the yield curve steepens, and interest rates and inflation decline in a major way, enough to lift consumers‚Äô optimism. Bitcoin and Copper (The Peter Dag Portfolio Strategy and Management, StockCharts) Bitcoin, like commodities, responds to trends of the business cycle and liquidity. The above chart shows the main turning points of Bitcoin correspond to the same turning points of copper, one of the most sensitive commodities to business cycle trends. Bitcoin and Crude oil (The peter Dag Portfolio Strategy and Management, StockCharts) Bitcoin has also the same turning points of crude oil and of most other commodities (see above chart). The reason is commodities respond to changes in liquidity and business cycle trends. Commodities rise when the business cycle points to a strengthening economy. Commodities decline when the business cycle reflects a weakening economy. Key takeaways The sharp decline of the growth of M2 and the deep inversion of the yield curve point to much weaker economic conditions ahead. The business cycle is declining and is currently in Phase 4. The price of Bitcoin will decline and bottom when the business cycle moves into Phase 1. This is the time when most other commodities are also rising. This analysis suggests Bitcoin price behavior depends on the vagaries of a central bank monetary policy and changes of the business cycle. The reason is its price is affected by changes in the liquidity created by the banking system.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4561531-sell-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4985583.jpeg

His remarks come despite reports that FTX loaned out over half of its customer funds (some $10B) to Alameda Research, an FTX-affiliated trading firm, in an attempt to fund risky bets. ""I wasn't trying to commingle funds,"" Bankman-Fried said, even though Bloomberg reported earlier this week that¬†some FTX customers were told to send wire transfers through Alameda, highlighting their tangled relationship despite the fact that FTX and Alameda were entirely separate businesses. FTX and Alameda, which owned a ton of FTX Token ( FTT-USD ), the crypto issued by FTX, were ""substantially more"" connected than intended, SBF said, while noting his ""massive failure of risk management and oversight."" He touched on his poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts, saying the FTT and solana ( SOL-USD ) used as collateral was not marked ""the way I wish I had from a risk perspective."" Starting on November 6, when Binance tweeted that it will sell its position in FTX Token ( FTT-USD ), SBF knew there was a problem about the potential for ""substantial losses for Alameda. I didn‚Äôt think it was going to be a massive loss for FTX customers, more like Alameda is going to be really tight on funds."" FTX and its more than 130 affiliates filed for bankruptcy on November 11 after the discovery of a multi-billion dollar balance sheet shortfall that triggered massive customer outflows. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt running Alameda, I didn‚Äôt know exactly what was going on, I didn‚Äôt know the size of their position,‚Äù SBF said. ‚ÄúA lot of these are things I‚Äôve learned over the last month When asked whether he's concerned about criminal liability, SBF responded,¬†""I don't personally think I have... it's not what I'm focusing on. There will be a time and a place for me to think about myself and my future but this isn't it."" 6:011 p.m. ET: Event concludes. 6:09 p.m. ET: SBF, a former billionaire, now has ""close to nothing,"" he said when asked about how much money he has left. ""I have one working credit card left. I think it might be $100K or something like that in that bank account. I put everything I had into FTX."" 6:02 p.m. ET: SBF said he doesn't know what his future holds; ""a lot of it is not in my hands at this point."" Update at 5:50 p.m. ET: SBF's political donations ""were mostly for pandemic prevention, on both sides of the aisle,"" SBF said. In FTX's first court hearing on November 22, a counsel to FTX said SBF treated his trading platform as his own ""personal fiefdom.""",NEUTRAL,FTT,EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | BNB | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3912755-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-i-never-tried-to-commit-fraud?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4984831.jpeg

42411675,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfEsW,1669844622,BlockFi‚Äôs Rise and Fall: A Timeline,"Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It‚Äôs the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.  October 2017 ‚Äì BlockFi begins  Zac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company‚Äôs chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.  February 2018 to December 2018 ‚Äì BlockFi‚Äôs first funding rounds  Venture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz‚Äôs Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.  March 2019 ‚Äì BlockFi offers compound interest account  Flush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it ""doesn‚Äôt come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.‚Äù As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn‚Äôt seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.  August 2019 - Series A funding  The firm‚Äôs next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel‚Äôs Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.  December 2019 ‚Äì BlockFi expands into trading  In December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood‚Äôs business model. ‚ÄúMarket makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,‚Äù BlockFi‚Äôs CEO said.  February 2020 - Series B funding round  Peter Thiel‚Äôs Valar Ventures led BlockFi‚Äôs $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping ‚ÄúBlockFi expand into Singapore‚Äù and the Asia-Pacific region.  March 2020 - Cash on-ramps arrive  BlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to ‚Äúcrypto payment rails‚Äù such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by ‚Äúrequests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren't already cryptocurrency owners.‚Äù The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.  May 2020 - BlockFi suffers minor hack  All was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee‚Äôs phone with a ‚ÄúSIM swap‚Äù that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee‚Äôs phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi‚Äôs retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi‚Äôs customers.  August 2020 ‚Äì BlockFi gets more funding  In August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.  October 2020 ‚Äì BlockFi makes a risky bet  In October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk's parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.  BlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.  January 2021 - BlockFi‚Äôs bitcoin ambitions  Early in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale‚Äôs product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.  March 2021 ‚Äì BlockFi gets new funding, $3B valuation  All was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin‚Äôs soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?  July 2021 ‚Äì Bad timing amid an onslaught of cease and desist orders  New Jersey‚Äôs Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state‚Äôs financial regulator claimed BlockFi‚Äôs interest accounts amounted to sales of an ‚Äúunregistered security‚Äù and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.  The CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that ‚Äì and it didn‚Äôt end well for BlockFi (we‚Äôll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.  February 2022 ‚Äì BlockFi settles with the SEC  In February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,‚Äù SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.  Summer 2022 ‚Äì BlockFi spirals downward  In June, BlockFi‚Äôs valuation sank to $1 billion in a ‚Äúdown round‚Äù ‚Äì a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund's collateral before its bankruptcy.In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi‚Äôs main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.  In dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren‚Äôt met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.  November 2022 ‚Äì FTX collapse slams BlockFi, firm files for bankruptcy  At the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.  That was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX‚Äôs credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid ‚Äúthe lack of clarity‚Äù about FTX. On Nov. 11, California‚Äôs financial regulator revoked BlockFi‚Äôs lending license.  BlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried's Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.  In the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?

42420844,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVcb,1669843240,"Bitcoin Correlation With the Dollar Index Turns Negative, Again","The correlation of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) to the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has once again turned negative. BTC‚Äôs correlation coefficient to the DXY has fallen to -0.36, after moving as high as 0.84 on Nov. 19.  Correlation coefficients measure the relationship between two assets, and range between 1 and -1. The former implies a direct pricing relationship between the assets, while the latter indicates an inverse relationship.  BTC had held a persistently inverse relationship to the DXY since July, before crossing into positive territory on Nov 9. In August, the correlation between the two assets fell to -0.94.  The timing of the reversal coincides with FTX-related market turmoil because the shift in pricing relationship occurred on the same day that Binance and FTX‚Äôs tentative deal fell through. The return to negative correlations signals that:  Markets have likely reset and found a new level of comfort specific to prices  Macro narratives will start to take hold again, as what impacts the dollar will likely be seen in crypto prices  On the first point, bitcoin has resumed its bout of range-bound trading, albeit near $16,500 as opposed to $19,500. The 15% haircut represents the discount applied to asset prices following questions about FTX and related contagion. Volatility, as measured by the Average True Range (ATR), has declined 40% over the most recent two weeks, as markets have begun to calm.  ETH‚Äôs correlation to the DXY has also returned to negative, while its volatility has declined 35%. BTC and ETH remain highly correlated, with a coefficient of 0.90.  On the second point, a steadying of BTC's price and return to inverse correlations means that issues pertinent to U.S. dollar movement will have significance for BTC as well. Investors should weigh Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments Wednesday and the central bank‚Äôs next meeting on Dec. 14 when it decides on the fed funds rate.  Asset managers continue to reduce exposure  Amid the lack of price volatility, institutional-sized asset managers have continued to reduce their long exposure to BTC. According to the most recent Commitment of Traders (COT) report, asset managers trimmed their long exposure by 247 contracts, the third time this has occurred in as many weeks.  On Nov. 8, asset managers comprised 43.4% of long open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. As of the most recent release, that number has declined to 29.7%. Leveraged funds now make up the largest percentage of open interest at 31.3% long, while comprising 47.2% of short open interest.  The 378 contract increase in long positions is down from the 1,367-contract increase in the prior report. The shift could be related to the February contract for BTC now moving into contango as opposed to backwardation. Contango occurs when futures prices for later months exceed those of nearer months. This condition is often bullish for spot prices, and prices tend to move toward the higher futures contract prices as expiration approaches.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/30/bitcoin-correlation-with-the-dollar-index-turns-negative-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65939466cf81d95b9eac594e0324f0b0b9b6c957-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Potential for slower rate hikes in December,"Major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) along with crypto-linked stocks have turned higher after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled the pace of interest-rate increases could slow down as soon as next month . After spending much of the past month below $17K after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) bounced 3.6% to $17.04K at 4:17 p.m. ET, as market participants cheered JPow's remarks. Ether ( ETH-USD ) climbed 5.7% to $1.29K at the time of writing. While the Fed chief indicated that the U.S. central bank may moderate the pace of its rate hikes starting at the December 13-14 gathering, he also emphasized the ""ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than thought at the time of the September meeting"" with inflation still well above its target. In other words, the inflation fight is yet to end hence no Fed pivot on the horizon. The Fed has lifted its benchmark rate by 75¬†basis points at each of its last four meetings. But for the December meeting, traders have been ratcheting up their bets for a 50-bp hike as Fed officials suggested over the past month or so a likely downshift in the pace of rate increases. As such, traders hedged for a 77.0% chance for a 50-bp move versus 66.3% in the prior day, according to CME's FedWatch tool . That would take the federal funds rate target range to 4.25%-4.50%, compared with policymaker's September projection of a 4.6% terminal rate in 2023. Crypto-related stocks, which are seen as high-beta versions of digital tokens, traded in a sea of green: MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) +8% , Galaxy Digital ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) +10% , Bit Digital ( BTBT ) +8.1% , Coinbase Global ( COIN ) +5.8% , Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) +9.3% and Marathon Digital ( MARA ) +6.3% . In addition, the stock market rallied hard , with all three major U.S. stock indices climbing at least 2% despite a deeply inverted yield curve that's calling for an economic downturn. While the crypto ecosystem continues to feel the burn from the multi-billion dollar collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Brazil approved a bill to legalize crypto payments .",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3912697-why-did-bitcoin-and-ethereum-jump-today-potential-for-slower-rate-hikes-in-december?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4982819.jpeg

42388517,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHuo5,1669842525,US Prosecutors Charge 21 Alleged ‚ÄòMoney Mules‚Äô With Using Crypto to Launder Proceeds of Cybercrimes,"Federal prosecutors in Texas have slapped 21 U.S. citizens with an assortment of criminal charges for allegedly helping various transnational criminal rings launder their ill-gotten gains using cryptocurrency.  Dubbed Operation Crypto Runner, the multi-year investigation was conducted by the East Texas branches of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), and the Postal Inspection Service (PIS) ‚Äì the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal Service.  The operation has ‚Äúdisrupted more than $300 million in annual money laundering transactions, seized and forfeited millions in cash and cryptocurrency, and identified thousands of victims,‚Äù according to a press release issued Wednesday.  Prosecutors say the 21 individuals caught in Operation Crypto Runner‚Äôs snare each played a key role in international scam and criminal operations, acting as domestic money launderers for their foreign co-conspirators.  At least four of the 21 people charged have already pleaded guilty to their crimes.  Maryland woman Zenobia Walker, 65, pleaded guilty in January to her role in a a scheme in which she received over $300,000 from victims of romance scams and other fraud schemes, deposited the money in her personal bank accounts, exchanged it for cryptocurrency and passed the crypto on to her foreign co-conspirators. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Nov. 2.  Three more individuals ‚Äì Tulasidas Konda, 57, and Lois Boyd, 76, both of Virginia, and Deependra Bhusal, 46, of Texas ‚Äì pleaded guilty to charges in connection with a multi-year money laundering conspiracy for proceeds of various scams.  The alleged ringleader, Konda opened bank accounts and mailboxes that were used to receive money from scam victims, exchange the money for crypto and then send the crypto to wallets controlled by the trio‚Äôs foreign co-conspirators. The three laundered roughly $6 million combined, according to the government release.  Two other defendants ‚Äì Randall Rule, 71, of Nevada and Gregory Nysewander, 64, of South Carolina ‚Äì have been similarly accused of converting $2.4 million in funds from romance scams, business email compromises and real estate scams into crypto for foreign operators. Rule and Nysewander have not pleaded guilty.  Another group of 10 defendants have been charged with taking part in a wire and mail fraud conspiracy that used fake technical support schemes to persuade victims to send money, often using shell companies and business bank accounts created to look like legitimate companies.  Two more defendants ‚Äì John Khuu, 27, of California and Sharena Seay, 37, of Florida ‚Äì have been indicted on money laundering charges for two separate alleged schemes to launder money tied to drug trafficking operations via crypto.  There are more arrests to come, according to the USSS.  ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement demonstrates the investigative capabilities of the Secret Service and highlights the success of our collaborative efforts through Operation Crypto Runner to dismantle and disrupt transnational money laundering networks,‚Äù said William Smarr, special agent in charge of the U.S. Secret Service‚Äôs Dallas field office in the release.  ‚ÄúThese arrests are just the beginning,‚Äù Smart added. ‚ÄúWe are committed to bringing each of the remaining perpetrators to justice.‚Äù",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/30/us-prosecutors-charge-21-alleged-money-mules-with-using-crypto-to-launder-proceeds-of-international-cybercrime-operations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/401ee764535102feacece9441aa0b0aa1193a579-3003x2252.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388515,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHuej,1669840055,"IBM and Australian Stock Market‚Äôs Blockchain Projects Failed, a Blow to Private Ledgers","The turbulence in the overall cryptocurrency sector following FTX‚Äôs collapse this month is well known. What‚Äôs gotten less attention, however, is the failure of projects that attempted to use the underlying crypto ledger technology in private, corporate settings, the once-hyped ecosystem known collectively as enterprise blockchain.  This week, TradeLens, a blockchain system built by software firm IBM and closely linked to shipping giant Maersk, announced it was shutting down, citing a lack of commercial traction. Some two weeks ago, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) said it was scrapping a much-delayed blockchain announced in 2016 that was meant to replace the clearing and settlement system that powers that equities market.  Neither IBM nor ASX responded to requests for comment by press time.  Back in the early days of 2015 to 2016, a groundswell of banks and large companies saw potential in taking blockchain technology ‚Äì which, as originally designed for bitcoin and the rest of crypto, is a public platform open to basically anyone ‚Äì into private, firewalled realms where groups of companies could use the tech to track assets and distribute an immutable record of their existence.  The enterprise blockchain space, which doesn‚Äôt seem to experience the same bullish and bearish market cycles as public crypto, is now feeling a change in the broader economic climate, particularly in areas like shipping. This is one of the reasons TradeLens is closing shop, according to Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, a consultancy firm to the container shipping industry.  ‚ÄúThe container shipping industry has had a run of two years of extreme profits, which allowed access to pursue all manner of technological solutions out there,‚Äù Jensen said in an interview. ‚ÄúNow, the tide has turned and industry is going to be under severe pressure. So that means for all the technological solutions out there, this is crunch time. Do you provide commercial value above and beyond what is just hopes and dreams for the future?‚Äù  Speaking of TradeLens specifically, Jensen pointed out there is a lot of competition from a range of different track-and-trace solutions in the container shipping space.  ‚ÄúTradeLens basically wanted to provide everything to everybody,‚Äù Jensen said. ‚ÄúBut some of the other visibility providers out there are a lot more niche. They focus on either specific stakeholders or specific parts of the process, and they have a lot more commercial success. So this might also be an indication that the market might not have an appetite for a one-stop-shop solution that covers everything, but is more amenable to more specific and targeted solutions for specific problems.‚Äù  Down under  Richard G. Brown, chief technology officer of R3, the builder of the Corda enterprise blockchain and one of the first startups in the space, said that while the shuttering of TradeLens and the ASX blockchain has happened in quick succession, the reasons are very different.  The ASX project‚Äôs failures have more to do with engagement between stakeholders and technology choices, said Brown, who referred to an Accenture report on the system.  ‚ÄúWhen it comes to TradeLens, it‚Äôs not about a failure in the technology,‚Äù Brown said in an interview. ‚ÄúThe demise of TradeLens may have something to do with IBM pulling back, or partly the cyclicality in the shipping industry, but the technology and the concept seem to be architecturally congruent from the outside.‚Äù  Stepping back, Paul Brody, head of blockchain at global consultancy firm Ernst & Young, believes the whole idea of private blockchains is fundamentally flawed. Brody and his team have been long-time adherents of promoting enterprise adoption of the public Ethereum blockchain, which has included using tech such as zero-knowledge proofs to make the tech palatable to big businesses.  ‚ÄúAll these private blockchain ventures have the same basic problem,‚Äù Brody told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Web2 business model, but a little bit of Web3 pixie dust sprinkled on.

We explore one SA reader's foray into Bitcoin poetry. (Future NFT project anyone???). FTX had a $1.4B short position in Bitcoin, suppressing the price. In 2017, there were many cryptocurrencies with distinct advantages to Bitcoin. Those advantages proved to be marginal in the long run. Those projects are now largely irrelevant. The same pattern is likely to repeat itself. Bitcoin may reap the benefits of the blockbuster R&D funding that has occurred over the last two years. In other words, hot air rushing out of the cryptocurrency ecosystem should refocus developer activity on Bitcoin. Centralized exchanges, such as FTX, were an impediment to progress. Introduction The collapse of FTX has left many people with the impression that ""cryptocurrency is a scam"". People who have dug their heals in on this issue now have reason to feel vindicated. Here is a witty little poem posted in response to FTX Is Crypto Cancer (So Is Coinbase) : Disclaimer: Sam Bankmen-Fried has not been formally charged with a crime at this point. There is no indication that FTX 'did not like SEC rules' as stated in the poem. I do not endorse the views of this poem, which is included in this article for satirical purposes only. (Paul T. Lambert, via Seeking Alpha) It's worthy of a chuckle, but the nuance is more complex. Having helped pioneer institutional investment in cryptocurrency, and having lived through the ""crypto winter"" of 2018 and 2019, I would like to share my thoughts on where the industry is headed. Update on FTX It's important to know that FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried was notably not a Bitcoin maximalist , claiming that Bitcoin ' has no future as a payments network '. Bitcoin is decentralized , meaning no single person or entity controls it. FTX's FTT ( FTT-USD ) cryptocurrency is centralized, controlled by FTX. FTX used FTT to prop up Alameda , which allegedly traded against FTX clients , while allegedly using their accounts as collateral. FTX was also the hype-man for other 'centralized crypto' projects, such as Solana ( SOL-USD ). Solana is incredibly impressive in many ways, but as it turns out, so centralized that you can pause it . (I sold all of my Solana earlier in the year.) Twitter FTX's disdain for Bitcoin clearly went beyond the opposing philosophies of decentralized finance vs 'centralized crypto'. FTX has been accused of holding a $1.4B short position in Bitcoin , holding zero Bitcoin reserves. This suggests that when clients ""bought"" Bitcoin through FTX, they were actually receiving a Bitcoin I-O-U from FTX. Effectively, this would mean that FTX was suppressing the price of Bitcoin to the tune of $1.4B, and the only reason we know about it is because FTX is now bankrupt. NYT In addition to this alleged Bitcoin short, Sam Bankmen-Fried also sold $300M worth of FTX stock during a private funding round. He has not been arrested and is expected to speak at a conference in New York this week , alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The Crypto Cycle Back in early 2017, these types of questions were asked quite frequently: Why Bitcoin? Why not Litecoin ( LTC-USD )? Why not Monero ( XMR-USD )? What about Ripple ( XRP-USD )? What about DASH ( DASH-USD )? What about Ethereum ( ETH-USD )? Would you rather own Bitcoin or Bitcoin SV ( BSV-USD )? A snapshot of the ten largest cryptocurrencies in May 2017 (CoinDesk) Each of these had their own distinct advantages over Bitcoin. Litecoin could do more transactions per second, so could DASH. Monero was more private Bitcoin (and still is), same for ZCash ( ZEC-USD ). Ripple/XRP had institutional support (before it was cool). NEM ( XEM-USD ) was adding new features to the blockchain, so was Ethereum. In the long run, the distinct advantages of these different cryptocurrencies has proven to be marginal. Today, they are mostly irrelevant, with the exception of Ethereum. Bitcoin is capable of processing twice as many transactions as Visa at 1/13th of the cost , using Lightning Network. This system enabled El Salvador to roll out Bitcoin as legal tender. Today, cryptocurrencies such as ZCash and DASH are mostly forgotten memories, buried under the torrent of recent smart-contract-enabled offerings. Cryptocurrencies such as Solana, Avalanche, Algorand, Cardano, Polkadot, Luna, Hedera, and Theta dazzled investors and VCs alike with innovative blockchain protocols and consensus mechanisms. In 2021, the excitement of smart contracts, DAOs, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, and NFTs propelled the cryptocurrency market to nearly $3T in capitalization. Once more, the question of Bitcoin's role and future became central to cryptocurrency. For the VC hype-machine, the future was FTT. For the Bitcoin community, ""Rome wasn't built in a day."" So yeah... ...I think some of the other platforms in the in the wider crypto space have tokens. And so, they're more focused on advertising the token. And so, they tend to be very heavy on marketing. Bitcoin doesn't have a marketing department. It just has lots of different individuals that own it, and essentially nobody really marketing it to the world, right? It's just marketed by organic adoption so it tends to be kind of low-key messaging, I guess. Right? And the people building on it are more interested in building lasting value because they don't have a token that they're trying to like rush to market or sell or something. -Adam Back, Blockstream CEO & Bitcoin pioneer My thesis is that the future will look something like the past, that the advantages of today's cutting-edge projects will prove to be marginal in the long run. To that effect, the hot air that is rushing out of the crypto ecosystem will result in a renewed focus on Bitcoin; Bitcoin will be able to reap the benefits of billions in VC-funded R&D, slowly hoovering up open-source innovation. This future is already emerging. There's work on a decentralized exchange for Bitcoin. There are multiple projects to bring more smart contract support to Bitcoin. There are B itcoin sidechains . There are even Bitcoin-linked NFTs. It begs the question, what new innovations will unleash the next wave of the cycle? Conclusions With the hot money making an exit, the industry is about go through a massive realignment of priorities and initiatives. I don't know where the price will ultimately bottom, but these developments are favorable to Bitcoin in the long run. It opens the door for Bitcoin to evolve beyond being ""digital gold"". It's a blow to centralized exchanges, which have become impediments to progress. Similarly, there is a very strong case for Ethereum. Perhaps the next era will be characterized as a strategic competition between the two.",NEUTRAL,DASH | ETH | SOL,BTC | DASH | ETH | REGULATION | SOL,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4561483-ftx-pain-is-bitcoins-gain?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4980716.jpeg
42388516,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHujP,1669838490,NFTs IRL: How Digital Collectibles Are Forging Offline Experiences,"Nestled between the iconic Roosevelt Hotel and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, there‚Äôs a buzzy new spot in Los Angeles that prides itself on exclusivity. Like other trendy social clubs, The Dancing Seahorse Club offers members-only benefits such as intimate concert experiences and exclusive access to its event space, which opened earlier this month. But instead of building its business on annual membership fees, the music-focused startup is offering life-long perks to holders of its non-fungible tokens (NFT).  ‚ÄúThere's just hundreds of benefits of on-chain solutions that we feel bring this business into the world of Web3,‚Äù said Alex Nahai, CEO of Dancing Seahorse, who has worked across the music and entertainment spaces for several years before embracing blockchain technology. ‚ÄúThrough our contacts and through what we're willing to invest into creating the best fan experience possible, we‚Äôre able to provide that.‚Äù  The brand offers two membership tiers in the form of profile picture (PFP) collections featuring its namesake seahorse logo ‚Äì 444 ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù NFTs that have a floor price of 88 ETH (about $111,860) on OpenSea as of the time of publishing and 8,888 ‚Äúpremium‚Äù NFTs that are being offered up at 3 ETH (about $3,810) each. So far, holders have been able to access a live performance from rapper Polo G at its nightclub and VIP gatherings at global shows featuring artists including Bad Bunny, Jack Harlow and Post Malone.  Dancing Seahorse says its goal is to ‚Äúchange the music industry forever,‚Äù and it joins a growing number of NFT projects that are focused on utility NFTs, which link real-world rewards and experiences to digital collectibles.  What are utility NFTs?  Although some people think of NFTs as either static JPEG images or pricy fine art collectibles, many NFT creators have started offering IRL perks for collectors who hold their NFTs. This method of incentivizing long-term ownership has helped stave off some of the uncertainty brought about by a frosty crypto winter and a sharp decline in NFT trading.  NFTs that offer real-world perks and experiences are called utility NFTs. While many are linked to colorful artwork or have collectible qualities that make them attractive to flip-happy investors, much of their value comes from a variety of practical applications. For example, some NFTs are being used in place of event tickets to reduce instances of fraud or price gauging, while other NFTs provide holders with 1:1 digital and physical goods.  Many successful art-focused NFT projects, including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Doodles, have introduced utility for holders, like hosting exclusive parties or meetups. These types of events are often referred to as ‚Äútoken gated‚Äù and require proof of NFT ownership to enter.  To enforce token gating at events, users are often asked to connect their crypto wallets to verify ownership of a specific NFT and claim an invitation. The event tickets can then be airdropped into a holder‚Äôs wallet, which was the approach serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuck took for his inaugural VeeCon conference earlier this year. To enter the conference, attendees needed to hold a VeeFriends NFT in their wallet and show an airdropped VeeCon NFT ticket at the door.  No third parties, less ticketing fraud  For Dancing Seahorse and other music-focused Web3 startups, utility NFTs can replace the need for physical tickets to get into events. Putting tickets on the blockchain lessens the dependence on third-party ticketing platforms that often charge additional fees, and can help customers dodge ticketing scams that continue to litter the music space.  These pain points are what prompted ticketing platform Groovoo to roll out NFT ticketing last month. The service allows event hosts to sell tickets in the form of NFTs, which helps them to verify ticket ownership and keep a record of all past transactions.  Arthur Sampaio, co-founder of Groovoo, told CoinDesk that blockchain technology offers built-in solutions to issues like ticketing fraud and theft.  ‚ÄúWe're focusing on how we can store tickets in a very secure way that cannot be tampered with,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMore specifically, what kind of information can we store on the blockchain so that other institutions can trust us?‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt's a very intrinsic characteristic of the blockchain,‚Äù he added.  Restaurant reservations and foodie fanfare  Utility NFTs are also helping to solve issues in the hospitality industry that can be frustrating for communities of self-proclaimed ""foodies.""  While getting a reservation at some of the most popular restaurants in New York City has become a nearly impossible task over the years, one company is using NFTs to sell preferential booking options to NFT holders, along with other exclusive experiences.  Front of House, an NFT events company that caters its menu of offerings to foodies, sells digital collectibles that offer bookings 24 hours in advance to exclusive restaurants that would otherwise require months-long wait time. Additional perks include members-only social events, menu preview tasting sessions and merchandise, among other things.  Phil Toronto, co-founder of Front of House, told CoinDesk that utilizing NFTs to offer reservations at exclusive restaurants can help broaden mainstream access to foodie culture and help curate communities of food lovers with shared interests.  ‚ÄúWe're doing our best to sort of liven up the term ‚Äòutility,‚Äô‚Äù Toronto said. ‚ÄúWe're taking an active role in demonstrating what could be possible in the physical world and bridging that with the digital token world.‚Äù  On the Front of House site, users can buy NFTs that offer privileged access to upscale New York restaurants such as Dame, Emmett‚Äôs on Grove and Hanoi House. Other collectibles include Polygon-based Wildair‚Äôs Donut Club, which comes with special merch offerings as well as collectible images by food photographer Evan Sung.  Another example is Flyfish Club, a private dining experience in New York City created by Vaynerchuck‚Äôs VCR group. It is only open to holders of its NFT, which at the time of publishing has a floor price of 3.5 ETH (about $1,270) on OpenSea.  Token-gated experiences to bolster community  NFT projects that offer utility are often successful at building tight-knit communities. This shared sense of affiliation and belonging among holders creates new opportunities for connection and encourages collaboration.  For Dancing Seahorse, hosting token-gated experiences gives music fans an opportunity to connect with each other and access exclusive performances by their favorite artists.  ‚ÄúWith Web3, people are finding that the experiences we provide also give people an opportunity to network,‚Äù said Nahai.  And while owning a sought-after NFT might interest some short-term investors, Front of House believes that creating unique, shared experiences is the real selling point for many holders of utility NFTs.  ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, this isn't about making money. It's about having an asset that provides you with something you can actually do,‚Äù said Toronto.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/30/nfts-irl-how-digital-collectibles-are-forging-offline-experiences,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c39a7c9a861d0b414874276aa1cfd3039d7be16-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The news comes as developers have gradually stopped participating on the testnet over the past few months, and participation rates have declined.  Ethereum runs testnets so that developers can run software before launching it on Ethereum‚Äôs main network (mainnet). Test networks essentially act as copies of the Ethereum mainnet, and they allow client teams, infrastructure providers and developers to test any changes to their applications before launching them in a more high-stakes environment.  Ethereum will also shut down its Rinkeby testnet sometime in mid-2023, giving developers ample time to move over any applications they have running to the Goerli or Sepolia testnets.  Read more: Etherscan Set to 'Deprecate' Ethereum‚Äôs Ropsten and Rinkeby Testnets  All of these testnets played important roles in development and testing prior to Ethereum's massive Merge upgrade, when Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Goerli and Sepolia both ran through their own tests of the Merge (meaning they transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake), so they are the most similar to the environment that the Ethereum blockchain operates under today. As such, those testnets are expected to continue to operate.  In October, blockchain explorer Etherscan shut down its infrastructure support for Rinkeby and Ropsten.  Ethereum developers consistently create testnets, depending on what upgrades they are trying to test.

42394089,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXVzh,1669835758,"FTX‚Äôs Collapse Was a Crime, Not an Accident","In the weeks since Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs cryptocurrency empire was revealed to be a house of lies, mainstream news organizations and commentators have often failed to give their readers a straightforward assessment of exactly what happened. August institutions including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have uncovered many key facts about the scandal, but they have also repeatedly seemed to downplay the facts in ways that soft-pedaled Bankman-Fried‚Äôs intent and culpability.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.  It is now clear that what happened at the FTX crypto exchange and the hedge fund Alameda Research involved a variety of conscious and intentional fraud intended to steal money from both users and investors. That‚Äôs why a recent New York Times interview was widely derided for seeming to frame FTX‚Äôs collapse as the result of mismanagement rather than malfeasance. A Wall Street Journal article bemoaned the loss of charitable donations from FTX, arguably propping up Bankman-Fried‚Äôs strategic philanthropic pose. Vox co-founder Matthew Yglesias, court chronicler of the neoliberal status quo, seemed to whitewash his own entanglements by crediting Bankman-Fried‚Äôs money with helping Democrats in the 2020 elections ‚Äì sidestepping the likelihood that the money was effectively embezzled.  Perhaps most perniciously, many outlets have described what happened to FTX as a ‚Äúbank run‚Äù or a ‚Äúrun on deposits,‚Äù while Bankman-Fried has repeatedly insisted the company was simply overleveraged and disorganized. Both of these attempts to frame the fallout obfuscate the core issue: the misuse of customer funds.  Banks can be hit by ‚Äúbank runs‚Äù because they are explicitly in the business of lending customer funds out to generate returns. They can experience a short-term cash crunch if everyone withdraws at the same time, without there being any long-term problem.  But FTX and other crypto exchanges are not banks. They do not (or should not) do bank-style lending, so even a very acute surge of withdrawals should not create a liquidity strain. FTX had specifically promised customers it would never lend out or otherwise use the crypto they entrusted to the exchange.  See also: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried's Crypto Empire Blur on Alameda's Balance Sheet  In reality, the funds were sent to the intimately linked trading firm Alameda Research, where they were, it seems, simply gambled away. This is, in the simplest terms, theft at a nearly unprecedented scale. While the total losses have yet to be quantified, up to one million customers could be impacted, according to a bankruptcy document.  In less than a month, reporting and the bankruptcy process have uncovered a laundry list of further decisions and practices that would constitute financial fraud if FTX had been a U.S. regulated entity ‚Äì even without any crypto-specific rules at play. Insofar as they enabled the effective theft of the property of American citizens, these ploys may still be litigated in U.S. courts.  The list is very, very long.  The many crimes of Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX  The Alameda connection  At the heart of Bankman-Fried‚Äôs fraud are the deep and (literally) intimate ties between FTX, the exchange that enticed retail speculators, and Alameda Research, a hedge fund that Bankman-Fried co-founded. While an exchange ultimately makes money from transaction fees on assets that belong to users, a hedge fund like Alameda seeks to profit from actively trading or investing funds it controls.  Bankman-Fried himself described FTX and Alameda as being ‚Äúwholly separate‚Äù entities. To reinforce that impression, Bankman-Fried stepped down as CEO of Alameda in 2019. But it has emerged that the two operations remained deeply tied. Not only did executives at Alameda and FTX often work out of the same Bahamian penthouse, but Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison were romantically linked.  Those circumstances likely enabled Bankman-Fried‚Äôs cardinal sin. Within days of FTX‚Äôs first signs of weakness, it became clear that the exchange had been funneling customer assets to Alameda for use in trading, lending and investing activities. On Nov. 12, Reuters made the stunning report that as much as $10 billion in user funds had been sent from FTX to Alameda. At the time, it was believed that as little as $2 billion of those funds had disappeared after being sent to Alameda. Now the losses appear to have been much higher.  It remains unclear precisely why those funds were sent to Alameda, or when Bankman-Fried first crossed the proverbial Rubicon to betray his depositors‚Äô trust. On-chain analysis has found the bulk of movements from FTX to Alameda took place in late 2021, and bankruptcy filings have revealed that FTX and Alameda lost $3.7 billion in 2021.  This is maybe the most befuddling part of the Bankman-Fried story: His companies lost massive amounts of money before the 2022 crypto bear market even started. They may have been stealing funds long before the blowups of Terra and Three Arrows Capital that mortally wounded so many other leveraged crypto players.  The FTT print and 'collateralized' loans  The initial spark that set FTX and Alameda Research on fire was CoinDesk reporting on the portion of Alameda‚Äôs balance sheet made up of the FTX exchange token, FTT. This instrument was created by FTX, but only a tiny portion of it was traded in public markets, with FTX and Alameda holding the vast majority. This meant those holdings were effectively illiquid ‚Äì impossible to sell at the open market price. Nonetheless, Bankman-Fried accounted for its value at that fictitious market price.  More dangerously still, FTT tokens are widely believed to have been used as collateral for loans, including loans of customer funds from FTX to Alameda. This is where the close ties between FTX and Alameda became truly toxic: Had they been genuinely independent firms, the FTT token might have been much more difficult or expensive to use as collateral, reducing the risk to customer funds.  This use of an in-house asset as collateral for loans between clandestinely related entities can be best compared to the accounting fraud committed by executives at Enron in the 1990s. Those executives served as much as 12 years in prison for their crimes.  Alameda‚Äôs margin liquidation exemption  In legal filings by the new CEO handling FTX‚Äôs bankruptcy and liquidation, it was reported that Alameda Research had special status as a user on FTX: a ‚Äúsecret exemption‚Äù from the platform‚Äôs liquidation and margin trading rules.  FTX, like other crypto platforms and some conventional equity or commodity services, offered users ‚Äúmargin,‚Äù or loans, that they could use to make trades. However, these loans are generally collateralized ‚Äì that is, users put up other funds or assets to back their borrowing. If the value of that collateral drops, or a margin trade loses enough money, the user‚Äôs collateral will be sold and the exchange will use that money to pay off the initial loan.  Liquidating bad margin positions is fundamental to keeping asset markets solvent. Exempting Alameda from these standards would give it huge advantages, while exposing other FTX users to immense hidden risks. Alameda could have kept losing positions open until they turned around, while competing users were closed out. Alameda was also in theory free to lose more money on FTX than it was able to pay back, leaving a hole where customer funds had been.  The exemption could be considered criminal from a number of angles. Above all, it means that FTX as a whole was fraudulently marketed. Rather than the even playing field an exchange is meant to be, it was a barrel full of customers.  Above them all, with shotgun poised, was Alameda Research.  Alameda front-running FTX listings  According to the crypto analytics firm Argus, there is strong circumstantial evidence that Alameda Research had insider access to information about FTX‚Äôs plans to list particular tokens. Because an exchange listing usually has a positive impact on the price of a token, Alameda was able to buy large amounts of these tokens before the listing, then sell them after the listing bump.  If these claims prove out, they would be perhaps the most obviously and brazenly criminal of the reported hanky-panky between Alameda and FTX. Setting jurisdictional questions to one side, the actions could be pursued under insider trading laws, even if the tokens concerned aren‚Äôt formally classed as securities.  In a similar situation earlier this year, an OpenSea employee was charged with wire fraud for allegedly buying assets based on early listing information ‚Ä¶ or insider trading. For the crime of merely front-running monkey JPEGs, that employee faces up to 20 years in prison.  Immense personal loans to executives  Executives at FTX reportedly received a total of $4.1 billion in loans from Alameda Research, including massive personal loans that were likely unsecured. As revealed by bankruptcy proceedings, Bankman-Fried received an incredible $1 billion in personal loans, as well as a $2.3 billion loan to an entity called Paper Bird in which he had 75% control. Director of Engineering Nishad Singh was given a loan of $543 million, while FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame received a $55 million personal loan.  The FTX situation has more smoking guns than a shooting range in Texas, but you might call this one the smoking bazooka ‚Äì a glaringly obvious sign of criminal intent. It‚Äôs still unclear how the bulk of those personal loans were used, but clawing the expenditures back will likely be a major task for liquidators.  The loans to Paper Bird were arguably even more worrying because they appear to have fueled more structural fraud by creating yet another related third party to shuffle assets between. Forbes has posited that some of the Paper Bird funds may have gone to buy part of Binance‚Äôs stake in FTX, and Paper Bird also committed hundreds of millions of dollars to various outside investments.  See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  That included many of the same venture capital funds that backed FTX. It will take time to sort out whether this financial incest constituted criminal fraud. But it certainly matches the broader pattern by which Bankman-Fried used secretive flows, leverage and funny money to deceptively prop up the value of various assets.  The 'bailouts' of entities holding FTT or loans  Speaking of which. In the summer of 2022, as the crypto bear market continued, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight, proposing bailouts of entities including bankrupt crypto lenders BlockFi and Voyager Digital. This was a moment when we at CoinDesk were among the deceived, welcoming SBF as a J.P. Morgan-style backstopper of the entire sector.  In a now infamous interview with CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box,‚Äù Bankman-Fried danced around the issue of where FTX got the cash for these backstops, and referred to these decisions as bets that may or may not pay off.  But that may not have been what was going on at all. In a recent column, Bloomberg‚Äôs Matt Levine hypothesized that FTX backstopped BlockFi using its FTT funny money. This Monopoly bailout may, in turn, have been intended to conceal FTX and Alameda liabilities that would have been exposed earlier if BlockFi had gone bankrupt sooner. There‚Äôs not even really a name for this ploy, but it echoes the end stages of many other corporate frauds.  Secretive purchase of a US bank  Examiners have discovered that Alameda Research invested $11.5 million into the miniscule Farmington State Bank community bank, an amount more than double the bank‚Äôs prior net worth. This may be illegal even in a vacuum: As both a non-U.S. entity and an investing firm, Alameda should have cleared a number of regulatory hurdles before it could acquire a controlling interest in a U.S. bank.  In the broader context of the FTX story, the bank stake goes from ‚Äúquestionably legal‚Äù to ‚Äúincredibly ominous.‚Äù Controlling a U.S. bank could have allowed Alameda and FTX to engage in any number of further shenanigans. Compare this, for instance, to attempts to buy U.S. banks by the Pakistan-founded Bank for Credit and Commerce International, which U.S. regulators repeatedly blocked. BCCI turned out to be an even more nefarious entity than FTX, and wanted to buy U.S. banks to bolster its global criminal money laundering empire.  Why the mainstream is getting it wrong  These are complex and in many cases nuanced forms of fraud ‚Äì largely echoing, it must be said, well-established models in the traditional finance world. That obscurity is one reason Bankman-Fried was able to masquerade as an honest player, and has likely helped keep coverage softer even after the collapse.  Bankman-Fried had also crafted a scruffy, nerdy image hard to square with malevolent thievery ‚Äì not unlike other 21st century luminaries like Mark Zuckerberg and Adam Neumann. In interviews, he talked a stream of nonsense tailored to snowjob outsiders about an industry that‚Äôs already full of jargon and complicated tech. He cultivated political and social influence through a web of strategic donations and insincere ideological statements.  See also: How Sam Bankman-Fried's 'Effective' Altruism Blew Up FTX | Opinion  Since his con collapsed, Bankman-Fried has continued to muddy the waters with carefully disingenuous letters, statements, interviews and tweets. He has attempted to portray himself as a well-intentioned but na√Øve kid who got in over his head and made a few miscalculations. This is a softer but more pernicious version of the crisis management approach Donald Trump learned from the black-hat mob lawyer Roy Cohn: Instead of ‚Äúdeny, deny, deny,‚Äù Bankman-Fried has decided to ‚Äúconfuse, evade, distort.‚Äù  And it has, to a significant degree, worked. Mainstream voices still parroting Bankman-Fried‚Äôs counterfactual talking points include Kevin O‚ÄôLeary, who portrays an investor on the reality show ""Shark Tank."" In a Nov. 27 interview with Business Insider, O‚ÄôLeary described Bankman-Fried as a ‚Äúsavant‚Äù and ‚Äúprobably one of the most accomplished traders of crypto in the world‚Äù ‚Äì despite recent data implying immense trading losses even when times were good.  O‚ÄôLeary‚Äôs status as an investor in, and formerly paid spokesperson for, FTX (we sure hope those checks clear, Kevin!) explain his continued affection for Bankman-Fried in the face of mounting contradictory evidence. But he is far from alone in burnishing Bankman-Fried‚Äôs image. The disgraced failed son of two Stanford University law professors will be handed the opportunity to defend himself onstage at the New York Times‚Äô DealBook Summit Wednesday.  The scale and complexity of Bankman-Fried‚Äôs fraud and theft appear to rival those of Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and Malaysian embezzler Jho Low. Whether consciously or through malign ineptitude, the fraud also echoes much larger corporate scandals such as Worldcom and, particularly, Enron.

Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, plunged by 18% in November, its biggest monthly loss in five months. Ether (ETH), the Ethereum blockchain‚Äôs native cryptocurrency and the second-largest overall, tumbled 21%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) lost 16%.  Hardest hit in digital-asset markets was a group of tokens commonly associated with Bankman-Fried ‚Äì because he either invested in them or was one of the biggest backers of the projects, or both. Colloquially, they have become known in crypto-market circles as the ‚ÄúSam coins.‚Äù  FTT, the utility token of the FTX exchange, tumbled 90%, falling from $26 to about $1.  The plunge began shortly after CoinDesk first reported on Nov. 2 that Alameda Research, a trading firm owned by Bankman-Fried, had a balance sheet chock full of the FTX exchange‚Äôs own tokens ‚Äì perhaps the first clear indication of improper self-dealing and excessive risk-taking by the entrepreneur. According to the report, Alameda held $3.66 billion of ‚Äúunlocked FTT‚Äù and a $2.16 billion pile of ‚ÄúFTT collateral‚Äù as the third-largest entry on the assets side of its accounting ledger.  Serum (SRM), the native token of a decentralized exchange on the Bankman-Fried-championed Solana blockchain, fell 70% in November ‚Äì the biggest loser for the month among the roughly 160 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index.  Solana‚Äôs native token, SOL, dropped 58% for the month as the Alameda balance sheet also revealed holdings of $292 million of ‚Äúunlocked SOL,‚Äù $863 million of ‚Äúlocked SOL‚Äù and $41 million of ‚ÄúSOL collateral.‚Äù The fear among traders was that Alameda (and other market players) might suddenly move to dump the tokens, further exacerbating the selling pressure.  The market fallout inflicted widespread casualties on the industry. Sino Global Capital, one of Asia‚Äôs biggest and most well-known crypto investors and led by longtime crypto investor Matthew Graham, was closely allied with FTX and had invested in many of the ‚ÄúSam coins.‚Äù According to the firm, its ‚Äúdirect exposure to FTX exchange was confined to mid-seven figures held in custody.‚Äù The firm has declined to quantify any losses related to indirect exposure, such as from holding the tokens that tumbled in value.  A key tone shift in crypto markets during the month was just how dramatically they diverged from the path of traditional markets. Stocks shined as investors processed speculation that the Federal Reserve might slow the pace of interest rate hikes as soon as December. The S&P 500 is up 2.2% in November, while gold climbed 7.8%.  November‚Äôs winners  BAND, the native token of cross-chain data oracle platform Band Protocol, was the big leader in the CoinDesk Market Index, surging 57% during the month. The jump came as its mainnet successfully upgraded to its BandChain, increasing throughput by 10 times.  Litecoin‚Äôs LTC token rallied 38%. The Litecoin blockchain is approaching its third mining-reward halving ‚Äì a programmed code that will cut LTC's pace of supply expansion by 50%.

Over the last 24 hours, the coin has registered substantial gains. With the price moving above the $1,233 resistance level, Ethereum price has pictured a positive short-term bullish thesis on its one-day chart. Technical outlook also agreed with the same and depicted a rise in demand for the king altcoin. Buyers will need to stick around for longer than the next couple of trading sessions for ETH to reach above the $1,300 price mark. The price of ETH must remain above $1,200 and $1,230, or else the bears will return. This would mean Ethereum could drop to a psychological floor of $1,000. The altcoin has logged considerable gains over the past week‚Äôs duration, surging more than 11%. ETH‚Äôs chart depicts accumulation, which is good for short-term bullish momentum. Related Reading: Polkadot Reflects Accumulation ‚Äì How Long Will It Trade Sideways? Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ETH was exchanging hands at $1,260 at press time. The next area of resistance for the altcoin stood at $1,280. It is, however, too early to determine if the altcoin has stabilized over the $1,230 price mark. It needs to trade above the $1,260 zone for the next trading sessions for the bulls to strengthen further. In case of this, the other price ceiling crucial for ETH‚Äôs upward movement was $1,350. On the other hand, a fall from the current price zone will take the price to $1,200 and then straight to $1,000. The amount of Ethereum traded in the last session increased, which showed bullishness. Technical Analysis ETH had nosedived into the selling zone at the beginning of this month; however, the altcoin has finally moved closer to the positive buying zone. The Relative Strength Index shot up to the neutral zone after remaining in the selling zone most of the month. This indicated that demand for the altcoin had returned to the market. A continued push from buyers will drag the indicator past the 50-mark, depicting more buyers than sellers. In relation to that, the Ethereum price moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which meant that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. In correspondence to other indicators, the altcoin depicted a buy signal on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates price momentum and trend reversal. MACD formed green signal bars above the half-line, indicating that if buyers acted on them, ETH would give returns. Bollinger bands depict price volatility and fluctuation; the bands were narrow, indicating price stability for Ethereum.

42420784,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYGxZ,1669833053,EU‚Äôs MiCA Law May Have an FTX-Shaped Loophole,"Officials in the European Union (EU) say their landmark new legislation, the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), would have prevented FTX-style collapses ‚Äì but there‚Äôs also a major loophole that could allow offshore companies to continue to operate within the bloc.  Even when the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation goes into force in the coming years, companies like FTX, based in the Bahamas, would still be able to serve EU clients without extra regulation, thanks to a technique known as reverse solicitation.  MiCA requires companies targeting the EU market to register with a local regulator, with checks on their governance and marketing ‚Äì ensuring that, for example, they don‚Äôt mislead potential investors, or misuse client funds, as FTX was alleged to have done before it filed for bankruptcy earlier in November.  But the text ‚Äì politically approved but not yet formally enacted ‚Äì contains some pretty wide exemptions that could in reality allow EU citizens to go to a foreign crypto site and buy all the bitcoin they want.  Reverse solicitation exists because, on a practical level, it‚Äôs hard for regulators to enforce financial rules on overseas firms, and because they don‚Äôt want to block companies from seeking foreign expertise outright. But it can also be abused, such as via standard contract clauses which deem a trade to have taken place at the client‚Äôs sole request.  MiCA broadly allows the practice, but, compared to other EU financial service laws, includes stronger powers for supervisors to stop solicitation being abused - including an ad ban for unauthorized products. However, the detailed ground rules need to be set by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which has to issue guidelines, and its officials already see this topic as a source of concern.  Reverse solicitation ‚Äúmight be a particularly pronounced problem in this space of crypto assets, and that is something that is of concern for us,‚Äù Steffen Kern, head of ESMA‚Äôs Risk Analysis and Economics Department, told lawmakers Wednesday.  ‚ÄúService providers outside the EU play a dominant role in crypto markets and should be expected to do so‚Äù even after MiCA is implemented, Kern added.  One answer, favored by the European Commission, which proposed MiCA and is now responsible for monitoring the new law, is to ensure other jurisdictions play ball using the same rulebook.  ‚ÄúCrypto asset markets are global, interconnected and mobile,‚Äù Alexandra Jour-Schroeder, a deputy director-general at the commission‚Äôs financial-services arm, told lawmakers on Wednesday, She said unilateral clampdowns in places like China have done little to curb citizens‚Äô access to crypto.  ‚ÄúWe have to be vigilant that our EU protections are not undermined by jurisdictions that ultimately fail to regulate and supervise their companies,‚Äù she said. She added that she wants other countries to adopt crypto rules on the EU model.  In traditional finance, received wisdom is that the problem will largely solve itself. Alhough you might find the odd client from overseas, to really scale up in the EU market you‚Äôll need a proper marketing campaign, which means you need to be based there; a regulatory badge of approval will prove a selling point, the argument goes.  ‚ÄúIn financial services there's a flight to quality over time‚Äù due precisely to FTX-style scandals, Barney Reynolds, a partner in the financial services practice of London law firm Shearman, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúBusiness gravitates to where the most sophisticated regulators and regulations are.""  The question is whether that logic applies in a sector where people are as likely to get advice from Reddit or YouTube as from a regulated financier, and where decentralized freedom from government control is part of the attraction. Jour-Schroder might be able to persuade the U.S. and U.K. to regulate crypto, but what about Bahamas, Dubai and Antigua, or those firms that deny they have any headquarters at all?  It‚Äôs that kind of question that leaves some lawmakers nonplussed, and concerned that EU registration confers an unfair disadvantage.  ‚ÄúCompanies physically present in the EU targeting EU consumers have to adhere to all these principles, rules and regulations,‚Äù Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen told CoinDesk after the Wednesday hearing. ‚ÄúThere's a disbalance, and a loophole.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don't really think they [the commission] have a concrete answer, and it's something that we have to look into in the future ‚Äì to find out how to prevent these loopholes from happening,‚Äù Hoogeveen said.

Most of my cases have been concentrated in the financial services field where I represented Wall Street, securities brokerage firms, commercial banks and national stock and derivatives exchanges ‚Äì in other words, traditional finance.  Starting in 2017, I pivoted my firm toward representing foreign and domestic crypto exchanges, as well as a host of startup enterprises using blockchain technology to disrupt traditional financial products and services.  James A. Murphy was the founder and chairman of law firm Murphy & McGonigle.  When I heard that Andrew Ross Sorkin was planning to interview FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (as part of the New York Times‚Äô DealBook Summit, scheduled before the Bahamian-based crypto exchange once worth $32 billion imploded), I reflexively went to my computer and typed up the first 10 questions that I would ask SBF, if given the chance.  See also: Let's Talk About the New York Times' 'Puff Piece'  Obviously, if we were going to court, I would have an outline with hundreds of questions and follow up points. Soon enough, Bankman-Fried will likely face a judge rather than a Times‚Äô columnist. But so long as he continues to ignore his lawyers‚Äô suggestions about not speaking publicly, it‚Äôs worth asking him tough questions.  The ‚ÄòOriginal Sin‚Äô  Sam, the FTX Terms of Service state very clearly that the assets customers deposit at FTX belong to the customers ‚Äì not to FTX.  You do realize it was illegal for you to misappropriate assets from your customers‚Äô accounts, right?  Potentially guilty confederates  Who at FTX or Alameda knew you were transferring those customer funds to Alameda Research [a hedge fund Bankman-Fried co-founded prior to FTX]?  The new FTX CEO, John J. Ray, III, has stated that you used ‚Äúspecial software to conceal the misuse of customer funds.‚Äù  Who helped you do that?  Show me the money  The New York Times has reported that $515 million was ‚Äúsuspiciously transferred‚Äù from FTX wallets after the bankruptcy filing.  Do you know where that money might be?  Are there any FTX assets hidden anywhere around the world, or in cold storage wallets, that the current management of FTX might be unaware of?  Something fishy in the Bahamas  The Bahamian authorities have admitted they ordered the transfer of certain FTX assets to wallets under their control after the U.S. bankruptcy was filed.  Did you help the Bahamian authorities transfer FTX assets?  See also: FTX Hack or Inside Job? Blockchain Experts Examine Clues  Major clawbacks  You personally borrowed $1 billion from Alameda. And one of your companies, Paper Bird, Inc., borrowed $2.3 billion from an Alameda affiliate.  That makes a total of $3.3 billion you borrowed.  Where is all that money right now?  Will you return those assets to the bankruptcy administrator immediately?  Can money buy you love? ‚Äì From the media  Which news organizations have you given money to through ‚Äúgrants,‚Äù ‚Äúdonations,‚Äù ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù or any other means?  FTX US ‚Äì not dead yet?  On Nov. 15 (four days after the bankruptcy filing), you tweeted that FTX US had sufficient assets to repay all its customers.  Was that statement true?  If so, why was FTX US placed into bankruptcy?  The other investment: political capital  You have been an enormous contributor to Democratic candidates in the U.S., and you even spoke of possibly spending $1 billion to elect a Democrat as president in 2024.  How many visits have you had with officials at the White House, members of Congress and Securities and Exchange Commissioner Gary Gensler? And what did you discuss with them?  Keeping secrets  The FTX bankruptcy lawyers are fighting very hard to keep the names of FTX customers secret.  Were any FTX accounts used by foreign or domestic political figures, ‚Äúrich and famous‚Äù people, oligarchs, drug cartels, terrorist groups or repressive regimes to hide their assets or engage in money laundering?

42388547,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRICbx,1669830839,"After Months at Arm‚Äôs Length, Sen. Brown Opens Door for Crypto Legislation","U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has widely been seen as the linchpin of legislation to set up oversight of the cryptocurrency industry. While his crypto suspicions have been clear in hearings, his plans for specific bills remained quiet until now.  Brown sent a letter Wednesday to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, for the first time outlining his willingness to work on legislation and the broad strokes of what that legislation should look like ‚Äì including that the approach must be comprehensive and rope in all the relevant financial agencies.  ‚ÄúSingle regulatory agencies currently generally do not have a comprehensive view of crypto asset entities‚Äô activities,‚Äù Brown argued in his letter, which highlighted the findings of a report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council led by Yellen, including its recommendation for legislation that would ‚Äúcreate authorities for regulators to have visibility into, and otherwise supervise, the activities of the affiliates and subsidiaries of crypto-asset entities.‚Äù  He said he wants to ‚Äúwork on such legislation,‚Äù especially in light of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX that destroyed many Americans‚Äô investments.  While the work on legislation is underway, he said U.S. financial agencies should keep up vigorous enforcement actions and ‚Äútake on the significant noncompliance with current law among crypto-asset firms.‚Äù  Brown‚Äôs remarks, however, don't reveal his views on existing legislative efforts. His position on a bill to regulate stablecoins, for instance, will be key, because such a bill ‚Äì like those being negotiated in the House Financial Services Committee and by other lawmakers on his committee ‚Äì will likely need his support. Brown hasn‚Äôt openly shared his view on more comprehensive efforts, such as the proposals from leading members of the Senate Agriculture Committee.  'Risky assets'  Meanwhile, at his committee‚Äôs hearing on nominations for Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. board members on Wednesday, Brown again made his crypto suspicions clear.  ‚ÄúWe can't let thousands of risky and volatile assets that are used only for speculation and sanctions evasion into our banking system, and we know that it‚Äôs a national security issue,‚Äù Brown said.  Yellen said at a separate event on Wednesday that the drama over FTX proves that this industry needs to have strong rules, ‚Äúand it doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù  ‚ÄúTo the extent that the crypto world could deliver faster, cheaper, safer transactions, we should be open to financial innovation,‚Äù she said at the New York Times' Dealbook Summit in New York. ‚ÄúThat said, that's not what most of it has been about.‚Äù  Brown asked the nominees at Wednesday‚Äôs hearing, ‚ÄúIs there any public purpose to crypto right now?‚Äù  ‚ÄúRight now, most of the public promise of crypto is for the future,‚Äù said Travis Hill, a Republican who President Joe Biden nominated to be the FDIC board‚Äôs vice chairman. ‚ÄúAs of today, most of that is theoretical and not part of everyday life.‚Äù  For his part, another Republican board nominee, Jonathan McKernan, suggested that the FDIC ‚Äì one of the three primary U.S. banking regulators ‚Äì may not be as relevant as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for directing crypto oversight.  ‚ÄúThere are some significant open questions as to what is a permissible activity when it comes to crypto at a bank,‚Äù McKernan said. ‚ÄúI think there is a role for the market regulators to play in continuing to define the rules of the road in this space, and the banks will need to similarly comply with that law.""  Skeptical senators  The hearing otherwise revealed a position solidifying among some Democrats on digital assets. Apart from Brown‚Äôs views, other Democrats also argued against exposing the banking system to cryptocurrency risks.  ‚ÄúI don't think crypto passes the smell test,‚Äù said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). ‚ÄúI don't want to give it credibility by regulation.‚Äù  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) may have been the hearing‚Äôs loudest anti-crypto voice, though.  ‚ÄúIf the crypto boosters had gotten their wish and a bunch of banks that the FDIC insures were all-in on crypto ‚Äì for example, holding FTX‚Äôs tokens on their balance sheets or accepting crypto tokens as collateral for loans ‚Äì would our banking system be less safe than it is today?""  ‚ÄúI would think so,‚Äù said Martin Gruenberg, the FDIC‚Äôs acting chairman who is nominated to again be its chairman. ‚ÄúThe failure of those firms was really limited to the crypto space and ended up not impacting the insured banking system.‚Äù",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | FTT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/30/after-months-at-arms-length-senates-brown-opens-door-for-crypto-legislation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9237b99d3ea098e8f3ef5a758f578410e198d762-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

And, by the way, BlockFi still owes $30 million of a $50 million fine.

42394087,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXVkJ,1669830644,A Self-Regulatory Organization Is the Best Way to Advance Crypto While Protecting the Public,"Our colleagues Adelle Nazarian, CEO of the American Blockchain PAC, and Alex Allaire, CEO of the American Blockchain Initiative, recently proposed chartering a self-regulatory organization (SRO) for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Doing so would advance U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs executive order calling for the responsible development of digital assets, arguably the most consequential presidential technology initiative since John F. Kennedy‚Äôs speech at Rice University launched America‚Äôs magnificent moonshot.  Much regulation of the financial industry is undertaken by self-regulatory organizations (SROs). Examples? The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the New York Stock Exchange.  Todd White is the founder of, and Ralph Benko the senior counselor to, the American Blockchain PAC.  They provide substantial public protection while avoiding many problems associated with inadequately funded regulators, doing their jobs often without the level of resources needed to allow them the nimbleness to protect consumers while not stifling innovation with compliance costs and red tape.  The financial industry itself, collectively, has greater domain expertise than can be expected of regulators. This reality invites transparent, fully accountable, self-regulation.  Formalized self-regulation is a model that the crypto sector would be smart to emulate, both for practical and reputational reasons.  Republicans now make up a slim majority in the House of Representatives. Notwithstanding their internal squabbles, the majority of Republicans trend deeply skeptical about government regulation. SROs constitute a well-tested, appealing, middle path.  Should Uncle Sam recognize a new, dedicated, SRO for digital assets? Or encourage broadening the mandate for an existing one, such as FINRA, which, among other things, licenses securities dealers and promotes ethical practices?  See also: Save Billions by Using the Blockchain to Distribute Federal Disaster Relief Money | Opinion  Good question. We respectfully submit that the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee in the upcoming 118th Congress would do well to tackle not whether, but how best, to recognize an SRO to police the sector in such a way as to protect the public while not stifling innovation.  We encourage the digital assets sector to come together to consider how to articulate and promulgate smart rules to encourage what President Biden has called for: the responsible development of digital assets.  Read more: Time for Crypto to Make Nice With Regulators | Opinion  No need to reinvent the wheel. Much may be learned by starting with a review of FINRA‚Äôs regulations, set forth here.  The protective ethos is crystal clear. Per FINRA: ‚ÄúFINRA is here to help keep investors and their investments safe. To ensure this protection, we enact rules and publish guidance for securities firms and brokers. We involve a number of interested parties in rulemaking deliberations so that broker-dealers and investors can have confidence they are collaborating on a level playing field. Our relationship to these participants, as well as the SEC, puts us in the unique position to guard the integrity of the market.‚Äù  Reflecting an equivalent ethos ‚Äì a level playing field, guarding the integrity of the market, just and equitable principles of trade, free and open markets, and protecting investors and the public interest ‚Äì it should be reasonably straightforward for FinTech to develop and administer effective rules.  Offering self-regulatory entities and formulating best practices, let the sector present its findings to Congress. From there, it should be possible to forge a political consensus as to how to advance the general welfare while fostering fintech innovation.  Anything traditional finance could do, we can do better.

42388538,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRIC9t,1669829834,Crypto Trader Auros Global Misses Payment on DeFi Loan as FTX Contagion Spreads,"Auros Global, a crypto trading firm, is the latest to face liquidity problems following the FTX collapse as it missed payment Wednesday on a decentralized-finance (DeFi) loan.  The firm borrowed 2,400 wrapped ether (wETH) worth about $3 million from a credit pool on Maple Finance, a DeFi lending platform.  ‚ÄúAuros is experiencing a short-term liquidity issue as a result of the FTX insolvency,‚Äù pseudonymous credit pool manager M11 Credit tweeted.  Auros joins other digital-asset firms, including BlockFi and Genesis Global Capital, that face financial difficulties as contagion spreads across the crypto industry. This phase of the now yearlong market rout started as crypto exchange FTX and its corporate sibling Alameda Research became insolvent and filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month. Genesis is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.  Auros‚Äô unsecured debt  There were ominous signs that indicate Auros is in a precarious liquidity position.  The trading firm borrowed 2,000 wETH ($2.6 million) with a 14-day maturity on Nov. 27, only three days before M11‚Äôs statement about Auros‚Äô short-term liquidity problems. Altogether, Auros has an outstanding debt of 8,400 wETH ($10.7 million) to M11‚Äôs wETH credit pool on Maple, according to Maple‚Äôs loan dashboard.  The same day, Auros also took out a two-week loan of $7.5 million in USDC stablecoin from another M11-managed pool on Maple.  Read more: FTX Files for Bankruptcy Protection in US; CEO Bankman-Fried Resigns  Auros also owes a $2.4 million outstanding debt in USDC to two separate credit pools on DeFi lender Clearpool‚Äôs platform, according to Clearpool credit dashboard. Both loans reach the maximum, meaning the borrower has to pay an unusually high interest rate (around 23% annualized percentage rate at press time) for the loans.  Credora, a crypto credit rating firm that works with Clearpool, downgraded Auros‚Äô creditworthiness to grade C (with AA being the best grade).  These loans are unsecured, meaning that the borrower did not pledge any assets against the loans and secured them with its allegedly good financial standing and trust that it would pay back.  If Auros cannot find a way out of its liquidity crunch, these loans are at risk of default, leaving the already embattled lending platforms with bad debt and threatening creditors with losses.  Auros Global did not return a request for comment. CoinDesk also reached out to Maple, M11 Credit and Clearpool for comment.  Unsecured crypto lending under stress  Auros‚Äô missed payment is another blow to unsecured crypto lending‚Äôs current business model.  Multiple loans from decentralized lending protocols defaulted in the last few months as digital asset trading firms faced insolvencies during the crypto market‚Äôs devastating downturn.  Blockwater, Invictus Capital and Alameda failed to pay back their loans from credit pools on TrueFi, leaving the platform with $11 million of bad debt. Creditors on Maple stomached a $7 million loss after Babel Finance‚Äôs loan was liquidated in June.  Unsecured credit providers such as Clearpool, Maple and TrueFi claim to be decentralized to a degree. However, they have to resort to traditional, time-consuming and rather centralized measures such as debt restructuring or court-assisted liquidation in case a loan defaults.

A malicious actor emailed both Coinbase and CoinDesk earlier this month, claiming to have ‚Äúdehashed‚Äù and ‚Äúdecrypted‚Äù sensitive data from 306 million Coinbase user accounts (Coinbase says it‚Äôs not mathematically possible to ‚Äúdehash‚Äù or ‚Äúdecrypt‚Äù data). The individual threatened to go public if Coinbase didn‚Äôt shell out $450,000.  Coinbase‚Äôs security team contacted the extortionist and later confirmed claims of a breach were unfounded. (Coinbase confirmed it typically collaborates with law enforcement in such cases but didn't elaborate on whether charges might be filed.)  ‚ÄúThis is an absolutely baseless extortion attempt. The individual is falsifying information to come across as legitimate, and they're just trying to extort money out of companies. I'm sure we're not the first company on their list or the only scam they have running,‚Äù Jeff Lunglhofer, chief information security officer at Coinbase, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Indeed, last month, Uber‚Äôs former chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, was convicted of two felonies for allegedly covering up a $100,000 extortion payment to hackers after a 2016 breach of the ride-sharing firm‚Äôs database.  Read more: Crypto Extortion on the Rise, Says Academic Study  Both the Uber scandal and the recent email incident prompted Lunglhofer to reiterate the importance of a robust bug bounty program in a new Coinbase blog post. A bug bounty is a reward that companies pay to individuals or outside security teams who discover and alert them to vulnerabilities in their systems.  ‚ÄúIn the wake of the recent Uber verdict, there is a lot of concern in the industry about bug bounty submissions becoming extortion attempts,‚Äù Lunglhofer wrote. ‚ÄúWe thought we would share some of the best practices for responsible disclosure, illustrated by a recent (fraudulent) extortion attempt we received.‚Äù  You‚Äôve spotted a bug. Now what?  If an individual discovers a vulnerability on any of Coinbase‚Äôs platforms, Lunglhofer emphasizes providing a detailed and accurate description of the alleged bug.  ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt evaluate a submission that lacks sufficient detail,‚Äù he states.  The details Lunglhofer typically looks for are things like access paths to sensitive information or to actual crypto assets, as well as an indication of potential damage from the vulnerability.  Once an individual collects all pertinent details, the second step is ensuring Coinbase has sufficient time to patch the bug before disclosing its existence to anyone else.  ‚ÄúA responsible security researcher will always provide a reasonable amount of time for us to respond to and fix a security issue before disclosing the details to any other party,‚Äù Lunglhofer says.  Read more: In Praise of White-Hat Hackers, but Overreliance Is Foolish  Finally, Lunglhofer stresses the importance of remaining lawful. Attempting to extort or blackmail a company for $450,000 is blatantly criminal.  ‚ÄúA bug bounty submission can never contain threats or any attempts at extortion. We are always open to paying bounties for legitimate findings,‚Äù Lunglhofer says. ‚ÄúRansom demands are an entirely different matter.‚Äù  Coinbase‚Äôs bug bounty program marked its 10-year anniversary last month. The program has found and fixed more than 600 bugs and paid out more than $400,000 in bounties this year alone.

The figure speaks to the success of Telegram‚Äôs second go-around at bootstrapping its own crypto infrastructure. Fragment is built atop the The Open Network, a blockchain Durov abandoned under regulatory pressure in 2020 and later returned to after its community kept it alive.  Bolstered by Fragment‚Äôs strong sales, Durov is setting Telegram on a course for deeper crypto buildouts. He said the company will build a decentralized exchange and non-custodial wallets that could reach millions of users. Telegram is already a go-to messaging app for many crypto traders, giving it a captive audience from the start.  The statement is the first confirmation of Telegram‚Äôs direct involvement with integrating TON blockchain into the messenger app. Earlier, Durov spoke of the blockchain development as a community project Telegram was just happy to watch. The system, earlier known as Newton and Toncoin, is one of two rival projects that grew out of the initial TON concept developed by Telegram. Both were developed by the community of supporters, although only one ended up with Telegram‚Äôs official recognition.  In a message on his personal channel, Durov contrasted Telegram‚Äôs effort with the ‚Äúexcessive centralization‚Äù of failed crypto exchange FTX.  ‚ÄúCryptocurrency users should switch to trustless transactions and self-hosted wallets that don't rely on any single third party,‚Äù he said.

Similar sentiment is often shared with fellow delisted token Stellar (XLM), and both tokens typically sit in the top 25-50 in terms of biggest tokens by market cap ‚Äì making them surprising cuts considering some of the more fringe, lesser-known tokens that Coinbase has listed previously. The final two tokens, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) are both the result of forks and will be recognizable to more legacy crypto users who can recall when these tokens came into existence as early ‚Äòforked coins‚Äô. Their stagnant performance and slow retraction of relevance has led to an unsurprising result with this announcement. Users impacted should refer to Coinbase‚Äôs blog post on the matter for more details. Related Reading: Polkadot Reflects Accumulation, How Long Will It Trade Sideways?

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Surges, Now Has A Value Of 2.44 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, this sell signal might lead to BTC‚Äôs price dropping in the next ten days. The ‚ÄúNetwork Value to Transactions ratio‚Äù (NVT ratio) is an indicator that‚Äôs defined as the market cap divided by the transacted volume in a specific period. What this metric tells us is how the value of Bitcoin currently compares with the investors‚Äô ability to transact coins, and thus if the crypto is undervalued or overvalued right now. One application of this ratio is through the NVT golden cross, which compares the short-term (10-day moving average) and the long-term (30-day moving average) trends in NVT to indicate tops and bottoms in the crypto‚Äôs price. Related Reading: Which Cryptocurrencies To Buy in 2023: Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Historically, the metric‚Äôs value being higher than 2.2 has usually been a signal to sell, while it being less than -1.6 has been a bullish sign. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT golden cross over the last year: The value of the metric seems to have sharply gone up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT golden cross has observed some sharp uptrend recently. The indicator now has a value of 2.44, meaning it has exceeded the 2.20 level that has historically implied sell signals. Related Reading: As Stepn (GMT) Decline Continues, BudBlockz (BLUNT) Offers A Better Alternative For Crypto Investors During late May, the metric saw a similar surge and rose to a peak value of 2.77. When the following month rolled around, BTC went through a huge crash from $30k to $20k. Since the crypto is once again overpriced according to the NVT golden cross, it‚Äôs possible the coin may go through more drawdown in the coming days. However, as the metric‚Äôs value is still lower than what it was at the high preceding the June crash, there might be potential for it to rise further, before the actual sell signal is in.

The current crypto ecosystem may prove to be unstable and unsustainable in its current form. A large part of the earlier successes of the cryptocurrency system was created by the financial bubble, created in turn by the Federal Reserve System. Now, we are seeing in many places the weaknesses that exist in a ""new"" technological system that has been overly stimulated by excessive amounts of money to draw on. The concern: there will be more failures as the crypto world works to build itself out of the bubble it has been living in. It was coming. Now, the pace seems to be picking up. BlockFi, a firm involved in the crypto world, has gone under. This loss follows the closing of FTX. And, this all follows the falling of Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital, and Celsius Network. We read in the Financial Times , ""The sheer interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem suggests it is now inherently unstable for all participants."" BlockFi has up to $10 billion in liabilities, which include customer accounts and settlement payments it owes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, FTX rescued BlockFi in the spring when there was another round of crypto collapses. ""BlockFi secured an emergency credit line of $400 million which also gave FTX a cheap option to buy BlockFi outright."" Now, BlockFi is arguing that ""it could simply reorganize in weeks and come out the other side revitalized."" But, courts don't move that fast, and it is not altogether certain that the crypto asset world will be able to recover that rapidly if in any form like it exists now. The article concludes, ""There is little reason to imagine that the crypto ecosystem can become sustainable in its current form."" History BlockFi came to life in 2017 and was created to provide credit services to markets with limited access to simple financial products. It was once valued at $3.0 billion. Peter Thiel, a Libertarian and cryptocurrency supporter, has been a strong financial backer of BlockFi. Thiel reportedly held a 19 percent position in BlockFi. BlockFi really began to function as money flowed into the cryptocurrency world around 2019 and beyond as the Federal Reserve created an investment bubble that supported the rise of many markets for financial assets and allowed billions of dollars to flow into these speculative markets. But, as the ""bubble"" progressed, not all firms prospered. FTX, founded in 2019, was another ""startup"" that was founded in 2019 and participated in the financial well created by the Fed in the 2020 and 2021 period. FTX was at one time valued at $32 billion. And, as suggested above, there are many more startup and early-stage companies in the crypto world that were founded in this time period who owe most of their existence to the amount of money that was just floating around the U.S. economy looking for a place to make a lot of quick profit. The M2 money stock rose by about 25.0 percent in 2020. Never has so much money been injected into the U.S. economy in one year. Then in 2021, the M2 money stock rose by another 12.5 percent, again an event that has hardly ever happened. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) went from about $5,000 in March 2020 to around $67,500 in November 2021. Well, the crypto world boomed and many investors made a lot of money. But, then the Federal Reserve began to signal that it was going to tighten. Bitcoin hit its peak price around November 8, 2021. The Federal Reserve really began to tighten up on its monetary brakes in the middle of March 2022. The price of bitcoin plummeted. The price now...around $16,000. And, companies dealing heavily in the cryptocurrency world weakened along with bitcoin. And, companies dealing heavily in the cryptocurrency world failed. FTX failed. Now, BlockFi has failed. And, there will be more. As the Financial Times article stated, ""[T]he crypto ecosystem suggests it is now inherently unstable for all participants."" Where We Are Now News of more failures in the near future will not be a surprise. Keep your eyes open. The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing its monetary tightening well into the 2023s. The U.S. economy is in disequilibrium, and it is going to take some time to get out of the mess it is in. Plus, you have more and more new technologies pushing to get started and to create their own path to profits. What the crypto world is going through is not new. Most innovative cycles go through some kind of shaking-out period as they move on into the future. The cryptocurrency world hit the ground running, with an asset price bubble that was being created by the Federal Reserve System. The results, for a time, were spectacular. But, the good times must come to an end. And, that is what we are going through. The problem is that on the downside, the adjustments that must be made to an evolving technology tend to be even more painful than in a ""more normal"" adjustment time. That is what we face. The world, as I have stated before, is going to become digital. But, it has to go through the process to find out the best ways to advance. A world that is flooded with money is not going to find that way because of all the possibilities that exist. This is a time of radical uncertainty.

Gemini was added to the OAM registry on Nov. 4 while Nexo was registered on Oct. 28.  It is mandatory for crypto firms to be approved for registration via a local legal entity with the Organismo Agenti e Mediatori (OAM), which maintains lists of financial agents operating in the country. Registration with OAM means the two platforms will be subject to the country's anti-money-laundering requirements.  Crypto exchanges including Binance, Coinbase and Coinify have been approved for registration since the list was set up in May, although a recent investigation by CoinDesk found the companies in the registry ‚Äì which now has 80 approved firms ‚Äì may not be subject to any anti-money-laundering checks until next year.  Gemini now operates in 65 countries and was also recently registered as a custodial wallet provider and provider of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies with Greece‚Äôs Hellenic Capital Markets Commission, the firm said on Wednesday.  Nexo already boasts more than 50 licenses worldwide, the company said in a statement to the press. With the OAM registration, Nexo plans on offering Italian customers ""transfers, issuance and exchange of virtual currencies, and digital wallet services.""  The registration also offers Nexo ""greater flexibility and robustness in its compliance across the European market,"" the statement said.

42388262,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCUYp,1669816800,Bitcoin Custody Firm Casa to Add Ethereum Support,"Casa, a popular Bitcoin self-custody firm, is adding Ethereum support to its platform in what some may consider an unlikely move. An overhauled version of the Casa app will launch in January, according to the firm.  Although the company's original CEO and co-founder, Jeremy Welch, had floated the idea of onboarding multiple cryptocurrencies early in the firm's history, some people consider Casa to be a purely Bitcoin company. This may have to do with the popularity of the firm‚Äôs chief technology officer and co-founder, Jameson Lopp, an outspoken cypherpunk and Bitcoin advocate with nearly half a million Twitter followers.  Read more: What Is Crypto Custody?  Regardless of the public perception, come January Casa will not only support Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), but will also be easier to use, thanks to user experience improvements that will be part of the platform overhaul, according to a release provided to CoinDesk.  ‚ÄúCasa will soon debut a refreshed app, with an enhanced look and feel that will improve members‚Äô experience. Following that, Casa will introduce Ethereum storage, as well as new membership plans,‚Äù the release said.  The app works by leveraging crypto‚Äôs multisignature, or ‚Äúmultisig,‚Äù functionality. Multisig is when a user needs more than one signature to spend crypto funds. A user holding bitcoin (BTC) in a Casa wallet for example, could use a ‚Äú2-of-3‚Äù multisig, meaning, three private keys exist, but only two are required to spend funds. If the user loses one key, they can still access their funds with the remaining two (one of which is entrusted to and securely stored by Casa).  ‚ÄúYou have multiple keys protecting one pool of bitcoin or ether. That means if you lose one key, you don't lose all of your money,‚Äù current Casa CEO, Nick Neuman, told CoinDesk in an interview. ‚ÄúSo you actually have some resilience and redundancy that provides significantly more security, and you don't have these stories of people losing their life savings.‚Äù  Crypto custody for 'everything important'  Indeed, cryptocurrency exchange FTX‚Äôs swift collapse earlier this month saw many retail investors, including former FTX employees, lose their financial nest eggs. The implosion reinvigorated the ‚Äúnot your keys, not your coins‚Äù mantra (meaning, control of crypto assets requires control of the assets‚Äô private keys) and appears to have brought self-custody solutions to the forefront.  ‚ÄúThe recent failure of FTX ‚Äì and ensuing catastrophic loss of customer funds ‚Äì highlights the critical importance of people having a simple and secure way to hold their own private keys,‚Äù said Lopp. ‚ÄúSelf-custody is the only way to prove ownership and control of your digital assets.‚Äù  Read more: FTX Employees Were Encouraged to Keep Life Savings in the Now-Bankrupt Exchange, Sources Say  What of Lopp‚Äôs strong ties to the Bitcoin community and the image of Casa (at least to some) as a ‚ÄúBitcoin only‚Äù platform? Will onboarding Ethereum tarnish that image and trigger an exodus of so-called ‚ÄúBitcoin maximalists‚Äù from Casa‚Äôs customer base? Neuman doesn't think so.  ‚ÄúEthereum has been our most frequent customer request for the last couple of years, and so am I concerned that it will damage our brand or business? No, because we've been listening to our customers,‚Äù Neuman said. ‚ÄúThe vision for Casa is really about being the private key manager for everything important in your life. So that's not just your bitcoin.

In anticipation of today‚Äôs speech by US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell at the Brookings Institution, crypto bulls seem to be anticipating possible dovish comments. At press time, Ether (ETH) was trading at $1,265, with trading volume continuing to fall to just $7.8 billion, down about 2.8% from the previous day. With the current move, Ethereum has managed to break through the key resistance at $1,230. As NewsBTC reported, resistance at $1,288 (on Binance) is now up for grabs before the first major resistance is encountered at the $1,300 level. In addition, investors should keep an eye on the $1,330 level as this is the threshold to recoup losses from the FTX crash. Ethereum Whales Foreshadowing Bigger Price Moves Meanwhile, data from Santiment is backing the bullish case for Ethereum (ETH). The on-chain analytics firm shared that Ethereum‚Äôs large key addresses have increased since the FTX debacle in early November. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Offers Trade Opportunities After Recent Bullish Breakout In the chart below, the key moments when ‚Äúsharks‚Äù and ‚Äúwhale‚Äù addresses accumulated and dumped ETH can be seen.

The crypto winter predicted to wind up in early November by some experts is still in full swing. Crypto critics like Warren Buffet still views crypto as a risky asset. The FTX saga has further changed the narrative, with investors unsure of keeping their holdings with exchanges. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has support in the lawsuit against XRP. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Continues To Impress With 25% Rally In Last Seven Days In the wake of these chaotic events in the past weeks, the market outlook has shown a high fear index. As a result, bitcoin mining is taking a beating as events continue to unravel daily. Hash Ribbon Forms A Death Cross ‚Äì What Does It Mean? The hash ribbons ‚Äì a technical indicator ‚Äì has formed a so-called ‚Äúdeath cross‚Äù that has previously indicated bitcoin miners buckling under pressure. These indicators use simple daily moving averages to unravel any changes in hash rates. Hash ribbons are renowned for long-term applications to identify macro bottoms on a Bitcoin chart. The formation of a bearish cross signals a strong downtrend. It means hash rates will reduce from the previous optimal levels. According to Charles Edwards on Twitter, the miner capitulation is a fallout from the $10 billion FTX fraud and collapse. Will Clemente, an industry analyst, observed the signal stating that ‚Äúwe are potentially entering into a double dip miner capitulatory period.‚Äù A similar event occurred in June 2022 with the formation of a death cross after the collapse of Luna. Glassnode reports that the hash rate seven-day moving average stands at 13.7% less than the all-time high value. The mining difficulty will now vary by -9% in the coming week. Hash rates have dropped dramatically as more miners begin to shut down their mining rigs. The hashrate today stands at 234 EH/s (exahashes per second. The mining difficulty is at its peak of 36.9 T. this figure will reduce with the hashrate falling and the competition between miners reducing. However, mining profitability (hash price) is the worst hit standing at $0.056 per day for each TH/s. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Exchanges Keeps Sliding, 1 Million BTC Pulled From These Platforms Profitability has been declining, with an 82.55 decrease observed within a year. In addition, miner capitulations lean toward the bears and add more selling pressure leading to the BTC price falling in the short term. Bitcoin Price Update Bitcoin price has shown signs of a slight revival today. Despite a brief retracement on Sunday, the price has consolidated in the $16,000 to $17,000 range. The FTX effect on the market is the leading cause of the latest downtrend. BTC is far from its November 2021 all-time high value by 76.5% and is trading at a two-year low. The current crypto market closely mirrors the bear market of late 2018 following the capitulation in November of that year. With such an unexpected turn of events, a bullish rally might not hold for a while. With the bearish cross in the hash ribbons, pessimism is on the rise for crypto prices. With lower rewards for miners, it is most likely that more miners will close shop in the coming weeks.

""Bitcoin has never been used to any significant extent for legal real-world transactions,"" he and adviser J√ºrgen Schaff wrote in a blog post titled ""Bitcoin's Last Stand"" on Wednesday. While bulls seem heartened by bitcoin's ability to hold the $16,000-$20,000 range amid the crypto collapse, Bindseil and Schaff called the current price action ""an artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.""  The ""conceptual design and technological shortcomings,"" of bitcoin make it unsuitable for payments, and since the crypto does not generate cash flows or dividends, it's a poor investment as well, they argued.  Trotting out the well-worn Ponzi argument, the two claimed bitcoin's value is reliant on continuing waves of fresh money from new investors, and said ""big bitcoin investors have the strongest incentives to keep the euphoria going.""  Don't misunderstand regulation as approval, the two warned, criticizing the fast-growing crypto lobbying class as putting forth the idea that crypto is just another asset class worthy of a spot in investor portfolios.  The ECB is not known for championing crypto but the bank's critical assessment of bitcoin came with a warning about how the industry is regulated. In fact, lawmakers and regulators around the world are scrutinizing their approach to supervising crypto following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which operated across multiple jurisdictions with little accountability.  On Wednesday, Singapore's financial regulators defended their standards of supervision to lawmakers and explained why a state-owned fund was invested in the fallen crypto enterprise.  Meanwhile, in the European Union ‚Äì which recently agreed on the text for its sweeping Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation ‚Äì lawmakers expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the rules, and if they'd be tough enough to prevent future collapses.  Bindseil and Schaaf closed out their essay by criticizing the energy-intensive Bitcoin network as ""an unprecedented polluter,"" and warned banks of likely ""reputational damage"" from promoting bitcoin.

Keyrock will use the funding to invest in infrastructure development, scalability tools and regulatory licensing across Europe, the U.S. and Singapore.  The funding round closed in September, Keyrock co-founder and CEO Kevin de Patoul told CoinDesk in an interview. The announcement, however, comes at a pivotal time for market makers, which provide liquidity in crypto markets.  Alameda Research, the sister company of bankrupt exchange FTX and a major market maker, was revealed to have liquidity issues in a Nov. 2 CoinDesk report, striking the first domino that led to the collapse of FTX and a massive crypto contagion that continues to spread. The survival and health of other market makers is vital to retaining stability in other crypto markets.  Founded in 2017 in Brussels, Keyrock pulled most of its assets from FTX the weekend after the CoinDesk story broke, but ‚Äúa little bit‚Äù remained stuck, de Patoul said. The amount was ‚Äúnot consequential‚Äù to operations or the stability of the firm, and no client funds were affected. The minimal exposure came down to solid risk-mitigation practices and an eye toward long-term strength rather than overly rapid growth.  ‚ÄúWe had the vision to create a system that would allow us to provide liquidity at a very large scale to all digital assets,‚Äù de Patoul said. ‚ÄúToday, digital assets equal crypto. In our minds, down the line, every single asset will have a digital representation.‚Äù  Keyrock was founded by de Patoul, software developer Jeremy de Groodt and entrepreneur Juan David Mendieta. The firm uses proprietary technology to provide scalable and adaptable liquidity products to marketplaces and asset issuers, including more than 85 trading venues and investor Ripple.  Keyrock now has an office in the U.K. and plans to expand to Switzerland and Singapore in early 2023. In the past year, Keyrock has expanded its trading volume threefold despite the bear market and doubled its global workforce to more than 100. The firm plans to double its headcount again in the coming year, going against the tide of hiring freezes in the crypto industry.

42394091,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXW4p,1669811400,MetaMask IP-Sharing Debacle Highlights the Scourge of Crypto Centralization,"Last week, the leading crypto wallet provider MetaMask came under fire for a change to its terms of service that revealed it was sharing user IP information with Infura, a piece of blockchain infrastructure created by MetaMask creator ConsenSys.  ConsenSys, a research and development company led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, built MetaMask to offer users a convenient way to store and trade their crypto without needing to trust centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance ‚Äì platforms that store, or ‚Äúcustody,‚Äù funds on a user‚Äôs behalf.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk‚Äôs weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum‚Äôs evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Relative to ‚Äúcold‚Äù wallets that allow users to custody their crypto keys on a kind of USB thumb drive, MetaMask, a ‚Äúhot wallet,‚Äù is installed on your phone or web browser and is continuously connected to the internet. While convenient ‚Äì you only need to keep track of a username and password, not a physical thumb drive ‚Äì ‚Äúhot wallets‚Äù are theoretically more vulnerable to attacks and information leaks because they are always connected to the Web.  But compared to centralized exchanges, hot wallets like MetaMask are, at least in theory, more private and secure than allowing someone else to manage your assets.  The revelation that MetaMask was sharing IP information with Infura set off a firestorm on Twitter, with many users upset to learn their identifying information could have leaked to Infura ‚Äì meaning their transaction history was not as private as they once thought.  Where we store our crypto keys matters  The FTX debacle, along with last week‚Äôs MetaMask controversy, resurfaced a familiar refrain in the world of crypto: ‚Äúnot your keys, not your crypto.‚Äù  If you hold your funds on a centralized platform, they risk being stolen or misappropriated (as happened in the case of FTX, which apparently loaned out user funds without users knowing).  Downloading a hot wallet was supposed to be a safer way to get around the ‚Äúnot your keys‚Äù problem ‚Äì your MetaMask funds are only accessible to you. But when users realized that MetaMask, too, was vulnerable to centralizing parties, they scrambled to figure out how they might be able to use the wallet without connecting it to Infura ‚Äì a so-called RPC service that MetaMask uses to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain.  While ConsenSys noted in a statement that it is technically possible to use MetaMask sans Infura, users quickly realized that doing so would be confusing and impractical ‚Äì requiring one to jerry-rig a new solution for reading information from the Ethereum blockchain.  The MetaMask controversy ‚Äì and the anti-centralization discourse that surrounded it ‚Äì serves as a harsh reminder of a hard truth that the crypto industry must face as it rebuilds from the FTX rubble: Centralized intermediaries have seeped deep into the crypto user experience.  In the crypto world ‚Äì particularly within the Ethereum ecosystem ‚Äì ‚Äúcentralization,‚Äù the idea of influence and oversight from central parties, is viewed as anathema to the core, post-2008 concepts upon which the technology was born.  But time and time again ‚Äì at every single level of the crypto user experience ‚Äì centralization continues to rear its head.  When Mt. Gox, the first large crypto exchange, lost user funds to a hack in 2014, it was ‚Äì at the time ‚Äì processing around 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. The Mt. Gox calamity was supposed to be a wake-up call to the dangers of centralized parties in crypto, a time to return to self-custody and first principles.  But almost a decade later, FTX collapsed in an even more cynical fashion ‚Äì with the exchange‚Äôs own creators misappropriating user funds.  Decentralization vs. ease of use  Though there has been early evidence of users moving to decentralized platforms in response to FTX, centralized platforms such as Binance, Coinbase and Kraken remain the dominant methods by which people store and trade crypto.  It‚Äôs hard to tell someone to go out and buy a cold wallet and use Uniswap to exchange their crypto when there‚Äôs an abundance of nicely packaged, easy-to-use centralized platforms waiting around.  Even if more of today‚Äôs centralized incumbents fall apart, it‚Äôs difficult to imagine that traditional financial institutions won‚Äôt eventually fill the void they leave behind with their own heavily regulated crypto entry points.  And it‚Äôs not just the technology by which retail users access crypto that has lent (and will continue to lend) power to centralized intermediaries; even the core technology upon which blockchains operate has not been immune to centralization.  The validators that operate Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain do so by ‚Äústaking‚Äù some sum of cryptocurrency with the blockchain in order to help write and authenticate transactions. But staking is a technically complicated endeavor, and misconfiguring a staking node can incur costly penalties.  As a result, more and more users are opting to stake (and earn rewards for doing so) via centralized platforms like Coinbase and Binance. Even community-driven ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù staking services, like Lido, have caught the ire of decentralization maximalists due to their massive influence over the Ethereum ecosystem.  And then there‚Äôs the block-building process, the technically complicated means by which validators compile user transactions and write them to the blockchain. In order to extract MEV ‚Äì extra profit that can be earned by ordering transactions in a clever way ‚Äì validators are increasingly turning to third parties like Flashbots to build blocks for them.  Heavy use of the Flashbots block builders, while convenient and lucrative, has led to fears that certain kinds of transactions ‚Äì like those associated with U.S. Treasury Department-sanctioned Ethereum addresses ‚Äì might have a harder time making it onto the blockchain because Flashbots excludes the transactions from blocks to avoid angering regulators.  While tech-savvy, ideological-driven crypto users might find ways to run and transact on blockchains in accordance with the movement‚Äôs founding principles, retail investors and financial institutions ‚Äì those that need to adopt crypto technology in order for it to achieve internet-scale ubiquity ‚Äì will continue to gravitate toward easy-to-use middlemen that abandon decentralization in favor of convenience and capitalism.  While it is reasonable to strive for a fully decentralized financial ecosystem, it is difficult to imagine that the financial instruments of the future ‚Äì or, at the very least, the means by which most people access them ‚Äì won‚Äôt look more like Coinbase than Uniswap.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/30/metamask-ip-sharing-debacle-highlights-the-scourge-of-crypto-centralization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f101f4daaa8acc8204d61dd04cd3cfe351f33d20-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new law, inspired by international standards designed to curb crypto tax evasion, could also apply to stablecoins, derivatives and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and force even non-EU based crypto providers to register within the bloc, the document reveals.  ‚ÄúThe obligation to report income earned through crypto-asset investments and the exchange of such information will help Member States receive a full set of information in order to collect tax revenues due,‚Äù said a draft of the document proposing the bill seen by CoinDesk.  Existing tax rules known as the Directive on Administrative Cooperation seek to avoid people stashing money in foreign bank accounts to avoid taxation ‚Äì but officials are now concerned that crypto accounts provide an escape route.  The move is also needed to better enforce financial blocks placed on Russia, the document added, citing fears that ‚Äúcrypto-assets could be used as a means of avoiding sanctions‚Äù which focus on more traditional assets.  Under the plans, crypto asset providers would have to collect and verify information about their users such as names, addresses, social security numbers and dates of birth, which would then be sent to the tax authorities in the user‚Äôs country of tax residence.  The rules would extend beyond an existing crypto-asset law known as MiCA, covering companies offering non-fungible tokens (NFT), and foreign companies that have incidental clients within the bloc.  ‚ÄúSuch crypto-asset service providers have to register in a Member State‚Äù of the EU, the document said, adding that ‚Äúlimiting the scope solely to EU-based crypto-asset service providers could significantly decrease the tax revenues of each option.‚Äù  MiCA, in contrast, requires EU-based cryptocurrency companies to register and have minimum governance norms, but carves out other Web 3 innovations such as NFTs. Total IT and other startup costs for implementing the measures will amount to hundreds of millions of euros, borne by crypto providers and tax administrations, the document said.  ‚ÄúThe Directive applies to both centralized and decentralized platforms as well as small or recently established businesses,‚Äù the bill said.  ‚ÄúThe definition of crypto assets is very general and targets as well those assets that can be held and transferred in a decentralized manner, without the intervention of traditional financial intermediaries, including stablecoins, derivatives issued in the form of a crypto asset and certain non-fungible tokens,‚Äù the document said, with providers urged to consider case-by-case whether NFTs are used for payment or investment purposes.  The document says the commission was ‚Äúinspired‚Äù by work at the OECD, a club of developed countries that has developed norms for tax administrations to share crypto data, and follows EU measures designed to curb money laundering using crypto.  The EU tax bill is scheduled for approval at a Dec. 7 commission meeting.

After the second largest exchange in the world went belly up, other exchanges had to divide FTX‚Äôs market share among themselves. And that Binance is one of the biggest winners now seems to be confirmed by recent data. The Block claims that Binance now has a 75% market share on the spot market, 8.5 times more than the second Coinbase. üö®Binance now represents 75% of all exchange volume, and almost 8.5x that of the second (Coinbase) Good or bad for the ecosystem? pic.twitter.com/ykPisGn3W2 ‚Äî Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) November 30, 2022 Other Data Providers Do Not Agree The chart is based on CryptoCompare data and shows that total volume for the month was $642.7 billion. Binance‚Äôs share of the yet-to-be-completed month of November reportedly equates to $481.7 billion. However, there are discrepancies with other data providers. Their data doesn‚Äôt find a massive dominance by Binance. Coinmarketcap, which was acquired by Binance in April 2020, shows that the exchange currently has $12.5 billion in daily trading volume. It is followed by Coinbase Exchange with $1.5 billion dollars, Kraken with $626 million and KuCoin with $495 million. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Continues To Impress With 25% Rally In Last Seven Days With a total volume of $44.985 billion over the past 24 hours, this only calculates to a much healthier 27.8% market share for Binance. CoinGecko, on the other hand, tracks 544 crypto exchanges with a total 24-hour trading volume of $59.5 billion. Binance‚Äôs market share is actually only 21.7% based on this figure. However, both data providers only provide daily volumes and thus not a complete picture. Binance Is In The Crosshair Due To Other Reasons Regardless of the discussion about Binance‚Äôs market supremacy, the exchange is in the crosshair of critics due to other reasons. One of the harshest critics is Bitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair. As he notes, BNB has made 9x in two months during the bull run with barely a retrace, 10x versus BTC since 2021. ‚ÄúMust be a new paradigm,‚Äù LeClair wrote and shared the following chart. The analyst drew comparisons to FTX and commented ironically; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it was retail that sent BNB 10x in two months. Same with FTT, right?‚Äù, and shared a chart of FTT and BNB with a similar price trend. ‚ÄúIt definitely wasn‚Äôt the exchange operator with an incentive to drive up the price of their own token to create a feedback loop of attention, hype, and more users‚Ä¶. Definitely not,‚Äù LeClair further commented. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Exchanges Keeps Sliding, 1 Million BTC Pulled From These Platforms He argues that the outperformance against ‚Äúeverything‚Äù is significant, and one should wonder what the reason is. Who is supporting this market (we know), and do they have infinite money? Think of some alts that outperformed this bull run? SOL (Alameda leverage and fraud), AVAX (3AC), LUNA (perpetual motion machine), etc. To support his conjecture, LeClair also looked at the volume side profile for BNB/BTC spot market and BNB/USDT perpetual swaps (leverage) on Binance. He found a striking disparity. While Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said the exchange never uses leverage, users are encouraged to do so by means of various offers on Binance, according to the claim. Also, CZ reiterated after the FTX collapse that Binance has never used its BNB token as collateral and has never taken on debt. LeClair only commented, ‚ÄúCZ my man, I really hope you‚Äôre telling the truth.‚Äù Jack Dorsey And Others Also Express Criticism Remarkably, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey took a stand on the matter, commenting: ‚ÄúAll made up.‚Äù Dorsey is known as a Bitcoin proponent, but his statement is vague. His only other comment on the subject was a response to ‚ÄúBitcoin, not shitcoin‚Äù with ‚Äúyes,‚Äù leaving the community in the dark as to whether he supports LeClair‚Äôs theses. All made up ‚Äî jack (@jack) November 29, 2022 Renowned on-chain analyst Willy Woo also expressed cautious criticism of Binance, specifically on its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU): SAFU is misleading marketing. It was boosted to ‚Äú$1 billion,‚Äù but if you look at it closely and factor out the correlated impact of BNB and to a lesser extent BTC, the fund is really only good for 0.5% of the $68 billion in assets on Binance. This is not hate, it is informing the public.

42413541,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9npQ,1669808761,"Crypto Winter Hurt Confidence, but Building Digital-Asset Infrastructure Remains Key, Morgan Stanley Says","Investor interest in digital assets has changed in the past year as crypto prices declined, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Wednesday. Retail interest in prices levels and volatility has eased while demand for regulated products for traditional financial clients has increased, the bank said.  Following this month‚Äôs demise of crypto exchange FTX and its sister company Alameda Research, the ‚Äúmarket is reassessing the value of all the project tokens issued‚Äù and ‚Äúwhether they have been used as assets for leverage,‚Äù the note said.  Discussions at the bank‚Äôs second annual Cryptocurrency vs. Traditional Finance event on Monday showed more bankruptcies and deleveraging are expected.  While it is unclear how long that process may take, most participants were of the view that ‚Äúcrypto, blockchain and distributed-ledger technology are going to be developed further in the future and increasingly used to trade financial assets.‚Äù  The focus is still on building digital-asset infrastructure, though some investors are of the view that it could be a 10 to 15 year journey before digital assets become fully mainstream.  The bank notes that it is now a year since what‚Äôs become known as the crypto winter started.  Recent price action and characteristics suggest that the current cycle is similar to that seen in 2017-18. Both times, bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) price fell by more than 70% from its peak and experienced a similar drop around this point in the process following a period of low volatility.  Crypto market leverage, however, is greater in this cycle than it was in the last. That‚Äôs probably because crypto institutions such as market makers, companies and investors are the dominant traders in the market this time round, whereas in 2017-18, retail investors dominated.  Morgan Stanley expects deleveraging to continue, noting that stablecoin market capitalization, particularly for the largest stablecoin tether (USDT), has been falling in the last month. It noted that Alameda Research was the largest single recipient of tether.

The crypto exchange‚Äôs collapse has led to calls to toughen or bring forward the rules, which require crypto companies to register with authorities and meet governance standards that other kinds of financial firms must follow.  But the European Commission, which proposes EU legislation, said that the rules would have helped.  ‚ÄúUnder the MiCA regime, no company providing crypto assets in the EU would have been allowed to be organized, or perhaps I should say disorganized, in the way FTX reportedly was,‚Äù Alexandra Jour-Schroeder, deputy director general at the European Commission‚Äôs financial-services arm, told lawmakers at a hearing on Wednesday.  Failings at FTX such as inadequate record-keeping and the misuse of client assets were ‚Äúvery serious‚Äù and ‚Äúpotentially even fraud,‚Äù Jour-Schroeder told lawmakers on the European Parliament‚Äôs Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels, but added that she doesn't ""see them as failures of blockchain tech or even crypto assets per se.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWith MiCA we will take a step change forward compared to the status quo,‚Äù she said.  The law has been agreed upon in principle and is due to get a final vote from lawmakers in February. It is ‚Äúurgent,‚Äù but she said she didn‚Äôt expect a renegotiation to shorten the 12- to 18-month time frame before the rule goes into effect.  Earlier this month, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. following CoinDesk revelations of a blurring of lines with its supposedly separate trading arm, Alameda Research. Investors and customers must now depend on bankruptcy proceedings to get their money back.  About 10% of FTX's customers were in the EU, and one subsidiary, FTX Europe Ltd., was until early November supervised by the Cypriot financial regulator.  Lawmakers weren‚Äôt entirely convinced by Jour-Schroder‚Äôs assurances, seeing FTX as a symptom of wider issues.  ‚ÄúIn the world of crypto there are constant problems,‚Äù said left-wing French lawmaker Aurore Lalucq. ‚ÄúEvery day there is market manipulation and people who are embezzling.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like the Commission to wake up a bit,‚Äù Lalucq added. ‚ÄúCan we really hold our heads up high and say that Binance, for example, which is registered in Europe‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt possibly go bankrupt?‚Äù  Binance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.  Ernest Urtasun, a member of the European Parliament‚Äôs Green grouping, said he has ""serious doubts that MiCA would have prevented‚Äù the FTX scandal and called for short-term measures to address risks or block risky crypto products.  ‚ÄúWe need to have a means of acting very fast,‚Äù he said.  Officials from the European Securities and Markets Authority, or ESMA, appeared to agree that FTX isn‚Äôt a lone case of malpractice among crypto companies, but stressed that new EU laws were a start to address the issues raised by FTX.  ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt comment on individual cases, but generally speaking, the industry has many signs of weaknesses across all key functions,‚Äù said Steffen Kern, head of ESMA‚Äôs risk analysis and economics department, citing poor management and failures to segregate client funds. ‚ÄúMiCA, had it been in place, would have been extremely helpful.‚Äù  Stefan Berger, the center-right lawmaker who was an architect of MiCA, defended the rules and said the blame should lie instead with FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  ‚ÄúFTX was the Lehman Brothers for this community,‚Äù Berger said, but added that the responsibility lay with ‚Äúthe behavior and hubris of an individual, Sam Bankman-Fried,‚Äù rather than with blockchain technology.  ‚ÄúMiCA has to be passed as quickly as possible,‚Äù Berger said, and ‚Äúcome into force so that in Europe, we have rules which rule this type of situation out from the word go.‚Äù  Read more: EU Seals Text of Landmark Crypto Law MiCA, Fund Transfer Rules",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/30/eus-mica-crypto-law-would-have-stopped-ftx-malpractice-officials-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cc5bd465e27f7021489dd1938a5d21d2af0a764-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The $1.7 million was dispersed across 26 accounts on six off-shore crypto exchanges, all of which are now required to hand over documents under a new U.K. rule applying to foreign companies.  ‚ÄúThe case is a huge step forward for those who are trying to recover assets that have been taken fraudulently and moved across borders,"" said Syedur Rahman, a partner at law firm Rahman Ravelli that represented the U.K.-based exchange.  ‚ÄúThis ruling is concrete proof of the value of the change to Practice Direction 6B and the possibilities that it offers to anyone facing the task of tracing and recovering what is theirs.""

42413544,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9nsE,1669804426,Singapore's Financial Regulator Defends Itself After FTX Blowup,"‚ÄúFTX is not the first cryptocurrency platform to collapse, nor will it be the last,‚Äù said Singapore‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong while answering lawmakers' questions about the crypto giant‚Äôs rapid failure in early November.  The country's Parliament put financial regulators and the Ministry of Finance in the hot seat on Wednesday with a series of questions about crypto regulation and the potential impact of FTX‚Äôs demise on the broader economy.  Since the collapse, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which was one of the first in the world to set up a rigorous regulatory regime for crypto companies, has had to answer tough questions about its treatment of crypto entities ‚Äì particularly why the regulator had placed FTX‚Äôs rival Binance on an investor alert list (IAL) but had allowed state fund Temasek to invest in the former.  Wong, who is also deputy chairman of the country‚Äôs central bank, reiterated that the IAL targets crypto companies that solicit Singapore customers without a requisite license.  ‚ÄúThis does not mean that all entities which are not listed on the IAL are safe to deal with. MAS cannot possibly provide an exhaustive list of all the unsafe or unlicensed entities that exist in the world,‚Äù Wong said, answering questions on behalf of the MAS.  Singapore made up 6% of FTX‚Äôs global customer distribution, according to a chart shown during FTX‚Äôs bankruptcy hearing. Wong said on Wednesday that the MAS does not have data on the ‚Äúnumber of retail users of FTX.‚Äù  Read more: There Was No Cause to Add FTX to Investor Alert List Before Collapse, Singapore's MAS Says  Wong also addressed the investment of Singapore‚Äôs state-owned investment fund Temasek into FTX, saying that it had caused not just financial loss but also reputational damage. Days after Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs crypto enterprise filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., Temasek announced it had written off its entire FTX investment of $275 million, which it said was made after conducting eight months of due diligence. Wong said that Temasek had initiated an internal review by an independent team to study and improve its processes, and to draw lessons for the future.  He pushed back on calls for more guidelines and safeguards over Temasek investments, saying that there was ‚Äúno need for additional audit requirements or Parliamentary Committees,‚Äù and that the boards should be insulated from political pressure.  Wong also defended the standards already in place.  ‚ÄúThe occurrence of investment losses does not in itself imply that the governance system is not working. Rather, this is the nature of investment and risk-taking,‚Äù Wong said.  He added that Singapore‚Äôs investment entities must take lessons from success and failure and ‚Äúcontinue to take well-judged risks in order to achieve good overall returns in the long term.‚Äù  Wong assured that spillovers from the FTX collapse will be ‚Äúvery limited‚Äù for Singapore‚Äôs broader financial system and economy. MAS‚Äô surveillance shows that key financial institutions in Singapore have insignificant exposures to cryptocurrency and crypto players.  ‚ÄúThe collapse of FTX and other major cryptocurrency platforms should bring about much-needed rationalization in the cryptocurrency space. The repercussions on the cryptocurrency ecosystem globally are still unfolding, and we are watching this,‚Äù Wong said.  The MAS plans to introduce basic investor protection measures, he added. The proposals laid out in a consultation paper published Oct 26, include having service providers administer risk awareness tests, segregate customers‚Äô assets from their own assets and refrain from operating a trading platform while taking proprietary positions for their own accounts.

At the time of this writing, the 13th largest cryptocurrency with an overall valuation of $5.51 billion, is trading at $76.80 and has gone up by 6% over the past 24 hours according to tracking from Coingecko. The asset‚Äôs seven-day performance is beyond ‚Äújust good‚Äù as it registered an increase of 25.1%. Meanwhile, on a month-to-date (MTD) basis, the altcoin is up by 36%. What make Litecoin‚Äôs current run impressive is that it is happening during the same time when industry frontrunners Bitcoin and Ethereum are struggling to gain any ground to push their respective prices to higher levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rises: Over 60% Of Holders Continue To Profit Despite FTX Nightmare Litecoin: ‚ÄòProfitable Opportunity‚Äô For Investors, Holders As it turns out, LTC is not only doing wonders in terms of its trading session performances as it is currently in a ‚Äúrewarding phase.‚Äù During the last few days, the asset‚Äôs Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) has also reached the point where if holders of Litecoin were to sell their holdings at this very moment, they‚Äôll end up making good profit. One possible reason for the resurgence of the digital coin might be its mining activity. According to the information shared by the project through its official Twitter account, the asset was among the few proof-of-work digital currencies that were ‚Äòprofitable‚Äô during the last few months. Despite reaching a mining difficulty score of 20.00 M, the profitability of Litecoin miners stood at $60%. In terms of hash rate, Litecoin witnessed a 13.25% increase compared to last month, indicating that the digital coin‚Äôs network is both healthy and growing. Pay Attention To These Factors Before Holding Litecoin As remarkable as LTC is right now, it is important to note that its current price is almost 13% lower than where it was in November 23 when it tested the $83.36 resistance zone. This was the result of the altcoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator settling at 41.80, putting it in an overbought position as sellers clearly had the advantage. Another bearish sign for Litecoin is the rate at which it was being transferred from one address to another as it recorded a significant decline compared to that of last week. The network development activity also has not much to offer as of this time, indicating that developers have nothing new to offer right now. Finally, according to Coincodex‚Äôs forecast, over the next five days, LTC is expected to rise by more than 12% on its way to hitting the $86 marker. A month from now, however, the cryptocurrency is predicted to lose some of its gains but will still change hands at $77.16 ‚Äì a value that is higher than its current spot trading price.

Crypto exchanges can be divided into two categories - centralized and decentralized. Exchanges potentially lack transparency. There are now hundreds of exchanges that trade 24/7 globally, and not all operate at the same standard; i.e., technology, governance, etc. By Sharon Liebowitz By now, the news in early November about the collapse of FTX ( FTT-USD ), one of the largest global cryptocurrency exchanges, is sinking in. At S&P Dow Jones Indices, we often discuss the challenges of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and its risks across multiple dimensions. These include asset-level risks, technology risks, market risks and regulatory risks, as well as unknown and sizeable systemic risks. As the fate of SBF (Sam Bankman-Fried) and his FTX exchange get sorted out by the judicial system and the court of public opinion, one thing most can agree on is that they never saw this coming. This opaque area within the crypto ecosystem could use some clarification. While the technology surrounding digital assets creates transparency - with its decentralized, secure and immutable ledgers - the surrounding ecosystem is not always transparent. Exchanges potentially lack transparency. There are now hundreds of exchanges that trade 24/7 globally, and not all operate at the same standard; i.e., technology, governance, etc. As the FTX collapse unfolded, S&P Dow Jones Indices‚Äô cryptocurrency price provider Lukka quickly removed both FTX.com and FTX.US from its list of eligible exchanges. Crypto exchanges can be divided into two categories - centralized and decentralized. FTX, Binance ( BNB-USD ) and Coinbase ( COIN ) are all examples of centralized exchanges (part of centralized finance, or CeFi). Centralized exchanges (CEXes) are typically controlled by a single entity and operate using a central order book - the trades go through an intermediary; that is, the exchange. Decentralized exchanges (DEXes), such as UniSwap ( UNI-USD ) or Aave ( AAVE-USD ), by contrast, have no intermediary - instead, they use smart contracts (pieces of software code) and an automated market maker (AMM) to execute transactions. Often, a DEX is set up as a decentralized autonomous organization ((DAO)), and decisions are made using governance tokens. This brings us to the tokens associated with various exchanges. FTX created FTT 1 , a token that provided its holder a discount on FTX trading fees. FTT also could be staked (locked up) for additional rewards, such as lower fees and higher rebates, or used as collateral for derivatives or margin positions on FTX. Similarly, Binance exchange created BNB, 2 a token that allowed discounts, payments and more on the BNB Chain ecosystem. (Coinbase is a publicly traded company that offers USD Coin ( USDC-USD ), a stablecoin.) By contrast, UNI 3 and AAVE 4 tokens govern their respective DEXes via on-chain governance. These token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades that allow it to be community-led and minimize the need for trust. All the above represent different types of exchanges and tokens, as well as different risks and values. However, they provide little transparency. And that brings us to the role of indices. Indices bring transparency by measuring the performance of a market. Indices also provide multiple perspectives to track and potentially access a market. The S&P Cryptocurrency Indices are no different. These indices reflect diversification, a methodology that screens index constituents on various levels, as well as an independent Index Committee which has discretion over index decisions involving regulatory, structural or legal issues. FTT, BNB, UNI and AAVE are all constituents of the 50-coin S&P Cryptocurrency LargeCap Index , 5 though only BNB is greater than 1% of its makeup as of publication date. The FTX incident shines a light not only on the benefits of diversification, but also on the relative transparency of decentralized finance. _________ 1 FTX Token (FTT) FAQ 2 BNB - What is BNB and What Is It Used For? 3 Governance | Uniswap Protocol 4 Aave - Open Source Liquidity Protocol 5 S&P Dow Jones Indices, as of Nov. 18, 2022.

42413552,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9nym,1669798677,Perpetuals-Focused Decentralized Exchange GMX Surpasses Uniswap in Daily Fees Earned,"Decentralized exchange GMX has evolved as a serious competitor to established industry players such as Uniswap in the wake of FTX's collapse.  On Monday, GMX earned $1.15 million in trading fees, surpassing Uniswap's $1.06 million for the first time on record, according to data tracked by Delphi Digital.  The decentralized exchange, which allows users to trade perpetuals or futures with no expiry without an intermediary using smart contracts, is perhaps benefitting from a broader shift toward perpetual-focused decentralized platforms triggered by the recent fall of centralized giant FTX.  GMX went live on Ethereum layer 2 system Arbitrum in September 2021 and debuted on Ethereum-competitor Avalanche early this year. The platform offers relatively low transaction fees and zero price impact or the influence of a single trade over the market price.  Crypto perpetuals trading was first launched by centralized exchange BitMEX in 2016 and later dominated by its rivals Binance and the now-insolvent FTX.  Sam Bankman Fried's exchange FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, denting investor confidence in centralized exchanges.  GMX has pocketed $15.7 million in trading fees in four weeks, becoming the fifth-largest decentralized application, ahead of prominent players lincluding dYdX and AAVE, according to data source Token Terminal.  GMX's hosts, Arbitrum and Avalanche, have earned $985,600 and $540,500 in trading fees in 30 days. Uniswap has collected $54 million in trading fees, retaining the industry leadership.  Yet, Uniswap's UNI token has declined by 16% this month, while GMX has gained by 4%.  GMX's outperformance probably stems from the fact that the GMX token holders receive 30% of all the trading fees, while the UNI token holders do not receive a share in trading fees.  GMX has distributed $4.7 million to the token holders in the past 30 days, the fourth-largest payout among all decentralized applications.",POSITIVE,UNI,EXCHANGE | TRADING | UNI | ARB | MX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/30/perpetual-focused-decentralized-exchange-gmx-surpasses-uniswap-in-daily-fees-earned,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f15514697d08b8f753a3517f430631e160efef8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It seemed like a recurring theme for the digital asset which, in the middle part of the month, shed 53% of its August 20 value. This is not surprising considering many altcoins were not spared from the lingering effects of the crypto winter that was compounded by the sudden collapse of FTX. Although it still has ways to go, NEAR seems to be slowly getting back on track, tallying an increase of almost 8% over the last 24 hours to trade at $1.60 according to tracking from Coingecko. Given the current market conditions, the high discount that the digital asset offers right now (its price has gone down by 55% from its monthly high) is very enticing for investors looking for viable entry point.

The news might have been enough to trigger an upward movement in NEAR price but it failed to push network development activity numbers up, still within the lowest monthly levels ever recorded. This is not a good sign for the crypto asset and the blockchain as low development activity usually leads to low investor confidence. What To Expect From NEAR In The Next Few Days According to the forecast of Coincodex, the NEAR token will slightly increase its current spot trading price as it is predicted to hit $1.62 on December 5. Meanwhile, on December 31, right before the year ends, the crypto asset will trade at a significantly lower value of $1.05. One important thing to consider right now is that NEAR is within the range of its historic low which indicates that there might be a possibility for a bounce back in the coming days. However, as some of its metrics point towards a bearish momentum, investors are strongly advised to keep an eye on the asset‚Äôs blockchain development as it could prove to be an integral factor for a bull run to happen.

4953701,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510510,1669785962,Solana Asset Volatility Balloons To 260% As ROI Nosedives ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why,"The Solana ecosphere, unsurprisingly, is also suffering as a result of the current market contagion. SOL fell to its lowest performance in recent weeks. CoinGecko reports that its native token SOL has dropped in value by 58.3 percent over the course of a month. Here‚Äôs a quick glance at how the token has been performing: SOL experiencing high volatility and low return on investment An ascending triangle with a hint of a bearish break is noted SOL NFT will be released in the third quarter. As a result, the risk and volatility of SOL are not showing signs of any improvement just yet and has in fact grown to 259 percent combined. Right now, according to Messari, SOL has a volatility of 2.08, which is its all-time high in that category, and a Sharpe‚Äôs ratio of -3.67. When the value of the latter is negative, it indicates that the return on investment (ROI) from purchasing and holding SOL is so low that doing so could result in a loss. Despite this, the coin‚Äôs value has been rising on a daily and weekly basis. Even though market sentiment is very negative, SOL‚Äôs market cap domination is increasing. Is SOL showing signs of improvement? Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Clings To $5 Level Despite Unforgiving Bear Market Solana Glow Fading? SOL is currently in a weak position. Previous price moves lead to the construction of a rising triangle, which is a bearish pattern. With a Pearson‚Äôs R value of 0.7235 for the regression channel, greater suffering may be anticipated. At $13.97, which is the middle band of the Bollinger band, the coin was rejected. The Bollinger band appears to be approaching its breaking point. This would inevitably drive the price down below SOL‚Äôs current support level of $13.10. With a bearish crossover, RSI values also confirm the upcoming decline. In addition to confirming the present price trend, the money flow index gives the bears further strength. The EMA ribbon is also bearish as it prevents further upward movement. With SOL‚Äôs volatility and Sharpe‚Äôs ratio at all-time highs, a move below $13.10 and a possible short-term break of the 78.60 Fib level is possible. Bearish But Yet Acceptable Despite extremely negative market conditions, SOL‚Äôs NFT market domination and market capitalization have increased. As of this writing, SOL‚Äôs market cap has decreased from yesterday‚Äôs 0.62 percent to today‚Äôs 0.61 percent, but this is still a positive sign for the future. Despite this, investors and traders should be cautious with SOL and monitor the market condition.

42413551,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9o0e,1669777156,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Rises Toward $17K Despite Investor Unease,"Good morning. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptocurrencies swung upward despite ongoing concerns about FTX fallout and macroeconomic uncertainties.  Insights: Grayscale's other digital asset trusts don't have as much institutional interest as GBTC, which trades a serious discount but is still being scooped up by Cathie Wood's ARK.  Prices  Bitcoin Climbs Toward $17K, Despite Investor Unease  By James Rubin  Bitcoin continued its surge from Monday, despite ongoing investor unease over the FTX fallout, central bank monetary hawkishness and the potential impact of mass protests in China over the country's harsh COVID-19 restrictions.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading over $16,979, up nearly 4.5% during the previous 24 hours and its highest point in about two weeks. BTC has shown remarkable resilience, holding largely above $16,000 in the nearly month since crypto exchange FTX started to implode after a CoinDesk story about irregularities on its balance sheet.  ""People are nervous now,"" John Peurifoy, co-founder and CEO of crypto brokerage firm Floating Point Group, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""They're nervous about where the contagion goes, what counterparties they're working with. Can they put money in different places? Are they going to lose it? So people are cautious.""  Ether fared even better, recently climbing more than 7.5% to $1,272, its highest level since the second week of November. Other major cryptos assumed various hues of green, with UNI, the token of the smart contracts-based Uniswap platform, and SUSHI, the token of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap, each recently rising over 7%. The popular meme coin DOGE continued its momentum, rising 6% to trade at over 10 U.S. cents. DOGE has jumped roughly 50% over the past week.  U.S. equity indexes closed mixed amid rising macroeconomic uncertainties, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 down 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading flat. On Tuesday the Chinese government ratcheted up its efforts to quell the COVID-related demonstrations, sending police to protest hubs and increasing online censorship.  And markets will be listening nervously on Wednesday to remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, part of the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Fed officials have recently suggested an openness to more dovish interest rate hikes, even while reiterating their commitment to lowering inflation through monetary tightening.  Markets will also be eyeing U.S. congressional efforts to head off a railroad strike that could send prices of goods upward, reversing recent progress. The Consumer Price Index dipped to 7.7% in October, lower than the consensus projection and down from 8.2% the previous month.  Floating Point Group's Peurifoy was circumspect about predicting how low bitcoin's price would reach in the current bearish environment. ""How many more pieces will fall?"" he asked. ""How many people will have to sell crypto to get liquidity? People are holding back selling if they don't need to, but at the same time some people are having to because of economic situations.""  ""We're at this pause period. I call it the doldrums,"" he also said.

Insights  Grayscale's digital asset trusts, such as GBTC and ETHE, are trading at a serious discount  By Sam Reynolds  Grayscale is best known for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), but it also operates a whole suite of digital asset-based trusts.  Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.  When discussing GBTC, the words ""discount"" and ""record"" often come in the same sentence.  GBTC trades at a significant discount because there‚Äôs no redemption function for the trust. Meanwhile, bitcoin exchange-traded funds listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange is where the liquidity is going. The ""Hotel California"" nature of GBTC was supposed to be solved by converting the trust into a bitcoin ETF, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has continued to block it. This has led Grayscale to file a lawsuit.  So far this year, the GBTC discount has blown past its previous records given the broader FTX market contagion, and is now trading at a negative 40%.  And GBTC is just one of the trusts offered by Grayscale.  Many other digital asset trusts that have significant assets under management (AUM) face the same predicament as GBTC.  Data compiled from YCharts shows that Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust is trading at a 43.7% discount, while its ZCash Trust trades at just under a 49% discount.  Its Ethereum Classic Trust, meanwhile, trades at a whopping 70% discount.  Of course, all these have the same problem: The shares can be traded on the open market after a long lockup period, but not redeemed for the underlying asset. Grayscale is one of the largest holders of GBTC, simply because DCG has allocated so much cash for buybacks.  ‚ÄúThe Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program,‚Äù reads a 10Q filing for the ZCash Trust. Similar language is found in a 10Q filing for the Ethereum Trust.  One other problem is these other trusts simply don‚Äôt have the institutional interest that GBTC has. According to data compiled by 13F.info, which tracks 13F filings by fund managers, GBTC is held by 61 fund managers, while ETHE is held by 37.  Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK has still been buying GBTC, but its holdings of GBTC were down by 26% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter in 2021, according to 13F data ARK's much smaller holdings of ETHE are down by 15% during the same time period. There certainly are others making buys, but the scale just isn‚Äôt there.  Grayscale‚Äôs other trusts are too small to be listed in 13F filings. The Litecoin Trust has a significant premium, but there hasn‚Äôt yet been institutional interest in the product.  It‚Äôs tough to see how this can all turn around, considering the bear market and the SEC‚Äôs reluctance to offer a redemption scheme.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Brazil's Chamber of Deputies approved a bill on Tuesday regulating the crypto industry.  The bill, which was approved by the Senate in April and had been stuck in the Chamber of Deputies, now requires the approval of the executive branch to become law.  The bill, authored by deputy Aureo Ribeiro, establishes a new crime of fraud involving virtual assets, with a penalty of between two and six years in jail plus a fine. It also stipulates the creation of a ‚Äúvirtual service provider‚Äù license, which is to be requested by companies, including exchanges and other crypto firms.  According to the text, companies will have 180 days to adapt to the new rules before the law will be enforced.  The text stipulates that crypto assets considered securities will be regulated by the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM), while other digital assets not falling into that category will fall under the responsibility of another body to be appointed by the executive branch. The Central Bank is expected to be chosen.  This article was translated by Andr√©s Engler and edited by CoinDesk. The original Portuguese article can be found here.

There's a problem with the company's business model: it doesn't work in the current environment. Avoid the stock given valuation is closely tied to crypto, which in my opinion is based on nothing but thin air. BlockFi: another one caught swimming naked 2022 is a brutal year where many crypto bulls have been caught swimming naked. Luna (LUNC-USD) is done. 3AC is done. Celsius (CEL-USD) is done. Voyager (VYGVQ-USD) is done. Following the latest FTX (FTT-USD) scandal by crypto wonderkid Sam Bankman-Fried, BlockFi just filed for Chapter 11 as traders removed $6 billion from the platform within 3 days and Binance (BNB-USD) did not come to rescue. According to the bankruptcy filing, BlockFi's substantial exposure to FTX and Alameda Research was the culprit where Alameda defaulted on ~$680 million of collateralized loan obligations to BlockFi. Despite pausing user withdrawals, BlockFi was not able to overcome the liquidity crisis and had to sell its crypto holdings to raise $238.6 million in cash to fund the bankruptcy process. BlockFi owes almost $1.2 billion to its top 10 creditors, including Ankura Trust ($729 million), FTX US ($275 million), and the SEC ($30 million). Valar Ventures, a US VC fund co-founded by Peter Thiel, owns 19% of BlockFi. BlockFi was founded in 2017 and saw phenomenal growth where LTM trading volume grew from just $2 million in 2019 to >$23 billion in March 2022. During the same period, the platform's deployable assets increased from $345 million to almost $15 billion, while gross loan originations jumped from $687 million to >$47 billion. Due to evaporating confidence in the crypto market, however, Block's lendable assets fell to Is Coinbase a safe haven? Let's start this section from a user perspective. You've successfully avoided Celsius, Voyager, Gemini, FTX and BlockFi by putting all your Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD), and Tether (USDT-USD) in Coinbase (COIN). Does that guarantee the safety of your assets in the event that Coinbase files for bankruptcy? Not if you quickly skim through the company's most recent 10-Q where management disclosed the following: ""Because custodially held crypto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate, in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors."" As of 3Q22, Coinbase had a total of $101.7 billion in custodial fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies on behalf of customers. While Coinbase is clearly not FTX or BlockFi given its commitment to keep customer assets 1:1 (does not lend out client assets) and $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, the broadening fallout in the entire crypto ecosystem has made investors seriously nervous about the safety of their holdings whichever platform they're on. Following the recent FTX disaster, Coinbase's trading volume spiked , but this was likely a result of users selling their cryptos entirely to avoid any further losses. Does Coinbase have a viable business model? Coinbase is a crypto exchange that makes money from transaction fees. In 2021, retail transactions represented over 80% of revenue, while institutional accounted for just over 4%. In the first 9 months of 2022, Coinbase's total revenue fell 52% YoY to $2.6 billion as retail transaction revenue dropped 55% to $1.9 billion, accounting for 75% of total revenue. Evidently, this is a highly volatile business that depends heavily on retail transactions, which in turn are heavily influenced by the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two most traded cryptocurrencies on Coinbase. While Coinbase merely takes a cut of every transaction on the platform and should in theory benefit from increased volatility in the crypto market, this is completely not the case as seen in traditional exchanges such as CME ( CME ) and NYSE ( ICE ). With trading volume and revenue halved in 1Q-3Q22, Coinbase reported an operating loss in excess of $2 billion, operating cash flows of negative $4.8 billion, and diluted EPS of -$9.39 vs. $11.9 in 1Q-3Q21. Of course, there's always the good old stock-based compensation expense which came in at $1.1 billion. Coinbase recorded total OPEX of $4.7 billion in the first 9 months of 2022, while total crypto market capitalization fell from $2.25 trillion to $900 billion. As of writing, the entire crypto market is now valued at $788 billion. With a market share of ~7% and ~$1.6 billion in quarterly expenses, Coinbase will need a significantly higher take rate (1.3% for retail and only 0.01% for institutional in 3Q22) and transaction volume to make the math work. All told, the simple answer is that Coinbase is an expensive operation offering a commodity-like product in a shrinking market. While the business model could work in an easy monetary environment with free money, it is very unlikely to work in today's environment. Should Bitcoin and Ethereum prices remain challenged, Coinbase is likely to do shareholders more harm than good. After the FTX collapse, there's also the concern that regulations in the crypto space will only become more restrictive/expensive going forward. What's the intrinsic value of Coinbase? The performance of Coinbase is very closely tied to the performance of crypto prices (most notably Bitcoin and Ethereum), therefore the intrinsic value of Coinbase's stock is only as good as where crypto will be in the future. Given there's really no scientific way of estimating the values of most cryptocurrencies (no revenues, earnings, dividends, interests, rental income, etc.), I believe prices are essentially supported by the greater fool theory. I therefore do not believe Coinbase can be valued by any convention metric such as P/S or EV/EBITDA. In other words, owning shares of Coinbase is equivalent to owning either Bitcoin or Ethereum. What to do with the stock? Coinbase is a sell on any rally given the crypto rout is nowhere near the end in my view. That said, it would be equally dangerous to short the stock just because prices can always rally for non-fundamental reasons (e.g. better-than-expected inflation). Perhaps the stock will work when the Fed pivots, but it's important to understand that interest rates will remain high as long as inflation does not fall back to the 2% policy target. Until there's a clear path that rates will again fall back to 0% and animal spirits are to return, avoid Coinbase at all costs.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4561246-coinbase-in-trouble-after-ftx-blockfi-fiasco?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4945622.jpeg

""We made this announcement [plans to trademark Web5] because we were concerned that those who are intentionally obfuscating the term to sell products and services that we consider unrelated and contrary to the mission of Web5, were using the term in ways that we believe exploit the public,"" TBD tweeted.  ""While our concerns here have not abated, we have heard loud voices in the community who are concerned about the potential for abuse of trademark law in ways that would undermine the mission of decentralization,"" the tweet added.  The move comes just hours after the company tweeted that it ""decided to seek protection"" for the term Web5 as there were products and services that were misusing the name. ""We therefore decided to seek protection for 'Web5,' which will allow us to prevent confusion about the meaning of 'Web5' and ensure that the term is used as intended ‚Äì to refer to a truly open, decentralized layer for the new internet,"" a previous tweet announcing the decision to seek a trademark had said.  Web5 was announced this year during CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus Festival in Austin, Texas, where TBD explained that ""Web5 brings decentralized identity and data storage to individuals‚Äô applications."" It will let developers focus on ""creating delightful user experiences, while returning ownership of data and identity to individuals.""  TBD envisioned Web5, a word that combines Web2 and Web3, to be ""a public tool for good"" that will be open to everyone and will build the next iteration of the internet. However, trademarking the term, which deters others from using it, could be seen as opposite of an idea of a true decentralized internet.  In the previous announcement, TBD said that ""it's not our intention to prevent others from using Web5, but we want to establish an initial way to defend its principles,"" and added that it was working on ways to enable commercial and noncommercial uses of Web5, ""as long as participants respect the meaning of the term and uphold its main attributes.""  However, after the community backlash the company decided to suspend the plan until further notice. ""Our goal is to catalyze the community and have Web5 exist as its own thing, separate from TBD and Block.
