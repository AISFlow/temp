42427196,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Grh,1481148916,What the Blockchain Industry is Saying About Circle's Bitcoin Shift,"You could say there was a certain feeling that went beyond the news.  On the surface, Circle's decision to stop offering bitcoin buying and selling services might have precedent. The company had long talked about its drive toward social payments, and its belief in the bitcoin protocol as a foundational layer for finance, not a currency for consumers.  It may not even be that impactful. Circle will continue trading (buying and selling) bitcoin on behalf of its customers to move money, and it will continue using the protocol as the base for a new hybrid blockchian platform called Spark.  Yet, it seemed, in the hours after the news, there was little consensus about Circle's decision and what it meant – it was either a complete surprise or an expected pivot, depending on who you ask.  Reactions to the news was, as can be expected, mixed, and frustration among some of the startup's customers – particularly those who were using it as a portal to buy and sell bitcoin in the UK – surfaced on social media as well.  One of those who wasn't surprised by the decision was Joe Colangelo, president of the consumer advocacy group Consumers' Research. He argued that Circle has signaled such a move ""for some time now"".  He credited the shift to low revenues, arguing Circle could wind up reactivating the service under more favorable conditions in the future.  Colangelo told CoinDesk:  ""If demand for bitcoin as an asset picks up I expect they'll maintain an option to get back into the business of buying and selling bitcoin, the reality is that it's probably not just profitable enough for them given the additional costs that come from complying with regulations and dealing with fraud.""  In comments to CoinDesk, Circle differed slightly, with representatives stating that too much of the business's resources were going to supporting bitcoin buying and selling, something they increasingly saw as different from their core mission.  Unocoin co-founder and president Sunny Ray also expressed a lack of surprise, though he sounded a more critical note, calling it ""short sighted"" not to ""embrace"" bitcoin as a digital alternative asset more akin to gold.  ""They always said that they’re more interested in the transactional element of bitcoin and blockchain,"" he said of the firm's move.  Why now?  Others didn’t see this news coming.  Among the industry segment surprised by the pivot was Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead for ARK Investment Management. Saying he was ""puzzled"" by the decision, Burniske speculated that a number of factors may have come into play here.  He told CoinDesk:  “I have to imagine the ability to buy and sell bitcoin using Circle was either a drag on its bottom line, that it was concerned by the IRS request of Coinbase, or that it was under pressure from some of its more conservative investors to shift focus away from Bitcoin.”  The view proved popular with respondents, though Circle did not indicate the move was connected to the US government's actions to increase digital currency tax collection.  Burniske went on to frame the pivot as part of a broader shift among bitcoin startups that have turned their attention to applications beyond the digital currency in a reflection of both sentiment in the finance industry as well as among prospective investors.  Further, like Colangelo, Burniske suggested that Circle might not leave its exchange service in the background forever.  ""That said, these decisions are not set in stone, and it wouldn't surprise me if Circle someday allows users to buy and sell bitcoin on its platform once again,"" he remarked.  Coinbase boon  Among the seeming winners in the pivot is Coinbase, which, as Circle outlined in a blog post explaining the move, will become the startup’s “preferred exchange”, directing customers to it if they want to buy or sell bitcoin.  Tim Draper, who is an investor in Coinbase through the DFJ Venture Fund, argued in an email that the shift followed a loss in market share by Circle in favor of Coinbase.  ""Circle lost market share to Coinbase, so they decided to change direction,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Coinbase is the big winner here.""  Fred Wilson, another Coinbase investor through Union Square Ventures, said that while he doesn’t understand the motivation behind Circle’s move, it undoubtedly puts Coinbase in a strategic position within the digital currency exchange and wallet space.  ""While I can't really comment on why Circle made this decision, it leaves Coinbase as the dominant player in a rapidly growing new market and that feels really good to me,"" Wilson said.  Although, not everyone saw this as positive. As R3 researcher Tim Swanson pointed out on Twitter, the wallet and exchange part of the ecosystem is increasingly a less crowded part of the industry.  For it's part, Coinbase was tight-lipped about the move, with co-founder Fred Ehrsam stating simply:  ""Trying different approaches at this stage of the ecosystem is good for everyone.""  Strategy praise  Surprise aside, some industry observers told CoinDesk that, overall, the move is a smart one on Circle's part.  Among those who praised the move was author William Mougayar, who told CoinDesk that it puts Circle in a position to nab a bigger share of the global remittance market.  ""They are basically re-incarnating Venmo but with a global reach, and a friendly user interface,"" he said. ""This space desperately needs user-friendly experiences, and front-ending a money transfer app with a familiar UI is good news for consumer adoption.""  Needham & Co researcher Spencer Bogart emphasized that Circle isn’t completely leaving bitcoin behind, positing that the startup is looking to trim services that are likely revenue-negative to operate – pointing to other companies in the space that have pivoted in search of more revenue.  He also added that the move doesn't reflect poorly on the digital currency itself.  ""This doesn’t mean that bitcoin isn’t working and growing (it very much is), it just means that it's very difficult to build a profitable, mainstream, regulatory-compliant business based on Bitcoin today,"" he said, going on to conclude:  ""At the end of the day, honey badger don’t care.""

42427206,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Gvh,1481139958,Chain Reveals 'Ivy' Smart Contract Language in First Public Demo,"The 'Wild West' of smart contracts is about to get a little wilder.  Following the first-ever public demo of enterprise blockchain company Chain's in-house smart contracts language this week, the venture-backed startup is now preparing to release the technology to the public.  However, in an exclusive demo of the technology with CoinDesk, the person in charge of developing the language gave a sneak peek at the company's latest creation, explaining, too, what he envisions as its ideal application.  Product architect Dan Robinson told CoinDesk:  ""Ivy is particularly useful and well-suited for smart contract use cases that involve controlling property in a particular way. It’s a concept we call secured property or smart property.""  Ivy is currently in its R&D phase and is being implemented primarily for internal applications, though he said the expectation is it will eventually be opened to other developers.  Compiled to the Chain Virtual Machine (its stack machine that translates the code and performs operations), Ivy is described on its website as a declarative language in that its control-flow isn't specified, compared to ethereum's Solidity language (which is object oriented with higher organization).  Pulling from the prototypical smart contract example first used by developer Nick Szabo, Robinson said early smart contracts the company developed using the language are functionally similar to a vending machine.  Specifically, he gave the example of a smart contract that would run on a ""relatively decentralized exchange"" where users can make offers and bids on a multi-asset network. Users could either purchase an underlying asset or a seller could revoke the offer in this paradigm.  Robinson compared it to a vending machine in which a user can unlock a secured asset (such as a bottle of water) in exchange for a few tokens, but only the owner would have direct access to the product prior to its sale and the key to withdraw the received funds:  He said:  ""The owner of the vending machine can also go in with his special private key, his physical key, open the vending machine and withdraw the money that’s been paid into it and also the [water bottle] that was protected by it.""  Speaking smart contract  While the earliest examples of smart contracts written with the language are bound to be rather simplistic, the release comes into a competitive ecosystem.  Ivy is just the latest in a growing blockchain ecosystem that has seen no shortage of competing in smart contract languages.  For example, in June, blockchain consortium R3 hosted a smart contracts summit to review a wide range of template being experimented with by the likes of Barclays and others.  Then, in August, distributed ledger startup Digital Asset open-sourced its own DAML coding language, which it described as similar to a smart contract language, but designed specifically for the financial industry.  Going into the new year, a series of challenges (including ensuring contract counterparty confidentiality and contract accuracy) are among the top priorities by a number of parties.  However, Robinson described Chain's language as unique, given that it is designed for a future when digital assets (not just distributed ledgers) will be widely used by financial firms.  He concluded:  ""A large part of our focus at Chain is financial use cases. Generally, we think that blockchains are most useful when you have some kind of digital asset that is being transferred and issued on a network.""

42427184,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0GVh,1481120890,"Bitcoin Price Could Triple in 2017, Saxo Bank Says in 'Outrageous' Prediction","Saxo Bank wouldn't be surprised if the bitcoin price saw big gains next year.  The Danish investment bank recently published its annual ""Outrageous Predictions for 2017"", a collection of speculations that it stressed represents more of a fringe outlook than anything official. At the same time, the bank said that these ""outlier"" predictions represent its attempt to get those in the financial industry to think about more extreme possibilities for the year ahead.  In addition to off-the-cuff calls that the UK won't actually leave the European Union and that Italian equity prices will soar on the back of an EU-led bailout, Saxo Bank said that, under the right conditions, the price of bitcoin could skyrocket to more than $2,100.  Chief among its reasons was the potential for the incoming Trump administration to cause turbulence in the US economy (a reason given by bitcoin traders for recent price momentum).  Saxo Bank explained:  ""If the banking system as well as sovereigns such as Russia and China move to accept bitcoin as a partial alternative to the USD and the traditional banking and payment system, then we could see bitcoin easily triple over the next year going from the current $700 level to +$2,100 as the block-chains decentralised system, an inability to dilute the finite supply of bitcoins as well as low to no transaction costs gains more traction and acceptance globally.""  Though the prediction doesn’t represent an official position, it's not the first bullish indication the bank has made.  In 2014, then-current CEO Lars Seier Christensen discussed his ""personal"" interest in bitcoin with CoinDesk, describing it as an opportunity for investors.  At the time, he had also hinted at early testing of the tech within the bank as well, though later Christensen would go on to argue that liquidity problems at the time were keeping banks on the sidelines.

42427180,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0GPh,1481119172,Is Your Blockchain Token a Security? Coinbase Leads Legal Framework Launch,"Though a black-and-white issues for many enthusiasts, from a legal perspective, innovation with cryptocurrencies and blockchains remains in the regulatory gray.  That the technology – and its innovators – still face a risk when seeking to launch solutions in the market is front and center in a new legal framework released today.  Led by blockchain startup Coinbase, in collaboration with Coin Center, Consensys and Union Square Ventures, the 27-page framework, goes so far as to provide users with a ""decision matrix"" that those involved say can help mitigate design flaws that could have real-world legal consequences.  Reuben Bramanathan, associate counsel at Coinbase, said that while the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (and its counterparts globally) have been largely silent on the issue, there are likely to be roadblocks ahead given the lack of public education on concepts such as distributed applications and autonomous organizations.  Bramanathan told CoinDesk:  ""This is most useful for developers of new tokens. Certainly, most developers are aware of the risks and it's only going to get bigger as the space grows.""  In a blog post accompanying the release, Coin Center echoed a similar sentiment, indicating that it believes the resources can serve the greater good as the industry continues to test uncharted waters with applications that, while based on computer science, have been regarded as financial in nature by global regulators.  ""Tools like this ... should help get developers on notice about these risks and maybe shed some light on why these regulations matter and should be taken seriously,"" director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh wrote.  Overall, the paper is bullish on the idea that blockchains that do not restrict user participation will enable the creation of new businesses that mirror Amazon and Facebook in design, while having a similar global impact.  Yet, the work stops short of offering formal legal advice. Rather, Bramanathan positioned it as a primer, focused on US law, that enables developers to be prepared when seeking guidance.  The release follows a notable uptick in market activity, with CoinDesk's Q3 State of Blockchain report finding that nearly $200m ($198.8m) has been raised through token sales in 2016 to date, with the majority ($152m) dedicated to the failed DAO project.  Bleeding edge  While new, the publication marks the latest addition to a canon of research that those involved admit has perhaps not kept up with innovation.  Bramanathan acknowledged that while some lawyers have written about the subject, the industry is still largely dependent on a handful of skilled professionals whose time and energies are falling short of the needs of what they say is a growing market.  ""There are precious few lawyers who understand this space,"" he said.  That said, he also noted that there is a limit on available expertise. For example, Bramanathan said that the work challenged his own perceptions about how the technology could be used in the context of existing regulations.  ""One interesting thing that we found is that if your token is properly designed, then the fact that it is a pre-sale doesn't automatically make it a security,"" he said.  ""There was a view that any pre-sale makes it a security, and there's a strong argument for pre-sales to be non-securities in some cases.""  Business impact  Still, the paper was critical of common practices in the space, such as the tendency for developers who use such issuance models to attempt to increase the value of tokens sold as a method of generating fundraising dollars.  Bramanathan described the current state of the market as a ""free for all"", but said that the five ""principles"" put forward, if followed, should provide public confidence in projects.  The release comes at a time when Coinbase has made overtures to developers releasing so-called 'protocol tokens' or 'digital assets', adding new offerings to its exchange over the course of 2016. To date, this has included ether, the cryptocurrency powering the ethereum protocol, and litecoin, a bitcoin alternative.  Coinbase declined to speak about how the release would impact its product roadmap.

42427195,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0Gph,1481113734,Circle Cuts Bitcoin Buying and Selling in Product Pivot,"Circle Internet Financial, once one of the best-funded early bitcoin startups, has announced it will no longer allow customers to buy and sell the digital currency.  Confirmed today via an announcement in The Wall Street Journal and first revealed last night in a customer update, Circle said it will now focus on using a soon-to-be-launched proprietary blockchain-based protocol called Spark.  Customers can continue to store bitcoin using the Circle app, however, those who want to buy and sell digital currency will be directed to digital asset exchange service Coinbase, once one of Circle's biggest competitors in the brokerage space.  Users can still convert bitcoins stored via the service to dollars, pounds or euros and continue sending money via social messaging, without fees. But notably, users will no longer be able to send money to other bitcoin addresses.  Despite the changes, Circle maintained that its vision is unchanged, even if the technology it uses will shift.  A blog post issued today reads:  ""When we founded Circle, we had a vision and belief that it was finally becoming possible for money to work the way the internet works. A big part of that was a long-term bet on blockchain and digital currency technology, which we thought held the potential to provide the missing layer of protocols needed for open value exchange.""  Currently available in the US, UK and some European countries, the introduction of Spark extends the company's service to The Philippines and Korea, via partnerships with startups Korbit and Coins.ph.  In total, Circle has raised $136m, according to data from Crunchbase, most recently raising $60m in a Series D funding round in June that also saw it expand its operations to China.

The digital currency, which helps counterparties enjoy greater privacy by using zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKS, fell to a low of $46 at 10:30 UTC, Poloniex figures reveal.  ZEC lingered at this low price only briefly, quickly recovering to $47.71 by 10:40.  The cryptocurrency briefly rebounded, hitting $50.71 some 30 minutes later, but at the time of reporting, ZEC tokens had fallen back below the $50 and were trading at sub-$48 levels.  These price fluctuations took place amid relatively modest trading activity, as 24-hour volume did not reach $1.6 million at any point during the session, according to CoinMarketCap.  Zcash prices have experienced some sharp declines since the digital currency went live on 28th October, when ZEC surged to roughly 3,300 BTC (more than $2 million) but dropped to 48 BTC the same day.  Within a few weeks, Zcash prices had declined to 1 BTC. Now, their steady, downward movement continues.

42427185,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0GRh,1481072905,'Big Four' Firm Deloitte Invests in First Blockchain Startup,"Professional services firm Deloitte has invested in blockchain startup SETL.  The funding represents the first time the professional services firm has publicly invested in a blockchain startup, a Deloitte representative confirmed, though he declined to disclose the amount when reached.  SETL, which is based in London, is one of a number of startups worldwide looking to apply the tech to payment and settlement, and it recently became part of a regulatory sandbox initiative launched by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.  The funding comes less than a month after the two firms announced the development of a contactless payment card for Metro Bank that uses blockchain tech to settle transactions. As reported at the time, the project is expected to reach commercial production in 2017.  To date, Deloitte has partnered with a range of startups in the space to develop blockchain prototypes – work that representatives from the firm say is aimed at offering new kinds of services to its global client base.  David Myers, head of capital markets for Deloitte, said of the funding:  ""Blockchain has the ability to transform the industry, and we have been investing heavily in real-world applications, such as identity management, cross-border payments, loyalty, trade finance and a number of others. By harnessing the capabilities of SETL's blockchain, we can provide our clients with even more practical and transformational solutions.""  According to SETL, the investment came after a year of collaboration between the two companies.  ""We have been working with the firm over the past 12 months, and today's announcement demonstrates Deloitte's ongoing commitment to engage with our platform,"" said CEO Peter Randall.
