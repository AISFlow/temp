42433028,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2snh,1604431277,DeFi Sell-Off Continues as Index Futures Retrace to June Levels,"Index futures for decentralized finance (DeFi) continue to collapse, erasing all gains since late June, as the sector cools off following a wild summer of speculation.      On derivatives exchange FTX, perpetual futures for their DeFi index have fallen nearly 60% from their September high of $3,500, dropping to prices not seen since shortly after the new futures product launched at the end of June.      On Binance, futures for a similar index have plummeted nearly 70% off its Aug. 28 high of $1,190, made the same day when the product started trading. Since its launch, the index has largely only traded downward, closing every week, except for three, at a loss.      A temporary respite may be near, however, offering investors a chance to recover and reevaluate the market, according to Alex Gedevani, analyst at Delphi Digital and former analyst at Barclay’s. The speed of the ongoing sell-off has simply caught many investors “off-guard,” he told CoinDesk.      In Gedevani’s view, the altcoin market is “inching closer” to a capitulation event, at which point the sector can start to “gradually recover.” But a “fresh narrative” is needed to reignite capital inflows to the space, he added.      Since the start of September, bitcoin has gained 18% and outperformed every top alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) in the CoinDesk 20 index. In part, this performance is due to traders rotating investment capital from altcoins into bitcoin, as CoinDesk previously reported.      Bitcoin has been a “black hole sucking up capital from investors looking to cash in on gains from the DeFi summer,” said Jack Purdy, decentralized finance analyst at Messari, in a direct message with CoinDesk. These investors picked bitcoin since it “appears overwhelmingly bullish amid this macroeconomic backdrop,” he said.      Some DeFi projects won’t see a gradual recovery though. Newer projects launched this summer “without clear value propositions will continue to see downside” with investors consolidating into stablecoins or bitcoin, Gedevani said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/03/defi-sell-off-continues-as-index-futures-retrace-to-june-levels,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/017508061914a6553dfc27683e4bf0eb9e0dddcd-951x623.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum users paid $57.49 million in transaction fees in October – down 65% from September's record monthly tally of $166.39 million, according to data source Glassnode.  ""Transaction costs declined as volumes on decentralized exchanges dropped, reducing demand for network's bandwidth,"" Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of Equilibrium & EOSDT stablecoin, told CoinDesk.  Trading volume on decentralized exchanges fell by nearly 25% to $19.4 billion in October to register the first monthly decline since April. The majority of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are based on Ethereum.  Further, the maximum ""gas"" price – paid by participants to transact on Ethereum – declined from 5.18 million gwei to 0.6 million gwei in October, according to data source Bitquery. (A gwei is a billionth of 1 ether.)  The sharp drop indicates there was less aggressive bidding by market participants for running transactions on the network, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at London-based prime brokerage Bequant.  Total fees paid had surged from $22 million to $166 million in Q3, as the DeFi space witnessed explosive growth following the launch of COMP governance token by the lending protocol Compound in June.  Such was the activity in September that ether miners earned over six times more in fees than bitcoin miners.  And while ethereum miners earned significantly less from fees in October, they still made more than the bitcoin miners, who collected $41.20 million in fees.

42433030,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2sth,1604417323,US Bitcoin Mining Firm Layer1 in Legal Tussle Over Power Facility Ownership,"Bitcoin miner Layer1 Technologies has been dragged into a lawsuit from a co-founder who claims he invested millions of dollars and was then forced out of the firm.      In a complaint filed in the District Court in the Western District of Texas Pecos Division, the plaintiff, Jakov Dolic, sets out that he co-founded Layer1 with its CEO Alexander Liegl, having developed a liquid cooling system that would allow the company to make use of Texas' cheap wind power, despite the high summer temperatures in the state.      Dolic, a German citizen residing in Switzerland, alleges that Liegl ""falsely promised"" that he would be able to raise $50 million from investors for a ""large bitcoin mining operation.""      However, the investments didn't arrive, per the complaint, so Dolic claims he spent $16.24 million of his own funds to purchase of a Ward County, Texas, power substation from a firm called Hodl Ranch, as well as a further $3.5 million to expand the power facility. Dolic claims he had an agreement with Leigl that Layer1 would refund him the money.      Per the allegations, Dolic didn't receive anything for his investment, while Liegl ""took legal title to the properties."" Further, the plaintiff claims, after he confronted Liegl over ""unauthorized and wasteful spending of Layer1’s funds,"" he was ""pressured"" out of the company.      The complaint alleges Liegl had been ""paying himself significant 'consulting' fees without Dolic’s knowledge or authorization.""      Further, the plaintiff claims Layer1 faced a funding crunch, having failed to garner sufficient investment and had decided to sell the substation at a ""fire sale price,"" and ""before Dolic can protect his rights.""      """"The complaint is completely meritless and contains numerous allegations that are demonstrably and categorically false,"" Liegl told CoinDesk. ""The company will be responding quickly to seek legal sanctions against Dolic and his counsel for making false allegations that lack a reasonable basis.""      With the lawsuit, Dolic – who founded Genesis Mining in 2013 – aims to assert his ""rights to the properties that he bought directly from the seller,"" even though Layer1 ""technically"" has ownership of the title.      Also read: Bitcoin’s Mining Difficulty Sees Largest Percentage Drop in 9 Years      ""There are simply no plans, and there never were any, to sell the substation,"" he added.      Layer1 is a Delaware Corporation working out of California that sets out to mine bitcoin using wind power. The firm has seen investment from Peter Thiel, Shasta Ventures and CoinDesk's parent firm Digital Currency Group.      As CoinDesk reported in August, Layer1 was accused by a team member of misdescribing the role of a supposed core team member in a pitch deck for investors.

Announced Tuesday, Visa has invited digital asset wallet provider ZenGo into its Fast Track program. The startup hopes to use the program, which has famously championed Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and rewards app Fold, to help launch a crypto-integrated payment card for the U.S. in early 2021.      Crypto apps are the flavor of the month, with PayPal joining Square, Robinhood, Revolut and Ziglu, who are all competing in this space. ZenGo CEO Ouriel Ohayon talked up the non-custodial aspect of the Visa-backed card, which he says sets it apart from the likes of PayPal.      “Those other offerings are only a half-vanilla taste of what crypto is because they only let you own an IOU over a cryptocurrency,” Ohayon said in an interview. “This is the only one that is tied to a user-controlled wallet where the users have control of their funds and the funds are on-chain.”      Visa clearly sees the value in linking crypto services to plastic cards, having just tied up a deal involving peer-to-peer digital asset marketplace Paxful. Meanwhile, Coinbase is also launching its Visa-branded crypto debit card in the U.S. early next year.      Read more: Coinbase to Launch Crypto Debit Card in US for Retail Spending      The ZenGo payment card allows users to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat so it can be spent in the Visa network and withdrawn from ATMs. The wallet uses a clever technique called multi-party computation (MPC), which breaks up long cryptographic keys and can be leveraged to create a more conducive user experience. According to ZenGo, MPC saves customers from having to write down private keys or remember passwords, and protects them even if their phone is lost or stolen.      “As the preferred network for digital currency wallets, we are excited to help innovative fintechs like ZenGo harness the value of Visa’s network,” Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said in a statement. “Through the Fast Track program, we can support ZenGo with access to Visa’s experts, technology, and resources to scale with efficiency.”      Read more: PayPal Embraces Crypto, Igniting Market as Mainstream Adoption Inches Closer      When it comes to integrating crypto with a network of merchants or point-of-sale payments infrastructure, Visa-backed cards are not remarkably different from PayPal’s claim about connecting to some 20 million-plus online merchants. Both offerings involve converting crypto to fiat to make a transaction.      But the ZenGo app is much more about current utility than future speculation, Ohayon said.      “We see a growing number of people who want to use cryptocurrency for their daily lives,” he said. “Just going and buying some from Robinhood to speculate is not what they want. We have real estate agents who get paid in cryptocurrency, we have photographers, DJs, independent workers of all sorts.

He said the early uptake “proves we’re doing something people find interesting.”      NIFTEX has been seen as a factor in the resurgent popularity of digital collectibles, inspired in part by this summer’s decentralized finance (DeFi) craze. “Perhaps spurred by the DeFi Summer, NFTs are undergoing a second discovery cycle,” Hubert said.      With the funding, Hubert and co-founder Mark Le have ambitions to turn NIFTEX into a more solidified platform for anyone with an NFT to walk in and leave with something to trade (without sacrificing ownership of the original work).      “I see from crypto people regarding NFTs [with] the same type of skepticism I see from people outside of crypto looking at bitcoin,” Hubert said. “Trading NFTs is hard, especially compared to a cryptocurrency that is fungible.”      Read more: The Inevitable Marriage of Yield Farming and NFTs, Explained      That’s where the innovation to fractionalize expensive NFTs into ERC-20 tokens really kicked off, Hubert added. After all, collectibles are cool, but so is making money.      “With NFTs, digital scarcity is here, and it’s here to stay,” Larry Sukernik, investment chief at Digital Currency Group, said in a press statement. “Just like we buy and sell fractions of companies and real-estate, so can we buy and sell fractions of digital assets. It’s a wonky idea at first, but the longer you think about it, the more it makes sense.”      In an interview, Hubert also hinted at a “master plan” to design and build a second version of the platform, moving toward a fully decentralized NIFTEX – presumably with a governance token – in early 2021.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TRADING,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/03/niftex-raises-500k-to-build-out-nft-trading-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a06144d459c579216df3775a23be39c7dd951f56-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433050,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2tHh,1604411489,First Mover: 11 Election Talking Points on Bitcoin as TRUMP Futures Point to Loss,"Bitcoin (BTC) was lower for a third straight day around $13,500, having fallen back from a fleeting 33-month high of $14,093 over the weekend.      In traditional markets, Asian and European shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries increased 0.03 percentage point to 0.88%. Gold strengthened 0.2% to $1,899 an ounce.    Market moves    The U.S. presidential election is finally here. President Donald Trump's Republicans are as convinced that Democratic challenger Joe Biden will lead America down an irreversible path toward socialism and disorder as Democrats are convinced another four years of Trump could well signal the end of democracy and decency.      A lot of bitcoiners are just putting their faith in bitcoin.      None of this may be justified, or perhaps all of it. First Mover decided that the best way to add value as American voters go to the polls was just to jot down a few bitcoin-oriented talking points.      1) Bitcoin prices barely reacted when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016:      2) Bitcoin's price action for the entire month of November 2016 gets completely lost in the longer-term chart:      3) A ""blue wave"" in which Biden wins and Democrats take control of the upper legislative chamber, the U.S. Senate, could make it easy for the former vice president to implement an agenda that includes spending big on societal issues and climate change. Such fiscal stimulus could expand already record U.S. federal budget deficits and probably would have to be financed by the Federal Reserve via money printing. Bitcoin might benefit from an ostensible weakening in the U.S. dollar.      4) A ""red wave"" in which Republicans hold the presidency and U.S. Congress is viewed as a ""low probability"" event, according to Reuters, but could lead to a rally in stock prices and a ""risk-on"" environment for financial assets. That was a pretty bullish environment for bitcoin in the decade through 2019. Trump has promised ""massive tax cuts"" during a second term along with massive stimulus. That would probably mean the Fed needs to print massive amounts of new money to finance it all.      5) In any scenario, stimulus is the likely winner, as previously reported in this column. ""Regardless of the outcome, bitcoin will prosper,"" wrote Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the cryptocurrency-focused financial firm Diginex.      6) The FTX crypto exchange's TRUMP 2020 futures contracts, which pay out 100 cents on the dollar if the sitting president wins and $0 otherwise, have surged over the past week but are still indicating that Trump is headed for a loss. The tokens were changing hands at 38 cents late Monday. Note that these also pay out if Trump technically loses but is still president after January 2021:      7) A host of key local elections for could shake up the landscape for crypto-industry policymaking for years to come, as reported by CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De in his pop-up newsletter, ""State of Crypto: Election 2020"".      8) Much of the election handicapping in traditional markets has focused on the potential for steep volatility in the event that there is no clear election result, potentially leading to prolonged uncertainty or even a constitutional crisis. ""Should election results lead to turmoil and instability in the U.S., it would make sense"" for more people to turn to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as they grow ""ever weary of central banks and politicians in general,"" said Denis Vinokorov of the crypto prime broker Bequant.      9) Because voters have already cast early ballots in unprecedented numbers, the potential for prolonged uncertainty may be overstated, according to Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics. It ""will be measured in hours, maybe days, and not weeks and months as some expect,"" Greenspan told clients in a newsletter. That might mean there's less to knock bitcoin prices off their medium-term trajectory, which lately has been up.      10) If Biden wins, the next couple months of the ""stub period"" prior to the mid-January inauguration might see outsize risks as ""Republicans aim to avoid aiding an incoming Democratic administration,"" according to the Washington Post. Unemployment is elevated, the coronavirus continues to spread and the economy is going through tectonic shifts such as the transition toward remote working. All that means that there's little likelihood of calm returning to traditional financial markets or crypto markets anytime soon.      11) Trump's $1.5 trillion of tax cuts in late 2017 boosted employment but never really paid for themselves and thus ballooned the national debt, even before the pandemic hit. As the economy slowed in 2019, the Fed had to loosen monetary policy to keep markets from falling. That helped to rekindle a bull market in bitcoin following the harsh bear market of 2018. Bitcoin took another leg up this year as the Fed pumped $3 trillion into global markets. In the end, the cryptocurrency gained 19-fold over the past four years.    Bitcoin watch    Both bitcoin and traditional market investors look to be predicting a pickup in volatility following Tuesday's U.S. elections.      The largest cryptocurrency's one-month implied volatility – expectations of how turbulent prices will be over the next four weeks, as implied in options markets – has risen to a two-week high of 59% in the past three days, according to data source Skew.      ""We expect the cryptocurrency to trade volatile in the coming days,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk.      The heightened short-term price volatility expectations could be associated with fears that the outcome of the election may be contested, resulting in a period of political and economic uncertainty.      While the one-month implied volatility has picked up, the six-month metric remains flat above 60%. That suggests the market does not expect a prolonged period of political uncertainty in the world's largest economy.      Further, the 10-percentage-point rise in the one-month implied volatility isn't a big move and indicates a moderate shift in sentiment, according to Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.      More extreme sentiment is seen in traditional foreign exchange markets, where the Chinese yuan's one-week implied volatility has doubled in the past week to the highest since 2011.      One-week implied volatility gauges for the euro and the yen have also risen to the highest since April.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin’s Implied Volatility Rises Ahead of US Election    Token Watch    Ether (ETH): Amount of ether held at major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges drops to two-year low as decentralized exchanges grow in popularity.

The Shanghai exchange said Tuesday the changes will create new requirements such as more financial disclosures ahead of IPOs, making it more difficult for fintech companies to list. HKEX made a similar announcement soon after.      The announcements come on the heels of an interview between Jack Ma, founder of Ant Group and four major Chinese financial regulators including the central bank and China Securities and Regulatory Commission.      Just days before the IPO was to go ahead, the four regulators put forward a slew of new regulations that are targeted at fintech companies like Ant Group. In particular, measures from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission would further regulate fintech companies’ lending businesses, while requiring more licenses for cross-province transactions and imposing new limitations on the borrowers.

42433045,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2tDh,1604408411,The Crypto Industry Remains Mostly Unengaged in Election 2020,"The crypto industry appears largely uninvolved in this year’s election, beyond ita normal, ongoing efforts to seek friendly regulations and laws in Washington, D.C.      According to Federal Election Commission (FEC) data, employees at 10 significant firms to the cryptocurrency space – including Coinbase, Ripple, Andreessen Horowitz, Uniswap, Compound, BitGo, Gemini, Chaincode Labs, Kraken and Digital Currency Group and subsidiaries (CoinDesk is a DCG subsidiary) – donated a cumulative total of around $100,000.      This is not a comprehensive list of companies, in part due to lack of available data, but it points to a general trend for the 2019-2020 filing period. Other startups in the space also showed low numbers of donations.      How to explain this relative lack of engagement? While issues that would seem important to the average bitcoiner – such as the economy and how government stimuli are doled out – are at stake, other critical areas like the COVID-19 pandemic, health care, foreign policy and immigration are also top of mind.      Or perhaps the deeply polarizing battle between U.S. President Donald J. Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden has simply eclipsed relatively niche issues like cryptocurrency.      “I think the Biden-Trump [campaign], just the general politics, has sucked the air out of the room when it comes to specific issues,” said Tyler Whirty, the founder of HODLpac, a crypto-focused political action group.      Despite this lack of engagement, the election will impact how laws and regulations governing the crypto space unfold over the next four years. Organizations like the Blockchain Association, Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center have all been working to educate lawmakers and inform both crypto-specific and adjacent policy, said Brian Nistler and William Brannan, attorneys with the Lowenstein Sandler law firm.    Donations    On an individual level, the crypto community hasn’t been overly engaged with the election. There seems to have been little to no public discussion of issues pertinent to the industry, such as data privacy or encryption.      The vast majority of funds donated by the employees of the 10 firms mentioned appear to have gone to ActBlue, the nonprofit donor group that supports Democratic Party candidates and other progressive groups, in the 2019-2020 filing period.      Coinbase employees donated nearly half of these funds, totaling just under $45,000, with a16z coming in second at $24,000.      Still, these figures pale in comparison to the $1.5 billion ActBlue reported raising in just the third quarter of 2020 from 6.8 million individuals overall.      Donations from representatives in specific industries are one way for these industries to get lawmakers’ attention, said Ron Hammond, an industry lobbyist and former aide to Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio).      Read more: Election 2020: What’s at Stake for the Crypto Industry      “PACs do a lot to help move the needle,” he said. “That’s why Realtors get a lot of legislation passed … It cuts across both sides of the aisle.”      Overall, however, crypto donations in the political space are “noticeably lacking” at the moment in any significant volume, Hammond said.      That’s not to say the crypto community hasn’t made efforts to get more involved, Nistler and Brannan said.      “Various groups have advocated a mix of progressive and practical regulation as well as a more hands-off regulatory approach,” they said. “Those that favor such a hands-off approach tend to focus on the resiliency and independence of the blockchain functionality underlying cryptocurrency.”      Still, “many individuals” believe that some amount of regulation around the space is necessary to help the overall industry grow, they said.    ‘Opportunity’    The 2020 election is important to the crypto industry “no matter how you look at it,” said Graham Newhall, a communications adviser to the Blockchain Association.      Whirty said HODLpac had seen some decent engagement since its launch earlier this year, with a few hundred individuals signing up to the project. Not every signup has donated, however.      The PAC held its first community vote last week, which allows donors to choose who will receive the funds raised by the PAC. The group’s purpose is to promote crypto interests among the U.S.’s political leaders and, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, raised a total of $27,000 this year, or about $6,000 since its public launch in March.      The funds were distributed to 10 U.S. representatives, with the top recipient – Rep. Sean Maloney (D-NY) – receiving 36 votes.      “A lot of people in the industry are paying attention but they’re not doing so from a crypto perspective; they’re just watching the election just like anybody else,” Whirty said.      Read more: Crypto Traders Bet on US Election as FTX Prediction Markets Hit Record Volumes      Individuals may begin engaging more actively, especially if there is a return to normal following the election and pandemic, said John Collins, a partner at advisory firm FS Vector.      “If you’ve got a situation that’s … functional in whatever combination that looks like, and we can start asking people for legislation, I think there’s a lot of opportunity for the crypto space,” he said.      Existing efforts to engage with regulators are already paying off, Nistler and Brannan said, pointing to PayPal’s recent move into the crypto space after securing a conditional BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services.      “Through industry engagement, New York’s Department of Financial Services recently established a conditional licensing program aimed squarely at streamlining and lowering the barrier to entry for market participants to engage in cryptocurrency activities in New York,” they said.

A committee formed earlier this year to review Twitter's leadership has concluded the current management structure with Dorsey at the helm is sufficient, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing a company filing on the matter.  ""The board will continue to evaluate company and management performance according to a range of factors, including the company’s operating plan and established milestones,” the filing said, while expressing confidence in the existing leadership.  The panel reviewing a potential leadership change included representatives from activist investor Elliott Management Corp., which took a major stake in Twitter in February.  The firm had initially been eyeing changes to the firm's management, with the possible removal of Jack Dorsey as CEO, according to a Bloomberg report at the time based on sources.  Twitter shares gained about 1% in extended trading on Tuesday's news.  The decision to retain Dorsey is also an approval of his ability to lead two public companies concurrently. Along with Twitter, he also heads payments company Square, which recently disclosed bitcoin treasury holdings and has a cryptocurrency development unit.  While the review committee is keeping Dorsey as Twitter's chief, it also introduced a plan that would make it easier for outside investors such as Elliott to take control by replacing board members, Bloomberg reported.

The move signifies an important step for Bangladeshi companies in the digitalization of trade, the bank said.

It was carried out over the trade finance network Contour, built with R3’s Corda Enterprise blockchain technology.

42433044,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2t9h,1604401855,Bitcoin's Implied Volatility Rises Ahead of US Election,"Both bitcoin and traditional market investors look to be predicting a pick-up in volatility following the U.S. elections.    The cryptocurrency's one-month implied volatility – investors' expectation of how turbulent prices will be over the next four weeks – has risen to a two-week high of 59% in the past three days, according to data source Skew.  ""Bitcoin's price will be sensitive to the outcome of U.S. elections [on Tuesday],"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. ""We expect the cryptocurrency to trade volatile in the coming days, and that is being reflected in near-dated implied volatility in the options market.""  The heightened short-term price volatility expectations could be associated with fears that the outcome of the U.S. presidential election may be contested, resulting in a period of political and economic uncertainty.  While the one-month implied volatility has picked up, the six-month metric remains flat above 60%.  That suggests the market does not expect a prolonged period of political uncertainty in the world's largest economy.  Further, the 10-point rise in the one-month implied volatility isn't a big move and indicates a moderate shift in sentiment, according to Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.  More extreme sentiment is seen in the fiat currency markets, where the Chinese yuan's one-week implied volatility has doubledhttps://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-11-03/traders-price-in-wild-yuan-with-one-week-risk-measure-at-record in the past week to the highest since 2011.  One-week implied volatility gauges for the euro and the yen have also risen to the highest since April.  Implied volatility is gauged by demand for options as hedging instruments.  Seasoned traders often buy both call and put options, or hedge buy positions in the spot or futures market by buying put options when expecting uncertainty. That pushes the implied volatility metric higher.  A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date, and the put option gives the right to sell.  View  The traditional markets will likely suffer, aggravating an ongoing technical pullback in bitcoin, if the U.S. elections are contested.  While Democratic candidate Joe Biden is leading in most polls, online betting markets are more bullish on the odds for President Donald Trump.  Once the dust settles post-election, the rising pile of negative-yielding bonds across the globe is likely to reignite the bitcoin bull run as investors seek returns.  Bitcoin is currently trading largely unchanged on the day near $13,550, having fallen back from a fleeting 33-month high of $14,093 over the weekend.

42385055,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmnYr,1604395786,Bitcoin’s Mining Difficulty Sees Largest Percentage Drop in 9 Years,"Bitcoin’s mining difficulty just recorded its largest percentage decrease since the advent of ASIC mining machines in late 2012, dropping by just over 16% and giving miners a reason to celebrate as their profitability is set to increase significantly.      Difficulty dropped to 16.787 trillion at around 9:00 UTC on Tuesday, its lowest level since June, according to data aggregated by BTC.com. The adjustment marks the second-largest percentage decrease of all time.      Mining difficulty is a relative measure of the amount of resources required to compete for mining fresh bitcoin. It climbs or falls at the end of roughly two-week epochs (or 2,016-block periods) depending on whether the total estimated hash power consumed by the network has also increased or decreased.      Tuesday’s significant adjustment comes as many mining companies in China’s Sichuan province are taking machines offline and relocating to cheaper energy sources after the end of the region’s rainy season, as CoinDesk previously reported.      Over the next two weeks until the next adjustment, miners with machines still online will enjoy a welcome respite after battling an unusually difficult year, which Thomas Heller, COO at mining software company HASHR8, described as “truly one of a kind.”      As bitcoin’s price has increased significantly over the past few months and the amount of power needed to mine new bitcoins has decreased, “margins for efficient miners will significantly widen,” explained John Lee Quigley, director of research at HASHR8, in a note published Monday. Further, “a myriad of inefficient miners will be able to mine profitably again,” he added.      In short, between now and the next difficulty adjustment will be “extremely lucrative” for bitcoin miners, Quigley told CoinDesk in a direct message.      Beyond its size, Tuesday’s adjustment is also notable because of the infrequency of negative adjustments. Only 17% of adjustments are negative, and even fewer – roughly 2% – are double-digit percentage decreases.      “What we are seeing now is indeed an anomaly,” said Quigley. “Higher prices almost always lead to higher difficulty.”      Machines being relocated by Asia-based mining companies are expected to come back online over the next few weeks, moreover, and other miners may bring more machines online in the coming weeks to take advantage of the increased period of profitability, which could cause a difficulty increase over the coming adjustment periods.      Improved margins for miners during the hashrate drop are temporary, said Daniel Frumkin, engineer and technical writer at Slush Pool, the first-ever bitcoin mining pool launched in 2010.      “That said, nobody will complain about bigger margins for two to four weeks,” he told CoinDesk.

42385039,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmnHF,1604393234,Hong Kong's Securities Watchdog May Soon Regulate All Crypto Trading Platforms,"Hong Kong's government is seeking to change the rules for cryptocurrency trading firms operating or offering services within the city jurisdiction.      A new consultation paper detailed by Clara Chiu, director of licensing at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), in a keynote speech at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020 on Tuesday, will propose the SFC be given expanded regulatory oversight over all ""centralized virtual asset trading platforms"" in Hong Kong.      This will be regardless of whether they provide access to tokens considered to be securities or solely cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.      The SFC implemented regulatory guidance in 2019 that sought to treat digital asset firms trading at least one security token under the same rules as securities brokerages, but signing up with the regulator was voluntary.      ""Under the current legislative framework if a platform operator is really determined to operate completely off the regulatory radar it can do so simply by ensuring that its traded crypto assets are not within the legal definition of a security,"" said Ashley Alder, CEO of the SFC in a speech also on Tuesday, Reuters reports.      That is now set to change in line with guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Chiu said, with all cryptocurrency trading platforms proposed to apply for an SFC license under the city's anti-money laundering (AML) legislation.      See also: Hong Kong ‘Exploring’ Collaboration With China on Digital Yuan: Finance Chief      As a FATF member, Hong Kong is ""under an obligation"" to align with the AML standards for virtual asset service providers, she added.

42385050,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmnTp,1604379627,The 2020 Elections Are Boosting Crypto Prediction Markets,"In just over three weeks, the trading volume on decentralized betting platform Polymarket went from zero to almost $3 million.    As of Monday, Polymarket’s “Will Trump win the 2020 U.S. presidential election?” had over $2.8 million worth of bets placed, with each bet (for possible answers “yes” or “no”) costing less than a dollar. The platform allows users to place crypto bets on highly-debated current events and public topics including politics, pop culture, business and health, according to its websitehttps://polymarket.com/how-it-works.    Polymarket is a non-custodial platform, meaning it does not hold or store user-funds, and bets can be placed in the dollar-backed stablecoin USDC.      Prediction markets, where users can bet on the outcome of future events, are a key application of decentralized finance (DeFi), which allows users to conduct financial transactions on a blockchain without a middleman.      Elections and political debates attract high numbers of traders to these platforms; decentralized prediction platform Augur launched five years ago, but struggled to take off until U.S. midterm election betting gave it a modest push in 2018.      “To me, the presidential election is the Super Bowl for prediction markets. Every single one is experiencing a massive uptick in volume. It’s only natural that crypto follows suit,” David Liebowitz, vice president of business development at decentralized encyclopedia Everipedia, told CoinDesk via Telegram.      Elections also seem to attract new users to crypto betting platforms.      Read more: All-In on DeFi: Why the Days of Centralized Exchanges Are Numbered      “There are people who are using it, who aren't even crypto native users. They don't even fully understand crypto but they're still using Polymarket,” said Shayne Coplan, founder of Polymarket.      Just over a week ago, Polymarket announced it had secured $4 million in its latest round of funding, attracting high profile investors from the industry. Augur launched its new and improved version 2 in July of this year.    After Elections    Users are looking at a number of betting and prediction markets in the runup to Tuesday’s election. Anonymous crypto betting platform YieldWars launched its election battle last night and has since attracted over $50,000 in bets. Users can stake either the platform’s native $WAR token or ETH.      YieldWars’ co-founder, who goes by Owl, told CoinDesk via Telegram the sudden rise in volume is far from shocking given the scale and importance of the election.      “Crypto-based prediction markets should be flourishing on blockchain right now but have failed to deliver up to this point. The election has breathed life into prediction markets but what is going to happen when it ends? Are people going to be as enthusiastic about them?” Owl said.      Owl also said YieldWars may have found the “secret sauce” to keep people interested in betting, by creating battle royale-style tournaments for betting, ideal for sporting events. The election face-off is a one-time battle, where two pools are running simultaneously, one in each currency.      The platform has partnered with Everipedia to use Associated Press (AP) election data for resolving its election betting market.      Read more: Prediction Markets’ Time Has Come, but They Aren’t Ready for It      In October 2020, the reputed wire-service AP, in a first, partnered with Everipedia to create Oracle, an immutable record of 2020 election results on a blockchain.      “I don’t think there could be a more trusted source than the AP and seeing that the Oracle was built using Chainlink infrastructure, it was only logical to go with this option,” Owl said.      According to Liebowitz, blockchain has long been viewed as the best platform for prediction markets to thrive. But centralized betting platforms like PredictIt are still leading the game.      PredictIt has 214 “markets” or betting scenarios compared to the new-kid-on-the-block Polymarket’s 19 markets. As of Monday, PredictIt’s top event “2020 Presidential Election Winner?” had 116.7 million shares traded.      Coplan declined to say how that compared to Polymarket, calling it a “bizarre metric” adding his platform only tracked dollar trading volumes, and it did not have an equivalent.      Then, there is the expectation that elections will boost betting volumes.      “It’s only going to get bigger from here, especially four years from now when the next election comes around,” Liebowitz said.      According to Coplan, the demand for blockchain-based betting markets has always been there.      “It was just clear that there was a lot of demand for this. I would say, the past week or two, the demand has actually materialized. Still, these are just the very early days,” Coplan said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/03/the-2020-elections-are-boosting-crypto-prediction-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f05e4d678794737daf4e76fffec7fa2700e9c4c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
