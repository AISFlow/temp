They have shown great interest in Solana&apos;s performance and see a near and long-term potential in it because of its capability for experimentation. In a public release, Grayscale Investments said they will be &apos;enabling investors to gain exposure to SOL in the form of a security while avoiding the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping SOL directly.&apos; This will require a $25,000 minimum investment, charging Grayscale&apos;s standard 2.5% management fee. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein commented to Forbes: In many investors&apos; minds, there&apos;s a continued appetite to invest in Solana, In some sense, it is a more cost-effective blockchain [than Ethereum], and today we are seeing over 500 decentralized apps and about 1.2 million monthly active users on the network. When you kind of take a step back, and you see how quickly it has been able to ramp up, it&apos;s certainly pretty impressive. Regarding the investor&apos;s appetite for Solana, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is a strong supporter of the digital asset, giving a constant public endorsement that has become a key point of its current visibility.

42375621,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9I9D,1638315000,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Rally Stalls After US Central Bank Chair’s Comments; Ether Rises,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin dropped on U.S. Fed Chair Powell’s comment, while ether gained more market share.  Technician’s take: Support levels remain intact, which could establish a tight trading range between $55,000-$60,000 BTC into the Asian trading day.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,157 -1.3%  Ether (ETH): $4,642 +4.4%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,567 -1.9%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $34,483 -1.8%  Nasdaq: $15,537 -1.5%  Gold: $1,772 -.80%  Market moves  Bitcoin’s price sank after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Tuesday that the risk of higher inflation has “increased,” signaling the central bank would consider fastening the reduction of its asset purchase policies that have boosted the markets for risky assets.  “A faster Fed taper and increased [interest] rate hike expectations was bad news for bitcoin,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote in a market commentary. “Bitcoin is trading more like a risky asset than an inflation hedge.”  On the other hand, ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ended Tuesday with its fourth straight day of gains, trading above $4,600, according to CoinDesk’s data.  “Ethereum is still the favorite crypto bet for most traders and seems like it will make another run towards $5000 once risk appetite returns,” Moya added.  Ether’s growing market dominance is also reflected on the ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) chart: The ETH/BTC daily chart on crypto exchange Binance was up by more than 5.2%, at the time of writing, according to TradingView.  Other layer 1 blockchain-associated tokens also posted gains on Tuesday, led by Terra blockchain’s LUNA token, which logged a new record high price.

The cryptocurrency is down about 2% over the past 24 hours and is roughly flat over the past week.  The downward-sloping, 100-day moving average on the four-hour chart indicates a short-term downtrend. This means buyers have consistently taken some profit on rallies over the past month.  Recently, the $60,000 resistance level has been a key hurdle for buyers despite oversold readings on the charts. So far, support levels remain intact, which could establish a tight trading range between $55,000-$60,000 into the Asian trading day. BTC was trading around $57,800 at press time.

42411866,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgiYJ,1638314524,What Is CityCoins and How Does It Work?,"CityCoins describes itself as an avenue for citizens to generate crypto-based revenue for themselves and the cities where they live. Think of it as a system that allows users to contribute crypto funds to their home city, or support other cities, in exchange for rewards.  Users of the CityCoins platform have already begun to issue tokens for a handful of major cities, designed to help improve the lives of people living in them. Interestingly, the project has opted to base its operation on a bitcoin-powered ecosystem such that users and cities can potentially earn bitcoin.  Miami and New York have emerged as the first two cities where CityCoins have been launched. There is also the opportunity for citizens to introduce CityCoins for their cities inside and beyond the borders of the United States of America.  How do CityCoins work?  How to create a CityCoin  At a glance, it might seem like the creation and management of CityCoins is carried out by the project’s team. However, the process is actually completely in the hands of individual users. The project simply provides the infrastructure to support each CityCoin’s deployment.  So how do you go about creating a CityCoin for your own City? It’s a four-part process. First off, the crypto community can vote on which city they’d like to launch a CityCoin for next by completing a survey on the website. Once a particular city is narrowed down, it’s important that the chosen city’s mayor supports the proposal and agrees to claim the city wallet (see below).  Then, anyone can initiate the deployment of a new CityCoin by launching a smart contract (a software program running on a blockchain that takes certain actions when predetermined conditions are met) on the Stacks mainnet, or live version.  To do this, you’ll need to:  Download the Stacks Web Wallet  Fund the wallet with STX tokens, available on leading centralized exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, Crypto.com and OKEx  Head to the MineCityCoins website and connect your Stacks Web Wallet by clicking the top right-hand corner button  According to the official website documents, you’ll then need to “Submit the “register-user” transaction via the user interface, which records your Stacks address and optional memo on chain to signal activation of the CityCoin  Finally, a minimum of 20 individuals is then required to send an amount of STX – the native cryptocurrency of Stacks – to the newly created smart contract to activate the mining process. It’s worth noting, however, once a CityCoin smart contract is activated miners must wait 24 hours before being able to mine the newly created CityCoins.  What is Stacks?  Simply put, CityCoins uses a decentralized protocol powered by smart contracts to generate value for participants and their respective cities. The goal is to enable a system that will reward users’ efforts to keep the system afloat and, in the process, generate funds for developing selected cities. Unlike most crypto projects, CityCoins has opted for multiple token systems. This framework allows it to create a unique token for each supported city.  Note that smart contracts are programmable agreements deployed on the blockchain to eliminate counterparty risk. In other words, they will only finalize transactions or implement sets of commands when all the parties involved meet the conditions written into the smart contracts.  At this juncture, you may be wondering, how does CityCoins utilize smart contracts-enabled transactions on a bitcoin-based infrastructure, considering that the Bitcoin network does not support smart contracts? This is where a technology called “Stacks” enters the fray.  All of City Coins’ bitcoin-powered implementations exist thanks to Stacks, a blockchain infrastructure built on top of the Bitcoin network to enable smart contract applications. CityCoins can capitalize on smart contract technology and still utilize Bitcoin’s security fabric because it operates on Stacks blockchain, which is technically an extension of the Bitcoin blockchain that provides smart contract functionalities.  Notably, the entire CityCoin ecosystem relies on two core processes. The first is called mining, while the other is stacking.  How CityCoins mining works  CityCoins miners deposit STX into the CityCoins smart contract for a chance of earning CityCoins tokens – such as MiamiCoin or NYCCoin, for example. This process, known as bidding, takes place on the Stacks blockchain and involves a winning miner being selected and rewarded with CityCoins tokens each time a new block is discovered (approximately every 10 minutes, similar to Bitcoin’s block discovery time).  Note that the probability of emerging as a successful miner depends on the number of STX each miner bids (deposits into the smart contract) relative to the total amount deposited by competing miners.  For instance, if your share of the STX forwarded to CityCoins smart contract is 50%, you have a 50% chance of emerging as the miner eligible to claim the CityCoin token-denominated rewards allocated for that specific block. Miners can choose whether to bid for a single block, or up to 30 blocks at a time.  It’s important to note that depositing STX into a particular CityCoins smart contract is a one-way process. In other words, you permanently lose access to the STX tokens forwarded to the protocol’s smart contract, even if you emerge as a winning miner or not. Seventy percent of all STX tokens deposited into the smart contract is distributed among stackers, while the remaining 30% is sent to the city’s wallet.  It’s also worth noting, when mining is first activated for a new CityCoin 100% of STX tokens deposited into the mining smart contract are sent to the city’s wallet during the first reward cycle phase. Each cycle lasts 2,100 Stack blocks (approximately two weeks.)  In the event there aren’t any users stacking, all STX tokens are sent to the corresponding city’s wallet.  CityCoin mining rewards operate in a similar fashion to Bitcoin’s issuance schedule, where rewards are halved systematically every four years. During the first 10,000 blocks, winning miners receive 250,000 CityCoins per block. Rewards are then reduced to 100,000 coins per block for the next 200,000 Stacks blocks (approximately four years.) From there, rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks until Stack block 1,050,000 is reached, upon which a fixed amount of 3,125 CityCoins will be released per block in perpetuity.  How CityCoins stacking works  Stacking is very similar to Ethereum staking and requires participants to lock up digital assets in a smart contract for a voluntary period to earn rewards. The only difference is that the earnings are denominated in a different cryptocurrency. When you stake ether – the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum – you earn more ether as a reward. In contrast, CityCoin holders stack their CityCoins tokens to earn STX. The STX they earn comes from the portion of STX tokens deposited by miners, as previously described.  At this early stage, you can only receive CityCoins like MiamiCoin through mining. However, there are plans to list these tokens on exchanges in the near future.  In addition to earning STX tokens, people who stack their CityCoins can also generate bitcoin – providing a dual yield on their assets.  Like the mining process defined above, stacking occurs via the Stacks blockchain protocol.  What is a city wallet?  Each city where CityCoins has been launched has a special wallet called a City Wallet. This effectively acts as the city’s crypto treasury and is where 30% of all miners’ STX bids are sent.  The mayors of these cities can claim the funds in the City Wallet at any time and use the capital generated by cashing out of the tokens to improve the lives of their constituents. Better still, they can further stack the STX tokens accrued in the City Wallet to earn bitcoin.  What is MiamiCoin and NYCCoin?  Already, two cities in the United States of America have started accruing STX in their respective city wallets. These cities are Miami and New York City. CityCoins users have issued native tokens for each city:  MiamiCoin ($MIA): MiamiCoin was launched in August 2021 as the first CityCoins token designed to reward miners and generate STX and bitcoin for holders. As its name implies, MiamiCoin provides an avenue for Miami citizens to support the development of their city and, in turn, receive rewards for their contributions. Hence, when a miner deposits STX to the MiamiCoin smart contract, the miner stand the chance of receiving MiamiCoins as rewards. More importantly, a portion of the deposit goes to Miami’s city wallet.  In just under three months since MiamiCoinCoin went live, the protocol’s contribution to the city has grown to $20 million worth of STX tokens. It is worth mentioning that the city’s leadership has since gained control over this wallet.  Newyorkcitycoin (NYCCoin): NYCCoin is another variant of the CityCoins tokens specially designed to promote an enabling crypto community in New York. On Nov. 10, 2021, the NYCCoin smart contract was deployed and citizens have already started mining and stacking the token for a chance to earn rewards. Like MiamiCoin, NYCCoin creates an avenue for users to contribute to the economic growth of the city of New York. Already, the mayor-elect of New York City, Eric Adams, has expressed his support for NYCCoin.  Upcoming CityCoins  Austin, Texas has been touted as the next frontier for CityCoins, with plans to launch AustinCoin ATX seemingly in its final stages. However, unlike MiamiCoin and Newyorkcitycoin, the mayor of Austin, Steve Adler, has yet to endorse the ATX token launch.",POSITIVE,STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | STX,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-citycoins-and-how-does-it-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df332a41eef70af1cbb1c5f00eb9499206bfc318-1500x1000.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417098,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4oPd,1638308570,The Transhumanist Case for Crypto,"If you want to live forever, you need a money fit for purpose. Bitcoin, for many, is the ticket. It’s the first, largest and most decentralized cryptocurrency. It’s widely adopted – from retail investors to pension funds to nation-states. It has a durable brand. There’s a case to be made that it’s the most recent “Lindy” invention, the idea that ancient phenomena are less perishable by virtue of being around the longest.  But who would want to live forever? As a historical fact, it turns out, many early adopters of cryptocurrency, that’s who! How fitting! Transhumanists, a broad category of people who want to improve the human condition – extending life or extinguishing death, spreading happiness and eradicating suffering through technology – looked at bitcoin as a powerful tool in their arsenal.  This article, part of CoinDesk’s Future of Money Week, is excerpted from The Node newsletter, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It’s not necessary to name names here, but many of crypto’s earliest advocates had ties to the transhumanist movement. Many influential “crypto natives” still do. There are many flavors of transhumanism: Posthuman, cyborgism, immoralism, biohackers, the singularity are all close cognates. The overriding idea is simply that individual human potential isn’t constrained by our bodies, our biology or even the evolutionary process of natural selection. There’s a pill for that!  Nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science – sometimes abbreviated NBIC – are at the frontier of scientific advancement, pushing the limits of what’s physically and mentally possible. One day, we might have brain-computer interfaces, blending artificial and natural intelligence, perfecting our memories and infinitely expanding the scope of our knowledge. We might have pills to induce a state of bliss. Who knows?  “The purely technical obstacles to transhumanism I’d say are diminishing,” David Pearce, co-founder of the World Transhumanist Association (WTA), now known as Humanity+, has said. He’s right, to an extent. Using a mix of technologies, human beings are already overcoming their natural limits. Death may be a condition for all living beings now, but maybe not for the creatures we may become – or create.  Already, there are several for-profit corporations and nonprofit organizations that freeze human cadavers, of once-living people who hope to rise again in the near future when science has found a solution for disease, depression and death. New York University scholar of digital culture Finn Brunton called these people “extropians,” and chronicled the associations between cryptogenics and crypto.

Morris  Not able to know the state of the world they’d be born into, the “temporarily” dead need money that could outlast banks and even governments. Many were of a libertarian bent and thought the U.S. dollar was due to collapse. But you don’t need to be a futurist to think bitcoin will persist as long as the internet does. Sufficiently decentralized, bitcoin isn’t a hedge against inflation but societal collapse (in theory).  All of this seems like a gamble. But stay with me, and hold the ethical phone.  Transhumanism – literally “beyond human” – is as focused on setting artificial limits around the human condition as it is about additive technologies. Pearce, for one, looks to genetics as the realm for creating perfect human subjects. He notes that when he founded the WTA, the human genome wasn’t even decoded. Every year since then we’ve learned more about the basic building blocks of life – and eventually will be able to arrange them how we please. And why wouldn’t we choose perfection?  The “morphological freedom” to design babies to have favorable traits – to be smarter, more athletic, more outgoing than their peers – means identifying and dismantling bad genes. It’s literally artificial selection. In a similar way, Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto imposed an arbitrary limit around his monetary creation – 21 million BTC.  Some maximalists envision a world where all economic activity flows through the Bitcoin network, which would outcompete other currencies. Bitcoin has some advantages over the fiat system: It’s borderless, censorship-resistant and has settlement finality. It’s only grown in value since being released to the world. And, more importantly, it’s bigger than any government can control.  See also: The World Bitcoin Will Build | Cory Klippsten  In both instances of transhumanism and hyperbitcoinization, a tiny elite would rule. Bitcoin scarcity means that not everyone can share equally in the wealth, and its deflationary attributes reward the earliest adopters. Meanwhile, although Pearce and many transhumanists are broadly utilitarian and advocate for whatever would create the happiest humans (sometimes animals) in the future, he’s not a redistributionist.  In his book, “The Hedonistic Imperative,” Pearce argues that the world would be better if everyone was more like Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, rich and blessed with good genes. Whatever Gates-like post-human comes next, which we will create using the most transformative technologies, would mean the rest of humanity is obsolete – unable to compete.  Not every bitcoiner is a transhumanist, and not every transhumanist is a eugenicist, but it’s worth looking at how the movements relate and speak to each other. One lesson from a decade of crypto innovation isn’t whether something is technologically possible – but whether there is the social and cultural will. What might be most Lindy of all is knowing that technology – always an extension of the self – may always escape our control.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/11/30/the-transhumanist-case-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87c15801d72c80320e1922042bdda57d8218db14-2048x1559.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424174,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lARh,1638306968,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Underperforms as Ether and Other Altcoins Rise,"Bitcoin was roughly flat on Tuesday while alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether and Solana’s SOL token were up about 5% over the past 24 hours. LUNA, the native token of the Terra blockchain, rallied about 13% as traders chased incentive programs.  Overall, trading conditions were choppy across global markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that monetary policy could tighten faster than expected – potentially a negative for speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies and equities.  Despite short-term price swings, some analysts remain bullish on bitcoin.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,622, -1.0%  Ether (ETH): $4,661, +5.4%  S&P 500: 4,567, -1.9%  Gold: $1,775, -0.5%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.436%  “As BTC is looking good to close November below the expected target of $60,000, investors are optimistic that the cryptocurrency will repeat its historic trend of ending the year on a stellar bullish note,” Nikita Rudenia, co-founder of asset management firm 8848 Invest, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Rudenia has a $70,000 BTC price target by the end of this year.  Other analysts pointed to bearish bitcoin options activity as a point of concern. “Puts are getting more expensive as market participants turn their focus towards hedging spot [positions] or speculating on further downside. In a recent tweet, Genesis Volatility themselves noted a large amount of short-term put purchases,” Delphi Digital wrote in a Tuesday blog post.  Bitcoin dominance falls  Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization, or dominance ratio, has declined about 10% over the past two months to the lowest level since September. The decline in BTC’s dominance reflects the recent outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  Some analysts view the rotation from bitcoin to altcoins as an indicator of greater appetite for risk among investors.  Ether outperforms  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was approaching $4,800, near its all-time high, and was up about 5% over the past 24 hours. BTC was roughly flat over the same period. Technical indicators suggest further upside is likely for ether relative to bitcoin.  The chart below shows the ETH/BTC ratio, which is attempting to break above a five-month trading range. Two consecutive daily closes above 0.080 could yield further upside in ETH/BTC.  Altcoin roundup  Grayscale launches new trust dedicated to Solana: Digital asset manager Grayscale Investments announced its newest investment vehicle will be passively invested in Solana, reported CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley. This marks the firm’s 16th investment vehicle, following similar products that offer exposure to bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin and stellar lumens. SOL has enjoyed huge growth in 2021, increasing from around $1.50 at the start of the year to $214 as of Tuesday morning. Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of CoinDesk.  November’s biggest gainer is Crypto.com’s CRO token: Crypto.com’s CRO token more than tripled in November after a slew of prominent advertising deals, which include buying the naming rights to the Staples Center, reported CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma. The cryptocurrency exchange and credit-card issuer founded in 2016 now has a market cap of more than $17 billion, making it the top performer in November among digital assets with a market cap above $10 billion, according to Messari. As of Tuesday, the CRO price was around $0.70, up 226% on the month.  Cook Finance launches DeFi Index platform on Avalanche: Decentralized asset-management platform Cook Finance is bringing a suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) indexes to Avalanche. Similar to index products in traditional finance, Cook’s index products are composed of a list of tokens and track the performance of the underlying assets, making it easier for investors to buy a diversified allocation of cryptocurrencies in a single transaction. “We see this launch as providing an easy way for new users who want to get into DeFi indexes but were held back by high gas fees on Ethereum,” said Adrian Peng, CEO of Cook Finance.

Here are five things to know about the new leader of one of the world’s biggest tech companies.  1. He is a leading force in Twitter’s decentralization projects.  Agrawal oversees Bluesky, Twitter’s project to create a decentralized protocol for social media, which started in 2019, according to The Verge. The project didn’t make noise until this year: In January, it released an ecosystem review of decentralized social media. In August, Agrawal tapped Jay Garber, a crypto developer who worked on Zcash, to lead the Bluesky team. Graber said Agrawal has been a “champion” of the team from the start.  The new CEO also led Twitter’s brand new crypto team, according to The Verge. In September, Twitter launched tipping in cryptocurrencies and verification of non-fungible tokens.  2. He led Twitter’s migration to cloud servers.  Twitter had been plagued by slow performance and difficulty in launching new features, in part because it ran all of its services and projects on its own servers. Agrawal compared Twitter’s tech to a “ball of hair” in a 2020 interview with The Information, a phrase he borrowed from Nick Tornow, a platform lead at the company.  As CTO, Agrawal spearheaded the platform’s migration to cloud servers. In 2018, Twitter migrated cold data storage and Hadoop clusters to Google Cloud. Two years later, Amazon Web Services announced it would be hosting Twitter’s timeline feature.  3. He is concerned about the ethics of tech.  In 2018, Agrawal was part of an effort to determine whether Twitter’s image cropping algorithm was racially discriminatory. During his tenure as CTO the company launched, in April, a responsible machine learning initiative. Agrawal explained his thoughts on Twitter’s responsibility for content moderation in an interview with MIT Technology review, saying that the company’s approach “is rooted in trying to avoid specific harm that misleading information can cause.”  4. He has risen quickly up Twitter’s ranks.  Agrawal started working at the company as an engineer in 2011 and became CTO in 2017. He was Twitter’s first distinguished engineer thanks to his work on revenue and consumer engineering, according to his bio on Twitter’s corporate website.  5. He doesn’t tweet much.  Agrawal is not a big tweeter. His timeline is filled mainly with retweets and comments on company policy.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/30/five-things-to-know-about-twitters-new-ceo-parag-agrawal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/581c3365889787742112ef43aba74b40a9edd833-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394362,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcDln,1638305572,Note to Brands: Crypto Isn’t Funny Money. It’s Community,"In a mysterious message over Thanksgiving weekend, the Bored Ape Yacht Club tweeted out an image of a 3D-rendered shadowy Ape, wearing pink sunglasses and a green tracksuit. It was an Adidas track suit to be specific, with a BAYC logo on the left breast.  Another popular collection, PunksComic, whose derivative comic series that comes with fractional ownership rights to 16 CryptoPunks and whose initial non-fungible token (NFT) issue sells for over $27,000 at the time of this writing shared a similar image with one of their characters.  Sam Ewen, head of CoinDesk Studios, has spent over two decades in the technology, innovation and creativity marketing industry while working with many of the top brands in the world.  Another popular NFT collector/creator named GMoney also posted an image with his trademark silhouette wearing a hoodie and a crypto wallet address printed adjacent to the Adidas trefoil icon on the garment. All tweets had the simple text “/// 👀” next to them.  This all comes after a busy past few weeks for Adidas and its full-on jump into Web 3 with a land purchase/partnership in metaverse project The Sandbox and also announcing a collaboration with Coinbase with a simple tweet using the Web 3 crypto slang phrase, “Probably nothing.” Brands fail to understand that Web 3 is about community-based ecosystems, not just financial ones. And they are talking directly to the communities and influencers, not their wallets.  Read more: Facebook Steals Another Crypto Idea for Its Nonsensical Rebrand  When AMC cinemas announced that it was starting to accept crypto for ticket sales and concessions, with a specific shoutout to dogecoin holders that it is the next crypto on the list, it got some great press and some supportive comments. However, the movie theater chain seems to have done little to build a toolset to support crypto, nor does it seem to be an active participant in being part of the larger crypto conversation. AMC did it for the eyeballs.  It is not alone. Burger King offered a rewards contest to win either one of 20 bitcoin, one of 200 ether or 1 of 2 million dogecoin, but you needed a RobinHood account to claim the rewards (a marketing partnership at its purest), and it was not very decentralized. Even when Visa bought CryptoPunk 7610 for about $150,000 in August, it barely did much with it beyond a blog post and changing its public relations Twitter handle’s profile picture for one day to the punk avatar. With the CryptoPunk floor now at over $383,000, it may be one of the few brand moves where a marketing purchase gained value after launch.  What AMC, Visa, Burger King and many others (looking at you Arizona Iced Tea, Coca-Cola, Nissan) are missing is that the true value in crypto, and especially Web 3, isn’t in purchasing a funny type of money. It’s about the community itself.  Crypto enthusiasts have always wanted to get others into the ecosystem. In 2015, I gave my daughter and nephew paper wallets with $50 in BTC on them for a Christmas gift, less because I wanted them to trade it in for cash but because I wanted them to start to see how the foundational theories around money were changing and that they could be a part of the movement, too. Brands should be looking at participation in the communities as much as they want people to participate and engage with their brands.  Whether an owner of a Bored Ape, involved in a DeFi liquidity pool or a contributor to ConstitutionDAO, people want others to “ape-in” to the projects not just because it may pump their holdings, but because they get to spend time with a larger and larger group of like-minded collectors and investors and meet others who are “in the club.”  Spend time on Discord channels and users are talking about the project details. But many are also talking about where to vacation, what books to read, cars to check out and which shows they are watching. Just like anyone who has been holding bitcoin, ether or Cardano’s ADA for a few years, when you find your people you talk crypto. But you also talk about life just as much and how this movement is changing us as individuals and as a collective.  Read more: The Bored Ape Founders Haven’t Yet Joined the Yacht Club - Jeff Wilser  What mainstream brands are also not understanding is that the creators, influencers and entrepreneurs of the future are hanging out in these communities on Discord, Telegram, Twitter and other emerging Web 3 platforms. The more the brands engage these people now, the easier it will be to know them and work with them on future brand initiatives.  A few companies seem to be approaching it the right way.  Time Magazine has truly committed to its Web 3 initiative with an active Discord channel of over 8,000 subscribers, art drops with established and emerging artists, Twitter conversations and even a kids animated series based on an NFT artists’ collection. Anheuser-Busch seems to be taking the same route with its Discord server, having almost 5,500 users and a supposed Budweiser NFT drop to come soon.

Ethereum Supply On Exchanges Continues To Go Down As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the ETH supply present on exchanges has been going down since a while now. It has now hit new lows of about 14%. The &apos;percentage supply on exchanges&apos; is an indicator that shows the share of the total Ethereum supply stored in wallets of all exchanges. Usually, this supply present on exchanges is said to be the selling supply of ETH, and so if the indicator&apos;s value goes up, it means there is a higher number of coins in the available sell supply. Due to supply-demand dynamics of the market, this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for the cryptocurrency&apos;s price. On the other hand, if the metric&apos;s value moves down, it implies the available supply of Ethereum has reduced. Prolonged such trend can create a supply shock in the market, which can turn out to be bullish for the coin&apos;s price.

42375789,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwB2HR,1638297216,"Avalanche, Layer 1 Tokens Soared in November as Ethereum Fees Drove Competition","Interest in so-called layer 1 tokens heated up during November as several top blockchain protocols pushed incentive programs, while gas fees on Ethereum network remained near all-time highs.  “Layer 1″ refers to blockchains that run independently of other blockchains – as contrasted with “layer 2″ solutions that aim to speed up transactions on existing blockchains like Ethereum.  One such blockchain, Avalanche, saw its AVAX token rise 70% in November, the top performing layer 1 platform with a market capitalization of $10 billion or greater, according to data from Messari. Among the largest cryptocurrencies, AVAX was the second-biggest gainer overall, behind Crypto.com’s CRO token, which more than tripled in price during the month.  AVAX reached an all-time high in mid-November just after announcing a partnership deal with Deloitte to build more efficient disaster-relief platforms using the Avalanche blockchain.  The platform has also announced more than $600 million of marketing initiatives and incentives recently to spur growth on the network, possibly another factor in the price uptick.  Terra’s LUNA token price  Another alternative blockchain, Terra, saw its LUNA token rise 28% on the month, followed by Solana’s SOL, which rose about 5%. Notably, the gains came during a month when bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, slid 4.5%. Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), rose 7%.  “AVAX, SOL and LUNA are rallying along with other layer 1 protocol tokens, which have made huge gains as fees on the Ethereum network remain near all time highs,” said Clara Medalie, research lead at Kaiko, a market data provider.  Research from IntoTheBlock shows that transaction fees on Ethereum have continued to increase and are around $43 as of Nov. 27. Just a year ago, fees were around $1.15.  With transaction fees continuing to increase on Ethereum, users have had to explore alternative blockchains with lower costs, according to Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds’ chief operating officer and co-founder.  Anto Paroian, chief operating officer at ARK36, a cryptocurrency investment fund, said blockchains like Solana are getting a boost because the market is betting on the gaming and play-to-earn sector to keep growing. Play-to-earn refers to video games where users can earn cryptocurrencies as rewards.  The metaverse  The Sandbox, a virtual world where players can build, own and monetize their gaming experiences using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has seen its SAND token rise 236% on the month, while MANA, the token of virtual reality platform Decentraland, is up 65%.  Play-to-earn platform Axie Infinity was down on the month by 0.41%.  “That’s why blockchains that support these coins and ecosystems - such as Solana - are seeing so much uptrend,” Paroian said.  “The amount of hype, as well as projects being built in the metaverse, gaming and NFT spaces, is bullish for these blockchains that are designed to build dapps on top of,” said Alexandre Lores, an analyst at Quantum Economics. NFT refers to non-fungible tokens, which can represent interest in property, clothing, weapons or other items within games and virtual-reality worlds. A dapp is a decentralized application built atop a blockchain, such as automated cryptocurrency lending and trading platforms.  “These spaces are poised for 10x growth in the next few years regardless of BTC price action,” he added.  Paroian said neither Solana nor Avalanche are likely to dethrone Ethereum anytime soon, but “if ETH doesn’t take care of its gas fees problem, it is running the risk of becoming less and less competitive.”  Juan Pellicer, an analyst at IntoTheBlock, noted that the market capitalization of these coins is still relatively small compared to Ethereum’s $526 billion.  Stack Funds’ Dibb expects any further downside in BTC could lead to selling pressure for AVAX and SOL, especially since they’ve been bid up so aggressively in recent months.  Polkadot’s DOT token underperforms  While most layer 1 platforms saw gains over November, polkadot (DOT), saw a steep loss of 24%.  According to Pellicer, the reasons for polkadot’s underperformance aren’t clear.  Polkadot recently launched its first parachain auctions, which saw almost $3.5 billion collected by 10 hopefuls. The first coveted Polkadot parachain slot was won by decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Acala, which edged out Moonbeam for the first slot. Parachains are the individual layer 1 blockchains that run in parallel on Polkadot.  “A reason might be that now that their parachains are released, they are gaining gaining traction slower than traders’ expectations, since they are still lacking the volume and liquidity that other blockchains are currently seeing,” said Pellicer.  Edward Moya, senior analyst at the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, noted in an interview with CoinDesk that Cardano, which underwent a major upgrade in September known as the Alonzo hard fork, has struggled to attract massive projects, and its ADA token is down 16% on the month.  “Altcoins will have a tight leash on their trades while bets on bitcoin and ethereum should remain key holdings for most crypto investors,” said Moya.",POSITIVE,AVAX | DOT | ETH | SOL,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | SOL,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/30/avalanche-layer-1-tokens-soared-in-november-as-ethereum-fees-drove-competition,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91dfd6b5818d0456c1ec13527b4bca9342dd7bb9-4082x3061.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He said Tuesday on Twitter he was stepping down as Meta’s crypto lead and leaving the company, suggesting he’d return to his “entrepreneurial” roots.  Marcus leaves the Diem project, first announced in June 2019, as it continues to face stiff regulatory headwinds.  Marcus, a former president of PayPal, first joined Facebook as the vice president of the company’s Messenger division. He was tapped to lead Facebook’s blockchain efforts in mid-2018.  Libra, initially an ambitious plan to make sending money across borders as easy as sending a text, was immediately met with scrutiny following its 2019 announcement. Marcus was the face of Facebook on Capitol Hill as the company sought the blessing of U.S. regulators before launching.  Plans for Libra were scaled back through a series of cuts and the exodus of key corporate backers before being rebranded as Diem. Last month, Novi, the Meta-owned crypto wallet subsidiary, launched a pilot project that relied on the Paxos-administered USDP stablecoin instead of diem. Even this scaled-down pilot was met with hostility from lawmakers.

42417101,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4oRh,1638294783,7 Wild Scenarios for the Future of Money,"Some predictions about the future of money are cautious, sensible, sober and grounded. These are not. To open our minds as to what the future might bring, we chucked the usual concepts like “most likely” or “bet on this.” Instead we wondered, what are some dark horse scenarios that maybe, just maybe, could revolutionize the way we think about money?  Here the focus is more on fun than functional, more possible than probable. Then again, we now live in a world where cartoon apes sell for $2.6 million, memes about dogs are worth billions, and a sovereign nation accepts bitcoin as legal tender.  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  1. Risk becomes tokenized  What if we could tokenize risk? If we do this in a clever way, we could reduce the overall risk in the system and avoid meltdowns like the financial crisis of 2008, says Ashleigh Schap, a decentralized finance (DeFi) investor and adviser at Uniswap, a decentralized trading platform.  Here’s how to think about it. Imagine if you, as an individual, have tokens that represent each of your risks and liabilities. A token for your car loan. A token for your home mortgage. A token for your leveraged margin trading account. If you roll up all of your individual risk tokens, that would give you a sense of your total risk.  Now zoom out the lens. Imagine aggregating all of the risk tokens by each person in the community, and then an entire industry, or even the entire economy. Because these tokens are all smart contracts – programmable money – this would let you “build risk into the system in a more fundamental way,” says Schap.  She contrasts this to the constraints of traditional finance, most famously in the collapse of 2008, where each company had its own siloed view of risk but they lacked a holistic picture of the overall risk to the system. By tokenizing risk? You can snap all the puzzle pieces together, and “smart contracts can basically assess the entire picture.”  Read more: The Future of Money: 20 Predictions  2. Cars spend money and buy their own insurance  Way back in February of this year, Elizabeth Stark, head of Lightning Labs, gave me this prediction: “Machines will pay machines, natively, instantly … Teslas will pay for charging with Lightning!”  That’s just one example. The possibilities are endless. “Imagine a machine at a factory, if it runs out of ink, it can order more,” says Schap. She then gives a spicier scenario. “Maybe you have a car or a truck that’s able to buy its own insurance,” she says. Perhaps the car has the ability to assess risk and make smart decisions. “If it’s raining, it buys a little more insurance,” says Schap.  She notes that in our current world, whenever you buy car insurance, “you’re paying for the insurance every day, even when you’re not driving the car.” You have a busy life. You don’t have time to deal with insurance companies every month, much less every day. But imagine if the car could constantly survey the risks – weather, traffic conditions, even neighborhood – and make constant tweaks to your insurance? (Just before it becomes fully sentient and dominates the world.)  3. You will pay for things without thinking about it at all  This could be here sooner than you think. A couple of weeks ago, I went to a Denver Broncos football game. The stadium had a beer stand that looks teleported from the future: First you scan your credit card, then you go through a turnstile to enter a room full of coolers. You take whatever beer you want, then you leave. No scanning of UPC codes. No interacting with any humans. As the attendant explained to me, an elaborate network of cameras and GPS micro-sensors ensures that you are charged for the correct number of beers.  Tarun Chitra, CEO and co-founder of Gauntlet and General Partner at Robot Ventures, imagines a shopping experience like this in the future but without credit cards, wallets or even phones. It will be driven by cryptocurrency and stablecoins – not a centralized player like Amazon – and somehow it protects privacy. “You go pick up your items and walk out,” says Chitra. You have an agreement with the grocery store, for example, where “you can automatically charge me if it’s less than $100.”  Read more: The Future of Money: A History - Dan Jeffries  4. The price of your dinner will be in sats  The idea of “buying a coffee with bitcoin” is now something of a punchline, at least in developed economies like the United States. But it will happen eventually, says Cory Klippsten, founder of Swan Bitcoin (and author of an op-ed for this “Future of Money” series). “The medium of exchange for bitcoin will not take off,” says Klippsten, “until a lot of people hold the majority of their net worth in bitcoin.” His logic? It makes no sense to spend your bitcoin “unless you have nothing else to spend.” And he thinks this scenario is inevitable.  “Nobody wants to spend bitcoin. It’s the best risk-to-reward bet in history,” says Klippsten. And yet. As a bit of foreshadowing for what the mainstream world could look like, he points to the precedent of OG bitcoiners who have the majority of their assets in BTC. They got rich off bitcoin. They HODLed their bitcoin. But at some point, inevitably, when push comes to shove, they need to spend at least some of their BTC to do things like buy a car or a yacht.  Klippsten predicts that bitcoin as a store of value will become so widespread, and so ubiquitous, that eventually people will need to spend their assets. He imagines a chart with two “S curves”: one for the adoption of bitcoin as a store of value and then one with bitcoin as medium of exchange. (S curve: It starts out gradual and flat, then dramatically shoots up, then goes flat again.) “We’re still on the flat part of the S curve for store of value,” he says, and when that skyrockets, people will then hop over to the medium of exchange S curve. He scribbles out a quick drawing on our call, and literally two hours after we spoke, he formalized the graphic and tweeted the following:  The upshot of all this? “By 2035, most goods and services in most places in the world will be denominated in Satoshis,” says Klippsten. He clarifies that the dollar and other fiat currencies will still likely exist, which means that you might see multiple prices on items, just like you do at international airports. The implication, of course, is that the price of BTC would soar in value. Klippsten’s guess: “The chance of bitcoin being less than $1 million in nine years is infinitesimally small.”  5. Tokens make cash go away  First, imagine a world where tokens are ubiquitous. As Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, envisions in CoinDesk’s 20 Predictions, “I believe every company in the world will have a token in its capital structure in the next five-to-ten years.” These tokens are hybrids. They’re part quasi-equity, part loyalty program, and they’ll grow in value if the company becomes more valuable.  Then he takes the logic one step further. “We’ll also begin to see the digitization of illiquid real-world assets, like your home equity, your car, and your jewelry, as well as tokens that represent future liabilities like university tuition tokens and health care tokens.”  Here’s the kicker. Once every asset becomes digitized and liquid, says Dorman, “You’ll never need to own cash ever again. You’ll be able to stay 100% invested at all times, borrow against your assets as needed, and pay for common goods using your investments since they will be spendable blockchain-based assets. By bridging the gap between investment vehicle and payment vehicle, digital assets will ultimately eliminate the need for an asset that functions purely as money.”  Read more: Who Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z. Morris  6. Your house is a bank  This is an offshoot of the “cars can buy insurance” scenario, with a twist. If you’ve been in crypto for more than five minutes, you’ve heard the phrase “be your own bank.” But Chitra wonders, what if your house could be its own bank? Or your car? He notes that in the crypto world, thanks to the magic of liquidity pools in DeFi, “everyone can be a lender if they want to be.”  Not only could everyone be a lender but potentially everything. “It could be the IoT [Internet of Things] device, it could be your car, whatever, it could be a building.” In today’s world, using something like a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) to borrow against your building is a manual, tedious, torturous process that involves lots of banking. “That will become almost instant,” says Chitra, “as every building can become its own bank.”  And in the true spirit of this exercise, Chitra lobs another thought experiment: “The richest entity of the world becomes a broken Tesla.” The Tesla breaks, it can’t work and it can’t earn fees in the future where it gets paid for being an Uber. In the process, the Tesla somehow realizes that “the only thing it can do with its money is trade.” Because the broken Tesla can’t do anything else, it slowly learns to trade, it excels, it becomes a super trader, and “you have this rags to riches story.”  Think that scenario is out there? Buckle up for the final one.  7. Money goes intergalactic  “Galaxy Brain” doesn’t do this scenario justice. It is literally inter-galaxy brain. Schap clarifies that this scenario is far, far, far out in the future, but thinks that “assuming we continue to develop technologically, and if we manage to become space navigators – and we’re headed in that direction – money will need to change, because time will change.” She then suggests an idea inspired by the sci-fi novel “Neptune’s Brood,” from Charles Stross.  If we’re trying to travel to another galaxy that’s 400 light years away, as Schap explains, “money will mean something very different when you get to that very faraway place.” Decades, centuries, or millennia might pass while you make the journey from Earth to another corner of the universe. What if money could somehow incorporate properties that would account for these dramatic changes in time?  “I think you’ll have difference classes of money,” says Schap. “You’ll have immediate money that you’ll spend on a planet.” Then there’s “medium-term” money, which would be “useful somewhere in our galaxy.” The final class is what Schap calls long-term “slow money,” which “is much more valuable, but the reason is slow is that it has to move across space and time in an interesting way.”  Coming soon, on Coinbase.

To avoid the drudgery of carrying buckets of water down castle stairs to fill a cauldron, Mickey dons his master’s magic hat and animates a broom to do his chore for him. The rodent dozes off, then awakens to find the anthropomorphic broom has been following his instructions all too literally, with disastrous results.  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  Skeptics of the idea of programmable money see similar risks in entrusting financial activities to code.  For one thing, hackers have drained some $685 million from various decentralized finance (DeFi) systems over the last 18 months, according to The Block, showing that at a minimum code needs to be thoroughly inspected before deployment.  Yet, to Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, software bugs aren’t the half of it.  While cryptocurrency was born partly as a rebellion against the bailouts that followed the financial crisis of 2008, Kelly sees the ultimate lesson of that era as the need for the discretion that smart contracts remove.  Read more: Who Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z. Morris  CoinDesk recently chatted with Kelly about why he thinks programmable money is a boon during normal times, why it could create problems in market calamities and the difficulty of creating “kill switches’' for when things go awry. A lightly edited transcript of that conversation follows.  CoinDesk: When you consider the idea of programmable money, contracts that are set out in code rather than executed by humans, what do you see as the potential benefits? And what do you see as the downsides?  Steven Kelly: It’s sort of my natural inclination to split things into peacetime versus crisis time.  In peacetime, this is an unequivocal good. You’re just talking about faster, cheaper payments [and] less discretion, which means less room for human biases, less room for human error. Of course, this introduces all the [risk] of coding errors and protocol vulnerabilities, but since we’re talking about the future of money, we’re kind of assuming that gets worked out. And so you have the potential to streamline things, have payments happen when they’re supposed to happen, as opposed to “after forms get filled out and people press buttons and so-and-so gets back from vacation and remembers to return your call” and things like that.  There’s a huge potential in financial markets, as well. For instance, part of the disruption of March 2020 was literally people just going into their home offices where it’s a different phone number, and the trades just weren’t happening as quickly because people literally weren’t answering phones. Those kinds of things can happen in peacetime, too, because somebody’s on vacation or just because legacy systems are slower. [Processes] can be quickened and made more efficient, and you reduce the cost, basically, of the float.  But in crisis time, I get nervous. I get nervous about this idea because I’m dubious of the notion that you can pre-program all the exigencies that may occur in a crisis cycle.  In my Twitter thread from Sept. 21 on the systemic risk of smart contracts, for instance, some of the pushback [amounted to], “We in crypto, we programmers, we’re thinking about this, and we know that we need central actors, sometimes, in crisis. We can code in certain contingencies when certain things happen in the market, outside of, you know, x range or whatever.”  And I just don’t buy that at all. I believe what they’re saying. I don’t believe it’s enough.  Read more: The Future of Money: 20 Predictions  The stock market peak in 2007 was after the failure of the Bear Stearns hedge funds [one of the earliest signs that the U.S. subprime mortgage market was unraveling]. You just can’t program in, “OK, if the market’s doing this, then this is going to happen.” You can, to some degree, but you’re always going to miss the next crisis. You can’t preprogram the exigencies of a crisis.  We as a society have decided, when it’s war time we sort of let these failures slide, they sort of have a public good purpose. Like I had mentioned in my thread, banks used to just stop giving you your money back in a crisis. You’d go to get your deposit and they would say, “sorry.” That was not legal. It was never legal. And when this went to court [for example, in 1857, in the case of Livingston v. Bank of New York], the courts basically just said, “Well, if everybody’s doing it, then we’re not going to let one bank be charged for this.” Because basically the courts understood the exigencies of a crisis. And we sort of let illegal things happen for the greater systemic good. And that’s the kind of discretion that is sort of antithetical to smart contracts and programmable money.  Read more: The Future of Money: A History - Dan Jeffries  Yet, if these exigencies aren’t programmed in, and people get their money out, doesn’t that get us through the crisis faster? Wouldn’t it be better to just force us to rip the Band-Aid off?  No, that’s just incredibly costly. There are incredible costs to financial crises and bankruptcies and disruptions to the financial system functioning. Because we can say, “This is a bad bank, we want it to go away, we want a good bank to come up in its place.” But in the time between a good bank, with lots of information about customers, failing, and a new bank arising, and re-gathering all that information about those customers and they can then make loans ... that’s incredibly damaging [to have a lapse in lending activity]. So we want to let those banks fail if they’re insolvent, but we don’t want to do that like that [snaps fingers]. If Lehman could have failed over the course of a year, that would have been great. At least in isolation, it would have calmed [the markets].  That being said, I think there is some nuance to this. Because another thing that happens in a crisis is that once an institution is stigmatized, or maybe they’re the main focus of the media as an institution that’s going to falter, they start getting collateral calls. Let’s say you’re Bear Stearns and you’re in the news now and your liquidity is in question. If I’m a counterparty to Bear Stearns, nothing has necessarily changed in the market other than I’m hearing this news about Bear Stearns. I’m going to go to Bear Stearns and say, “Hey, you know what? I don’t like your marks. Now I want a little bit more collateral.” And if you’re Bear Stearns and you refuse, well, then the next headline is “BEAR STEARNS CAN’T MAKE COLLATERAL CALL.”  And the news story will cite “people familiar with the situation.”  Right! [Laughs] So there’s an advantage to smart contracts here. This is the other side of it. Bear can say, “Well, our smart contract’s handling that. Nothing has changed in the market, our [credit default swap] is here, and the collateral is here, so this is what the margin call is, and you can’t refute that.” So there’s this sort of give-and-take, because as soon as a player is weak, markets will say, “Okay, let’s get some collateral from them, because we know they can’t refuse. And let’s stop paying our margin calls on our other trades with them [where] we owe them some collateral, and let’s conserve our collateral. And let’s just start making calls and make sure they can still meet those calls.”  Is there any kind of a hybrid model that you could foresee where you would get these benefits in normal times, while mitigating the downsides in times of stress?  You know, it’s really hard because, like I said, none of this is formalized. We sort of let illegal things happen. No one is going to formalize, “when [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome] Powell says it’s okay to do illegal things, you can do illegal things”! So it’s very hard to formalize ex ante. So I just worry that [a crisis involving smart contracts] will unfold too fast, ex post [facto], before we can be ready for it.  I don’t want to stifle this innovation either. And I think there are huge benefits to be had. I want the central bank and others to be able to keep up, and these financial institutions. That’s the other thing: It’s not just crisis-fighter discretion. It’s crisis fighters within private institutions. It’s Goldman Sachs who gets to choose to ignore emails and not answer phone calls. And we kind of like that as a society.  A lot of the conversation now with programmability has to do with central bank digital currencies (CBDC). Couldn’t presumably a central bank have some kind of a kill switch, so contracts would be automated but there would be a “break the glass” option?  This is another thing that comes up even from DeFi folks. They say, “we have some sort of centralization in a crisis. Put in somebody who’s operating a kill switch, and they only get this discretion in a crisis.” But the problem, and this is a little bit of an irony, is that you need some decentralization. Yes, you can give that kill switch to the Fed. But Goldman is never going to go to the Fed and say, “Hey, we really can’t make a margin call today. Can you flip the kill switch on Citigroup for 48 hours and buy us some time?” That’s never going to happen. But if Goldman does it, then we all just kind of look the other way. And, and we say, “oh, you know, the marks were bad.”  Even accounting itself can be complicated, because stuff that’s marked to market all the time, it’s been marked to the price it’s trading at, in a crisis, all of a sudden [the banks holding the assets] will say, “You know? We’re not going to mark this to market any more, we’re going to re-evaluate this.” We see huge chunks of assets move from the trading book to the held-to-maturity book, which are accounted for differently. Another thing we see is [assets classified as] Level 1, which is “we take a market price, and that’s how we keep it on our books,” move it into Level 3, which is like mark-to-model. “We decided that the prices aren’t representative and we want to mark [the asset] to our model.”  The other thing that happens is the FASB [Financial Accounting Standards Board] comes out and says, “You know what? You guys don’t have to mark it to market so much. Don’t worry about it. If it’s illiquid, we’re going to change our standards. Here’s some new guidance.” And all that gets lost, you know, if it’s all pre-programmed.  Like I said, even in a crisis, there are pros and cons to this. Because in a purely programmed world you can’t prey on the weak advantageously as a counterparty, but also the strong can’t further draw a moat around themselves.

42407263,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVFWWr,1638290627,Ethereum in 2022: What Is Money in the Metaverse?,"Ethereum is a smart-contract blockchain focused on building a secure, decentralized environment to host applications of all types. The past year, decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) have taken the stage to show the world the possibilities that can arise from blockchain technology. However, scalability products that can increase performance in response to changes in processing demands are starting to unlock the vast potential Ethereum holds, and its co-creator, Vitalik Buterin, has his eyes set on decentralizing social media, gaming, governance and more.  In its infancy, Ethereum has largely become host to marketplaces for trading and lending crypto assets (Uniswap and Aave) and buying or selling digital art (OpenSea). The introduction of second-layer platforms built on top of Ethereum, like Arbitrum and Optimism, and technological solutions like ZK rollups, will drag down transaction fees and open Ethereum to decentralized social media platforms like Reddit.  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  The common theme among all use cases will be the need for users to own and spend Ethereum’s native asset, ether.  Ether is the key to unlocking blockspace on the Ethereum network, whether that includes deploying new applications, using existing applications or sending tokens between different wallets. The native asset is to the network what gas is to a car. Post-EIP 1559, blockspace consumers buy and burn the asset to participate in the digital economy. In the near future, ether will also be used to stake and secure the network.  Read More: The Evolution of Ethereum’s Monetary Policy  Arising from its usefulness as gas, ether has become a unit of account and the most common pairing on decentralized exchanges (DEX).  What is money in the metaverse?  If Ethereum, alternative base layer protocols (i.e., Solana and Avalanche) and “the metaverse” are ultimately successful, the definition of money will become much broader than its fiat limitation today. We are already seeing protocols raising capital, and investors measuring their portfolios against ether instead of dollars or even stablecoins (tokens pegged to the value of a fiat currency). However, the use of ether as money does not discredit fiat, stablecoins and other stores of value. It is simply a complement – and one that could potentially become a currency of the metaverse.  Read More: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Crypto assets, including ether, are still much more reflexive to demand than stablecoins and dollars, making them a better investment than a currency (for now). However, the larger the Ethereum ecosystem grows, the better the currency ether becomes.  Currently, speculators far outweigh actual blockchain users, but a blossoming ecosystem is changing that as ether can be used for DeFi, NFTs, validation, social media and more. In fact, in Coinbase’s Q3 earnings report, the company highlighted that it has seen a major shift toward people actually making use of blockchain technology by taking their tokens off exchanges.  The chart below shows how on-chain users have grown alongside new Coinbase accounts, signaling users are genuinely interested in interacting with applications on Ethereum. Cheaper alternatives to the Ethereum mainnet, or live version, have gained even more traction, with Polygon flipping mainnet in active users for a single day early in October. Additionally, Arbitrum has onboarded 275,000 users looking for cheaper blockchain interactions.  Tokenization of assets and composability between DeFi applications are just beginning to create open, tradable markets for assets that were once illiquid. Assets that can be traded against each other, used as collateral or sent to any part of the world in an instant, start to behave a lot more like money than property or stores of value.  According to Julien Bouteloup, founder of Stake Capital and core developer at decentralized exchange Curve, the Web 3 workforce has shown significant interest in being paid in token equity over stablecoins. While this could be a side effect of the bull market and rising valuations, employees are likely genuinely interested in being an owner of the projects on which they work.  What’s next for the value of ether?  Play-to-earn gaming has likely just started, and Ronin-based NFT game Axie Infinity is already generating billions of dollars in annualized revenue. Users throughout the world are living off income from the game, with revenue making up a notable piece of the Philippines’ gross domestic product. The connection between gaming and finance is growing closer, highlighting just one aspect of a more digitalized world.  Read more from “Future of Money Week”: Who Sets the Rules for Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z Morris  If today’s trends are carried into tomorrow’s future, the world will be more financialized than ever. It’s too early to tell whether this will be a net positive for humanity, but crypto and DeFi have given a glimpse into the good and bad that come with tokenization.  Airdrops and equity distribution (when done correctly) have distributed wealth much more freely and fairly than corporations have done, historically. However, the other side is equally true as scams and exploits show how greed can be magnified through tokenization and the anonymous economy.  For good or bad, the definition of money will continue to become murkier as the digital economy grows, just as it did with the creation of credit cards and online payments and the move away from paper money. This fits perfectly with the narrative of the metaverse, where the line between the digital world and real life becomes thinner and thinner.

This is the second time in November that LUNA has logged a new all-time high. At press time, LUNA was changing hands at $57.63, up 11% in the past 24 hours, according to data from Messari.  LUNA is part of an algorithmic balancing system that helps stablecoins running on the Terra blockchain maintain parity with fiat currencies. One of the major developments from the network’s Columbus-5 upgrade in October is a new design for keeping stablecoins pegged to their fiat value: whenever UST is minted, LUNA with the same amount of value is burned.  According to data from Terra Analytics, more than 92 million LUNA tokens have been burnedhttps://terra.smartstake.io/history since the Columbus-5 upgrade went into effect at the end of September.  “LUNA’s price is a function of UST demand,” said Jeremy Ong, vice president of business operations at crypto research firm Delphi Digital. “As UST demand goes up, LUNA’s price also goes up.”  Not just UST  But Ong said a number of incentive programs from Terra-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are also a factor.  Abracadabra.Money, a multi-chain decentralized lending platform, launched a yield-earning product for non-interest-bearing tokens called Degenbox earlier this month. The product first allowed users to deposit UST as collateral in order to receive yields.  Another shot in the arm for LUNA’s price may be a so-called lockdrop event from Astroport, a decentralized exchange protocol on Terra, Ong said.  Astroport will launch the lockdrop event on Dec. 6, allowing users to lock their LUNA tokens in exchange for a “drop” of the protocol’s own not-live-yet ASTRO tokens, according to the project’s Medium page.  “People are trying to get more LUNA for Astroport’s lockdrop,” Ong said.  Terra is the fifth-largest smart contract platform by total value locked (TVL) at $11.87 billion, according to data from DeFi Llama. TVL is the total value of the cryptocurrency committed to DeFi protocols that are built on a given blockchain.

Minutes of the most recent meeting between the Premier League and fan representatives reveal the league is considering getting involved in NFTs, with sources saying the League’s approach will be “slow and cautious,” and different from the fan engagement model provided by a platform such as Socios, The Times reported Monday.  Several Premier League teamshave launched tokens on the Socios platform, which fans can purchase to receive prizes, access special experiences or vote on minor club decisions.  The Premier League may instead be looking to follow in the footsteps of Spain’s La Liga, which partnered with French digital soccer collectibles platform Sorare in September to offer NFTs of all players in the league for fans to trade and play in fantasy tournaments.  Across the pond in the U.S. , the National Basketball Association and National Football League both have deals to create officially licensed NFTs through Dapper Labs, while Major League Baseball has partnered with Topps.  Investigating crypto’s ties to the Premier League  The minutes of the recent meeting also reveal the Premier League will investigate the growing links between Premier League clubs and crypto companies, with Chief Executive Richard Masters “committed to looking into the issue.”  Watford’s official shirt sponsor is crypto betting firm Stake.com, which also includes the dogecoin logo adorning the players’ shirt sleeves. Meanwhile, Southampton’s training uniform is sponsored by educational side Learn Crypto, which itself is partly funded by Watford’s previous sponsor, crypto-friendly online betting platform Sportsbet.io. Crypto exchange CoinJar is also one of the sponsors of Brentford.  Fan representatives have expressed concern that the visibility of such companies around Premier League clubs will draw fans to invest in crypto and lead them to lose their money.

42375779,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwB28d,1638290142,Bitcoin Turns Lower as Fed Chair Suggests Inflation No Longer ‘Transitory’,"Bitcoin turned lower along with U.S. stocks after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday it may be time to retire the term “transitory” as a way of describing inflation.  Over the past seven months, Powell and other officials at the U.S. central bank have repeatedly used that term to suggest that the forces driving recent consumer-price increases might abate as the economy accelerates from coronavirus-related lockdowns.  So the shift in messaging by Powell, during testimony before a U.S. Senate panel, might signal that authorities now see the inflationary pressures as longer-lasting – potentially indicating that the central bank might be less willing to continue the loose monetary policies that have buoyed markets for risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  “It is time to retire the word ‘transitory’ regarding inflation,” Powell said during the hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.  Bitcoin’s price slid to about $57,000 as of press time, down from about $58,500 before the hearing started.  Bitcoin as inflation hedge – and risky asset  The largest cryptocurrency is viewed by many investors as a hedge against inflation – based on the idea that its supply is tightly controlled by the programming built into the underlying blockchain. That hard-coded process is contrasted with the human-decided monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which has ballooned its balance sheet to about $8.7 trillion, more than double where it stood in early 2020.  But bitcoin is also seen as a risky asset, so there’s also a view among traders that loose monetary policies encourage investors to make bigger speculative bets. A reversal of these “dovish” policies might prove a tailwind for bitcoin.  At a Fed meeting earlier this month, Powell and other officials announced a plan to “taper” their $120 billion of monthly bond purchases – a form of monetary stimulus – by $15 billion a month.  The announcement was seen as an acknowledgement that officials needed to move sooner rather than later to tamp down inflation.  6.2% in October  Since April Federal Reserve officials have been attributing fast-rising consumer prices to “transitory” factors that ostensibly would dissipate once the economy normalized.  But inflation has continued to rise - with the closely-tracked Consumer Price Index climbing 6.2% in October compared with 12 months earlier. That was the highest pace in three decades, and economists were quick to warn that the price increases weren’t likely to reverse anytime soon.  In prepared remarks ahead of the Senate hearing, Powell said that “most forecasters, including at the Fed, continue to expect that inflation will move down significantly over the next year as supply and demand imbalances abate.“  During the live hearing on Tuesday, Powell acknowledged economists’ recent predictions that the Fed may need to accelerate the tapering of its monthly bond purchases – to keep inflation from overheating. The U.S. central bank’s final monetary-policy meeting of this year is scheduled for Dec. 14-15.  “It is appropriate, I think, for us to discuss at our next meeting, which is in a couple of weeks, whether it will be appropriate to wrap up our purchases a few months earlier,” Powell said Tuesday, according to according to Bloomberg News.  Bitcoin and omicron  In the prepared remarks, Powell addressed the growing concerns about the recently-emerged omicron variant of the coronavirus.  “It is difficult to predict the persistence and effects of supply constraints, but it now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year,” Powell said. “In addition, with the rapid improvement in the labor market, slack is diminishing, and wages are rising at a brisk pace.”  The upshot could be mixed for bitcoin: Rising prices could bolster the cryptocurrency’s appeal as an inflation hedge, but a more hawkish monetary policy on the part of the Fed might prove a headwind.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/30/bitcoin-turns-lower-as-fed-chair-suggests-inflation-no-longer-transitory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/391391b7b56c26853048f1528aaca42400479f7b-1315x985.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

NYDIG opened the fund on Nov. 16 and a single investor contributed the full amount. The firm plans to leave the fund open indefinitely.  NYDIG launched its first digital asset funds late last year when the NYDIG Digital Assets Fund I raised $50 million and the NYDIG Digital Assets Fund II raised $100 million from institutional investors. Fund I invested entirely in bitcoin, but it’s not clear if that’s the case for the latest fund.  The NYDIG funds tend to attract investors with deep pockets. The first digital asset fund included two backers and the second had one investor.  NYDIG, a subsidiary of Stone Ride Holdings, has longstanding ties with traditional financial institutions. Earlier this year, NYDIG partnered with NCR to make crypto purchases available to 650 banks and financial institutions. U.S. Bank recently introduced a cryptocurrency custody program with NYDIG as its backer.  Crypto fund launches have accelerated this year as digital asset prices rally. Earlier this month, Paradigm, the firm from Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia partner Matt Huang, announced a $2.5 billion fund, the largest ever in the crypto industry.

Safle, a next-generation non-custodial wallet, is one of the projects currently leveraging blockchain to bring identities back to the hands of users. Unlike the centralized and federated identity models, the Safle ecosystem introduces decentralized identities, giving crypto users control over their identities and data. While the crypto market has grown exponentially, users have limited options of non-custodial wallets. Meanwhile, the ones that exist have proven to fall short in some areas. For starters, most of the current non-custodial wallets are limited to specific blockchain networks, making it hard to transfer assets across multiple chains. They also face major security issues that have exposed DApps and crypto users to malicious attacks in the past. Safle is designed as a decentralized blockchain identity wallet consisting of other Web3 infrastructures that support DApp development and integration with multiple blockchain networks. The Safle ecosystem seeks to solve the existing pains in the digital identity niche, creating a frictionless experience for cryptocurrency users and developers to build on decentralized infrastructures. Dating back to 2019, the primary goal of Safle is to give users back what is rightfully theirs: security and privacy.

42375783,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwB2CP,1638288333,Kimbal Musk’s Big Green DAO Is a Big Step for Web 3,"On the heels of a $40 million experiment that caught mainstream media attention, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are taking another step into mass consciousness today as Kimbal Musk – the billionaire Tesla board member and brother of fellow entrepreneur Elon Musk – is announcing the opening of membership applications for Big Green DAO, a Web 3 charity focusing on food justice.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Musk said that one of the goals of the charity is to overhaul the philanthropy industry with the use of blockchain-based tooling – a sector he believes is plagued by inefficiencies.  Big Green is also launching at a time when DAOs appear poised to follow non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as the next blockchain tech-based acronym to enter the public conversation. Search engine interest in the organizations, nominally leaderless online investment collectives that are jokingly referred to as “group chats with a bank account,” is at a multiyear high following the capers of ConstitutionDAO, a collective of 17,000 donors who raised millions in an attempt to purchase a rare print of the U.S. Constitution.  Read more: After Being Foiled by a Billionaire, ConstitutionDAO Faces Lingering Questions  In light of the sudden scrutiny, Musk’s experiment is a daring step from a public figure risking personal and professional reputation to embrace an often sneered-upon technology, and a validation for the many developers and builders who have advanced DAO tooling in recent years.  First steps  Musk’s venture into blockchain began in earnest “a year ago,” spurred on by other billionaires – including his sibling, who was recently, and perhaps incorrectly, crowned richest man in the world – getting involved in bitcoin.  “There was Michael Saylor’s loud-and-proud investment, followed by my brother’s decision to participate at Tesla, and I’m on the board at Tesla – just as a responsible board member I had to spend more time on it,” he said in an interview.  Quickly he determined that crypto can be divided into two camps: what he calls the “speculators” and “the religious.”  “The religious are awesome,” he told CoinDesk. “They are total believers that this will decentralize the world, change governance, bring power back to the masses. It’s a beautiful conversation when you’re connected to someone religious about it.”  Nonetheless, the speculative noise – what the DAO scholar Paul Dylan-Ennis refers to as “the moat of trash” – nearly turned him off on the sector. Musk emphasized that he largely doesn’t even like investing his money in the stock market, and it was only the true believers that “kept him digging.”  “When someone is religious about something, I need to find out why. There’s some bad religions out there, but for the most part, there’s usually something underneath it all tying people together,” he said.  The thing tying people together in Web 3, according to Musk, is primarily community creation.  “It’s community like I’ve never seen it before. I’m a restaurant guy in my non-tech life, and I love that it brings people together, so that kept me interested. And the fact that it decentralizes power – that’s interesting to me. I’ve always had a healthy disrespect for the authorities,” he said.  Crypto influence  Once Musk decided to start a Web 3 community of his own, he sought to surround himself with advisors both from the cryptosphere and from traditional finance.  While early conversations with crypto natives (including members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT community, whom he speaks fondly of) steered him toward projects that would create speculative assets – using an NFT drop to raise funds for charity, for instance – Musk’s initial focus for his Big Green DAO venture is on pure philanthropy.  His right-hand man in the effort is Matthew Markman, a Ph.D. candidate and a “DAO facilitator” for metaverse gaming community Decentraland, as well as a project manager and community moderator for two other projects – one of Web 3′s many prolific, assiduous polymaths.  Markman and Musk were connected via a mutual friend, Bear Kittay, a Web 3 investor and former Burning Man spokesperson. From there, the project’s network of crypto advisors grew to include Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, venture capital maven Vinny Lingham, frequent DAO contributor Priyanka Desai and ConsenSys executive Mike Kriak, among others.  Musk reports being “overwhelmed” with the “positive energy” he’s received from the crypto community.  “It’s not normal for me to have that degree of a warm welcome. The amount of people who would spend 20 hours on a whitepaper, just so my reputation wouldn’t be hurt – it’s my reputation! I thought that was very cool,” he said.  Architecture  So far, the public response to Big Green DAO, whose white paper was released last week, has been overwhelmingly positive.  “In the past few days when we released it, we expected trolls to go nuts. I don’t think we got a single Twitter troll. For me, I get involved in a lot of things – cool, world-positive things – and you always get trolls. Not one,” beamed Musk.  According to Markman, the DAO’s architecture is the product of significant research, and it largely builds on preexisting models.  “I drew a lot from Decentraland DAO, I was looking at Uniswap, I was looking at Olympus DAO, I was just looking at every single DAO I could come across, their voting processes and their structures, to figure out what would work best for us,” said Markman.  The DAO leverages a multi-tier system including an executive committee and a broader voting community.  At the advice of project advisor and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, the DAO took steps to ensure it could remain registered as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. This means the DAO is under the purview of a legal entity’s charter, which requires the group to focus on food justice, and the executive committee can vote down spurious proposals to ensure compliance.  When it comes to voting on grants distribution, however, power is largely in the hands of DAO members, and Markman is aiming to experiment with ranked-choice voting (which involves tinkering with DAO voting platform Snapshot’s base functionalities with a homebrewed user interface).  Read more: Popular DAO Voting Platform Snapshot Labs Raises $4M  “The goal was to make a DAO that would have a flexible, agile process that we can’t have in our material voting systems. It’s difficult to say, change how we vote on one issue in our everyday voting, where in a DAO we can program different ways to vote for different systems,” Markman said.  One of the greatest challenges Markman anticipates is going to be initiating food justice workers in the tenets of Web 3.  “We’re going to have more surprises than you see in a lot of DAOs because we don’t have a social context going into it. We’re bringing in a lot of people who are distributed from a different space, and they’re not used to organizing online. We have to develop the social structures as we’re developing the social and governance structures,” he said.  However, the ultimate goal of the project is to enable frontline food justice workers to choose not just who gets the money, but also who gets the power in the organization.  Said Musk: “The core appeal of a DAO is a thesis: If we put the grant-making authority in the hands of the frontlines will it make a bigger impact than keeping the decision-making centralized?”  Tested theories  For crypto natives, Musk’s thesis has already largely been proven true.  In 2019, MolochDAO – a DAO designed to raise and distribute funds from ecosystem contributors for Ethereum infrastructure – led to a resurgence of interest in the tooling and design space in the wake of the collapse of The DAO, a 2016 cooperative investment experiment.  MolochDAO has since been repeatedly forked, leading to successful organizations such as MetaCartel and The LAO, and ultimately spurring a DAO renaissance that has continued into 2021.  More recently, the Gitcoin DAO has successfully distributed over $40 million in grants for public goods infrastructure based on community voting.  Early DAO pioneers, such as MolochDAO’s Ameen Soleimani, say that DAO infrastructure is ideal for charitable organizations because of the transparency of voting and use of funds, the lack of operational overhead, and the ability for groups to quickly reach and act on consensus.  Read more: DAOs May Be the Future of Work, but Don’t Bet on Them Being the Next Big Asset Class  That transparency and direct funding are exactly the qualities Big Green DAO is looking to bring to real-world philanthropy.  “The majority of funds in philanthropy end up going towards expenses with giving and accepting money. There’s so much excess waste in paying for procedures and bureaucracy,” said Markman.  Empathy without ego  Ultimately, Musk is hoping Big Green DAO can overhaul the structure of real-world philanthropy – a sector that accounts for $800 billion in annual of giving that he and Markman see as ripe for disruption.  “I’ve been to the Gates Foundation in Seattle – it’s like the United Nations. It’s the biggest building in the city. It’s got thousands of people who work there. I do think they have good intentions, but they’re spending a fortune on their overhead, and there isn’t a lot of transparency,” said Musk.  Musk noted that “it’s Bill’s money, so whatever” and that he doesn’t want to criticize the charitable work of others, but DAOs offer a leaner, alternative model.  “Why do we need an office? We’re so decentralized that we couldn’t fill one,” he said.  Markman also took aim at the “ego bloat” that comes with big-budget, big-name giving. Not only can “we can take out a lot of the middlemen,” but DAO-based charities can also decentralize away the shadow of a megadonor founder.  “The idea in the 2000s was a lean startup, and what we’re doing here is trying to create a lean organization,” said Markman.  ‘It will work’  Big Green DAO’s initial efforts are scheduled to last a year and distribute over $1 million in funds. After that point, Musk and his team will pause and assess to what degrees the DAO structure has allowed the organization to reach its goals.  “We’ve given ourselves an out to say, ‘This experiment didn’t work,’ but we feel very bullish that it will work,” he said. “To be clear, this is an experiment. If this doesn’t work, we’ll go back to the drawing board and try it a different way.”  He noted that he’s committed to seeing his thesis play out, and that if the DAO fails for any reason the team will continue to tinker with the mechanics rather than abandon the tools.  According to Markman, it’s a coming-out moment for DAOs and the DAO community, which has been paving the way for projects like Big Green for years:  “We have a lot of crypto-native folks, and we have a lot of people who have never touched a wallet, never considered being here, were terrified of this space – and we’re bringing those communities together. It’s an important step in increasing adoption and adaptation of these technologies, systems, and social structures we’ve been keeping in our little echo chamber for a while.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MANA | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/30/kimbal-musks-big-green-dao-is-a-big-step-for-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6dba7644193fbcc35890835f4e3f6c246f5adad-3561x2374.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394370,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcELh,1638285770,US Policymakers Are Still Evaluating Stablecoins,"We are rapidly approaching the end of 2021 but policymakers are not letting up in terms of their approach to crypto. Last week’s letter to stablecoin issuers is yet another step in this ongoing story.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  When stablecoin rules?  The narrative  Last week, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) sent letters to a handful of stablecoin issuers asking for more information about their issuances, governance, consumer protection policies and more. It’s the latest move in an escalating effort by lawmakers, particularly the Senate Banking Committee chairman, to understand and evaluate stablecoins.  Why it matters  Lawmakers are grappling with stablecoins worldwide, but we’re starting to see movement from just asking questions to the beginnings of actual policy proposals and potential laws. In that light, the questions Brown is asking stablecoin issuers could identify what issues might fall into the explicitly defined regulatory landscape.  Breaking it down  Brown sent letters to Circle, Coinbase, Gemini, Paxos, TrustToken, Binance.US, the Centre Consortium (which Coinbase and Circle jointly operate) and Tether, asking for information about the respective stablecoins they issue.  Roughly summarized, the questions ask:  How customers can acquire the stablecoins;  How customers can redeem the stablecoin;  How much of the stablecoin has been issued;  What might prevent a customer from purchasing the stablecoin;  Whether any trading platforms have “special arrangements” with respect to the stablecoin;  How specific levels of redemption might impact the issuer;  How an exchange might evaluate forks.  Some letters had more questions than others, such as those to Coinbase and Gemini.  “I have significant concerns with the non-standardized terms applicable to redemption of particular stablecoins, how those terms differ from traditional assets, and how those terms may not be consistent across digital asset trading platforms,” Brown wrote in several of the letters.  The letters came a month after Brown, with a handful of other Democrat senators, wrote to Facebook, ordering it to halt its announced Novi pilot program as well as any work on the diem stablecoin project.  At the time, the lawmakers wrote that Facebook could not be trusted with customer data although, interestingly, this was not an issue discussed in last week’s letters.  Brown’s letter referenced the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets’ report on stablecoins, which the group published at the beginning of November.  In a similar vein, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve published their joint sprint team timeline last week, announcing when they plan to announce further clarity around bank interactions with crypto, including stablecoin issuance.  Given a) the PWG’s recommendation that stablecoin issuers be regulated similarly to national banks and b) the PWG’s recommendation that Congress cement this proposal through legislation, it’s very possible that last week’s letters are a first step toward this regulation.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Five Democrat senators have expressed their opposition to OCC nominee Saule Omarova, Axios reported last week. The already contentious nomination has faced headwinds since being announced, and this state of affairs doesn’t look likely to change.

Celsius CFO Arrested on Charges Tied to Former Job at Moshe Hogeg’s Firm: Yaron Shalem, who joined crypto lender Celsius as its chief financial officer in March of this year, was one of the individuals arrested alongside Israeli crypto entrepreneur Moshe Hogeg earlier this month (the charges appear to be unrelated to Celsius).

42394367,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcEGZ,1638283809,Let the Market Come Up With Better Money Tech,"Twenty-five years ago, in the dawn of electronic money, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan presented a paper at the U.S. Treasury conference on “Electronic Money and Banking: The Role of Government,” where he argued that the future of e-cash will depend on the private sector’s “flexibility to experiment, without broad interference by government.” The COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the transition from paper currency to e-cash. People still want cash, but increasingly in digital form stored on mobile wallets rather than in bill folds.  China has already closed the door on private, market-based cryptocurrencies to protect the state’s stake in creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC). There is little doubt that eventually all major central banks will create their own digital currencies. The question is whether governments will allow private digital currencies to emerge and compete with these official digital media of exchange, or follow in China’s footsteps by banning private, market-based substitutes.  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future. James A. Dorn is vice president for monetary studies at the Cato Institute and editor of the Cato Journal.  In thinking about the future of money, it is critical to get the relationship right when it comes to money, the market and the state. There would be gains from allowing a parallel private system for digital currency beside CBDCs, and letting people be free to choose. The market discovery process could then help determine the future of money, rather than give the state the upper hand.  Private monies emerged far before central banks via decentralized decisions by a network of traders to adopt a widely accepted good to act as a medium of exchange. Over time, gold and silver coins replaced cowrie shells and other crude forms of money. Money became more abstract with the introduction of paper currencies and checks, and it became centralized.  By and large, today, currency is a pure fiat money. Its value is solely dependent on keeping its supply in line with demand. The official money network is not easy to compete with; governments are not eager to have their currency monopolies disturbed by private entrepreneurs offering superior alternatives.  Yet, there is no reason to fear the spontaneous development of alternatives to discretionary government fiat money. Allowing free competition within a genuine rule of law that safeguards property rights – including the right to a sound currency – is the best way to encourage innovation and progress. A monetary system based on trust is an important foundation for economic and social harmony. Allowing a free market in ideas and experimentation, whether it be for money or other institutions, generates new information that is lost when the state bans competition, which is best understood as a Hayekian discovery process.  The new frontier of cybercurrency and blockchain should not be restricted by overreaching government bureaucrats who want to protect their turf and maintain the status quo, or by bankers who don’t want competition in the delivery of financial services. If we are to gain the benefits of fintech and the information revolution, doors to an innovative and more adaptive monetary system must remain open while maintaining sufficient regulation to ensure a transparent and orderly payments system.  See also: Gary Gensler Says Crypto Is a ‘Wild West.’ Others See Pure Capitalism | Opinion  The right balance between state and market, therefore, is essential in providing an institutional environment that promotes freedom and responsibility – and extends the range of choices open to people. Tilting that balance toward the private sector will more likely develop a robust monetary system than placing a heavier load on discretionary central banks issuing fiat money, whether paper currency or digital cash.  That idea is reflected in a recent study from the Bank for International Settlements, in which the virtues of CBDCs are noted while recognizing the risks from a lack of private alternatives:  The ultimate benefits of adopting a new payment technology will depend on the competitive structure of the underlying payment system and data governance arrangements. The same technology that can encourage a virtuous circle of greater access, lower costs and better services might equally induce a vicious circle of data silos, market power and anti-competitive practices. CBDCs and open platforms are the most conducive to a virtuous circle.  Instead of following China’s practice of cracking down on cryptocurrencies, the United States and other open societies should follow the market and see whether it can offer better alternatives than another government fiat money unconstrained by any monetary rule.

The new service comes as Avalanche and other upstart blockchains look to win market share from Ethereum, where users have complained of high fees.  “We see this launch as providing an easy way for new users who want to get into DeFi indexes but were held back by high gas fees on Ethereum,” said Adrian Peng, CEO of Cook Finance.  Similar to index products in traditional finance, Cook’s index products are composed of a list of tokens and track the performance of the underlying assets, making it easier for investors to buy a diversified allocation of cryptocurrencies in a single transaction.  Cook Finance launched its mainnet on the Ethereum blockchain in June, and it’s also live on the OEC blockchain.  Additionally, Cook is launching three new Avalanche-focused indexes: the AVAX Ecosystem Index, AVAX Mega Cap Yield Farming Index and an AVAX Stablecoin Yield Farming Index.  The two latter indexes will involve a yield farming component through Avalanche’s Yield Yak.  According to data provider Messari, Avalanche is currently the 12th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, topping $26 billion as of Tuesday. The token is among a group known as “Ethereum killers,” which drew increased interest from the crypto community this year as users on Ethereum complained of high transaction costs. The price of Avalanche’s AVAX token is up nearly 30-fold this year.  “We are getting a lot of interest from the community on expanding into new chains and layer 1′s with lower transaction fees,” Cook Finance Chief Marketing Officer Nathan Leon told CoinDesk. “Layer 1″ refers to blockchains that run independently of other blockchains – as contrasted with “layer 2″ solutions that aim to speed up transactions on existing blockchains like Ethereum.

Susquehanna International Group, a major (if hush-hush) traditional equities trading shop, co-led the round through its ventures wing, SIG DT, alongside Jump Crypto – Robinhood’s go-to firm for processing crypto trades – and Blockchain Capital, a crypto ventures firm.  Also featuring Alameda Research, Coinbase Ventures, Solana, the Chicago Trading Company and others, the round highlights how deep-pocketed investors are betting and building on the Solana ecosystem as a home for financial markets – not just crypto trades.  Hxro Network’s derivatives toolbox will feature protocols for futures, perpetual swaps, options and parimutuels, co-founder Dan Gunsberg told CoinDesk. Projects can plug into those protocols and spin up a limitless number of derivatives trading outposts.  Read more: Crypto Derivatives Firm Hxro Raises $15M From Macro Hedge Fund Commonwealth  That playbook has some precedent in the Solanaverse. Serum became a systemically important hub for Solana-based spot liquidity by making its central limit order book widely available. And Pyth, a data oracle service, is critical to myriad projects’ information feeds.  Hxro is “composable” with both, Gunsberg said.  Doing the same for derivatives – more specifically for derivatives that “professional” traders, not just crypto crowds, would touch – will likely require more than just accessibility. That’s part of the reason why Hxro will launch as a “permissioned” market by integrating with identity firm Civic, too.  “Right now open interest in the traditional world is close to $185 trillion,” Gunsberg said. Hxro is building for a world where much of that action moves over to crypto.  “Our belief is that to really establish a real footprint for decentralized derivatives” that can work at an institutional scale, “you need to have these types of firms that have the domain expertise,” Gunsberg said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/30/hxro-raises-34m-on-promise-of-derivatives-trading-infrastructure-for-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/757c4cd0a62ccaf451ad4443752b021fe6bf5575-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency exchange and credit-card issuer founded in 2016 now has a market cap of more than $17 billion, making it the top performer in November among digital assets with a market cap above $10 billion, according to Messari.  At press time, the CRO price was around $0.70, up 226% on the month. That compares with an 83% gain for the month’s second-biggest gainer, Avalanche’s AVAX token. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, slid 4.5% in November.  “Crypto.com’s recent marketing initiatives have certainly played a role in CRO’s gains,” said Clara Medalie, research lead at Kaiko, a market data provider.  On Nov. 17, Crypto.com purchased naming rights for Los Angeles’ Staples Center. In late October the company’s $100 million campaign “Fortune Favors the Brave,” featuring actor Matt Damon, began running.  Adding to the global marketing initiatives, Crypto.com announced it would become an official partner of CONMEBOL Copa Libertadores, the highest level of club soccer team competition in South America.  “Exchanges are increasingly leveraging massive marketing initiatives to boost name brand recognition, and this is having a strong effect on token prices, which have historically been highly reactive to bullish exchange announcements,” said Medalie.

With the six-month implied volatility hovering near its lifetime average of 84%, the longer duration put options appear cheap. So, traders could be buying those in a bid to make outsized gains on a potential sell-off.

Now, why do you think that this is so important? Cryptocurrency is going to forever change the way that we interact with the world and the Internet. Plus, what blockchain is really introducing is a revolution of sovereignty (Source: IN Groupe). It is certainly going to put the power back in your own hands. Many feel that this may be the single greatest moment of wealth transfer that any of us are going to live through. If you, too, want to become a part of this revolution, now is the time to jump into the decentralized finance (Defi) scene and invest in yield farming. Since the summer of 2020, yield farming has been on fire. Many crypto investors have turned to yield farming to make even more profits with their capital. What is Yield Farming? Many people use terms like yield farming, liquidity providing, and staking interchangeably, but there are differences in what they mean and how much money you can make. Staking refers broadly to the rewards that you get through the validation process of a proof of stake. Blockchain staking and yield farming are similar in the sense that they allow investors to earn a return on their assets. However, yield farming is a bit more intense, meaning, it has the potential for a higher return for a crypto investor.

13221892,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=477727,1638269132,White Whale Releases Details on Flash Loan Architecture,"Let&apos;s break it down. Simply put, a flash loan is, as the name implies, a loan that is opened and closed in a very short amount of time. More specifically, it is opened and closed in the same transaction. Flash loans are used to execute atomic trades that either capitalize off of inefficiencies in the market or provide some other functionality to the borrower. Atomic trades are trades that can be finalized in one transaction and almost all on-chain arbitrage falls under this category. By now you hopefully realize how powerful this financial instrument can be. But with this power comes responsibility. While White Whale is said to be the first to roll out flash loans on Terra (and the whole Cosmos!), a number of protocols already offer it on Ethereum. The sometimes bad connotation linked to flash loans is caused by a number of exploits that happened on Ethereum in which hackers used this tool to do so-called re-entrancy attacks. Fortunately, CosmWasm (the smart contract language of Terra) is designed to avoid this kind of attack. When comparing CosmWasm to Ethereum&apos;s smart contract language the developers state: &apos;A big difference is that we avoid all reentrancy attacks by design. This point deserves an article by itself, but in short, a large class of exploits in Ethereum is based on this trick .&apos; And, &apos;Cosmwasm avoids this completely by preventing any contract from calling another one directly.&apos; These precautions enable White Wh...",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | MARKET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/white-whale-releases-details-on-flash-loan-architecture/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Bloomberg reported that the headquarters are for the entirety of Asia, quoting Huobi’s co-founder Du Jun.  Since May, Huobi has moved much of its staff to the Singapore office after the Chinese government announced a crackdown on crypto trading. Du Jun had also relocated to the city-state, while the other co-founder, Leon Li, is still in China, the company said. Li is reportedly subject to border restrictions by the Chinese government.  Huobi had said that it will expel all Chinese users by the end of the year to comply with Chinese regulations.  The Singapore office will not serve any Singaporean customers, Huobi told CoinDesk. It will operate under Huobi International Pte., of which Li is a majority shareholder, Bloomberg reported. Atlas Value and venture capital firm Zhen Fund are also shareholders, according to the report.  Huobi Tech, a Hong Kong company that is also founded by Li but is a separate legal entity, has set up a subsidiary, Huobi Singapore, to serve local users. The entity, Feu International, has applied for a digital token payment license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  Huobi will set up another base in “France or the U.K. in 2023,” Jun reportedly told Bloomberg.

Bitcoin slipped 2.5%, hitting lows of under $56,000, while the futures tied to the S&P 500 declined by 1.2%. The Aussie dollar-U.S. dollar (AUD/USD) exchange rate fell to a 12-month low of 0.7092, and the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note penetrated Friday’s low of 1.47% as government bonds drew safe-haven demand.  Stéphane Bancel, the CEO of Moderna, told Financial Times that current vaccines will likely be much less effective against the new variant. Bancel added that pharmaceutical companies could take months to produce vaccines at scale to counter Omicron.  Bancel’s comments renewed concerns regarding the pandemic’s trajectory, torpedoing recovery in risk assets. The buoyant mood returned to crypto and equity markets on Monday after reports stated that Omicron patients in South Africa had extremely mild symptoms. Also, U.S. President Joe Biden said the new variant is a “cause for concern” and “not a cause for panic,” ruling out economically painful lockdown restrictions. Bitcoin crashed nearly 9% to $53,600 on Friday after the World Health Organization (WHO) deemed Omicorn a variant of concern.  There is consensus in the market that policymakers would provide unlimited support to asset prices if the situation worsens, leading to lockdowns. However, that would push governments and central banks in a tough spot. With inflation already running hotter than expected globally, lockdowns and more stimulus could lead to stagflation, a period characterized by low growth and elevated price pressures. While bitcoin is widely perceived as a store of value asset, it remains vulnerable to weakness in growth-sensitive assets like stocks.  Some crypto investors seem worried about prospects of an extended price drop and appear to be transferring coins to exchanges. Data tracked by Glassnode shows centralized exchanges have received more than 24,950 BTC in the past four days, as evident from the pickup in the number of coins held in exchange addresses. Investors typically move coins to exchanges when intending to liquidate their holdings.  While the latest uptick in the exchange balances is hardly substantial, a continued rise might signal a deeper drawdown. Bitcoin fell sharply in May after the number of exchange balances violated the year-long downtrend.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/30/bitcoin-back-on-the-defensive-as-moderna-ceo-warns-of-reduced-vaccine-efficacy-exchange-inflows-eyed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/846145fee1b0817f73ce5941e2d76d99076640aa-1920x1272.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when it&apos;s implementation was released as open-source software. Bitcoin are created as a reward for a process known as mining. Among asset classes, Bitcoin has had one of the more volatile trading histories. The cryptocurrency&apos;s very first big price increase occurred in 2010 when the value of a single bitcoin jumped from just a fraction of a penny to $0.08.

42424195,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lQFh,1638233274,Kleiman v. Wright: Jury Deliberations Continue in Week 2,"MIAMI — A federal jury has not yet reached a verdict after deliberating Monday in the federal civil trial of Kleiman v. Wright, which is now in its fourth week. However, a question posed by the jury suggested they are not comfortable valuing bitcoin.  “Many of us do not feel comfortable adjcating [sic] an amount,” they wrote in a note that was read aloud Monday afternoon by U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom, of the Southern District of Florida.  The civil case pits Dr. Craig Wright, an Australian man who claims to have invented bitcoin, against Ira Kleiman, the brother of the late Dave Kleiman, a computer forensics expert from South Florida. The jury began deliberating the case last week.  There are two plaintiffs in the case: Dave Kleiman’s estate (of which Ira is the personal representative) and W&K Info Defense Research, LLC, a Florida limited liability company incorporated by Dave in 2011. (Ira is currently listed as a manager of the company.) Plaintiffs allege that Dave and Wright had a partnership to invent and mine bitcoin, and thus the estate and the business are entitled to bitcoin and intellectual property created under the partnership.  Plaintiffs have asked for $36 billion (representing the value of bitcoin at issue), plus $126 billion (representing the value of intellectual property at issue, though this amount could be tripled if the jury finds for civil theft) and $17 billion in punitive damages.  The jury deliberated most of the day, but at 2:17 p.m. ET asked for a simple definition of the word “conferred.” The word is referenced in jury instructions, which explain that both plaintiffs in the case have asserted claims of unjust enrichment against Wright.  To prevail on this count, plaintiffs would need to have proven certain points by a preponderance of the evidence: that David Kleiman and/or W&K conferred a benefit on Wright; that Wright voluntarily accepted and retained that benefit; and that it would be inequitable or unfair for Wright to retain the benefit without paying the value of the benefit to the Estate of David Kleiman and/or W&K.  The jurors also sent a note asking, “How much of intellectual property does W&K currently have under the estate? Do we need to select an amount for bitcoin and intellectual property?”  They also asked, “When answering yes to a question requiring an amount, must we follow a certain formula or can we leave it blank? Many of us do not feel comfortable adjcating [sic] an amount.”  The judge and attorneys for both sides debated how to answer, with the assumption that jurors had misspelled “adjudicating.”  Ultimately, Bloom told the jurors that all evidence has been received, that they should rely on their collective memories and that they should refer to jury instructions, which state, “If you find for the Estate of David Kleiman and/or W&K on any of its claims, you must consider the matter of damages. Generally, you should award an amount of money that the preponderance of the evidence shows will fairly and adequately compensate the Estate of David Kleiman and/or W&K for its damages.”  Finding damages  The instructions describe particulars for each count alleged in the complaint.  For the count of breach of partnership (which is alleged by the estate but not by W&K), if the jury finds a partnership existed it must determine the quantity of any bitcoin, if any, owned by the partnership, the current value of that bitcoin and award the estate 50% of that value unless the jury finds that Kleiman and Dave Wright agreed on a different amount. Likewise, the jury must determine the same for intellectual property.  For breach of fiduciary duty (which is alleged by W&K, but not by the estate) , the jury should award W&K damages “calculated as of the time the Defendant breached his fiduciary duty to W&K; for unjust enrichment, either plaintiff would be “entitled to an amount of money equal to the value of the benefit conferred upon the Defendant and attributable to his wrongdoing.”  The other counts are alleged by both parties. For the count of conversion, the jury should award the estate or W&K the quantity of assets, if any, that were converted and their value. “Plaintiffs are entitled to the highest value of the assets between the time of conversion and the date of your verdict,” the instructions say.  For civil theft, the jury is to award “an amount of money, if any, that the clear and convincing evidence shows are the actual damages sustained by the Estate of David Kleiman or W&K.” Again, “the highest value of the assets between the time of conversion and the date of your verdict” is to be used.  For either fraud or constructive fraud, instructions say the jury should award the estate or W&K “the amount of any damages calculated as of the time the Defendant committed the fraud or the constructive fraud.” For unjust enrichment, either plaintiff would be “entitled to an amount of money equal to the value of the benefit conferred upon the Defendant and attributable to his wrongdoing.”  If the jury finds for the estate or W&K on the counts of conversion, fraud and/or constructive fraud claims, it must decide whether to award punitive damages – meant to punish and deter others from similar actions.  These are warranted against Wright if the jury finds “by clear and convincing evidence that he engaged in intentional misconduct or gross negligence, which was a substantial cause of damage to the Estate of David Kleiman or W&K.”  Intentional misconduct is defined to mean that Wright had “actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of the conduct and that there was a high probability of injury or damage to the Estate of David Kleiman or W&K and, despite that knowledge, the Defendant intentionally pursued that course of conduct, resulting in injury or damage.”  “Gross negligence” means the Defendant’s conduct was so reckless or wanting in care that it constituted a conscious disregard or indifference to the life, safety or rights of persons exposed to such conduct.  The jury can decide the amount of punitive damages. It was instructed to consider:  The nature, extent and degree of misconduct and the related circumstances, including “whether the wrongful conduct was motivated solely by unreasonable financial gain; whether the unreasonably dangerous nature of the conduct, together with the high likelihood of injury resulting from the conduct, was actually known by the Defendant;whether, at the time of damage, the Defendant had a specific intent to harm a Plaintiffand the conduct of the Defendant did in fact harm a Plaintiff”; and  The financial resources of the Defendant.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | RESEARCH,Deirdra Funcheon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/30/kleiman-v-wright-jury-deliberations-continue-in-week-2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ace68e5223d9ed2899ffc8a05eb8f41f9f93bfb-5304x3600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
