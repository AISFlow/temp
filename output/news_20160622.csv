42378781,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkNT,1466637829,Blockchain Startup Circle Raises $60 Million Amid China Expansion,"Blockchain-based payments app Circle has raised $60m in new funding from China-based investors, an announcement that coincides with its unveiling of a dedicated domestic subsidiary, Circle China.  The Series D funding was led by Beijing-based investment firm IDG Capital, with Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, SilverLake co-founder Glenn Hutchins and former IBM CEO Sam Palmisano contributing funding. Circle also added new strategic partners in the region including Baidu, CICC Alpha, China EverBright Investments, Fenbushi Capital and CreditEase.  In interview, Circle co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire indicated that the Series D round will be used to fund its global operations, and that Circle China had been capitalized six months ago with a separate seed round.  However, Neville and Allaire used the announcement to emphasize how they believe Circle is now taking steps to build a truly global payments experience, one that will soon be able to allow users in the US, Europe and China to exchange value with the ease of a text message.  Allaire told CoinDesk:  “We don’t think of ourselves as focused on remittance or money transfer, we don’t think those categories will exist. For us, this capital is all going in the global company and that’s investment in consumer marketing, that’s the focus.”  Allaire sought to describe Circle as “not another closed network” like peer-to-peer payment platforms like Venmo or Transferwise, companies to which the startup’s business model market observers allege is now perhaps most similar.  In this way, Neville and Allaire assert that their core advantage is not that Circle will excel in providing money transfer services to consumers, but rather a more mature version of the company’s app will transcend boundaries, and thus, be more user friendly.

42378788,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkV1,1466637613,Ether Prices Fluctuate Wildly Amid Ethereum Fork Concerns,"The price of ether, the native digital asset powering the ethereum network, has fluctuated wildly over the last few days as its developers struggled to determine how to resolve the loss of investor funds at one of the platform’s signature projects.  At issue is the loss of roughly 3.6m ETH taken from a distributed autonomous organization (DAO) called The DAO and the ongoing drive to secure both funds lost to attackers and those that remain, for now, under the control of aspects of its development community.  Against this backdrop, ether’s markets have been fluctuating wildly on the uncertainty over both how the situation would be resolved, and how the resolution would be received.  For example, fears persist that solutions in which developers need to rewrite the blockchain’s history, reversing transactions that were valid according to the platform’s rules in a bid to bail out customers, will cause a loss of confidence in the market and result in ether being delisted by major exchanges.  After rising to a high of 0.028 ETH/BTC around 3:30 UTC on 17th June, ether declined roughly 50% to 0.014 ETH/BTC at 6:55 UTC on 20th June, Poloniex figures reveal. By 04:10 UTC on 22nd June, the digital currency had recovered to 0.024 ETH/BTC, approximately 70% higher than its price only two days prior.  But while The DAO hack is laying ethereum’s technical challenges bare, some market participants are viewing the decline as an opportunity to buy, Max Boonen, founder of market maker B2C2, told CoinDesk.  Such comments, echoed by other market observers, infer that there is confidence in the fundamentals of the ethereum market, despite the fact trading began just last year.  For example, market expert Petar Zivkovski emphasized that ether’s ""fundamentals are still strong"" and that ""the DAO scandal will come to pass"".  Of note is that while ether experienced some sharp fluctuations recently, it was not alone among digital currencies.  The price of bitcoin also experienced some volatility over the last few days, a development that has served to further amplify ether’s price swings, Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, told CoinDesk.  The digital currency’s price fell from an on opening price of $764.04 on 20th June to a closing price of $631.72 at 19:40 UTC on 21st June, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal. The currency then recovered, rising to $678.22 UTC between 12:45 and 12:59 UTC on 22nd June and then falling to as little as $610.32 at 18:00 UTC that same day.  At press time, the price of bitcoin was hovering just above $600.  With this in mind, Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, stated that he believes the markets are likely to be choppy in the days ahead.  Zivkovski concluded:  “We still think there is some downside before that happens, driven mainly by former bulls looking to cut losses as the ETH dumps took them by surprise.”  Charles L.

42378785,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkPz,1466624814,Cornell Professor Calls for 'DAO 2.0' Movement,"The Cornell computer scientist who helped identify vulnerabilities in The DAO revealed 10 new exploits in its code at an event in New York.  The statements from Emin Gün Sirer, a longstanding critic of the project, come amid broad concern over developments at The DAO, a smart contract-based funding vehicle built with ethereum that has effectively collapsed following an exploit of a vulnerability within its smart contract code.  Sirer warned that, while the vulnerability that led to the removal of tens of millions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency ether is now well-understood, much remains to be fixed before another DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) can be launched.  The statements were the first to lay a clear path forward for how to build an organization run largely with code, and thus fulfill the original vision of The DAO.  Sirer, who is the co-director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3), an academic research project focused on the technology, used the forum to lay out a detailed account of possible exploits for such projects that go all the way down to the Ethereum coding language itself.  Sirer went on to argue that the issues highlighted are relevant when looking at the question of creating similar projects in the future.  He told the crowd:  ""The DAO 2.0 requires much, much more effort. It’s a much deeper field than people might think.""  Vulnerabilities detailed  In the days leading up to the initial bug detection, Sirer and his colleagues published an overview of what they called a “recursive call” vulnerability that allowed the exploiter to move funds into a so-called “child DAO” that breaks off from the original DAO.  Addressing a crowd of about 70 bitcoin coders, ethereum developers, computer scientists and financial professionals at last night's event, Sirer went into detail about other possible threats.  For example, the “stalking” bug – which is currently being used to mount a counter-attack against a white-hat hack designed to move funds into a safe account – is an example of one of the vulnerabilities Sirer identified at last night’s event.  The 10 vulnerabilities Sirer discussed in detail include a ""concurrent proposal trap"" whereby an attacker makes an arbitrary proposal such as 'Do you believe in God?' designed to entice a high degree of response, and include long voting period during which the token used to vote becomes trapped. Then, a competing proposal could be made by the attacker after the funds have been locked up.  Another exploit, called a ""majority takeover"" attack, disguises a majority vote by a single party that might benefit from a successful proposal by splitting the voting power into smaller votes cast separately, for which he said there is no known defense.  Some of the exploits discussed last night were published in detail in the earlier paper. A full list, along with an account of how The DAO functions, can be found here.  ""The whole point of smart contracts is to create exciting, weird financial instruments,"" Sirer told attendees, adding:  ""This is not exciting, it’s just weird.""  Tough love  In the hours leading up to yesterday’s event, Sirer engaged in an Twitter debate in which he argued that the Ethereum community should ostracize founding members of Slock.it, a Germany-based startup that wrote The DAO code and spearheaded its deployment.  At the event in New York, Sirer doubled-down on his call, naming founders Stephan Tual and Christoph Jentzsch, in particular.  But while Sirer had some harsh words for Slock.it, he said the problems extend to ethereum itself. He called The DAO a ""ginormous $220m bug bounty"", a criticism that extended not only to DAOs, but to ethereum’s smart contracts coding language Solidity, which he said is a work in progress.  Sirer told attendees:  ""We should redesign Solidity, we should rethink what it means to write secure state machines, how we should specify them and how we should make sure that they do not mess up.""

42378786,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkTl,1466610077,DAO Debacle Escalates: Attacker Counter-Attacks Ethereum Developers,"The situation at The DAO is continuing to escalate.  The most visible distributed autonomous organization on the ethereum network, which once held $160m worth of the cryptocurrency ether, has now seen these funds dispersed to several different accounts.  Complicating matters is that the owners of some of these accounts are, at present, unknown.  The heightened uncertainty follows actions taken by a group of ethereum developers, who launched a ""Robin Hood"" effort to gain control of the funds yesterday. The effort was said to be aimed at safeguarding The DAO’s ether holdings following a new attack, a separate incident from the one that originally compromised investor holdings days before.      For the few who haven't been following, the ethereum developers yesterday successfully siphoned tens of millions of dollars worth of ether from The DAO and moved it into two new contracts utilizing the same exploit that resulted in the removal of roughly 3.6m ethers last Friday.                                          But now, someone behind one of those attacks has returned fire by taking advantage of the same aspects of The DAO's smart contract that allowed last week's attack.  Lefteris Karapetsas, technical lead for Slock.it, the Germany-based ethereum startup that spearheaded The DAO, said that the actors behind the actions are now in a position to launch a similar attack, using the same exploit that originally compromised The DAO.  Karapetsas said that attacker was able to obtain a stake in the two DAO sub-groups, known as child DAOs. He had previously proposed a counterattack that could be used as a stop-gap measure to disrupt the attacker.  Karapetsas told CoinDesk:  ""Someone donated ether to The DAO with the sole purpose of having some balance inside The DAO so that he can join split 78, which is a whitehat DAO. He did not manage to get a lot but he has some tokens inside that DAO right now.""  However, the creation phase of the child DAOs means that the attacker wouldn’t be able to perform the exploit until late next month.  This waiting period, Karapetsas said, would provide cover and time to come up with a fork of the ethereum network.  Slock.it founder and COO Stephan Tual told CoinDesk that much of The DAO's funds were moved in an effort including members of the Ethereum Foundation and Slock.it, among others, though he stressed that those groups were not playing an official role.  ""70% of the funds are now under the direct control of a group of whitehats consisting of individuals from ethereum foundation, Slock.it, etc,"" he said.  But as it stands – and as today’s counter-move demonstrates – the inherent vulnerabilities in The DAO’s smart contract leaves the door open to future attacks. Each child DAO created is an effective copy of the original, bringing with it all of the flaws contained within. It’s because of this that some are pushing for a rule change in the ethereum network.  Proponents of that strategy say it would allow developers to freeze funds taken from The DAO, and thus secure funds until they can be recovered.  Opponents, on the other hand, argue that the move threatens the integrity of the ethereum blockchain and the project as a whole. Others have asserted that the drive to fork ethereum is driven by the self-interest of developers who have ownership stakes in the compromised funds as well as The DAO itself.

42378759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7liut,1466606676,US Regulators Recommend Oversight for Bitcoin and Distributed Ledgers,"A major financial oversight body within the US government created in the wake of the financial crisis has identified bitcoin and distributed ledger systems in general as a potential systemic risk.  The Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) said in the new report released yesterday that the technology represented an innovation that “appear[s] poised for substantial near-term growth” and that it is reflective of a shifting landscape that merits attention from regulators.  As a broad recommendation, the committee said that regulators should prepare to adjust accordingly if the technology sees broader adoption or outright supplants certain market intermediaries. The issues identified focus on the lack of experience with these systems among participants in financial markets, exposing them to operational and fraud risks.  Beyond that, the FSOC said that the global nature of the technology – and the fact that it transcends legal jurisdictions and national boundaries – will potentially require regulatory cooperation on a similar scale.  The report notes:  ""Furthermore, since the set of market participants which makes use of a distributed ledger system may well span regulatory jurisdictions or national boundaries, a considerable degree of coordination among regulators may be required to effectively identify and address risks associated with distributed ledger systems.""  The FSOC was created with the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was drafted in response to the 2008-09 financial crisis. Signed into law in 2010, the bill was a controversial one, and to this day draws arguments that it either regulates the financial system too much or not enough.  The committee itself was given a broad mandate to investigate possible systemic risks, and according to the law, is empowered to designate market issues and take action against activities or market participants it deems an immediate risk to the US financial system.  The FSOC is currently chaired by the Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. Its voting members include Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen as well as the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Comptroller of the Currency, among other agencies within the Treasury Department.  Fraud issues  The report suggests that inexperience using the technology could result in deployment problems, and it went on to highlight scalability and fraud risks in particular.  It’s here that the committee specifically cited bitcoin, pointing to recent network capacity issues as an example of what might adversely affect a person or business new to the experience.  ”Market participants have limited experience working with distributed ledger systems, and it is possible that operational vulnerabilities associated with such systems may not become apparent until they are deployed at scale,” the authors write.  The report continues:  ”For example, in recent months, bitcoin trade confirmation delays have increased dramatically and some trade failures have occurred as the speed with which new bitcoin transactions are submitted has exceeded the speed with which they can be added to the blockchain.""  This inexperience could expose some market participants to fraud as well, the report argues.  ""Similarly, although distributed ledger systems are designed to prevent reporting errors or fraud by a single party, some systems may be vulnerable to fraud executed through collusion among a significant fraction of participants in the system,"" it states.  The need to adapt to a changing landscape, according to the report, is driven in part by the idea that market intermediaries with which regulators have worked and gathered information from could change or become obsolete.  For now, the FSOC writes, regulators should keep close watch, stating:  “Financial regulators should continue to monitor and evaluate the implications of how new products and practices affect regulated entities and financial markets and assess whether they could pose risks to financial stability.""

Announced today, ATB Financial, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD), Reisebank, Santander, UniCredit and UBS have all revealed that they are using the technology, though Ripple said the specific use cases each partner is pursuing varies.  In interview, Ripple CEO Chris Larsen sought to position the partnerships as evidence that adoption of the company’s technology is increasing, and that these partners are increasingly serious about using its offerings for real money transfers.  Larsen told CoinDesk:  ""We’ve reached the stage where a significant number of these banks are moving to commercial production. What’s significant here is the space is moving beyond experimentation and moving into actually deploying this.""  The announcement follows the news that Santander is using Ripple as part of an internal trial open to employees that it aims to take live later this year.  In statements, ATB chief strategy and operations officer Curtis Stange said that his firm had used the technology to make overseas payments, while CIBC and NBAD expressed an overall enthusiasm for Ripple and the efficiencies it could enable.  The responses come as financial institutions continue to explore Ripple’s technology in ways that position the platform as an outlier among blockchain-based networks.  For example, Ripple partners have been vocal about their use of the platform to exchange more traditional payment messages rather than XRP, the digital asset that powers the Ripple consensus ledger (RCL). By doing so, partners say they are able to bring banks and market makers into a data sharing environment that reduces costs.  Larsen said he believes most of Ripple’s clients are using the RCL and Ripple Connect, which allows them to exchange know your customer (KYC) and compliance information prior to initiating transactions, but that over time, adoption of XRP, the digital asset may increase due to the cost savings it could provide.

42378767,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lj3h,1466597158,What Ethereum's DAO Disaster Means for Bitcoin Development,"Up until the point when The DAO collapsed, it was a symbol of the explosion of innovation that the ethereum blockchain had enabled.  While the consumer-facing apps built on the bitcoin blockchain have been largely limited to various wallets, exchanges and casinos, at the time of The DAO's collapse, more than 50 projects were awaiting votes on their request to fund ideas as diverse as a new way to lease cars and entirely new forms of governance.  But, these efforts are now stalled, and the $60m worth of ether destined to be invested in them, as of now, is lost in limbo.  Amid the ongoing crisis, some of bitcoin’s best-known computer scientists are using the incident to point to bitcoin’s slow growth as its greatest asset.  They argue that while bitcoin’s simplistic machine language takes much longer to write with than ethereum’s Turing-complete coding language, Solidity, it is also less prone to mistakes.  Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd told CoinDesk:  ""My thinking is if I can’t explain a system to a drunk guy with a fine arts degree and have him have a decent chance of understanding how it works, at least at some level, chances are the system is too complex for me to understand.""  Make me a sandwich  It wasn’t until the morning of the attack that Todd says he first looked in detail at the way Solidity operates.  What he discovered was what he described as a problem of levels of abstraction. Too much knowledge was demanded of the developers whose ideas were behind the explosion of ethereum-based app development.  While ethereum’s digital currency-powered blockchain, combined with a Turing-complete programming language, promised to let developers easily construct distributed applications (dapps), according to Todd, the skill to actually deliver on that promise might be higher than expected.  Though it takes more work using bitcoin’s scripting language to accomplish the same tasks as with ethereum’s Solidity, it's also easier to see the problems, Todd argued. The very nature of the bitcoin scripting language means that each of its different states can be analyzed in isolation. With Solidity on the other hand, the problem is essentially a moving target.  Todd likened it to making a sandwich. With ethereum, the sandwich would require instructions on where to place the knife on the bread before applying mustard, and how many times to spread the condiment.  Whereas with bitcoin, developers order the ingredients themselves.  ""You say, I want this on my sandwich, go make that happen,"" said Todd. ""And you will get predictable results because you’re at the right level of abstraction.""  Christopher Allen, principal architect at bitcoin development startup Blockstream, put the sandwich metaphor differently:  ""[Ethereum] is like if you were given a pig and some wheat.""  Build me a plane  Prior to joining Blockstream earlier this year, Allen co-authored the TLS security standards that help protect a wide range of communications via our modern computer networks.  Allen said the perception that ethereum was easy to build with naturally led to an expectation that complicated, large-scale projects like The DAO should be built. When in reality, he argues, the problems could be broken down into simpler components and resolved in more traditional ways.  One example Allen mentioned that those whose projects are now in limbo in The DAO might want to consider is using existing contract law and the open-source principles to found and test a network of traditional limited liability corporations. Then, after the LLCs are established, run experiments with how to encode certain parts of the work-flow using ethereum's blockchain or bitcoin’s blockchain.  Another way forward for those DAO projects trapped in limbo is to break down the concepts coded into their software into more the fundamental elements of a transaction, for which he says bitcoin is better suited.  By using this method, and solving small groups of problems at a time, he contends DAO developers could discover new ways to use existing bitcoin technology and other tools currently being developed to express the idea as a series of transactions.  Allen compares today’s dapp construction to the early days of the airplane development when successful models were built using wood and paper.  Allen said:  ""We need to have more test pilots and we need to have more experimental planes and things of that nature. This is dangerous for a while.""  Bitcoin is a net  In the history of digital currency, The DAO will likely go down as the Mt Gox of ethereum. One key difference, however, is that this time around the digital currency industry has a stronger sense of itself.  Unlike Mt Gox, which had a relatively small support team and was overseen autocratically by its then-CEO, The DAO is being triaged by the Internet of Things startup, Slock.it, which wrote its original open-source code; members of the Ethereum Foundation that helps oversee the ethereum codebase; and a drove of independent coders connecting online.  But another key difference is that when Mt Gox collapsed, the bitcoin community had nothing to fall back on but its own ingenuity.  While Peter Todd argues that computer science isn’t yet ready to successfully pull-off what The DAO claimed to offer — a leaderless organization run on a bundle of smart contracts and designed to support an ecosystem of related startups — he says that ongoing work by Bitcoin Core developers and the surrounding ecosystem are advancing efforts to build similar distributed autonomous services without the bugs.  Yesterday, he published a lengthy update on his work to build a state-machine approach to ""smart contract"" systems, called Proofchains or Dex. In interview Todd also mentioned the work of Johnson Lau’s Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree, which he said ""begins to allow us to do much more complex constructions"".  Allen’s Blockstream already has Elements Project, an open-source community for deploying sidechains used to test early versions of bitcoin’s proposed Segregated Witness upgrade. Segregated Witness is in its own right another example of efforts underway by the bitcoin community to increase the complexity it can host, while not sacrificing safety.  Far from being a stranger to controversy, Todd himself is one of the central figures behind the debate over how best bitcoin can scale.  In interview he said he felt bad for the Ethereum developers who are currently trying to solve the problems that led to the current crisis.  But in the same way he and other bitcoin developers learned from Mt Gox, he said he’s trying to learn from The DAO:  ""We really have to be careful to not allow the kinds of things that happened with The DAO. Or even worse, things that might risk the entire bitcoin ecosystem. Could it be said that we are too conservative? Quite possibly.""

42378763,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7liw9,1466561363,Circle Execs: The DAO Proves Blockchains Require Trust,"UPDATE (22nd June, 2016 17:45 GMT): Circle co-founder Sean Neville has now expanded on these thoughts in a Medium post.      Circle co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville are the latest high-profile blockchain entrepreneurs to weigh in on the ongoing crisis with The DAO, the ethereum-based distributed autonomous organization that saw millions in customer funds compromised last week.  In interview, Allaire and Neville called the ongoing event, which has found the development community taking action to protect remaining funds from losses, ""fascinating"", citing it as an example of how all blockchain technologies remain in the earlier stages of development.  Notably, Neville said that the situation provided an example of why he believes that blockchain tech, despite its strong emphasis on automating transactions and exchange, will still need to rely on the actions and abilities of people to succeed.  Neville told CoinDesk:  ""Cryptography and software could replace the gatekeepers, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have trust in human beings at all. We have to trust how changes to the software and the apps are rolled out.""  Both co-founders said they have been watching the situation closely and that they are excited about ethereum’s capabilities, though they cautioned the event proves the platform is in ""production beta"".  Allaire also commented on how ethereum smart contracts could come to force a larger transition in the legal world, one that he suggested would actually be advanced should investors in The DAO seek legal recourse for any losses.  “Is a smart contract a contract and will a court uphold it? If the court says the terms and conditions in the code are a contract, the code becomes the law,"" Allaire said.
