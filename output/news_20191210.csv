42431254,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1FLh,1576018800,FinCEN Sees Jump in Crypto-Related Suspicious Activity Reports,"Crypto companies have filed 7,100 Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) since May, America’s anti-money-laundering (AML) chief said at a banking conference Tuesday.      The reports, according to Kenneth Blanco, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), follow FinCEN’s May guidance explaining how the Banking Secrecy Act, the cornerstone of U.S. AML law, applies to the virtual currency space.      Since then, Blanco said that in total 11,000 crypto-related SARs have been filed with FinCEN. Twenty-one hundred filers directly referenced the guidance and “dozens” of new entities filed their first report.      The high numbers indicate that virtual asset service providers (VASP) like crypto ATMs and exchanges are keeping a closer eye on potentially illicit activity moving across their network.      “It is encouraging that CVC entities, dozens of whom had never filed a SAR report prior to the May advisory, are using the red flags and reporting suspicious activity back to us,” said Blanco.      Venezuela in particular appears to be a hotbed of suspicious crypto activity, Blanco said. The Latin American country with its allegedly oil-backed token, the Petro, seems to have spawned an increasing number of unregistered money services business.      Domestically, crypto companies are reporting more darknet-linked customer transactions, more scams, and more activities targeting the elderly, whose “limited knowledge” of cryptocurrency places them at higher risk.      Blanco said that all financial institutions need to consider their crypto SAR reporting, even those who do not currently report any activity.      “If the answer is no, they need to reevaluate whether their institutions are exposed to cryptocurrency,” he said.      The remarks come as crypto exchanges, analyst firms, and others bolster their efforts to expand suspicious activity reporting.

42431268,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Fdh,1576013400,Blockchain Faces Big Challenges But the Opportunity Is Enormous,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Don Tapscott is the author of 16 books, most recently with his son Alex, Blockchain Revolution. He is Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute.      In 2019 the blockchain revolution ground to a halt. At least that’s the word from those who should know.      A recent Gartner Group report called it “blockchain fatigue.” Other pundits echoed the view that pilots have fizzled out, few implementations have gone into production, and blockchain is likely to be a marginal technology.      Empirically, this view is incorrect. Our research shows hundreds of production systems underway across a dozen industries. Most of these are based on Ethereum, Hyperledger, or Corda but other platforms are emerging.      Global trade finance is moving to blockchain. TradeLens—IBM and Maersk’s joint blockchain initiative in shipping—welcomed its first round of new shipping giants this year. Everledger has expanded its efforts to eliminate conflict diamonds into China via a WeChat app. Token offerings that raised upwards of $10 billion in the last year alone have disrupted venture capital.      Mind-boggling initiatives are also underway related to digital currency and economic inclusion. India’s Reliance Industries, for one, announced that its mobile subsidiary Jio will turn its 300 million users into the world’s largest blockchain network; Facebook proposed Libra, the crypto asset that could turn the social media giant into the world’s largest retail bank overnight. Then the People's Bank of China revealed that it was “almost ready” to launch a sovereign digital yuan for international use. President Xi Jinping urged the rest of China to “seize the opportunity” provided by blockchain to accelerate the nation’s innovation.      This all sounds like “full steam ahead,” not “blockchain burnout.” So, what’s going on here?      1. Blockchain has a PR problem      The words blockchain or crypto still conjure up images of bad actors, criminals, and get-rich-quick hucksters using a new technology to commit age-old frauds—and there has been plenty of that. Meanwhile, parochial infighting and juvenile squabbling has reflected poorly on the ecosystem as a whole.      But we are witnessing swift and legitimate progress on standards. For example, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance launched a platform-neutral Token Taxonomy Initiative (TTI) in April; by November, TTI members from competing blockchain platforms were able to publish their first shared framework for business models and networks based on tokens. Collaborations such as the Blockchain in Transport Alliance have made industry-specific progress on, for example, a standard for location components and a framework for tracking events. This sort of interdependence will be the key moving forward.      Also, institutions such as the Chamber of Digital Commerce are proving themselves crucial allies for governments hoping to strike the right regulatory balance. We’re doing our part at BRI by highlighting use-cases and the need for governance and cooperation and change at the societal level. Extraordinary leaders like SEC Commissioner Hester Piece, the Bank of England’s Mark Carney, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s former chair Chris Giancarlo, and nominee for Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang have emerged as advocates. Momentum is building.      2. Blockchain is running head-on into the system of laws, regulations, and structures that govern society.      Freedom of speech and information is protected by the US Constitution to be open. But when it comes to assets, all our systems of laws and governments are designed to keep these closed, proprietary, and owned by the powerful. It’s no wonder blockchain and crypto are taking a long time. They’re confronting many fundamentals of how our economy and society work.      As Giancarlo said in a recent interview:    “The late 20th Century digitization of information through the Internet took place in a regulatory ‘light’ zone due to the US Constitution's protection of speech from Federal government interference. Conversely, the early 21st Century digitization of value is taking place in regulatory ‘heavy’ zone because of the long-established authority of US state and federal governments to protect property rights, including those of consumers of financial services (banks, trust companies and other financial service providers have been subject to both state and Federal regulation for decades). As a result, the practices that guided the digitization of information (i.e., ‘Don’t ask permission, ask forgiveness’) when used for the digitization of property rights are particularly provocative to the established legal and regulatory order, as we have seen with initial coin offerings.”    Regulation represents by far the most significant hurdle for blockchain innovators, according to a survey of executives and entrepreneurs conducted by the Chamber of Digital Commerce Canada and the BRI. Existing regulations favor incumbents over disruptors. Blockchain presents new challenges to regulators looking to protect consumers and markets, but the rigidity with which they have approached blockchain has often stifled innovation and growth.      As a result, major economies like Canada continue to see “company drain” to friendlier jurisdictions. As we’ve seen with Switzerland and Singapore, the first major jurisdictions to establish favorable conditions for blockchain ventures will reap the rewards in jobs and economic growth.      3. The technology is still immature      To borrow from the late Roy Amara of the Institute for the Future, we tend to overestimate the impact of a new technology in the short run, but we underestimate it in the long run. To thrive in the long term, blockchain faces implementation challenges beyond regulation and the active inertia of incumbents.      Interoperability. Like the early days of the Internet when private intranets dominated the scene, blockchain is balkanized in silos. Projects like Cosmos and Polkadot or the partnership between Ethereum and Hyperledger may enable an interoperable Internet of blockchains in the first half of 2020.      Scalability. Most platforms have much to do to scale their solutions. Ethereum, a dominant platform for smart contracts and application development, can still process only 15 transactions per second, and its Istanbul upgrade faced numerous delays. Interoperability may alleviate this problem as users marshal multiple blockchains to achieve scale.      Usability. Buying or selling crypto is still difficult. Participation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem requires a level of validation that most users find unappealing. Complex security processes have become barriers to adoption. Creating more user-friendly processes for buying and storing cryptocurrency securely is still a crucial challenge for the industry—and Microsoft, Overstock, and Virgin Galactic are among the very few places for households or corporations to spend it.      Security. Blockchains are more secure than traditional computer systems, as John Oliver pointed out using my chicken nugget analogy. But hackers can still breach apps, systems, and businesses built on blockchains. In 2019, $250 million went down the drain on one exchange alone—QuadrigaCX—with its deadly centralized business model.      Data rights. Internet users create the “new oil”—data—but the digital landlords capture all its value. The solution is not just government protection of privacy (like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation) or even charitable landlords offering users access to some of their data. We believe that self-sovereign identities on blockchain will enable us to capture and control our own data. While there are promising identity initiatives underway (Sovrin), we’re a long way from a radically new identity framework.      The Stakes      If business and government leaders fail to act, the consequences could be stark. Consider the race to a global digital currency, likely a big theme for 2020.      First, there were traditional crypto networks like bitcoin. Second came corporations like Facebook (can other digital conglomerates be far behind?). Next up are nation states, with China implementing its digital currency in 2020 as a step toward replacing the US dollar as the currency of record. This will no doubt stimulate the US Federal Reserve to push ahead with the digital dollar. As other countries join in, we may see Mark Carney’s vision of a “synthetic hegemonic currency,” which would grow from a basket of other fiat currencies to dominate money globally.      In the coming year, central bankers, policymakers, and business leaders—all of us—will decide what the future of the digital economy will look like. Western economies have an opportunity to embrace decentralization and the Internet-of-Value and, in doing so, maintain their leadership positions in the global economy. But leaders will need a level of flexibility and openness that we have not yet seen.      As with everything bold, the future is not something to be predicted, but achieved. Now more than ever, the question of who will build that future should be top of mind in 2020.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Don Tapscott,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/10/blockchain-faces-big-challenges-but-the-opportunity-is-enormous,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cd1fbc744ecaebeefd4fb36d07600a193bab5cb-1368x904.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the next phase, which is expected to start in early 2020, the entire regions of Kaliningrad oblast and Yekaterinburg will use the system. The next step will be expanding it to all of Russia, according to Waves Enterprise.      The system Waves Enterprise developed will access data from the power meters in houses and apartments, store it and distribute consumers’ payments between the company generating the electricity and the power grid operator, according to the announcement. This is intended to make the calculation of the payments more transparent and reduce what households owe for electricity, a debt that has reached over $12.5 billion in Russia in 2019.       Households will be able to see how much power they are using via an app and choose a more suitable tariff such as opting for one that provides a cheaper price during the night hours, according to the announcement.      Along with SAP and Waves, three companies piloted their solutions for Rosseti, said Alexander Sadov, head of the project management at Rosseti Ural, the subsidiary that is supervising the project. They are Digital Horizon, Digital Energy Laboratory and B41.       The winner, however, is still to be chosen in a public call for bids scheduled for Q1 2020, and the winner in the bid will be able to build a distributed ledger-based solution for electricity consumption records, with the plan to launch into production in the mid-2021, Sadov said.      “We see now that the technology is working. With it, we can check that the electricity consumption data is consistent,” Sadov said.      According to him, using a distributed ledger can help prevent the manipulation of data, which can happen when the intermediaries that accumulate the data from consumers pass it to the generating companies for billing.      “We believe the system should be developed on a private blockchain and on a platform developed in our country, meeting our demands for data protection and cryptography,” the chairman of Rosseti, Sergei Semerikov, said in the press release. Also participating in the pilot was Russia’s largest privately owned bank, Alfa Bank.      Rosseti previously announced another local blockchain pilot in collaboration with Gazprombank, Russia’s oil and gas giant’s subsidiary, and the venture fund Digital Horizon.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/10/russias-power-grid-company-tests-blockchain-for-power-meter-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d6d3de00535c4e613c0a301b5962eeaca92ae73-1500x965.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release, Matthew Brent Goettsche, 37, of Lafayette, Colorado; Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks, 38, of Arvada, Colorado; and Joseph Frank Abel, 49, of Camarillo, California were indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud (Goettsche and Weeks) and conspiracy to offer unregistered securities through their participation in BitClub Network, a mining pool. The news was first reported by BNN Bloomberg.      Two other unidentified defendants remain at large.      The alleged scammers created false figures meant to demonstrate BitClub’s earnings from its bitcoin mining pool to its investors between April 2014 and December 2019.      An attached indictment showed how Goettsche and an unidentified individual planned how to make their fake numbers look ""real"" by providing daily earnings inconsistent on a day-to-day basis.      “Goettsche discussed with his conspirators that their target audience would be ‘dumb’ investors, referred to them as ‘sheep,’ and said he was ‘building this whole model on the backs of idiots,’” the release said.      Investors were encouraged both to purchase shares of the mining pool, as well as “rewarded” for bringing on new investors.      Goettsche allegedly directed his co-conspirators to raise and lower the Ponzi’s supposed earnings at various times, while Weeks apparently sent an email in mid-2017 which noted BitClub’s shareholder funds were not used to purchase more mining equipment.      In a statement, John Tafur, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS-Criminal Investigation group’s Newark field office said, “today’s indictment alleges the defendants were involved in a sophisticated Ponzi scheme involving hundreds of millions of dollars that preyed upon investors all over the world.”      The scam was “a classic con game” with a crypto twist, he said.      BitClub has long been an active player in the crypto space too. The pool claimed to receive $136,000 as part of an errant bitcoin transaction fee, of which it donated half to the Bitcoin Foundation in 2016.      The pool also apparently supported the controversial SegWit2x upgrade (which was eventually pulled) in 2017.      The FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation and IRS local field offices were all involved in the investigation.

42431267,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Fjh,1576009489,US Judge Orders UK Court to Depose Telegram's Advisor About Token Sale,"U.S. District Court Judge P. Kevin Castel in New York signed an order to Britain's High Court to depose John Hyman, Telegram's chief investment advisor.      The motion, requested by the SEC last week and granted Monday, seeks testimony and documents from Hyman related to his work raising funds for Telegram's blockchain project TON. The request was filed by SEC official Jorge Tenreiro, according to the signed order.      The request for international judicial assistance asks the High Court of England and Wales to have Hyman ""appear before an examiner or other appropriate judicial authority in England and Wales"" for a deposition.      ""It has been demonstrated to this Court that justice cannot be done amongst the parties to the Action without the testimony of Mr. Hyman... This Court requests the assistance of an appropriate English judicial officer to compel the appearance of Mr. Hyman to give oral sworn testimony and to produce documents on the subject matters and for the date ranges as described in this Request,"" the order says.      The motion is a part of ongoing litigation by the SEC seeking to halt the release of the TON blockchain and the issuance of the project's tokens, known as grams. The SEC believes grams are unregistered securities, sold by Telegram to a number of notable American investors and ready to flood the U.S. capital market.      Telegram refuted that charge, saying it had sought guidance from the SEC on how to avoid having grams classified as securities but didn't hear from the regulator. Telegram registered its token pre-sale as an exempt offering under the Regulation D in February and March 2018.      The court previously requested the depositions of Telegram's leadership, including founder and CEO Pavel Durov.

42431265,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Ffh,1576006200,Cryptocurrency Is Most Useful for Breaking Laws and Social Constructs,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Jill Carlsonis co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system, and co-host of the What Grinds My Gears podcast. She also works as an advisor and consultant for startups including Algorand, Risk Labs, dYdX, CoinList, and Tezos.      Why hasn’t cryptocurrency gone mainstream?      “It doesn’t scale.”      “It’s slow.”      “It’s expensive.”      “It’s volatile.”      “It’s hard to use.”      Or maybe it was never supposed to go mainstream.      This is not to say cryptocurrency is any less important, meaningful, or useful. Rather, I think perhaps we have been judging cryptocurrencies’ success (or lack thereof) according to a false metric. We would not judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.      By design, cryptocurrency does not solve mainstream problems.      Scale, speed, and cost are all examples of mainstream problems within finance, from main street to Wall Street. Credit card networks go down. Stock trades take days to clear. Wire transfers are expensive. In some situations, cryptocurrencies may offer marginal improvements on any of these issues, but more often blockchain-based systems will fail when compared to more conventional, centralized solutions.      This does not represent a design flaw. In fact, this is an intentional trade off. Decentralized systems forsake scale, speed, and cost in favor of one key feature: censorship resistance. Cryptocurrency solves problems faced by the censored who, by definition, are not the mainstream.      In particular, cryptocurrency enables individuals and organizations to make censored transactions. Procuring drugs on the internet. That’s an example of a censored transaction. Buying US dollars in Argentina is another example. Paying a sex worker. Sending money to a friend in Iran. Making an online purchase as an unbanked individual. Selling cannabis as a dispensary. Getting money out of Venezuela. Supporting dissidents in Hong Kong. The primary utility of cryptocurrency lies in engaging in financial activity that is otherwise suppressed or prohibited.      This is the stated intent of cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, described cryptocurrency as a tool of freedom. He compared it to other peer to peer networks like Tor which are similarly resilient to censorship. If we look at the anecdotal evidence, we can see that this is indeed how bitcoin is being used from China to Palestine. Furthermore, what little quantitative data we have also suggests that cryptocurrency use is higher in countries with financial restrictions. These results line up with predictions around cryptocurrency adoption that have existed for years. It is time to face this potentially uncomfortable reality: cryptocurrency is most useful when breaking laws and social constructs.    I, for one, do not want to live in a world where cryptocurrency has found mainstream use.    There exists a long history of censorship resistant and privacy preserving technologies: Signal for messaging, Bittorrent for file-sharing, Tor for web browsing. Like bitcoin, these tools are not built for the mainstream. Most people would rather use faster, slicker, glossier centralized alternatives like Facebook Message, Dropbox, and Google Chrome. But for censored people and organizations, decentralized technologies have always provided an escape hatch. For as long as they have existed, these tools have brought with them a certain level of societal discomfort. This discomfort stems not from these platforms being lawless domains -- regulations exist on the dark web as much as they do in any jurisdiction – but rather from the difficulty these platforms present in enforcing these government policies and social norms. These technologies render censored activities more difficult to stop.      Decentralized technologies can be used for good, for evil, and for everything in between. From Hammurabi’s Code through to the Patriot Act, the morality of laws has been a matter of debate for as long as they have existed. The laws of one jurisdiction are often deemed unethical and unacceptable by its citizens and those of other geographies. To say that cryptocurrency is used primarily to engage in illegal or socially unacceptable activities is not a normative statement. It is used by freedom fighters and terrorists, by journalists and dissidents, by scammers and black market dealers, by revolutionaries and government officials. It is used by civilians to break unjust laws and escape humanitarian crisis, and it is used by the policymakers who write those very same laws. And of course, the same statements can all be made regarding the original decentralized payment system: cash.      As an industry, we spend a lot of time considering how to drive mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. I, for one, do not want to live in a world where cryptocurrency has found mainstream use. For if it has, that world is a very scary place indeed.      This is not to discourage or devalue any of the work that is being done to improve decentralized technologies. Many projects in the industry are working toward optimizing away shortcomings in the technology. Layer 2 protocols promise to speed things up. New consensus mechanisms and forms of sybil resistance expect to improve scalability and reduce infrastructure costs. A myriad of applications are building more user-friendly wallets, on-ramps, exchanges, and other tools. All of these developments are important but they may never result in mass adoption. Improvements in scalability, speed, cost, volatility, and user experience may, however, make the critical difference for those who are users, no matter how fringe: the young woman in Venezuela surviving on bitcoin or the Chinese businessman using Tether for cross-border trade.      To judge cryptocurrency based on mainstream adoption is to judge it on a metric it was never designed to achieve.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALGO | ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/10/cryptocurrency-is-most-useful-for-breaking-laws-and-social-constructs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96c48f3a344d61792862b758bd5e3ca4125e549f-1542x910.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It was a brutal reversal for the scalability-focused blockchain project’s coin. As recently as Dec. 8, it traded against bitcoin as high as 570 satoshis ($0.04) from 150 “sats” ($0.01) in the first week of November, according to Binance data.       Prices started losing altitude from 14:00 UTC on Monday. What initially seemed like a textbook technical correction due to overbought conditions turned into a full-blown sell-off with prices falling more than 67 percent (from 465 to 153 satoshis) in just 120 minutes beginning midnight UTC on Tuesday.       The exact reason for the selloff is not known. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that the MATIC team had nothing to do with the price drop and the crash was likely caused by panic selling by “big traders.”       Some investors, however, believe the selloff was caused by manipulative dumping.       Bryce Weiner, founder of startup exchange Altmarket and a popular Twitter personality wrote a thread accusing the MATIC team of engineering a pump and dump scheme. Other traders believe the price drop was caused by the unlocking or release of around 248 million MATIC tokens by the team.       Sandeep Nailwal, chief operating officer and co-founder of MATIC Network, trashed allegations of manipulation and assured investors that his team had nothing to do with the price drop. He backed up his claim in a tweet noting that a majority of tokens are still in MATIC’s foundation address and that the unlocking of the 248 million tokens in question was done in a staggered manner “so there is no large sell pressure on [the] community.” The unlocked tokens amounted to just 0.25 percent of the total supply, MATIC’s official twitter account claimed.

42431272,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Frh,1575999000,"2019: The Year Washington, Silicon Valley and Beijing Faced Off Over Crypto","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Galen Moore is a senior research analyst at CoinDesk Research, focused on developing metrics and analysis for crypto asset investors. Christine Kim is a research analyst for CoinDesk. She focusses on producing data-driven insights about the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.      2019 has been a historic year for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.      Global state leaders such as President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping and the President of the United States Donald Trump have made public statements addressing the dynamics of this revolutionary tech. Traditional tech companies such as messaging app giant Telegram and social media giant Facebook have made bold promises to integrate crypto into their line of products and services.      All this is just scraping the surface of all that went on in crypto-land over the past 12 months. From our family to yours, the CoinDesk Research team presents you with what we believe are the 10 most influential events of 2019. In a later post, we'll give a sneak peak at what we’re expecting for 2020.       Key events charted against the bitcoin price and searches for bitcoin on Google      1. Ethereum hard fork: Constantinople - Feb. 28      After multiple failed attempts, the second largest blockchain in the world by market capitalization executed its sixth system-wide upgrade, also called a hard fork. Dubbed Constantinople, the hard fork was executed as two upgrades, one after the other, in order to patch a critical vulnerability discovered mere hours before the upgrade was scheduled for activation.      2. Binance hacked - May 7      $40.7 million in bitcoin was stolen from the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, Binance. Using funds from a separate pool of Binance resources called the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), all losses were refunded to users by the startup. CEO of the company Changpeng Zhao said in a letter at the time: “In this difficult time, we strive to maintain transparency and would be appreciative of your support.” Market reaction to this hack resulted in bitcoin prices dropping almost $300.      3. BitMEX flash crash - May 17      A sudden and large sell order for bitcoin through cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp caused bitcoin prices to drop overnight by 15 percent. Going from $7,700 to $6,600 in just 15 minutes, the positive mood amongst cryptocurrency traders changed drastically overnight. The cause of the flash crash is still highly speculated and debated in the crypto industry.      4. Libra unveiled - June 18      This summer, social media giant Facebook unveiled its first and only cryptocurrency project called Libra. Libra is architected to be a permissioned blockchain network able to facilitate cross-border payments through its “low-volatility” cryptocurrency. Shortly after the Libra unveiling, U.S. regulators called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about the project. How Libra development will continue moving forward in spite of regulators’ concern and hesitation is still to be seen in 2020.      5. U.S. Fed’s Powell discusses bitcoin - July 11      The Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Jerome Powell gave a testimony about Libra before the Senate Banking Committee. While he said the project raised “a lot of serious concerns,” Powell also made comparisons driving the narrative of bitcoin as digital gold. Crypto industry figureheads such as CEO of Digital Currency Group Barry Silbert tweeted at the time, “How far we’ve come,” in response to Powell’s statements about bitcoin.    This transaction 'flippening' is a milestone for the world’s second largest blockchain network.    6. Bakkt debuts bitcoin futures - Sept. 23      The Intercontinental Exchange-backed bitcoin warehouse, Bakkt, finally launched in September after several delays and over a year of questioning from U.S. regulators. Bakkt opened its doors offering physically-settled bitcoin futures for the first time to U.S. institutional investors. Three months into its launch bitcoin futures trading volumes on Bakkt hit a record high of $124 million.      7. Block.One settles SEC charges - Sept. 30      The most lucrative initial coin offering (ICO) in history was conducted by EOS blockchain creator, Block.One. This year, the charges laid against the startup by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its ICO sale, which reportedly raised $4.1 billion, were finally settled. The penalty? Block.One was fined by the SEC and required to payback 0.58% of the initial raise, which amounted to $24 million.      8. SEC halts Telegram token offering - Oct. 11      The second largest token offering in history was conducted by messaging app giant Telegram. After raising a reported $1.7 billion for its “TON” ICO, Telegram was scheduled to launch its cryptocurrency this October. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company for its unregistered securities sale and ordered a halt to token distribution. Charges laid against Telegram by the SEC have yet to be settled.      9. China’s Xi embraces blockchain - Oct. 25      President of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, gave his first in-depth remarks about blockchain technology this year. Unlike most other state leaders, Jinping encouraged China to “seize the opportunity” afforded by blockchain. He stressed that implementation of “the rule of law” into blockchain systems was integral to the technology’s development. To this end, China is currently developing a digital version of its national currency, the renminbi.      10. ERC20 transactions surpass ETH - Nov. 10      In November, the number of Ethereum-based tokens transactions exceeded the number of native ether transactions on the ethereum blockchain. First identified by blockchain data startup CoinMetrics, this transaction “flippening” is a milestone for the world’s second-largest blockchain network. It suggests users of ethereum may finally be using the technology for its intended design; that is, a development and execution platform for decentralized applications.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,"Galen Moore, Christine Kim",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/10/2019-the-year-washington-silicon-valley-and-beijing-faced-off-over-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11f0b23c43412919232c1c045594afe464a91555-1421x2560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431262,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1FXh,1575998400,JPMorgan Blockchain Payments Network Eyes January Japan Launch,"JPMorgan Chase’s blockchain payments platform looks to be expanding to Japan, and soon.      The U.S. banking multinational is eyeing a launch for its Interbank Information Network (IIN) in the East Asian nation possibly in January, executive director Daizaburo Sanai told Bloomberg in a report on Monday.      Built on Quorum, a permissioned blockchain based on ethereum and developed by JPMorgan, IIN is designed to enable member banks to exchange information in real time, allowing them to verify a payment has been approved. This, the bank says, helps reduce friction in international payments and ultimately leads to faster processing times.      The system is also a way of reducing the risk of money laundering, which is why over 80 Japanese banks have expressed an interest in joining IIN, Sanai said.      Japan has been under pressure to up its anti-money laundering game since the Financial Action Task Force found ""numerous and serious deficiencies"" in 2014.      IIN's ability to reduce delays in the payments process would allow the member banks to quickly collaborate with law enforcement in suspected cases of money laundering, an official at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank – one of those interested in joining IIN – told Bloomberg.      Sanai agreed, saying the system makes the screening of payment recipients “faster and more efficient.”      As of mid November, there were approximately 365 banks signed up for the initiative from other parts of the world, according to JPMorgan's website. OCBC became the first Singapore bank to join IIN in September. Deutsche Bank – the number one bank globally for the clearing of euro-denominated payments – also became a member the same month.      Should all 80 Japanese banks join IIN, they'd comprise the biggest group from any single nation, according to the report.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/10/jpmorgan-blockchain-payments-network-eyes-january-japan-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecd88a344c2d0d6cd33fc11891c615065558877a-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431251,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Bjh,1575991965,"Nic Carter on Quadriga, Libra and Other Suspect Projects","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Nic Carter is a partner at Castle Island Ventures and co-founder of Coin Metrics.      It’s apt that Nic Carter’s favorite book is Candide, a satirical novella published during the age of enlightenment. It’s a story of a sheltered man coming to terms with the hardships of reality. Deeply critical of the optimism of the age, the philosopher Voltaire asks in Candide, “If this is the best of possible worlds, what then are the others?”      Not a satirist himself – though he’s given it a hand – Carter is one of crypto’s most dogged critics. His rise to prominence coincided with the gaining popularity of the phrase “blockchain, not bitcoin” -- the idea that distributed ledgers are a solution to everything from world hunger to cancer. Carter isn’t convinced blockchain will usher in a utopia.      If this is the best of all possible ledgers, what’s with all the fraud?      But Carter does believe crypto – especially bitcoin – will change the world for the better. As founder of Castle Island Ventures, a venture capital operation, and CoinMetrics, an analytics startup, he’s actively investigating and investing in what he sees as the industry’s most promising projects.      We caught up with Carter in late October to discuss the industry's recent scams, the dangers of fractional reserve banking, Libra, and the effects of spending too little time in “meat-space.”            Nic, crypto has come under attack from a lot of places this year, from state actors, the media to some extent, especially after Gerald Cotten died and people lost millions of dollars. I mean, why would anyone trust it?      Cotten was such a good case study. What people thought was the case was not the case as it was reported. I was super skeptical of the original story -- that this guy just lost some keys. He basically operated a Ponzi exchange. It's really a story about fractional reserve banking and how everything goes wrong when people think an exchange doesn’t have sufficient reserves. At that point, there's gonna be a run on the bank. That’s why I really agitate for proofs of reserve. Exchanges should publish periodic attestations that they have X amount. Quadriga should be a catalyst for this. But nobody gave a shit. It was nothing to do with the security of bitcoin or custody. It collapsed because this guy was a fraudster. For whatever reason, people don't demand proofs of the actual solvency, at least with the vigor they might question banks.      Do you think this represents a systemic risk for the industry? That exchanges potentially could be operating when they're actually insolvent?      My guess is that none of the big high profile western exchanges are insolvent. Quadriga probably was the only one, because CoinMetrics has done some work evaluating trading volume versus bitcoins on the balance sheet [though an imperfect science, a ratio derived from exchange volumes and deposits acts as a “proof of reserves” to show that trading doesn’t exceed assets on chain]. We know deposit numbers generally seem to work, but some of them, like exchanges trying to get a leg up in the market, might have a big incentive to lie, cheat or play unfair. Some of them are undoubtedly insolvent. There's hundreds of exchanges worldwide, only a handful meet the BitLicense requirements in New York, which means they face real consequences if they screw up.      Would you say the licensing that Department of Finance is doing in New York state has been helpful?      It's a substitute. A paradox. Because this will cripple and spur development. I'm not some sort of decentralization fetishist. You're not meant to need to trust the government to trust that bitcoin is sound, for instance. Like if 80 percent of all bitcoins were held in exchanges which were regulated, like the end of being FDIC insured, that's literally the same model that underscores the banking system. So if we are relying on exchanges which are guaranteed by the government in some way, you can still have bailouts. You could have covert inflation. You're going to get the same banking system all over again. So it means you haven't achieved much, which is why I'd prefer instead of regulation, super aggressive transparency. Proving to depositors that they are sound is an obvious thing they can do, instead of getting the hammer from the government eventually. What else happened this year?      Libra.      Yeah, it seems that is the number one story of the year. What’s really interesting to me is that, Congress got so upset about it, I think mostly to score political points. But I think Facebook miscalculated, because they thought their messaging was about creating a global currency. We're gonna have this reserve, and we're gonna fill it with all these foreign currencies, and a little bit of dollars. Obviously, that's going to offend Congress. Because the dollar is like 70 percent of all international trade. So they're going to want the reserve full of dollars. Facebook could have gone the patriotic route, and said the Libra Reserve will be full of dollars and maybe 10 percent Swiss francs. So we'd basically export dollars abroad, which helps finance the government. It’d be good for the U.S., good for the treasury. It’d be a new vector for the dollar’s rise around the world. You could keep selling cheap Treasury bills and so on.      But they didn't do that. So, there are consequences.      The other thing I find funny is that everybody in Congress, for some reason, woke up to the threat of cryptocurrency, or non-sovereign currency, right when Libra was announced. But bitcoin's been around for 10 years, and they weren’t worried about it. They're underestimating it. Mnuchin went on Squawk Box and talked about bitcoin in the context of Libra. I guess in their minds, they don't even realize that something that is a non-corporate project can actually be viable for money. Or maybe they just surrendered some of the messaging from people like [Congressman] Warren Davidson [Representative, Ohio], who said bitcoin can't really be controlled and should just be left aside from now.      The other thing that nobody's bringing up is Ripple. Ripple and Ripple Labs are U.S. companies. They're issuing their own currency, XRP. They've sold it by the bucket load for the last six years. And they're being totally ignored. Why aren't they getting letters saying: “stop doing this.” I think it's because no one takes them seriously, but they take Facebook very seriously.      In 2018, you were bullish that the SEC would crack down on a bunch of different ICO projects.      Yeah, that’s my great shame, man. Yeah, they never did.      Yeah, and this year, we saw a bunch of new actions – Telegram just within the past few days – do you think that this phantom of the industry ended up being kind of toothless?      It was this looming specter. Our firm doesn’t invest in any tokens for that reason as well as a variety of ethical reasons – I don't like the dirty secret of the industry: that venture firms get their exit from tokens by selling them to public retail investors. In some way or another, they get a discount. They structure it in a variety of ways, but the way they make money is by drumming up hype for these things and then selling them before it becomes clear that they're obviously worthless. It's perverse, because it's an IPO for a firm that may have a patent, yet has nothing to offer. The whole thing is funded under expectation and hope, and it's not clear that there's any sustainable revenue or value accruing to any of these tokens. Period.      You know?      Maybe Bitcoin just about works. But we don't even know how to value it. Every other smart contract chain you're talking about, how do you value those things? Nobody has a good answer. The fact that the investors in these things know their exit comes from retail, which still happens, makes it profoundly unethical. Like even Ripple which has these quarterly disclosure reports where they say how much extra XRP they sold? They can't even get those numbers right. CoinMetrics looked in and found serious discrepancies between the on-chain stuff and what the disclosure of 100 million XRP. From the start of my serious involvement in this industry, I thought for sure there would be serious fines. And the perpetrators would be banned from the securities industry or from holding positions as directors of a company. And yeah, that hasn't been the case. It makes me think that maybe we're dealing with a S.E.C. that is super risk-averse and doesn't want to get into costly litigation, unless they think they have a slam dunk. If I had to guess, I think there might be something more coming down from the SEC.      Are there any token projects you see as legitimate?      Professionally speaking, we are a venture fund. We absolutely could back startups building on other chains. There's valid things being done on other blockchains. In terms of the monetary use case, I think bitcoin is gonna be the winner for the foreseeable future. But there will be a lot of smart contract chains fighting it out down there, and one of them will probably get meaningful usage at some point. We're still figuring out the basics, man. Custody, key management, exchanges. They are corrupt. Merchant service is stuff like that. There's still opportunity, sure. Ultimately, it'll be nice to start seeing building on lightning. There are half a dozen startups that are targeting lightning.      What do you think of [the dangerous idea of] accelerationism?      I'm interested in Curtis Yarvin’s decentralized web project. It's not just about money. It's society. It's not just owning your land. It's laying claim to your identity. If you think about your Twitter handle as a plot of land, or the property that you improve upon and put work into...your social graph, then [you can say how it could valuable]. Ultimately, I think social media is not going to make it. And we're gonna get something like Urbit or some other federated model like Mastodon to organize a virtual society. It allows you to control your own data in a home server. Someday, optimistically, I think that's gonna happen in the real world. Like an exit from the state. We'll have our own states.      Decentralized things, or at least bitcoin, represent something philosophical that’s an advancement in human thinking and in human society. Others have called it a truth machine that exists independently of the state.      I think bitcoin isn’t actually an end in itself. It's one of the most critical innovations that we've ever developed. The first being when people realized they could encode information by scrawling it down on clay cylinders in Mesopotamia and give information persistence. Blockchain is just a sophisticated version. I bristle a little bit at “truth machine” just because it's, like “garbage in garbage out.” Also, it gets abused a lot in a non-bitcoin context. There's not a lot of guarantees in blockchain. You need to attach a computational, real world cost to the job of including information on the ledger to make sure that the information is good.      There’s an argument that blockchains are really bad for human transactions -- that the technology will only make sense after everything is automated for computers to speak with each other.      Yeah, it's kind of hostile to humans. When humans interacted with blockchains they can mess up, make a typo. We kind of stumbled into this technology. We were progressively going more digital. If bitcoin didn’t exist, we'd have some other former virtual cash. Maybe someone would have rebooted like Chaum’s e-cash. I don't exactly know how machines would benefit from machine-based currency. I haven't really puzzled that out. People talk about electric cars paying to charge up. What's the problem bitcoin solves? It lets people that mistrust each other transact online. Machines could be instructed to trust. Bitcoin is a very cold institution. It's kind of like a machine, it's unfeeling, and just follows set rules. All of our best institutions are kind of resistant to capture, resistant to malleability.      Will the U.S. create a digital dollar this year? Do you expect more sovereign nations to create coins?      The virtualization of currency is only going to continue because it's like super pro to government objectives. They want to be able to surveil every transaction. Plus, you can't impose negative interest rates on physical cash. Right? They really want total granular control of the economy through the money supply. But something like that would kill commercial banking, and they have a quasi-monopoly and pretty powerful lobbyists, so I doubt a digital dollar would happen anytime soon.      Either way, I don't think it's good or bad for bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/10/nic-carter-on-quadriga-libra-and-other-suspect-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce084a1aeb9989f238a9add1154a53c407693504-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431244,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1BTh,1575986421,Danish Tax Agency Sends Warning Letters to Suspected Crypto Tax Evaders,"Denmark's tax authority, the Skattestyrelsen, has been sending letters to cryptocurrency users it suspects of tax avoidance, demanding a range of information about their trading activities.      In the letters, the Skattestyrelsen further asks recipients to amend previous tax returns based on their crypto activities and warns of penalties for non-compliance, according to a blog post from crypto tax startup Koinly.      The agency received permission to obtain data on the Danish users of three exchanges earlier this year, Koinly said, ultimately collecting information on around 20,000 individuals.      In the letters, crypto users are asked to provide information such as profits and losses for the 2016-2018 income period, including for crypto-to-crypto trades. Respondents must further provide the rates at the time of the trades and the purpose of the transactions. Other required information includes proof of wallets created, bank statements and a statement of current crypto holdings.      “Filing tax on cryptocurrency trades is a difficult task as crypto traders usually hold several exchange accounts & wallets and freely transfer crypto between them, so there’s no easy way to figure out what the capital gains are for any particular trade,” Koinly founder Robin Singh said.      In the blog post, Koinly said traders should take the letters seriously and respond with the required information.      ""This is just the first step in the fight against tax evasion and more serious actions are likely to be taken against investors in the future so it is a good idea to get your affairs in order as early as possible,"" the firm said.      The action by the Skattestyrelsen echoes that of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which in August sent similar letters to crypto traders it believed had misreported trading income. Recipients had 30 days to respond, but were able to disagree with the assessment.

With the move, John Whelan, head of Digital Investment Banking at Santander and chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, hailed the technology as a real-world solution for securities issuance.      In a tweet posted Tuesday, Whelan said:    ""We just performed an early redemption of our blockchain-based bond that we issued on September 10th, 2019. This unequivocally proves that a debt security can be managed through its full lifecycle on a blockchain (public in this case).""    He also provided public blockchain transactions on Etherscan as proof of the transaction, which can be seen here (issuer wallet) and here (investor wallet). In this pilot transaction, Santander was both investor and issuer.      When it announced the news three months ago, Santander said it had become the first institution to use a public blockchain to manage all aspects of a bond issuance.      The bank used a custom ethereum token to represents the $20 million bond, and settled it with another token that represents cash held in a custody account.      While other entities such as the World Bank and Societe Generale have also issued blockchain-based bonds, Santander appears to be the only entity to have automated the whole process on a public chain. Santander Security Services even custodied the cryptographic keys for the tokenized security and cash.      “It’s an evolutionary step,” Whelan said in September. “There are no secondary markets yet, but we are on that path.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/10/santander-exec-claims-blockchain-success-as-bank-redeems-ethereum-issued-bond,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8935a3f1086b5cef6c5e7edfe8dbb06e80a2e915-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431238,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1BHh,1575979200,State-Owned Chinese Bank to Finance Small Businesses With Blockchain Tech,"China Construction Bank, one of the nation's ""Big Four"" state-owned commercial banks, launched a blockchain-based platform to support the financing of small businesses on Friday.      The bank aims to help small and micro companies sell their financial claims such as short-term notes receivable at a discount in return for immediate cash payments via the platform, according to a report by ChainNews.      The new platform will enable the bank to buy financial claims from factoring companies that had previously purchased the assets from small businesses, the report said.      The bank will also offer other financial services, including credit risk guarantee, and receivables management via the platform.      Many of the financial services could be used for export companies to gain short-term liquidity since they tend to go through a time-consuming process to receive the payments from their importers.      The new platform is the latest effort for the bank to develop such trade finance services on blockchain-based platforms.      The bank upgraded its trade finance platform BCTrade in October after it broke $53 billion transaction volume since its launch in April 2018.      The version of the platform expands its factoring and forfeiting services across different banking and non-bank institutions in China and abroad.

Acceptance below $7,087 would open the doors for a re-test of recent lows near $6,500.  A high-volume move above $7,870 (Nov. 29 high) is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal.    Bitcoin is again operating on slippery ground, having faced repeated rejection above psychological resistance over the last four days.      The top cryptocurrency by market value has failed to hold onto gains above $7,600 in three out of the last four days. Prices remained below that level on Sunday.      Monday's rejection above the psychological level appeared most disheartening for the bulls. The cryptocurrency had jumped from $7,440 to $7,666 in the seven hours to 15:00 UTC, according to Bitstamp data.      The upward move, however, was undone with a $283 drop to $7,383 in the following 60 minutes. The cryptocurrency ended the day with a 2.4 percent drop, engulfing the trading range seen over the last three days.      That price action is reflective of the market sentiment, which is still quite bearish. So, a deeper drop toward $7,000 cannot be ruled out.      The cryptocurrency is already charting a bearish follow-through to Monday's move. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,330 on Bitstamp, having hit a low of $7,274 earlier today.    4-hour and hourly chart    Bitcoin has dived out of an ascending trendline (above left), confirming an end of the corrective bounce from the six-month low of $6,500 seen on Nov. 25.      The downside break is backed by a bearish below-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI).      The bearish case would weaken if prices manage to rise above $7,666, invalidating the big red hourly candle with a long upper shadow created Monday.      Its worth noting that the selling volume (red bars) witnessed during that price drop was the highest since Nov. 27. So, any breakout above $7,666 needs to be backed by strong buying volume (green bars) to have staying power.    Daily chart    Bitcoin created a bearish ""outside day"" candle on Monday. These occur when the day begins with optimism but ends on a negative note, undoing or engulfing the preceding day's high and low.      Monday's outside day has engulfed the preceding three days' price action and invalidated an upside break of the descending trendline confirmed on Dec. 6. The 14-day RSI has also dropped through the ascending trendline.      All-in-all, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside.      Bitcoin risks falling to support at $7,087 (low of Dec. 4's inverted bearish hammer) in the next 24 hours. A violation there would expose recent lows near $6,500.      On the higher side, a move above $7,870 (Nov. 29 high) is needed to invalidate lower-highs set up and confirm a short-term bullish reversal.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/10/bitcoin-looks-south-after-strong-rejection-above-7600,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7ab3adea84221d8026972fcd65e9dd2a434b424-1500x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431255,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Bhh,1575972000,Saga Stablecoin Goes Live Backed by Basket of Fiat Currencies,"Saga Monetary Technologies has finally launched its SGA stablecoin, and it's already planning to break away from its pegged basket of currencies.      SGA, the basket-backed stablecoin envisioned last year by the Saga Foundation, is a long-term play tailoring to two very different goals of the crypto market: being a (relatively stable) store of value and a free-floating asset all its own, according to Ido Sadeh Man, founder & chairman at the foundation      In doing so, it seeks to answer global regulators’ growing concerns over a stablecoin that could threaten stability. Largely spooked by Libra, the stablecoin project with a clear roadmap to mass adoption via Facebook, monetary authorities around the world have said unchecked stablecoins could have wide and negative implications.      As the U.S. Federal Reserve put it, “a loss of confidence” and run on the issuers could trigger “potentially severe consequences for domestic or international economic activity, asset prices, or financial stability.”      SGA’s seemingly contradicting ambitions give rise to a complex game plan. At launch, SGA will be a stablecoin through-and-through.      Its value will rely solely on the “basket of national currencies” whose collective worth backs up SGA’s list price. Meant to mimic the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights, a currency-like reserve asset pegged to the dollar, euro, renminbi, pound sterling and yen, this “basket” will ensure SGA’s stable price.      Tokens will come into being as consumers buy in. Man said a smart contract issues new tokens to meet buyers’ orders and burns excess tokens as holders sell them back. It stores all proceeds with a network bank, the identity of which will be announced prior to launch, according to a spokesman.      Man said that reserve holder transparency will shore up any doubts regulators could have. The SGA's website will report the funds held in its reserves through daily attestations.      Its issuance model will slowly move away from the basket of fiat as holders buy in and signal their trust in its value. Over time SGA will become entirely unpegged, he said, and the value of the outstanding tokens will depend on how many are being held. This will prevent a run on the reserves, he said.      “There will always be enough money in the reserve to allow the contract to purchase all SGA tokens, although the price of SGA is dependent on the quantity of SGA in circulation at the time,"" he said.      Man also said that SGA front-loaded its regulatory due-diligence. He said SGA is in line with the European Union’s know-your-customer and anti-money laundering regulations and adheres to the Financial Action Task Force’s crypto asset guidelines.      He further said that SGA expects crypto regulation to continue to evolve.      One place it is actively evolving is the United States. In November, congressional representatives introduced legislation that would classify “managed stablecoins” as securities. The legislation is far from passing, though if it or similar legislation ever were, it could have broad ramifications across the stablecoin sector.      This uncertainty means SGA is staying out of the U.S. crypto market for now.      “Due to the current regulatory uncertainty with respect to cryptocurrencies, we have chosen to not allow US persons to onboard via our platform, at least at present,"" Man said.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/10/saga-stablecoin-goes-live-backed-by-basket-of-fiat-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/470f7ecf3ed1743ce1d6f77ab75f6d492688dfc3-1500x926.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The projection by Charles Hwang, managing member of the hedge fund Lightning Capital and an adjunct professor at Baruch College, represents a multiple of bitcoin's current price around $7,500.  Hwang wrote in a post on Medium that he assumed demand holds steady at 633,000 bitcoin through 2021, while mining rewards drop to 328,500 bitcoin a year from the current pace of 657,000 a year.  ""This sudden shift in the supply curve will most likely be the catalyst for the next bitcoin bull run,"" Hwang wrote in the post.  Lightning Capital is a small hedge fund, with roughly $500,000 of assets, but Hwang's prediction adds to a growing number of estimates from investors and analysts trying to gauge the potential impact of the halving - where the number of bitcoin mining rewards created every 10 minutes is sliced in half. The cut happens every four years, in accordance with the cryptocurrency's 11-year-old design.  Some market observers say bitcoin's first two halvings in 2012 and 2016 helped fuel big rallies in bitcoin's price, and the German bank BayernLB predicted earlier this year that the 2020 halving could drive the price as high as $90,000. Other analysts argue that, since investors know the event is coming, it theoretically should already be baked into bitcoin's price.  Hwang told CoinDesk in an interview that he considered his demand estimate conservative. He projects that 82,000 bitcoin purchases could come from online dark markets while 546,000 bitcoin could be bought through over-the-counter provider LocalBitcoins.  ""There have been many people who claim there is no demand for bitcoin,"" Hwang said. ""However, the data from LocalBitcoins and dark markets demonstrates people are purchasing bitcoin.""

The company said in an announcement on Tuesday that the EU member state regulator has cleared a base prospectus filed by the firm. With that, EU retailers who have access to the Swiss SIX and Germany’s Boerse Stuttgart exchanges can now trade various crypto-based exchange-traded products (ETP) offered by Amun.  Under the EU securities law, each member state has the ability to review and issue licenses applicable across the EU under the “single passport” rule. Sweden’s financial regulatory stamp opens Amun to a greater European retail market.  “[The approval] gives us wide access to sell directly and market directly to basically all retail in Europe,” Amun CEO Hany Rashwan said to CoinDesk.  The SFSA’s approval also green-lights the firm’s further plans to apply to list its crypto ETPs on other regulated exchanges in the EU in its bid to expand the market access.  Listing on other regulated exchanges is expected to be approved by the EU in 2020, Rashwan said. However, product listings must be approved by individual exchanges. Still, Rashwan said the firm is eyeing three of Europe’s largest exchanges for next year.  Amun currently lists seven products on the Boerse Stuttgart and ten on the Swiss SIX, all of the products being crypto-based ETPs totaling some $55 million assets under management.  It most recently launched an ETP with digital asset bank Sygnum listed under the “MOON” ticker along with a Tezos (XTZ) backed ETP on the Swiss SIX in November.  “Our mission is clear and that is to help investors more safely, cost effectively and easily invest in crypto asset classes through our crypto ETPs,” said Amun’s President Ophelia Snyder in a statement. “We are very fortunate to have finished this process within 4 months of its consultancy period.”",POSITIVE,XTZ,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | XTZ,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/10/swiss-startup-amun-wins-regulatory-approval-to-sell-crypto-etps-to-eu-retail-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cabdc5c7279f246c1726b0f8cf30c3f43d543ac3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431240,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1BNh,1575944100,"Bitmain Shifts Miner Sales Tactics, Betting Big on Bitcoin Halving Pump","Bitcoin mining colossus Bitmain has rejiggered its sales strategy to reverse a decline in market share following the return of co-founder Jihan Wu to the company's helm.      At a customer event hosted by Bitmain on Saturday in Chengdu, China, Wu appeared on stage for the first time as the sole chairman and CEO a month after regaining control. Addressing clients and partners, he presented new strategies to restore Bitmain's waning market dominance.      In essence, he proposed to sway miners to stick with Bitmain's products by having the company take on the risks related to cash flow, bitcoin price volatility and electricity costs.      As such, Bitmain is betting big that bitcoin's price will jump next year amid the scheduled halving of mining rewards, which will reduce new supply created with each block of transactions. Whether the next halving will actually spark a rally like the first two did is a subject of debate currently.      While the event was exclusive for customers, screenshots of the firm's presentation deck seen and verified by CoinDesk show that Bitmain has rolled out three main tactics to appeal to mining investors.      To begin with, it appears Bitmain has replaced its previous sales strategy, wherein customers had to pay the full amount upfront for mining equipment due for future shipment, with a tiered down payment structure.      For instance, customers that pre-order 100 to 999 miners can put 50 percent down while larger investors purchasing more than 5,000 units can pay a minimum 20 percent upfront.      The rest of the payments need to be cleared seven days prior to the actual shipment date. But the upshot is this would shift the short-term cash flow pressure away from customers toward Bitmain itself.    Co-mining    A second tactic that Bitmain plans to roll out targets those who own mining farms with power resources but do not yet have enough equipment to run at full capacity.      The firm said it will offer a co-mining agreement that runs over a year for mining farm operators to rent its flagship AntMiner S17 or T17 products. Bitmain would cover the year-round electricity cost at 0.35 yuan ($0.05) per kilowatt-hour while mining farm operators remain responsible for maintenance.      In return, Bitmain will retain 75 percent of the mining profits and farm operators will take the remaining 25 percent. Notably, if the mining revenue is less than the electricity cost, all the mined coins would go to Bitmain, the presentation deck shows.      Through this plan, Bitmain could once again increase its capacity in mining for itself – an investment that has decreased over the past two years as the company focused more on selling equipment.      CoinDesk reported earlier this year that Bitmain decreased its self-owned bitcoin hash power to just 237 peta hashes per second (PH/s) in May – an 88 percent drop from April – accounting for around 0.5 percent of the network's total power.      Yet based on the company's latest disclosure, its proprietary mining power has rebounded over the past six months to 930 PH/s as of Dec. 5, taking about one percent of the network's total hash rate.      Further, Bitmain now seeks to ease mining investors' concerns regarding bitcoin's price volatility by giving out a put option to those who make product orders in large quantities.      For example, for users who purchase 1,000 units of AntMiner S17 Pro, worth about $1.5 million, the firm will give away 62 put options, worth in total one percent of the miner order amount. Each put option would allow customers to sell bitcoin at a price of 35,000 yuan ($5,000) on March 27.      If bitcoin's price hovers higher than $5,000 by that date, it would be a losing proposition to exercise the option. If it's below the threshold, customers could exercise the option to make a profit, the size of which depends on how much lower bitcoin's price would be below $5,000 at that time. Bitmain would be the counter-party bearing the cost.    Heated competition    It remains to be seen whether Bitmain's new strategies will succeed. But the shift is a sign of intensifying competition in the mining business.      In a recent all-hands meeting, Wu admitted to his staff that Bitmain's market dominance in mining equipment and mining pool hash rate have been declining throughout the year.      And it was for that reason that he chose to return to the management of the firm by making a surprising move that ousted his co-founder Micree Zhan as chairman.      Meanwhile, competition among major miner makers in China is still racing nonstop ahead of bitcoin's halving next year with Shenzhen-based WhatsMiner manufacturer MicroBT launching its flagship M30 series of miners.      Also on Saturday, MicroBT released the new line of products. They boast a hashing power of 88 tera hashes per second with energy consumption as low as 38 joules per terahash.

Lightning is the scaling technology trumpeted as the future of bitcoin payments. With the new Nayuta Android app, users can tap into the new payment system in one of two ways: by using the baked-in bitcoin ""full node"" for added security or they can switch to a ""SPV"" version (Neutrino), which isn't quite as secure, but takes up much less space on the phone.      Nayuta claims it is the first developer to add a full node to its wallet, making the esoteric sovereignty-preserving technology a bit easier to use. They use a fork of the project ABCore, which makes it easier to run a full node on Android devices.      ""Using a full node is the only way to really know if you received bitcoin, if you don't use a full node you are always trusting somebody to a degree, whether that would be the wallet company's node or the miners,"" said Christian Moss, Nayuta's mobile app developer.      Full nodes can take hours to download, but they're the most secure way of using bitcoin as the user doesn't have to trust anyone to ensure they have the correct transaction data. Making a full node easy to run has long been a primary goal for many bitcoin developers.      ""For day-to-day, it is definitely more convenient and practical to use the wallet without the full node. However it is important to have the full node available in case the network were attacked in a similar fashion to Segwit2x with miners producing invalid blocks,"" Moss said.    'Hybrid' mode    In addition to allowing users to choose either a full node or a SPV node running in the background, there's a third ""hybrid"" mode, which allows the wallet to automatically bounce between the two.      ""With hybrid mode, during the day when you are outside your wallet gets blocks from Neutrino [the SPV wallet], and at night when your phone is charging, having wifi, and [the bitcoin full node] is running it will check those blocks are valid,"" said Nayuta CEO Kenichi Kurimoto.      He hopes this is a good way to get the best of both worlds.      ""In the bitcoin space, only a fully [validating] node is the perfect solution for self-sovereignty. On the other hand, the SPV node is superior for storage size, internet connection bandwidth, and power consumption. We think that there may exist a new good solution to this trade-off problem. Nayuta mobile wallet hybrid mode is one such solution,"" he said.      Moss is optimistic it will only get easier to run a bitcoin full node on a mobile device over time.      ""Whilst this current implementation of a full node lightning wallet is not as super user-friendly we think that research and development in this direction is a no-brainer for bitcoin. [In] the future, as smartphones become more powerful, running a full node could have a similar UX experience as running a light client wallet,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/10/nayuta-claims-its-android-lightning-wallet-is-the-first-to-build-in-a-bitcoin-full-node,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/358f7d11abd60d2108ca18a9c1b20c975cc2f7bb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
