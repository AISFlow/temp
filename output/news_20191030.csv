42382926,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tRDT,1572471931,Canadian Fund Manager to List Bitcoin Fund on Major Stock Exchange,"Canadian investment fund manager 3iQ received initial approval on its long road to launch a closed-end bitcoin fund on either the Toronto Stock Exchange or the TSX Venture Exchange later this quarter.  The firm said on Wednesday  that it received a favorable ruling before a panel of the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) for the Bitcoin Fund, noting the commission moved to direct the OSC Director to issue a receipt for a final prospectus.  “We have addressed the questions of pricing, custody, audit, and public interest issues in a regulated investment fund. We intend to refile the prospectus as soon as possible,” CEO Fred Pye said in a statement.  3iQ claims its entrant is ""the first regulated, major exchange-listed"" bitcoin fund in the world - the caveat being that other firms have launched similar products that are unregulated or on smaller exchanges. In June, Swiss-based Amun AG launched its exchange-traded product (ETP) using the Bitwise 10 Select Large Cap Crypto Index as a benchmark on the Swiss SIX Exchange.  3iQ had been working closely with the OSC’s Investment Funds and Structured Products Branch to create an investment fund allowing retail investors to participate in a regulated and listed fund, according to Pye.  New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini Trust Company LLC will provide custody services to manage the bitcoin in the fund.  3iQ partnered with asset manager VanEck to develop an innovative bitcoin benchmark from VanEck’s MV Index Solutions, a regulated index provider in developing cryptocurrency indices and data series.  VanEck withdrew its own exchange-traded fund application  to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in late January 2019.  In April  , 3iQ acquired the rights to manage First Block Capital’s funds, including the FBC Bitcoin Trust and FBC Distributed Ledger Technology Adopters ETF, while First Block has a strategic investment in 3iQ.

42382923,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tR5v,1572470754,Genesis Clocks Quarterly Surge in Cash and Stablecoin Lending,"Genesis Capital saw another jump in cash and stablecoin lending this quarter.  The lending arm of the over-the-counter trading subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG) published its latest “Digital Asset Lending Snapshot” on Wednesday, noting that the surge in cash lending was significant enough to shift the firm's $450 million lending book.  For the first time this year, BTC-denominated loans now represent less than 60 percent of Genesis’ portfolio. The cash lending program grew from 23.5 percent of the firm’s active loan portfolio in the second quarter to 31.2 percent in the third quarter. The loans were denominated in fiat or USD-pegged stablecoins like USDC, PAX, TrueUSD or USDT.  Despite bitcoin’s proportional decline, Genesis still has approximately $225.9 million in outstanding BTC-backed loans.  Matt Ballensweig, head of business development at Genesis, told CoinDesk that cash lending during the quarter was driven by demand for liquidity in the crypto industry.  This often comes from crypto-rich mining firms, who need financing to pay overhead and electricity costs. However, cash lending is also tied to bitcoin’s spot price and market sentiment.  Ballensweig said as the market shifted bullish on bitcoin’s prospects, institutional traders pledged crypto to borrow fiat to finance the purchase of more bitcoin. In what’s called a ""basis spread,"" leveraged investors capture the difference between depressed spot prices and the futures market.  “As long as your ROI [return on investment] is higher than the cost of borrowing, it makes sense to do this,” he said.  This mechanism was complicated toward the end of the quarter. Since mid-September, the forward price curve has flattened, contributing to a contraction in cash-backed loans from $160 million in the second quarter to $140 million at the end of the third.  According to the Genesis snapshot, investor interest in altcoins also grew quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by a jump in ETH and ETC-backed loans. Together, ethereum and ethereum classic now comprise 10.5 percent of the firm’s total outstanding loans.  Ballensweig said the general uptick in altcoin originations can be attributed to hedge funds and market makers gaining short exposure.  “Each quarter the compositions of altcoins fluctuate, depending on when hedge funds think there’s an opportunity for the market to retrace on those particular assets,” he said.  Genesis added $870 million in new loans and borrows in the third quarter, up 17 percent from the second. This is the sixth straight quarter that originations have increased, bringing the firm’s total amount lent and borrowed to $3.1 billion.

42382921,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tR7B,1572468318,There's Now a DAO for Deciding Which Blockchains to Stake On,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) meets decentralized governance.  That's the idea behind StakerDAO, a new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for investing in existing proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains.  Introduced Wednesday by Tezos Capital CEO Jonas Lamis, the new DAO will allow participants to vote on where to best earn rewards as validators in a given network.  ""StakerDAO is a new platform for governing financial assets,"" said Lamis. ""We want it to be secure, decentralized and compliant.""  The lead investor in the project is crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital. Other participants were not disclosed, nor was the amount invested.  ""It's about maximizing yield but it's also about carefully curating a portfolio of these underlying staking assets,"" Polychain's Olaf Carlson-Wee said.  StakerDAO will focus on existing PoS blockchains such as Cosmos, Tezos, Terra and others, he added.  Beyond the similar name, Carlson-Wee said MakerDAO (in which Polychain was an early investor) was the primary inspiration for StakerDAO.  ""The MakerDAO project is very interesting because it managed to create a DAO where the MKR token generates value to holders based on the success of an underlying DeFi smart contract system,"" Carlson-Wee said of the popular decentralized lending protocol, adding:  ""I think that model wherein a DAO can generate value based on an underlying DeFi protocol is something possible beyond just MakerDAO.""  MakerDAO is a two-token system most well-known for its DAI stablecoin, where borrowers pledge their ether to get dollar-pegged DAI in return. To get their ether back, they have to return the DAI, plus a fee payable in DAI or the MKR token.  But while MakerDAO is built on ethereum, StakerDAO will live on the Tezos blockchain.  Where MakerDAO has its MKR governance token, StakerDAO will have STKR. STKR is the vehicle through which investors can expect to make money, Lamis said.  ""Whether it be from direct profits that come [from the DeFi projects it builds] or through some token buyback and burn model like MakerDAO has, we expect profits to accrue,"" he said.  As such, STKR tokens will be offered as a security, Lamis stressed, wholly-compliant with U.S. securities law.  Abiding by the law  While full regulatory compliance with U.S. securities laws normally means restricting access to tokens to a limited group of accredited investors, Lamis stopped short of specifying what exact qualifications he imagines will be required to own STKR.  “I don’t want to get ahead of myself on how that’s going to roll out just yet. It’s not something the lawyers want to talk about yet [either],” said Lamis. “When you start dealing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, you have to be very conservative in your vision.”  Lamis envisions launching StakerDAO and its token-holder voting system by the end of 2019.  In addition, he expects the launch of new DeFi applications voted on by STKR token holders as early as Q1 or Q2 of 2020.  While these applications could include new stablecoins (similar to DAI), lending protocols and derivatives platforms, that’s not all the StakerDAO platform will be capable of doing, Lamis said.  How it works  At the beginning of each year, STKR token holders will elect five council members to make governance decisions on what projects and DeFi applications to build.  Then, on a 30-day cycle, proposals for StakerDAO council members to vote on will be introduced, deliberated on and ultimately executed.  This part of the iterative governance of StakerDAO was largely inspired from the Tezos blockchain, according to Lamis.  Having executed its first-ever system-wide upgrade finalized through a token holder voting process in May, Carlson-Wee said, the Tezos governance model was a testament to how “hard decisions” can be made in a decentralized manner on a blockchain.  Lamis added that the Tezos governance processes implemented on the protocol layer were ultimately why StakerDAO was built on the Tezos blockchain as opposed to ethereum. Ethereum currently relies on an informal and off-chain process of decision-making influenced by the collective will of protocol developers, miners and other community stakeholders.  “Tezos is by far the best-structured blockchain for managing governance over the long-term,” said Lamis. “We think it’s going to be the [most] stable blockchain for long-term governance.”  Jonas Lamis image via Tezos Capital",POSITIVE,MKR | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MKR | XTZ | DAI,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/30/theres-now-a-dao-for-deciding-which-blockchains-to-stake-on,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dac5dbeda3192cdf8893a223e3ca1d19ba092cc-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Chicago exchange revealed Wednesday that each contract would be based on one of CME's bitcoin futures contracts (which in turn consists of five bitcoin); the contracts would be quoted in U.S. dollars per bitcoin with a tick size of $25 (or $5 for reduced tick sizes); and would trade from 5:00 P.M. Central Time Sunday to 4:00 P.M. Central Time Friday.  An FAQ added  that the options will settle into one futures contract when trading ends.  CME first announced its intention to launch options contracts on top of its existing bitcoin futures product last month, targeting a launch date sometime in the first quarter of 2020, pending regulatory approval.  CME's bitcoin options will be similar to the options contracts it offers on top of other futures products, he said, and offers traders a way of hedging their risks against spot and futures positions.  CME published the specifications days after competitor Bakkt announced it would begin offering a similar product on its own futures contracts beginning in December 2019.  Bakkt announced last week that it would begin offering options on its physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts beginning Dec. 9. Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler said in a blog post that the Intercontinental Exchange's subsidiary had received customer feedback asking for the product.  In a September interview, CME global head of equity index and alternative investment products Tim McCourt said the new product was also inspired by customer feedback.  ""Where we’re at in the process, we’ve done extensive validation with members and after this announcement we’ll continue to engage with market participants who have input on how the product should be designed and …. We’ll continue to make sure it meets their needs,"" he said.  ""I think the response has been strong, we’re excited about bringing to market. It’s not too dissimilar to the futures when we are engaging with customers ... The fact that options will be listed on a regulated venue and will be centrally cleared continue to resonate with the marketplace.""

42382911,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tQtL,1572461736,Bitcoin Just Hit $1 Billion in All-Time Transaction Fees,"On Oct. 30, 2019, the bitcoin blockchain reached $1 billion in cumulative transaction fees.  “This milestone is a really cool milestone just because it shows how much people value block space,” said Bryan Aulds, founder of bitcoin wallet Billfodl. “And that it's something people don't mind paying for, which I think is really important moving forward.”  According to data from blockchain analytics startup BlockChair, the amount of bitcoin transaction fees collected annually has actually decreased in recent years. This is due to the advent of scaling solutions on bitcoin including “Segregated Witness” and the Lightning Network.  And while the cumulative amount of bitcoin transaction fees converted to USD amounts to roughly $1 billion, the amount is actually much larger if you consider the market value of bitcoin today. According to Coin Metrics data, 204808.3479 BTC has been doled out in transaction fees to miners since 2009. At today’s price, that’s equivalent to $1.86 billion.  The cumulative size of transaction fees on the bitcoin network is only set to grow larger in the coming years – especially as alternative mechanisms for rewarding miners such as block subsidies gradually decline.  “Over the long run, the transaction fees will eventually have to replace the block [subsidy],” said Jameson Lopp, CTO of bitcoin management startup Casa. “There's a reason why it's called the block subsidy in the code. It's because it is subsidizing the security of the network,” adding:  “The understanding all along is that this subsidy via inflation will have to be replaced by the people who are paying to use the network via transaction fees.”  Securing the bitcoin network  Stepping back, transaction fees play three key roles on the bitcoin blockchain – all of which serve to secure the integrity and censorship-resistance of the network.  First, attaching fees to bitcoin transactions discourages denial of service attacks, also called “spam” attacks, from slowing down the network.  “When you create a transaction, you're able to use bandwidth and write data onto the hard drive of anyone running a node on the network,” said Lopp. “If there's no cost to doing that then you can saturate everyone's bandwidth and fill up everyone’s hard drive.”  Second, fees serve to prioritize which transactions get confirmed and written onto blocks faster than others.  David Steinberg, VP of crypto mining consultancy Navier, said:  “It's very simple: you pay more, you get your transaction accepted more quickly. So that mechanism is a fair way to participate in a pending transaction pool.”  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, transaction fees also ensure transaction finality. Coupled with the bitcoin block subsidy – which yields 12.5 BTC per block and decreases by 50 percent every four years – transaction fees incentivize bitcoin miners from purposefully stalling or editing the blockchain.  Without this monetary incentive, miners could easily be bribed by malicious actors to unfairly withhold all or certain transactions from being committed to the blockchain.  “In aggregate, the transaction fees plus the block subsidy provide for the probabilistic transaction finality of the bitcoin system,” said Pierre Rochard, founder of consultancy startup Bitcoin Advisory, adding:  “The greater this finality is, the less time transactors have to wait before having confidence that the transaction will not be censored or double-spent.”  What’s ahead  “We have another 10 to 13 years of decent subsidies left before it drops away to pretty negligible amounts,” said Billfodl’s Auld.  When this happens, miners will have to start adjusting profitability measures around the comparatively more volatile values of transaction fees as opposed to block subsidies.  “You have to start thinking more about the game theory around miner profitability and what would happen if the profitability of a miner becomes a lot more volatile from hour to hour, day to day,” said Lopp. “For example, we already know there are both daily and weekly cycles of demand for block space.”  Bitcoin image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/30/bitcoin-just-hit-1-billion-in-all-time-transaction-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24ade693d55d755fd7365572ca26d99867319d76-1500x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The London-based firm claims to be the first in the world to combine biometrics with secure multi-party computation and has attracted investors like venture fund gumi Cryptos Capital, which led the round, as well as Ripple’s Xpring, Blockchain Valley Ventures and LuneX.  “We don’t want the network to spy on user biometrics,” said Paolo Gasti, Keyless co-founder and chief technology officer. “This way the authentication happens right there and wasn’t just a session replay of a previous authentication.”  The cybersecurity firm has finished beta testing and integrations with two crypto wallet customers for its first product, the Keyless Authenticator, Gasti said. The authentication technology is said to protect personal data across cloud, mobile and internet-of-things technologies.  Keyless is in the process of integrating with two other firms with the goal of launching Keyless Authenticator to the public by the end of the year, Gasti added.  Ripple's Xpring invested in Keyless because of its potential for adoption in multiple industries, especially crypto, said Xpring Senior VP Ethan Beard.  ""During our technical review, we found Keyless' solution to be clever and well thought out,"" he told CoinDesk via email. ""We believe Keyless' solution will be particularly welcomed by wallet providers and exchanges to accelerate the verification process for crypto holders.""  Using secure multi-party computation, Keyless allows the user to split up encrypted parts of biometric information – their face, voice or fingerprint – as well as encrypted parts of a machine-learning algorithm that identifies that information and sends the encrypted details to multiple nodes. The nodes are run by the user and companies on the Keyless network.  While the firm is still experimenting with the technology, Gasti expects each user to have five nodes associated with their account. Three out of those five nodes would have to come to consensus before the biometric information is decrypted.  Keyless is touting the product’s speed of authentication. While this process has been executed by scientists in 20 to 30 seconds in the past, Gasti claims that Keyless has gotten the computation down to under 100 milliseconds.  “We’ve known since the 1980s that this was possible … and we’ve been working on this for ten years,” Gasti said, adding:  “The product allows low-latency execution without having any effect on security.”  Fingerprint image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/30/ripple-invests-in-biometric-cybersecurity-startups-22-million-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ca38443a3519b4b19d624960a7797a8150ab4fd-1500x791.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382959,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tRCD,1572451203,Pay Your Friends to Protect Your Keys: One Startup's New Take on Crypto Custody,"If you’re worried about losing your private keys, try tapping your friends as a recovery network, one startup says.  Vault12, backed by Winklevoss Capital, True Ventures, Naval Ravikant and Data Collective, went live on Wednesday, offering a new passkey system for crypto-holders to secure their digital assets.  The app uses a cryptographic technique called Shamir's Secret Sharing, developed by legendary Israeli cryptographer Adi Shamir. Customers select a group of individuals, referred to as ""guardians,"" who each possess parts of users' seed phrases (the multi-word passwords crypto wallets require for asset access). If app-users lose access to their crypto assets, they can combine portions of their guardians' keys to recover their funds. Users can pay guardians ether to protect their key portions.  Chief crypto officer Wasim Ahmad told CoinDesk Vault12 has no access to users’ seed phrases and assets. The app is ""decentralized"":  ""It's all on people's individual phones and their individual devices and it doesn't pass through any servers, ... the company doesn't have any ability to see any of that. From an external risk perspective, that's a big deal.""  Co-founder and CEO Max Skibinksy described the social recovery idea as a step-change in password management.  ""Every hardware and mobile wallet to a degree passes the final security step [to] users,"" he said. ""They say, 'well we have this very secure way of operating the wallet but please keep this recovery phrase or crypto key or whatever' … [you] own the job of keeping it safe.""  Instead, with Vault12, the recovery function sits with a group of friends.  The concept isn’t new. Mobile phone manufacturer HTC has a similar social key recovery mechanism with its Exodus phone line, though users cannot pay others to hang onto their passphrases.  Vault12, which has operated in beta, will support Windows and MacOS operating systems.  Guardian ether  Vault12’s app lets guardians set prices, Skibinsky said. One user could act as a guardian for $10 per month, while another might charge higher prices but offer more exclusive services. He added:  ""We provided this mechanism in the app that owners ... add ethereum to [their] Vault and this ethereum will go in a smart contract that will monthly pay out guardians the price that the guardian set for their services, and this price will be visible to both [parties] when you set up the Vault.""  The launch product is aimed at individuals setting up their own networks, but Skibinsky said future versions would be aimed professional user-groups, including legal firms or employers.This should help reassure people with less experience in the space to hold crypto assets, he said.  Ahmad said users can replace their guardians at any point.  ""If someone keeps losing their phone, the app will tell you 'oh this person’s offline,' … and you can say 'well maybe I should swap them out for someone else,'"" he said. ""The app will handle all of those kinds of scenarios … it’ll notify you about the health of your guardians [and] about the health of your assets.""  Users can configure their systems to ensure geographical separation for their guardians and set up multiple backup devices to act as a contingency in case any guardians are unavailable, or to protect against natural disasters, Skibinsky said.

42382924,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tR9h,1572449409,Leaked Transcript Details Power Struggle Inside Bitcoin Mining Giant Bitmain,"The Takeaway:  A partial transcript of an internal meeting at Bitmain on Tuesday details a long-running power struggle that led to the sudden ousting of co-founder Micree Zhan.  The conflict between Zhan and fellow co-founder Jihan Wu came to a head in December 2018 as the company pursued a round of layoffs.  In Tuesday’s emergency meeting called by Wu, he admitted the company has had a subpar 2019, exacerbating tensions among top executives.  The abrupt dismissal of Zhan comes just one week after Bitmain filed for another IPO attempt in the U.S., according to a report by Tencent News.      A transcript of a Bitmain staff meeting reveals an ugly power struggle inside the world's biggest bitcoin miner maker that led to the abrupt ousting of co-founder Micree Ketuan Zhan.  CoinDesk has obtained and verified a partial transcript from the hourlong meeting on Tuesday. In it, Jihan Wu, a co-founder of Bitmain who started the company with Zhan in 2013, explained to all employees why he thought it was necessary to oust his long-time partner and former co-CEO.  After stepping down from day-to-day management in December 2018, Wu returned Tuesday as chairman of the company and executive director of the Beijing Bitmain subsidiary. He immediately made his presence felt.  Earlier in the day, Wu notified staff that Zhan had been dismissed from all his roles, effective immediately. During the subsequent all-hands meeting, he described a falling-out between the two executives late last year.  ""Zhan escalated what should be a disagreement on an ordinary company business decision to the level of power struggle,"" Wu told the staff.  Mounting tensions  Wu said in Tuesday’s meeting that he and Zhan have butted heads since 2015.  However, things came to a head in December 2018 when Bitmain decided on a round of major layoffs. Wu pushed for the layoffs, while Zhan initially resisted.  According to Wu, he and three other founding members of Bitmain tried to persuade Zhan to reach a unanimous decision on the layoffs, which Wu and others viewed as necessary for saving the company.  Zhan remained unconvinced, however, and tried to rally other senior and mid-level management against the layoff plan, Wu said, only to find out that most supported it.  Wu said in Tuesday’s meeting:  “Everyone knows in 2018, the company spent unnecessary and hasty investment everywhere on research and development projects and hiring dozens and hundreds of people without a second thought. Everyone supported the layoffs.”  Still, Zhan ordered a second meeting on Dec. 17, arguing that he should be the sole CEO and threatening to void stock-option incentives for whoever wouldn’t back him up.  In the end, Zhan’s second attempt failed, Wu said, but the two came to an agreement to both step down as co-CEOs and Bitmain moved ahead with the layoffs.  “I know Zhan is an insecure person and can be bitter. I chose to take a further step back and let him take the glory role of chairman,” Wu said in the meeting.  However, the turmoil caused serious divisions within the company and spooked Bitmain’s trading partners, at a time when the crypto market was at its bottom, according to Wu’s account.  “Right on that day, we had suppliers calling us to push for clearing accounts payable. The Bank of Beijing already agreed to give us credit lines but that got cut the next day,” Wu said, adding:  “Had it not been the bounce-back of the bitcoin price in later months … the company may not have been able to weather through the winter last year.”  Missed opportunities  2019 hasn’t been great for Bitmain, Wu said in Tueday’s internal meeting.  Even with bitcoin’s price rebound, Wu said the company didn’t fully seize the moment.  “Our mining equipment’s market share is declining,” he said. “Our mining pools’ dominance is also declining.”  Indeed, Bitmain’s major rival miner makers including Canaan, WhatsMiner and InnoSilicon have all been able to increase sales following the market boom this year.  Meanwhile, BTC.com and Antpool, Bitmain’s flagship mining pools, lost their long-time dominant positions to Poolin – founded by former BTC.com creators – and F2Pool. Poolin and F2pool are currently the top two mining pools in the world, based on the real-time hash rate distribution.  Calls to Zhan’s mobile number, as well as subsequent text messages requesting comment, were not answered. However, a Tencent News report said on Wednesday that Zhan has already started approaching lawyers in an aim to bring a lawsuit against Bitmain.  A spokesperson for Bitmain would not comment.  ‘Crazy’ ideas  Wu and Zhan seem to have sparred over what Wu called Zhan’s “crazy” ideas – namely doubling down on the company's artificial intelligence (AI) business, which is unrelated to bitcoin mining.  According to Wu, some of Zhan’s ideas included getting finance and accounting employees in Shenzhen to take up sales roles for AI products.  “Who will be handling our book in Shenzhen? How are we going to present the financial data for [an] IPO?” Wu asked, adding:  “Recruiting 300 fresh graduates? How many staff do we have right now? Do we have sufficient resources to train them if we recruit this many people in one shot?”  He further alleged that Zhan recently proposed investing more in a business that was already “distressed” and had burnt out the firm’s core developers who are “sick at home.”  “AI is a venture investment for Bitmain,” Wu said. “It still needs a considerable amount of investment. We have to keep making money from our main business in order to have the venture investment in AI.”  Wu added:  “Some said inside the company, I’m the one who handles business and Zhan handles technology. I want to ask, between Zhan and I, who really has a love for the technology? Zhan doesn’t love technology, he loves that feeling of fulfilling his endless desire for power. He doesn’t love technology, he loves vanity. Folks, we have no options but to keep Zhan away from this company.""  IPO bloodletting  According to the Tencent News report, Bitmain has already filed an application in the U.S. seeking to go public again. The confidential filing was reportedly submitted one week before what the news outlet described as Wu’s coup.  The report added that on Oct. 28, one day before Wu’s email, Zhan was still attending a conference in Shenzhen on behalf of Bitmain to promote its AI products.  Zhan returned to Beijing after the news broke on Tuesday, but has been barred from entering the company’s offices, Tencent News said.  However, a major question remains unanswered: How did Bitmain manage to dismiss Zhan from all of his roles given that he was the chairman and major shareholder?  Prior to the December 2018 shake-up, Zhan held 36 percent of Bitmain’s holding company while Wu had just 20.25 percent, according to Bitmain’s 2018 IPO filing in Hong Kong citing data from September 2018.  Other major shareholders include founding members Yuesheng Ge (4.18 percent), Zhaofeng Zhao (6.26 percent), and Yishuo Hu (4.18 percent), as well as a trust that held 18.47 percent as the company’s employee stock-option incentive.  Other major external shareholders include Sequoia China Capital (2.7 percent), Richway Investment Limited (1.17 percent) and Sinovation (1.13 percent).

42382915,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tQvr,1572444057,CoinGecko Now Tracks Data From 20-Plus Crypto Derivatives Markets,"Cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko has added a new service tracking the growing number of crypto derivatives products.  The firm's derivatives tracker currently lists some 100 products such as perpetual swaps and futures from over 20 derivatives exchanges, the firm said in a press release, and covers data points such as price, interest, basis, funding rates, expiry dates and trading volume.  Listed derivatives can also be viewed in three separate ways, including by isolating products from specific exchanges.  CoinGecko CEO TM Lee said the firm anticipates adding more metrics in the future, including options and leveraged tokens offered by various exchanges:  “We hope to empower traders with more data that they can use to make better-informed decisions. We are excited about the potential growth of crypto derivatives and look forward to further democratizing data access as we continue to commit to the maturation of the digital asset space.”  The service does not list products from notable derivatives providers such as CME and Bakkt, as yet. The firm told CoinDesk that was down to the need for a reliable API for the data and the exchanges would likely be added soon.  CoinGecko’s new dataset follows the September overhaul of its “Trust Score” metric for exchange transparency. Originally launched in May 2019, Trust Score was a response to a report from financial firm Bitwise, which claimed 95 percent of crypto exchanges were involved in wash trading or other methods to obfusicate real trading volumes.  With its new offering, CoinGecko joins data provider Skew as one of few services to offer traders an easy way to monitor derivatives based on cryptocurrencies. The firm launched its skewAnalytics service in late September as it announced the raising of $2 million in seed funding from venture capital firms including Kleiner Perkins.

Announced Wednesday, the blockchain startups will tokenize portions of properties financed by U.K.-based Alliance Investments, which will then be opened up to investors.  Rani Zahr, CIO of Alliance Investments, said in a statement:  “Raising funds through an STO is more efficient, cost-effective, autonomous and democratic than traditional financing. We believe that we are at the forefront of a technological change that can disrupt the current funding paradigm.”  The first offering is due in Q1 2020, when tZERO will issue security tokens that represent £20 million in equity of a water-front development currently under construction in Manchester.  “This one building, a large multi-storage development, [is a] first for Alliance, but represents a large pipeline that they intend to fund using STOs [security token offerings],” Roman Schnider, chief financial officer at The Tezos Foundation, told CoinDesk.  The Tezos protocol will serve as the base infrastructure to “deploy, transfer and store the digital assets and smart contracts,” which will then be offered for secondary trading on the PRO Securities alternative trading system, an SEC-registered subsidiary of tZERO.  Other real estate developments will be tokenized over the course of several years, with the companies saying they would include residential and student accommodation, as well as commercial and hospitality properties. Financial consultant Megalodon has been tapped as an advisor for the project.

42382928,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tRFz,1572433216,Bitcoin Eyes First Monthly Price Gain Since June,"View  Bitcoin looks set to post the first monthly gain since June. The percentage rise, however, may be less than 10 percent as the daily chart is reporting signs of buyer exhaustion.  A triangle breakdown on the hourly chart, if confirmed, could yield a pullback to support at $8,820.  A high-volume contracting triangle breakout will likely yield a re-test of recent highs above $10,000.      Bitcoin (BTC) is on track to end a three-month losing streak, having recovered from recent lows around $7,400 seen a week ago.  The number one cryptocurrency is currently priced at $9,200 on Bitstamp – up 11 percent from the Oct. 1 opening price of $8,304.  If confirmed, the close would mark the first monthly gain since June, as the cryptocurrency fell by 6.27, 4.8 and 13.51 percent in July, August and September, respectively. The three-month losing trend was the longest since January 2018.  Bitcoin fell by 6.27 percent in July, ending the five-month run of gains, which saw prices climb from $4,000 to $13,880.  The October rise would be the sixth monthly gain of 2019.  It is worth noting that BTC was trading at four-month lows below $7,400 a week ago and appeared set to post a loss for the fourth consecutive month.  The tide, however, turned in favor of the bulls on Friday and Saturday, when bitcoin shot up 42 percent from $7,500 to $10,350.  The monthly gain would have been in excess of 20 percent had the cryptocurrency held on to gains above $10,000. BTC, however, quickly fell back into four figures and has witnessed solid two-way business in the range of $9,950 –$9,050 in the last 48 hours.  The technical charts indicate the probability of BTC falling all the way back below the monthly opening price of $8,304 is low. However, prices could fall to former resistance-turned-support of $8,820, in which case the monthly gain would be less than 10 percent.  Hourly chart        BTC has carved out a low-volume narrowing price range or contracting triangle on the hourly chart. A dip below the lower edge, currently at $9,100, would confirm a triangle breakdown and could accelerate the correction to $8,820.  A violation there would expose next support lined up at $8,474 (horizontal line), although a sustained drop below $8,820 looks unlikely.  Bitcoin would likely challenge recent highs above $10,000 if the contracting triangle ends with a high-volume breakout. At time of writing, the upper edge of the triangle is seen at $9,500.  Daily and 4-hour charts  The repeated failure to hold on to gains above the 100-day moving average and Monday's daily red candle with the long upper shadow indicate buyer exhaustion.  Further, the 4-hour line chart is showing a channel breakdown, meaning consolidation has ended with a downside break, opening the doors for a deeper pullback.  Therefore, the probability of BTC diving out of the narrowing price range on the hourly chart is high.  Monthly and weekly charts  Bitcoin closed well below the July low of $9,049 in September (above left), confirming a downside break of the narrowing price range.  The bearish pattern is still valid as prices are holding well below the September high of $10,949.  Traders, however, need not wait for a bull market confirmation above $10,949 and could adopt a bullish stance if prices manage to end the week (Sunday, UTC) above $9,725. That would confirm a falling channel breakout on the weekly chart (above right).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382910,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tQs5,1572431932,Jack Dorsey Backs $10 Million Round for Token Offering Platform CoinList,"Token offering platform CoinList has raised $10 million with backing from Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey.  CoinList announced Wednesday the closing of a Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital and joined by Dorsey and Collaborative Fund. The capital will go towards the further development of CoinList Trade, a new exchange platform, along with a crypto wallet, according to the Wall Street Journal and a company Medium post. The latest funding round follows a 2018 seed round joined by Polychain Capital and Digital Currency Group, among others.  Dorsey’s investment is reportedly his first in the platform, which the WSJ said has helped companies raise some $800 million in tokens since August 2017. A vocal bitcoin proponent, Dorsey launched a bitcoin-only developer arm at Square earlier this year and has recently come out as decidedly against the Facebook-initiated Libra project, which he said was ""not consistent"" with Twitter's values.  In a statement to the Journal, Dorsey said the San Francisco-based firm presents an honest solution for coin launches.  “Crypto needs a trustworthy platform for launching new projects. CoinList leads the industry in that role, and trading is a logical next step.”  Launching in May 2017, CoinList helps firms navigate regulatory rules concerning initial coin offerings (ICOs), a popular capital acquisition vehicle for emerging projects. Projects Blockstack, Algorand, Filecoin and Dfinity have all leveraged the firm for token offerings and distributions. CoinList's exchange is initially operating in 38 states and some international jurisdictions with support for cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), algorand (ALGO) and USD Coin (USDC).  ICOs continue to be a prime target for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Earlier this month, messaging platform Telegram’s token distribution was held up following an emergency restraining order by the regulator over the firm’s $1.4 billion offering. The SEC and Telegram are set to go to court over the token issuance Feb. 18–19.

42382920,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tR29,1572428138,Bitmain Seeking US IPO With Confidential SEC Filing: Report,"Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain is said to have confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Sponsored by Deutsche Bank, the offering was filed with the SEC earlier this week before a recent management shakeup saw the ousting of Bitmain co-founder and executive director Micree Ketuan Zhan Oct. 29, according to Tencent News.  Bitmain will now undergo questioning by the U.S. securities regulator before – if allowed – submitting an F1, a certification required for foreign companies before listing in U.S. securities markets. It's not clear how much capital the firm is looking to raise through the public offering.  Bitmain’s U.S. IPO dreams follow a failed attempt to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) in 2018. The mining giant’s application lapsed in March 2019 and was not re-filed. Bitmain declined to comment on the lapsed application at the time.  To increase the firm’s chance of a U.S. listing, Bitmain has also hired the former representative of Nasdaq China, Zheng Hua, as a consultant, Tencent News reports.  CoinDesk reached out to Bitmain to confirm the news, but a representative would not comment.  The effects of the leadership shakeup on the listing process have yet to be seen. As of the last listing attempt on the HKSE, departed executive Zhan held a 36 percent stake in Bitmain Holdings, the parent company of Beijing Bitmain Technology. Co-founder and now chairmen-of-the-board Jihan Wu owns 20 percent of the firm.  Bitmain's U.S. IPO plans come alongside a notable investment in the region. Earlier this month, the company opened a new mining plant in Rockdale, Texas. Beginning at 25 megawatts for dedicated bitcoin mining, the converted aluminium smelter plant has the potential to scale up to 300 megawatts.  And just two days ago, miner manufacturing rival Canaan also filed for an IPO with the SEC. The offering prospectus indicates it intends to list on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol ""CAN"" and sets a placeholder amount of $400 million for the raise.

42382929,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tREj,1572426032,Binance CEO: 'Russia Is Our Key Market',"MOSCOW – The line for selfies with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao seemed endless, even though it was the second photo op of the night.  The cryptocurrency exchange mogul, known as CZ, had already taken photos with Russian fans before the meetup started, and he kept smiling at cameras and shaking hands for half an hour after it ended.  It was CZ’s first visit to Russia, and the turnout showed his popularity with the local crypto scene. The concert hall of the Radisson hotel in central Moscow could hardly fit the roughly 700 people registered for the Oct. 21 event.  The warm feelings were mutual.  ""We are always looking for partners in any community, especially in Russia,” CZ told CoinDesk before his talk. “Russia is our key market, one of the most active markets in the global blockchain space.""  When asked on stage who will have the most influence on crypto in the near future, he mentioned Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, drawing laughs from the audience. It was a winking reference to the indecisiveness of Russian regulators.  “In America, the regulators are very distributed, and China is not going to move any time soon,” CZ told the crowd. “There is a potential bill in Russia that may pass very soon, and it will be a good thing for the industry.” (The bill in question is currently dormant in the Russian Parliament.)  Russian expansion  Over the past year, Malta-based Binance, among the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has been expanding aggressively around the world.  It’s opened fiat-to-crypto exchanges in four jurisdictions: Uganda, Jersey, Singapore, and the U.S. last month.  The exchange also launched a fiat on-ramp for the Nigerian currency niara (NGN) and most recently announced that Russian ruble deposits are coming.  But that’s just the start of Binance’s plans for Russia, where CZ told CoinDesk he wants to open an office.  “There is a very strong programmer talent [here],” he said. “On this trip, it is very clear to me that we should look into the developers’ office, not the commercial office, not just yet.”  Further, Binance is looking to bring its stablecoin project, Venus, to Russia.  “We are also working with other potential stablecoin issuers pegged to fiat currencies,” CZ said. “In every location we’re doing that, in Russia specifically, we’re looking for those partners as well.”  The Russian government announced it was working on a national cryptocurrency, the so-called crypto ruble, in January 2018, but since that time, there have been no updates on the project.  Fiat on-ramp  Dealing with fiat is a tricky part of doing crypto business in Russia, as cryptocurrencies have no legal status in the country yet, and crypto-related companies usually register as providing IT services and the like.  Only a handful of smaller exchanges like EXMO, Yobit, Livecoin and Kuna offer ruble deposits via partnerships with acquiring services that facilitate electronic payments and take care of the fiat bank accounts.  Without naming names, CZ said Binance is in talks with banks and acquiring services in Russia to provide a fiat gateway for the ruble.  “We’re basically doing what other exchanges are doing here, in Russia,” CZ said. “We are discussing with banks, but it’s not official yet. The banks are at a very early stage. Payment services will probably come up first.”  In fact, the ruble deposits were expected to be up and running already, CZ said, but technical issues delayed the launch by a couple of weeks – Binance is tentatively planning it for early November now.  Other initiatives  Meanwhile, CZ said he’s happy with the performance of its new business partner, Binance U.S., which opened in September. Currently, the platform sees about $14 million in daily trading volume, according to the market data websites CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko and Cryptocompare.  The Nevada-licensed trust company Prime Trust provides the fiat on-ramp and banking relationship for Binance U.S., CZ said. (Prime Trust isn’t FDIC-insured, but it has accounts with institutions that are.) He is hoping that institutional investors will ultimately do the majority of trading on the U.S. platform.  However, institutions are highly interested in trading derivatives, and this option is currently unavailable for U.S. traders: a warning about it pops up in front of any new user trying to sign up for Binance Futures.  The futures platform, nevertheless, has been gathering speed during its first months of existence, even surpassing Binance’s bitcoin spot market on some days. To fire up things even more, the exchange added an unprecedented 125x leverage for futures contracts earlier this month.  This leverage, higher than what’s available from other bitcoin futures venues, raised some eyebrows and sarcastic tweets which suggested that 125x is a perfect chance for traders to get “rekt.” CZ says the unprecedented high leverage is something the Binance users have been asking for, and would differentiate the exchange from competitors.  “It’s a little bit of marketing, a PR game as well, but you also want to be a little bit innovative,” he said, adding:  “We copy a lot of stuff from a lot of people, but we also want to be a little bit different.”  CZ image courtesy of Binance",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/30/binance-ceo-russia-is-our-key-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd3f541d675102255f2916d8efcfd66e78c2aa0f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382922,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tR8R,1572423018,Livepeer Prepares to Unlock New Way for GPU Miners to Earn Crypto,"By the end of this year, GPU miners could have a fresh new way to earn crypto without any opportunity cost.  Decentralized video-streaming startup Livepeer debuted its Streamflow testnet on Tuesday, and miners and developers are working with the company to test video transcoding using idle chips already built into graphics processing units (GPUs).  ""The millions of GPUs out there that are mining cryptocurrency, ethereum, zcash, grin, monero, they have video encoding on those chips that can't hash cryptocurrency,"" Doug Petkanics, Livepeer's founder, explained to CoinDesk in a phone call. ""They are sitting there doing absolutely nothing.""  In other words, if a mining farm is mining monero, it can keep doing that. Once Streamflow goes live on the ethereum mainnet, however, the GPUs in that farm will be able to also earn both ETH in fees and Livepeer's LPT token in block rewards for using the currently untapped video transcoders.  ""For miners, it's additional revenue that comes at almost no opportunity cost,"" Petkanics said, something Livepeer has been promising for some time now. Miners can now start testing the current implementation to help the Livepeer team get it to a reliable build.  Testnets can also inspire more interest from developers as well, as Electric Capital observed with its most recent report on developer activity in crypto.  To be clear, the current Livepeer alpha is not yet using GPUs. Petkanics wrote in an email:  ""The current version of Livepeer only supports CPU-based encoding. So the 'miners' performing the work are not simultaneously mining cryptocurrency like they can in the new release.""  Forward progress  Livepeer is funded by an $8 million seed equity round. It famously innovated on an early token distribution using a technique called ""Merkle mining,"" where network participants put forth some of the resources required to distribute a token.  People who hold Livepeer's LPT tokens can delegate them to network participants to earn more crypto and provide security to the network. If Streamflow works, nodes should have a great deal more work to do.  Streamflow ""should make a scalable, reliable, cost-effective network for encoding,"" Petkanics said. For background, Livepeer takes video streams and ""transcodes"" them into the many formats that people might view them on. So a TV gets a different stream than an iPhone 5S, so the company providing the stream isn't wasting lots of unnecessary data bandwidth for a viewport that can't adequately display it.  The software will move to the ethereum mainnet ""once we achieve enough reliability and no one's value is at risk for participating with this software,"" Petkanics said.  Micro 'lottery tickets'  The new update protects users' value in another way as well. It's using probabilistic micropayments in order to pay miners. This means that miners are effectively getting paid in lottery tickets.  ""Over time you will earn exactly what you wanted to earn and I will pay exactly what I wanted to pay, with high probability,"" Petkanics said.  The secret is that what a participant ""earns"" are lots of chances at getting paid as they provide work. Most of these are worthless and no transaction is needed to verify that. When one is not worthless, then the miner can redeem it for transaction fees. Statistically, this one payout should usually be equal to what all the prior worthless lottery tickets would have been worth if each one had a fair payment attached.  The Orchid protocol, for private bandwidth sharing, is working on a similar approach, but the basic concept has been around for some time.
