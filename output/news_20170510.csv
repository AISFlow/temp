On 4th May, the New York-based exchange posted an update to its website, stating that it was suspending withdrawals, deposits and existing orders. Yet the statement was short on details, and as of today, the exchange has not yet detailed its reasoning behind the stoppage.    When reached for comment, founder Ilya Subkhankulov said that he was in the process of drafting an update on the situation, though when asked about the timing he said that ""an update today is unlikely"".  In the meantime, users have continued taking to social media to criticize the lack of clarity. Some users reported that when they were able to log in to the site, their balances showed no funds. At least one user claimed to have sent complaints to federal agencies like FinCEN and the Federal Trade Commission.  According to Subkhankulov, the reported issue is ""an unintended side effect of the system-wide freeze"".  Celery was launched in 2014 by BTX Trader, a multi-exchange trading platform.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42399858,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvZN,1494440110,More German Prosecutors Join OneCoin Investigations,"Germany's fight against OneCoin, a digital currency investment scheme widely believed to be fraudulent, is heating up.  German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung has published new details about the government’s efforts against OneCoin, reporting that prosecutors from the State Criminal Police Office of North Rhine-Westphalia, as well as the city of Bielefeld, have opened new investigations.  As CoinDesk reported in April, BaFin, Germany’s top financial regulator, seized the accounts of IMS International Marketing Services GmbH, which is accused of functioning as a money laundering channel for OneCoin. BaFin later effectively outlawed OneCoin just days later, issuing cease-and-desist letters to companies connected to the scheme and its backers.  What this means: When BaFin seized the accounts of IMS, they took control of roughly €29m. Yet, as the regulator said at the time, they believe as much as €360m changed hands between December 2015 and 2016 – an indication that the scheme found investors during its height.  According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, the prosecutorial investigations center around seven unnamed people and whether they made false promises about big profits from investing in OneCoin. Investigators also want to know to the extent to which they violated Germany’s payments services statutes – which connects them to what BaFin has done thus far – and may expand the scope beyond those parameters.  Further, as BehindMLM reports, the crackdown is already having an impact, with two events in Germany related to OneCoin being cancelled this week.  The big picture: Europe is quickly becoming an inhospitable environment for OneCoin.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, regulatory or law enforcement bodies in a number of countries are known to be investigating OneCoin. These include Germany, Hungary, India, Italy and the UK.  Several central banks in Africa have issued warnings in the past, though the extent to which their respective governments are investigating the scheme is unknown at this time.

42399861,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvdJ,1494435607,Litecoin Successfully Activates SegWit,"A long-debated change originally intended to improve bitcoin has now locked in on the lesser-known cryptocurrency network litecoin.  Segregated Witness (SegWit) has been the subject of bitcoin's infamous scaling debate for a couple of years now, but it's now getting an opportunity to shine on litecoin, or so its supporters argue, leading some to believe that it will now help reveal whether concerns about the change are valid for bitcoin.  The change first locked-in two weeks ago, leading to two more weeks of waiting to ensure demand for the upgrade remained consistent. Earlier today, the change activated at block 1201536.  What does that mean? Litecoin users can now begin using the new style of transaction, and there has been at least one such transaction so far.  However, most advocates are excited about the new technologies that can now be built on top of a network with SegWit. For example, the Lightning Network, which could boost litecoin transactions by as much as a million times, can now hypothetically be used to move real money.  Litecoin developer Loshan T told CoinDesk:  ""I think today will be a great day for pushing more awesome tech into Litecoin. With SegWit activated on litecoin's mainnet, I cannot wait until we deploy confidential transactions, Lightning Networks, MAST and Schnorr signatures.""  Still, these projects are rather early stage. Developers from the startup Lightning Labs, at least, seem to think that it’s too early to talk about sending money over the still-experimental network and plan to continue improving their code first.  Uncertain future  It's unclear what exactly this activation means and what role litecoin will play in the future.  Loshan mentioned that some onlookers are skeptical that litecoin really needs the Lightning Network, since litecoin transaction blocks are not yet full, but pointed to trustless cross-chain transactions between bitcoin and litecoin as a potential Lightning use case that the developer believes could benefit both cryptocurrencies.  One piece is that wallets will need to upgrade to support the type of transactions. Multi-signature wallet mSIGNA, for example, has done so.  Further, there were some worries about the activation – some logistical and some political. Earlier high-level analysis showed that developers are unsure whether all miners and exchanges are completely prepared for the change.  Time will tell if these concerns mean anything. Less than an hour after the change, the cryptocurrency appears to be operating normally.

42399854,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvWQ,1494433206,France's Government is Beginning a Blockchain Research Effort,"The French government has convened a new working group focused on blockchain.  The effort is being spearheaded by France Stratégie, a commission that reports to the office of French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve. Founded in 2013, France Stratégie acts as a kind of research and strategy development office on socioeconomic issues.  What they're doing: According to a statement from France Stratégie, the working group will:  Research the blockchain implementations that exist today  Explore the benefits (and costs) of public-sector applications  Propose how the French government can ""support its development"".  The working group will meet on four occasions between May and September, and is set to deliver its findings in October.  Who's involved: A list of participants in the working group details how the effort represents a mix of public-private cooperating, drawing members from both government agencies and startups working with the tech. Specific agencies include France's Prudential Supervisory and Resolution Authority and DINSIC, an information technology office that reports to the Prime Minister.  All told  , nearly 40 people are taking part in the working group.  Why it matters: It's the latest sign that France is moving to support at least some applications of blockchain.  While the passage of a statute allowing for the issuance of mini-bonds via blockchain last year might still be the most consequential development to date, the scope of the working group – and its proximity to the head of the French government – suggests that the project could result in some significant findings.  The news also builds on the work already being down by the Banque du France, the country's central bank, which in the past year has tested prototypes centered around the tech.

42399849,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvRV,1494427516,EU Parliament Report Explores Blockchain's Social Impact,"Is the spread of blockchain representative of a shift in Europe's social values?  That's the question posed in a new paper from the research arm of the European Parliament. According to the authors of the publication, the technology's biggest impact ""could be through its contribution to subtle changes in broad social values and structures"".  What they argue: After touching on the more material costs of running bitcoin's blockchain – namely the energy costs associated with mining – the authors look at the socio-cultural drivers of interest in a technology that prioritizes transparency and access to information.  As they write:  ""To say that blockchain's popularity is due to increasing social trends to prioritise transparency over anonymity, to diminishing trust in traditional financial and governance institutions, and to expect greater levels of accountability and responsibility in all aspects of our lives, is only part of the story. Nevertheless, using blockchains instead of traditional ledgers actually invokes these very shifts in society.""  The context: Observers of European politics since the financial panic of 2008 will have undoubtedly noted an increase in anti-government sentiment, particularly toward the EU itself.  Political campaigns such as the vote to take the UK out of the EU and right-wing politician Marine Le Pen's failed bid to secure the French presidency earlier this month are just two examples of the ""diminishing trust"" highlighted by the report.  What comes next: According to the report's authors, policymakers have a few approaches they can take in this light.  Three proposals center on some degree of adoption of the tech by European governments, including a more proactive path in which they ""actively encourage development and innovation of blockchain technology by granting legitimacy to their products"".  On the other hand, policymakers could take the reverse approach and refuse to recognize the legality of smart contracts, for example.  Read the full report here.

42399860,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyveI,1494423921,Webjet Ethereum Pilot Targets Hotel Industry's 'Dirty Secret',"Publicly traded online travel service Webjet is in the final stages of turning an internal blockchain pilot into a finished product.  Designed to track the inventory of hotel rooms around the world using a private version of the ethereum blockchain, the app was built using Microsoft Azure's blockchain-as-a-service sandbox.  Whereas most applications of distributed ledger technology are being built to cut out unnecessary middlemen or otherwise increase efficiency, Webjet managing director John Guscic said his company has another target in its sights.  In addition to cracking open a new stream of potentially valuable data on travel trends and more, Guscic said Webjet's blockchain application has been designed make it easier for the half-dozen or so intermediaries between a consumer and their hotel to get paid for the roles they play in facilitating a booking.  Speaking at the Microsoft Digital Difference event in New York City, Guscic told CoinDesk:  ""That's the industry's dirty little secret. That 4% of volume doesn't get paid for. So ... that's what we're trying to solve.""  The opportunity  On average, the Australia-based firm (valued at AUS$1.18bn) books about 750,000 rooms per year in the US, New Zealand, the UK, Canada and Mexico, with millions more searched daily.  Of those, Guscic explained, about one in 10 room bookings experience some sort of manual intervention, and, for one in 25 bookings, service providers including travel agents, travel retailers and travel wholesalers don't get paid for the services they provide.  In addition to making up the lost revenue, Guscic said the pilot, which is currently being used by Webjet employees for internal transactions, also aims to achieve more traditional blockchain promises.  In the existing online travel booking industry, the reconciliation process can take as long as a month, Guscic said, during which time service providers and customers alike can sit in limbo unable to prove whether a service was provided, and at the right price.  Addressing the issue, Webjet created a blockchain dashboard that uses a smart contract built on the ethereum blockchain that is accessible directly by third parties without the need of an API. According to Guscic, the app means the various parties in a travel transaction can know immediately that an obligation was fulfilled.  ""It's an opportunity not to compress the supply chain,"" said Guscic ""But to make it more seamless, and by making it more seamless you take costs out of the process to enable each part of the network to work more efficiently.""  Business shift  First revealed in February, the upcoming industrial-grade blockchain application is part of a larger push by Webjet into a new source of revenue.  Following on the heels of Webjet's shift to Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform in 2012, the travel booking company expanded from providing hotel rooms directly to guests, to helping partners including the International Air Travel Association (IATA) aggregate their hotel inventory for sale around the world.  In 2013, that new B2B revenue stream resulted in a net loss, but, by the following year, it was generating revenue helping others track and sell hotel rooms. Then, in fiscal year 2016, Webjet generated AUS$155.5m in revenue, $31m of which was from B2B sales.  To help push those margins further, Webjet first spoke with Microsoft in May 2016, and over the course of four 'hack days' at which the tech giant's engineers worked side-by-side with Webjet staff, the application currently being tested internally was created.  The completed blockchain application is expected to launch later this year with three partners on board.  According to Guscic, early versions of the app actually worked too well, and generated more new kinds of data than the employees could analyze. As a result, some of the features were toned down to focus primarily on providing insights on travel trends and demographics.  Guscic said:  ""Our initial experimentation with blockchain contributed to the chaos of enormous data, so we continue to refine that process.""

42399851,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyvSU,1494418510,Why Project Indy is Using Hybrid DLT to Rethink Digital Identity,"The single biggest challenge for digital identity systems has been to create counterparts to the secure physical identifiers we use today.  For instance, there has yet been no effective online equivalent to producing your driver's license at the drug store. And while there are traditional identifiers most people are familiar with online (like the Facebook login), these systems raise key questions about the centralized registries trusted by consumers and the control they have on the systems that secure them.  Now, Project Indy, a blockchain initiative developed by the Sovrin Foundation, is trying to fix this problem using a hybrid distributed ledger platform. As described, the ledger would be public, but in order to interact with it, an invite would be required.  According to Phil Windley, chair of the Sovrin Foundation, the idea is to ""strike a middle ground"" between permissionless ledgers like bitcoin and permissioned options like R3's Corda.  ""One of the key philosophies of Project Indy is that private information is never written to the ledger, even in encrypted form,"" said Windley. ""It gets anchored on the ledger so there's proof that it existed on a certain day.""  Elements of identity are then updated on the distributed ledger to be verified by an agent. In the example of a digital driver's license, an agent could be the Department of Motor Vehicles (in the US). However, the idea is that the system is used by third-party operators, but not owned or controlled by them.  Project Indy subscribes to the concept of 'verifiable claims' – a method of cryptographically authenticated online identification, where no private data is written to ledger, returning some ownership to the user.  Windley explained:  ""With a verifiable claim, this is now a cryptographically signed self-contained set of data that I can hold. Now when I come to the pharmacy and need to prove I'm over 18, my system can prove that to the pharmacy in a way they can trust, they can verify, they can validate that it was the DMV that issued that.""  It's worth noting that the World Wide Web Consortium has set up a verifiable claims working group to encourage interoperability among different players building decentralized ID solutions.  Dawn of decentralized identity  But why is centralized identity a problem? And what does blockchain do to provide a solution?  Online identity has been a ""disastrous situation"" for some time according to Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger, the blockchain group overseen by the Linux Foundation.  Project Indy recently joined Hyperledger, and now hopes to get the ball rolling on this new form of identity with some practical use cases. A prominent use case would be in the financial services sector, replacing fractured systems that are prone to privacy breaches and leave the user with little or no control over their identity data.  The mission statement of Project Indy is restoring control to people's online identity by moving away from centralized services.  Windley told CoinDesk:  ""By putting this on a ledger that's operated by a number of different players under governance rules, nobody owns its, everybody can use it, anyone can improve it.""  Kicking the tires  In partnering with Hyperledger, the Sovrin Foundation is contributing Project Indy's code to the non-profit consortium – a move Windley believes will hasten development of the project's proofs of concept (PoCs).  ""We have running code that can serve as the basis for prototyping, experimenting, hacking, certainly for finding holes, both security holes or conceptual holes,"" said Hyperledger's Behlendorf.  Like many distributed ledger technology efforts, the financial services sector is showing the most interest in Project Indy so far. And, according to Windley, there are six financial services PoCs already underway.  ""Probably the first one that's going to be launched is one that identifies people in call centers, which isn't the sexiest application you can imagine, but it’s a real problem that financial institutions have,"" he said.  Another banking use case is compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Identity ledgers would reduce the regulatory costs felt by financial institutions in this regard, claimed Windley.  Healthcare is also a potential beneficiary of the tech. The project envisages a system where doctors who move between different hospitals could hold their own identifiers to verify their credentials.  Still, Behlendorf is more open-minded about where the project might lead, saying:  ""Right now we are very eager for people to come in and kick the tires.""

42399838,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysbO,1494414018,"Bitcoin Miner Canaan Raises $43 Million for Blockchain, AI Push","China-based Canaan Creative, maker of the Avalon bitcoin mining chip series, has raised 300m yuan (roughly $43m) as part of a bid to diversify its business.  Valuing the firm at ¥3bn (approximately $430m), the Series A round saw the participation of Jin Jiang International Group, Baopu Asset Management and Tunlan Investment.  The investment is the largest-ever announced by a bitcoin mining business, though one that's in line with moves from Canaan's competitors. One of the largest makers of ASIC chips specialized for mining, the firm's diversification follows competitor Bitfury's transition into software services and pursuits centered on enterprise blockchain offerings.  For Canaan, however, the funding will serve as a means to facilitate the exploration of computing chips for use in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and potentially, into hardware solutions for alternative cryptocurrencies that require different chips to optimize the mining process.  Spokesperson Steven Mosher told CoinDesk:  ""We are also looking at other currencies and other places where we can apply that capital. We can apply it to big data, we can apply it in AI or in IoT.""  According to Mosher, the company believes AI will provide the most fertile ground for the Canaan's expansion, and he projected that the returns could be ""as good as"" the company's earnings from mining chip sales. Further, he suggested that given the interest in intersections between the two industries there could be ""synergy down the road"".  Mosher also hinted at other products aimed at alternative cryptocurrencies.  ""We have new products in the pipeline both on the proof-of-work side of things, and also around the whole blockchain ecosystem,"" he said.  Such diversification is not uncommon these days, as many mining pools, for example, offer software that enables mining computers to coordinate in the race to secure various blockchains and compete for their rewards.  However, it's notable that the shift comes during a time when the alternative cryptocurrency markets have emerged as one of the more active areas of ecosystem growth.  So far in 2017, the combined value of all public cryptocurrencies, bitcoin included, has swelled 180%, rising to $51bn from roughly $18bn at the start of the year, according to data provider Coinmarketcap. If that sounds high, however, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin has seen even more robust growth.  The value of these assets, including popular alternatives like litecoin and ether has risen to $22bn, up from just over $2bn at the end of 2016.  'No pivot'  Mosher, however, stopped short of characterizing the strategy as one that means the company is diversifying away from bitcoin. In part, Mosher said this is because there is a natural upward bound on how much mining firms can make in the bitcoin ecosystem alone.  As an example, he cited the fact that mining chip producers have to strike a tricky balance between hardware sales and deploying those chips themselves in data centers for the purposes of securing the bitcoin blockchain.  ""If you create more hashing power, you're competing against the other side of your business,"" he explained. ""You're making money from your customers, but you're hurting [your] mining operation [by raising bitcoin's difficulty calculations].""  Canaan, for its part, only makes chips and doesn't use them in mining data centers, as do competitors Bitfury and Bitmain.  Mosher said he expects more bitcoin miners to follow this path due to the fact that the business is lucrative enough to fund other efforts. (A study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, for instance, projected that more than $2bn has been earned from mining since the network began running in 2008).  ""We're all making money on the main chain and the question is, what are we doing with that money?"" Mosher said. ""Blockchain has been so good, such a great opportunity, and it throws off a good amount of cash, it's about staying strong and robust.""  Future IPO?  The funding also follows a time of transition for the company, which was nearly acquired by electrical equipment maker Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric in 2016 in what would have been the industry's largest-ever acquisition if completed.  At the time, Shandong Luyitong was said to have offered ¥3.06bn to acquire 100% ownership of the firm in a move that would have made the combined entity a publicly traded company. The sale was ultimately blocked in September of that year by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange due to ""uncertainties"", though not ones that reportedly stemmed from its bitcoin activities.  In statements, Mosher still described the Series A as a ""pre-IPO"" round, though he stopped short of providing any further details.  If pursued, Canaan would be one of the first bitcoin startups to IPO in the traditional market, a strategy that was also put forward by Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov in 2014.

42399840,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysgJ,1494410408,Ethereum's Double-Edged Sword: Will a Rising Price Hurt Users?,"Ethereum supporters have every reason to be elated.  Not only has the value of the platform's ether tokens jumped by about 900% since the start of the year, but the public blockchain has recently attracted attention from banks and tech behemoths. And while ethereum supporters have long argued that the global computing platform would help to form a new kind of internet, a wave of innovators are now trying to deliver on that ideal.  The problem is that there might be downsides to this increase in price and increase in attention. Namely, as the price increases, ethereum apps grow more expensive to use.  That's because on ethereum, users need to pay directly for the computational power they use, whether to place a bid on a prediction market or use new kinds of decentralized Twitters and Ubers. For now, this is a different picture than, say, Facebook, the popularity of which rests in part on its 'free' platform.  Matus Lestan, co-founder of the ethereum app Ethlance, for example, recently posted a screenshot of a user looking to create a user profile on the platform – an action that cost 0.08 ETH, or $7. It would have cost ""little more than $1"" when ether was at $10, he wrote.  Given this increase, Luis Cuende, project lead at decentralized startup Aragon, told CoinDesk:  ""[I]t's very understandable that some users may be pissed off.""  The price of gas  Still, many ethereum apps, including Aragon, are in the test stage right now. So, it's unclear how many apps and users are actually impacted by this increase.  It might be more of a harbinger of future friction. Augur co-founder Joey Krug, for instance, said that users of his ethereum-based platform aren't being impacted.  ""Since Augur is currently still in beta on testnet [the higher prices haven't] affected us directly yet,"" he said. ""However, once it's live, it will indeed.""  Adding to the complexity, though, is that the prices are more dynamic than simply being affected by the cryptocurrency's increase in value.  The details are a bit thorny. First off, it's worth noting that 'gas', 'gas price' and 'gas cost' all mean different things. (Even ethereum's inventor has mixed up the terms.)  'Gas' describes units of computational power in ethereum, while 'gas cost' is used to denote how much gas is required to perform an action on the platform. A simple transaction costs 500 gas, while storing data using ethereum costs 100 gas.  These numbers are hardcoded into the software. Finally, the 'gas price' is how much each unit of gas costs in ether.  The total cost of an action on ethereum is the gas cost multiplied by the gas price. If the gas price stays the same while the value of ether increases, as has been the case so far, then the overall price of smart contracts increases.  In ethereum, miners set these gas prices. ""Miners are the ones calling the shots,"" Jason Teutsch, founder of scalability project TrueBit Foundation, told CoinDesk.  Miner pressure  Some expect that miners will lower the gas prices. Their incentive to do so, one argument goes, is that if they don't, less people will use the network and pay transaction fees. So far, though, this hasn't happened.  The gas price sometimes fluctuates, according to a chart from ethereum data site Etherscan, but has stayed at roughly the 22 to 23 Gwei range (0.000000000000000022 ETH or less than 1 cent) for the past year.  ""It's a bit of mystery to me why this quantity remains so stable. Perhaps it's an artifact of mining pool policies, but it might also reflect some average fixed cost perceived by miners,"" Teutsch said.  So, the situation could be mitigated if miners pushed down fees. Indeed, some users are currently campaigning mining pools to push down the gas prices.  Adding to the confusion, as Krug pointed out, is that users can post transactions with a fee that's less than this hardcoded price. Transactions might not go through as quickly, but he pointed out that, even at about one-twentieth of the current price, ""it's really not much slower"". The problem is that most users are simply going along with the hardcoded price.  Given this, there might be less reason to worry about an increase in prices just yet. Because blocks aren't full, in fact many of them are empty, users aren't fighting to get their transactions into a block with increased fees (as with bitcoin).  ""Gas prices aren't going down, but blocks aren't being filled either, it's a lose-lose all around,"" Krug said.  ""A large amount of this is due to developer failure to act,"" he said, arguing that developers should introduce a more dynamic gas price that is dependent, in part, on how full blocks are.  Longer term, there are other limitations to public blockchain technologies as they stand today. For example, there's a limit on the amount of computational power per block on ethereum. This limit is roughly equivalent to bitcoin's block size, although ethereum miners, again, can increase or decrease it.  Wouldn't it be simple to just reduce the gas prices while also increasing the amount of gas that fits into a block? Well, there are trade-offs: increasing the gas limit increases the burden of running an ethereum full node.  Dealing with these trade-offs is a problem bitcoin has also faced. And is, in a sense, a big element of its block size debate is centered on the community arguing about growing transaction fees.  In other words, a lower gas limit is required for ethereum to remain decentralized. But that could lead to higher smart contract prices in the long term, as more people use the platform.  Towards solutions?  In that way, you could think of these price increases as a symptom of blockchain tech's larger scalability problems, of which there are a range of projects that might help.  One such project is TrueBit, which pushes ethereum smart contract computation verification, such as more advanced computations like machine learning, to a new layer above the blockchain.  ""TrueBit is immune to some of these problems,"" Teutsch said, arguing that the platform can help with transaction throughput, as well as facilitate more advanced ethereum computations.  What does that mean in this situation? The idea is that then you don't have to settle as many computations directly on the blockchain. You'll still have to pay fees to the computers in the TrueBit market, but the idea is that you will rarely have to pay the more expensive fees required to settle a transaction on-chain.  Gilles Fedak, co-founder of distributed cloud computing app IEx.ec, noted that although their applications are already primarily off-chain, the team behind the computing platform is looking to another off-chain network, Raiden, to help with some of their problems.  In another direction, Cuende said that Aragon's business model might be an inspiration for other decentralized apps. The startup plans to pay transaction fees on the platform, shielding users from the increasing prices.  Still, all of these projects are works in progress. And until they come to fruition, or miners adopt new fee structures, ethereum smart contract fees could climb. Which is a little ironic, considering Buterin once suggestedhttps://vid.me/FMHe that bitcoin's transaction fees are too high.

The startup announced today that Obotritia Capital had committed the funds, as well as purchasing a stake in Bitbond, although the terms of that deal were not disclosed.  The investment represents the second time this year Bitbond has attracted outside capital. In February, the firm raised $1.2m from a group of angel investors. That followed €600k raised in mid-May 2015.  Bitbond said it plans to use the latest financing to further grow its network, with an eye to reaching small business and independent sellers.  ""The debt commitment by Obotritia brings Bitbond to the next level in our efforts to provide universal SME financing. The next step is to work with partners,"" founder and CEO Radoslav Albrecht said in a statement.
