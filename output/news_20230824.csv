16504480,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548706,1692918015,"Ethereum Whales Ready For Next Leg-Up After Buying 56,000 ETH","Following the crypto market crash last week, Ethereum whales look to be gearing up for a recovery as they accumulate ETH. This accumulation trend is very telling of what these large investors expect the market to do next, which could serve as an indication of what’s to come. Ethereum Whales Buy Over 56,000 ETH On Thursday, the on-chain data tracker Lookonchain took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal the activities of Ethereum whales over the last week. The post shed light on the sentiment among these large holders and showed their expectations for the digital asset. Related Reading: Which Top Meme Coins Have Held Their Value Best Amid The Crypto Market Crash? According to the screenshots posted by the tracker, four Ethereum whales went on an impressive buying that saw their balances jump significantly. Between them, they bought a total of 56,100 ETH, worth $94 million, in the last week alone. These whales identified as smartestmoney.eth, 0x3CEE, 0X5bA3, and 0x3478 bought 18,300 ETH ($30.6 million), 18,000 ETH ($30 million), 17,900 ETH ($30 million), and 2,000 ETH ($3.4 million), respectively, during this seven-day timeframe. Whales are accumulating $ETH from the bottom! 4 whales accumulated 56.1K $ETH ($94M) in the past 7 days. – 0x3CEE accumulated 18K $ETH($30M); – 0x3478 accumulated 2K $ETH($3.4M); – 0x5bA3 accumulated 17.9K $ETH($30M); – smartestmoney.eth accumulated 18.2K $ETH($30.6M). pic.twitter.com/M93Mhkpn6p — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 24, 2023 All of the whales acquired this stash over multiple transactions, withdrawing large amounts of ETH from crypto exchanges Binance and OKX. Even more interesting is the fact that these accumulations began after the market crash that saw ETH fall to $1,500, suggesting these whales are trying to catch the bottom. Is An ETH Recovery Imminent? Ethereum’s fall to $1,600 pushed the assets below critical levels for maintaining its bullish momentum. These include the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. However, it is not all bad for the digital asset going forward. As the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows, investor sentiment has been slowly but surely recovering over the last few days. This suggests that faith is returning for investors and they are beginning to put money back into the market. If this continues, then the influx could see the price of Bitcoin continue to recover, dragging the likes of Ethereum along with it. Related Reading: SHIB Burn Rate Jump 1,100% Amid Expectations Of Shibarium Relaunch Right now, the most important level for ETH to beat remains the resistance at $1,700. But if bulls are able to successfully retake this level and turn it into support, then the recovery is expected to be long-lived. Otherwise, the price of the altcoin could fall back toward $1,500. At the time of writing, ETH is changing hands at $1,664, meaning the whale investors are already sitting in profit.

According to the announcement, the collaboration between PancakeSwap and Linea aims to provide a seamless trading experience with lower fees, increased liquidity provider returns, and enhanced capital efficiency. Related Reading: Here’s Why Arthur Hayes Is Not In Support Of A BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF PancakeSwap V3 On Linea Linea, formerly known as ConsenSys zkEVM, stands as Layer 2 scaling solution powered by ConsenSys. Linea achieves faster transaction speeds and reduced gas costs while ensuring security by utilizing zero-knowledge proofs and maintaining full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence. Developers can seamlessly create or migrate Ethereum apps without code modification or smart contract rewriting. With native integrations of popular tools like MetaMask and Truffle, Linea empowers developers with flexibility and scalability on the zkEVM. The collaboration has provided PancakeSwap users with insights into Layer 2 scaling solutions and the Linea platform, contributing to the development and adoption of decentralized financial solutions. Per the announcement, PancakeSwap v3 on Linea introduces two key features: advanced Swap and Liquidity Provision functionalities. These features enable users to trade tokens and participate in liquidity provision directly on the platform. The core principle of PancakeSwap v3 is maximizing capital efficiency, allowing liquidity providers to concentrate their capital within specific price ranges where most trading occurs. By optimizing asset utilization, liquidity providers can enhance their earnings. PancakeSwap v3 enables liquidity providers to achieve a capital multiplier of up to 4000x compared to its predecessor, v2, thus maximizing returns.

16500064,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548736,1692910837,Why Nvidia’s 20% Rise Ignited Rally In Crypto AI Tokens,"Crypto tokens with Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have outperformed other assets as chipmaker Nvidia reached an all-time high. The legacy company’s stock price saw important gains as its bet on the AI sector paid off. Related Reading: SOL Tallies 5% Gains In One Day After Shopify Integrates Solana Pay As of this writing, crypto market tracker Coingecko data records double-digit gains for AI-based cryptocurrencies. Render (RNDR) and Akash Network performed best in the last 24 hours and the previous week, respectively, with the former recording a 6% profit and a 10% gain. Nvidia Fuels AI Crypto Rally, But It’s the Trend Sustainable? According to a report from Sarson Funds, the correlation between crypto AI tokens and Nvidia is “strong.” The chipmaker has spearheaded the AI trend in the legacy financial sector and sparked interest in this technology. As a result, and under current market conditions, AI crypto tokens are moving with Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock price. Sarson Funds stated the following regarding NVDA’s rally and its impact on the crypto sector: AI-powered cryptocurrencies are reacting positively to Nvidia’s stellar Q2 earnings! The connection between #crypto and AI is stronger than ever as Nvidia ($NVDA) exceeds estimates with $13.51B in sales and $2.70 EPS, outperforming predictions. Notably, Render Network +8%, Singularity NET +9.9%, & Fetch +8.7% upon the announcement. In that sense, the fate of crypto tokens is highly linked to NVDA’s future performance. The stock’s gains were tied to better-than-expected results in its quarterly report and are likely to continue in the coming months. According to the company’s recent report, AI chip sales will only accelerate, boosting Nvidia’s revenue and potentially spilling into the crypto sector. In addition, other tech giants are jumping on the AI fever, reinforcing the thesis that the new technology will unlock further gains. Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress told investors this regarding their expectations for the coming months: There is tremendous demand for Nvidia accelerated computing and AI platforms. Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs. We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year. By geography, data center growth was strongest in the U.S. as customers direct their capital investments to AI and accelerated computing. In the meantime, crypto traders might use NVDA’s as a proxy for AI crypto tokens performance. If the forecasts are accurate, NVDA will likely double its current stock price by the end of the year; how will crypto AI tokens stand by then?

42409804,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPfmI,1692909931,"Tokenization News Roundup: Resource Extraction, Social Media Monetization and Real World Connections","What will crypto’s critics say if tokenization takes off? Tokenization is the process of using blockchains to represent the monetary value of other assets, whether those are as immaterial as crypto or as real as a house. Beginning with bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have long been mocked for lacking intrinsic value, actual cash flows and a connection to reality. Yet every week there are more stories showing how blockchain is being put to work making actual assets more tradable and transparent through tokenization.  This is the latest weekly installment of the Tokenization News Roundup covering everything from crypto credit incumbent Maple’s relaunch on Solana to the latest research on the effects of tokenizing social media activity.  Pendle Finance Users Can Now Profit From Real World Assets – CoinDesk  The Story: Pendle Finance, a yield-generation decentralized finance platform that launched last November, is expanding into real-world assets (RWA) with a suite of tools that enable users to properly hedge existing RWA DeFi platforms that earn interest from the real world. The protocol will tap two preeminent DeFi systems with links to traditional finance – MakerDao’s boosted Savings (sDAI) and Flux Finance’s fUSDC stablecoin – for the new product.  The Takeaway: Pendle CEO TN Lee summed up the move: “Fixed Yield and RWA have some of the largest addressable markets that remain untapped in DeFi. I firmly believe these will play a key role in attracting huge, off-chain institutional investors on-chain.” In other words, there is already a semi-established base of RWA-geared crypto projects that makes expansion for the rest of the sector to build more advanced systems like derivatives, swaps and fixed income security products. And this is only possible because blockchain systems are interoperable.  Maple Finance Eyes Asian Expansion With $5M Investment, Returns to Solana – CoinDesk  The Story: Sector leader Maple Finance, an on-chain credit protocol that has originated at least $2.2 billion in loans, is returning to the blockchain it launched on: Solana. The protocol suspended its on-chain lending pools on Solana and backed away from the chain in January, after getting caught up in the FTX collapse contagion event. The decision to return comes shortly after Maple secured an exemption from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer Treasury yields to U.S. investors.  The Takeaway: Maple is seemingly carving out a path forward after getting hit by a wave of defaults, apparently targeting Asia for growth and new customers. If there’s a lesson that could be repeated its that rebirth is as much a process as shedding dead weight and eating losses as sometime recognizing you need a hand up. Founders recently closed a $5 million investment round led by BlockTower Capital and Tioga Capital and secured promises from Solana-based protocols including stablecoin issuer UXD, perpetual swaps protocol Drift and lending protocol Solend to use the relaunched service.  Crypto Startup Aims to Tokenize Stocks by Playing by the Rules – Bloomberg  The Story: Want to own a piece of Tesla Inc., Walt Disney Co. and Nvidia Corp. and pay for those stocks in stablecoins like USDC and tether? Dinari, a California-based startup founded in 2021, thinks it found the solution to tokenization — at least for investors outside the U.S. — with its blockchain-powered Dinari Securities Backed Tokens offering. The company issues so-called “dShares” that represent and are backed by actual securities, which are held in trust by Alpaca Securities LLC and Interactive Brokers Group Inc. It is currently applying for a broker-dealer license subject to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and seeking status as a “transfer agent” under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The end goal is to become a fully opening securities exchange.  The Takeaway: There are many startups working to tokenize stocks, an effort complicated by the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX and Do Kwon’s Mirror Protocol that were arguably the furthest along before both came to a screeching halt. But investors including Susquehanna International Group and Balaji Srinivasan think Dinari found a workable plan to re-legitimize the industry. Co-founder Chas Rampenthal summed up the effort best when saying “In order to run, you have to walk, and in order to walk, you have to crawl.”  Tokenization of social media engagements increases the sharing of false (and other) news but penalization moderates it – Nature  The Story: Esteemed science journal Nature published a paper all about the coming wave of decentralized social media, or DeSo, and the implications of “tokenizing” user engagements. Authors ​​Meysam Alizadeh, Emma Hoes and Fabrizio Gilardi argue that social media companies like Streemit, Reddit and Twitter are announcing plans to help users monetize their activity, which would bring financial and reputational incentives for engagement that “might lead users to post more objectionable content.”  The Takeaway: The authors ran a social media survey inquiring whether “hypothetical token incentives” would make users more like to share different kinds of news and found that this could increase sharing of misinformation. Previous research specifically about trying to boost “accuracy” on social media through financial or reputational incentives actually decreases peoples’ willingness to share misinformation — but the authors do not seem confident that’s what executives are aiming for. This has policy implications for future content moderation practices, which may bend DeSo in more positive or negative directions.  Australian Central Bank Sees Tokenization as Possible CBDC Use Case – ​Reserve Bank of Australia  The Story: Asset tokenization and “smarter"" payments are two potential benefits of digitizing Australia’s fiat money, according to a 44-page report detailing conclusions of a recent central bank digital currency pilot program. Together with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre and 16 commercial participants, the RBI found CBDCs can support a range of services not currently possible by existing payment systems. This includes supporting innovation in existing financial markets (like debt securities) as well as the emerging “private digital money” sector.  The Takeaway: While CBDCs are not necessary to achieve all the stated goals, the mostly positive report noted CBDCs could enhance resilience and inclusion in the digital economy. The central bank noted that “programmability,” or the ability to set parameters and uses around money, which is done in crypto using smart contracts, may have serious benefits improving efficiency and reducing risks “in a range of complex business processes.” While central banks may not be tapping blockchain in particular — they certainly seem to be paying attention to monetary innovations that crypto is spearheading.  Central African Republic expands Sango project to land, resource tokenization – Cointelegraph  The Story: The Central African Republic (CAR) will use a state-designed blockchain called Sango to tokenize land and natural resources. Those plans were initially announced in 2022. In late July of 2023, the CAR National Assembly “unanimously approved” a law designed to further digitize the country’s economy, offering a streamlined visa program for foreigners and lighter licensing process for people who want to start real estate, agriculture, forestry and/or natural resource exploitation businesses.  The Takeaway: The CAR has had a wavering stance on crypto after becoming the second country after El Salvador to adopt bitcoin as legal tender and repealing that status early this year. It is also working to replace its primary currency, the Financial Community of Africa franc (FCA), with a cryptocurrency tied to the national Sango blockchain.

42409822,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcPgMf,1692907586,Tornado Cash Devs Are Caught in a U.S. Dragnet,"I’m not going to call Roman Storm or Roman Semenov innocent for their work building the now-sanctioned Tornado Cash protocol. I’m not even going to say the two aren’t guilty of the three specific crimes of which they were accused. But I am willing to say the two are caught up in something much bigger than themselves and are likely victims as much as perpetrators.  Yesterday two explosive stories hit the wires about supposed crypto crimes that taken together show a fuller picture of the U.S. government’s interest in Tornado Cash. In addition to the Romans getting charged, the FBI also issued a warning that North Korea is preparing to cash out millions in stolen crypto.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  If the connection isn’t immediately obvious, it helps to know that in its indictment the Department of Justice made pains to note that the hermit kingdom’s infamous Lazarus Group accounted for “hundreds of millions” of dollars of the $1 billion in illicit funds the Romans allegedly helped launder by building Tornado Cash.  In other words, the legal action taken against Tornado Cash is bound up in a geopolitical conflict between the U.S. and North Korea. In other other words, both the smart contract itself and the Romans are caught up in a massive U.S. dragnet.  So far unable to actually persecute North Korea itself or bring to justice any suspected hackers – who are thought to be funding the wayward country’s nuclear missiles program, no less – the U.S. government is making an example out of a couple cryptocurrency coders.  The actual crimes almost don’t matter. Instead the prosecution of Storm, Semenov and their colleague Alexey Pertsev who faces trial in the Netherlands is supposed to stand for the international community of Good Guy nations going hard against an international pariah. Considering the countless resources that flow to law enforcement in the U.S., the technology and spycraft available, you have to wonder: is this the best they can do?  This is more lit crit than evidence, but consider the DOJ presser’s dek, that bit under the headline that’s supposed to sum up the story and highlight why it matters: “Concurrent Treasury sanctions and DOJ indictments hold to account founders of mixing service that laundered stolen virtual assets for North Korea.”  The trouble is, you can sanction Tornado Cash and charge its founders with any imaginable crime, but that isn’t going to shut off the actual smart contract. Storm and Semenov are being charged with facilitating money laundering for writing and publishing self-executing code that will continue to function – i.e. continue laundering funds – whether they’re in jail or not.  Not only that, but Tornado Cash will continue laundering funds for North Korea because the code itself is agnostic to who is using it. There’s no semantic debate about it; there’s no AI to question whether it “knows” if what it’s doing is right or wrong, just a couple hundred lines in Solidity that follow prompts and push transactions out onto the blockchain.  Should the Romans get in trouble anyway? Isn’t that quite a dangerous machine they built? And couldn’t they have tried to put in an off switch? To the extent that Russian nationals, Storm and Semenov, broke U.S. law by neglecting the appropriate know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) protections and FinCEN “money-transmitting business” registrations then, maybe, sure, there’s enough justification to bring them to trial.  But the whole money laundering thing freaks me out. It’s true, I don't know enough about the case to say whether they were actually national defense risks who were working in tandem with North Korea to launder funds to build bombs. But something tells me that isn’t quite right, instead it seems like many crypto ideologues that Storm and Semenov were simply concerned about the absolute lack of financial privacy today.  Their document “Tips to Remain Anonymous” was a collection of best practices meant to guide people looking to, justifiably, bolster their on-chain privacy. It included hot tips like using Tor, auto-delete your browsing history and use different IP addresses for Tornado Cash deposits and withdrawals. Something tells me that a hacking group like Lazarus already knows what a VPN is.  We’ve heard this one before: it’s the same accusation levied against former Ethereum Foundation developer Virgil Griffith, who presented at a conference in Pyongyang where he said that Ethereum exists outside of government control. What an Earth-shattering revelation to make in 2019. Griffith was found to have violated U.S. sanctions, and is now a few months into his 63-month prison sentence.  See also: Cloning Tornado Cash Would Be Easy, but Risky | Opinion  To some extent I get it. It would probably be a headache for the U.S. if there were dozens of Virgil Griffiths in the world making contact with state enemies — and few would ever be as doe-eyed and innocent as the real Virgil Griffith seemed to be. Likewise, crypto mixers undoubtedly present a problem for financial enforcers, especially if they exist in a state like Tornado Cash pre-2022 when it was an open question whether using it was illegal.  The trouble is the twisting logic it takes for the government to shut these systems down. There are, as Coin Center argues, legitimate First Amendment rights that protect developers who write code. There are legitimate needs for privacy in the world. And the suggestion that every dollar that passes through a mixer is “laundered” is a pernicious way of ignoring all the legitimate uses of blockchain and legitimate reasons for wanting anonymity – and it’s troubling how often this idea comes up.  But even if the existence of something like Tornado Cash is an issue of national security, it wouldn’t be right to ask people to trade in liberty for security. I mean, “burner phones” can often be untraceable, causing trouble for police.

16497983,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548731,1692907252,Bitcoin Bottom: BTC Not Fulfilling This Historical Pattern Yet,"On-chain data shows Bitcoin is currently not satisfying a condition that has historically occurred alongside major bottoms in the price. Bitcoin Supply In Profit Is Still Greater Than Supply In Loss In a new post on X, James V. Straten, a research and data analyst, has pointed out how BTC isn’t fulfilling the bottom condition for the supply in profit and loss metrics. The “supply in profit” here naturally refers to the total amount of Bitcoin supply currently carrying an unrealized profit. Similarly, the “supply in loss” keeps track of the number of underwater coins. These indicators work by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last transferred at. If this previous price for any coin was less than the current BTC spot price, then that particular coin is being held at a profit, and the supply in profit adds to its value. On the other hand, the coins with a higher cost basis are counted by the supply in loss. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in both these Bitcoin metrics over the entire history of the cryptocurrency: Looks like the two metrics are still far apart in value currently | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X In the graph, the analyst has highlighted a specific pattern that these two indicators have shown during historical bottoms in the cryptocurrency’s price. It would appear that the supply in profit dips below the supply in loss during these periods of lows, implying that most of the market enters into a state of loss. Generally, investors in profit are more likely to sell, so whenever the supply in profit is at very high values, tops become more probable for Bitcoin. Similarly, a large number of investors instead of being in loss should mean there wouldn’t be too many sellers left. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Shoots Up, Pain Not Over Yet? This is potentially why bottoms have historically formed when the supply in loss exceeds the supply in profit. The chart shows that the Bitcoin Supply in Profit is currently quite a distance over the supply in loss, suggesting that a decent number of coins still carry gains. To be more precise, there is a difference of six million coins between the two supplies at the moment. The current market is nowhere near fulfilling the historical bottom criteria. However, the bottoms that the pattern has generally coincided with have been the cyclical lows, observed during the worst phase of the bear markets. In the current cycle, this bottom was marked after the FTX crash in November 2022. The only exception to this rule was in March 2020, when Bitcoin crashed due to the onset of the COVID-19 virus. This crash was an unexpected event, which may explain why it doesn’t fit in with the other bottoms. As the market at its current stage is likely already past the bear-market bottom, this supply in profit and loss pattern shouldn’t hold too much bearing on whether BTC has hit a local bottom after the recent crash. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Flashes Buy Signal, Bottom In? If the November 2022 low wasn’t the true bear-market bottom, BTC might have more pain in store, as a significant swing in market profitability will be required before the real bottom is found.

42419718,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFWyj,1692906219,Coinbase Is Talking With Canadian Banking Giants to Promote Crypto,"U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase is in talks with Canadian banking giants, trying to convince them to support the crypto ecosystem in that nation, which the company recently entered as it grapples with regulatory uncertainty in its home country.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Lucas Matheson, the director of Coinbase’s Canada operations, said that he’s been having conversations with Canada’s tier one banks. He didn’t identify them by name, but Canada’s largest banks are collectively known as the Big Five: Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.  “We have five banks that have the majority of Canadians banking with them and so one of the things that I’m working on in Canada is working closely with tier one banks to start banking crypto and start supporting our industry,” Matheson said. “I’m hopeful that over the next few quarters, we will see some of our larger banks in Canada start participating in the crypto economy.”  Coinbase started operating in Canada this month after it was sued in June by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for operating as an unregistered securities exchange. Coinbase has praised Canada's approach to crypto regulation.  Matheson said Canadian regulators have been engaged and helpful in finding the right regulatory framework for both the digital asset economy and the country’s own ambitions to become a leader in the space.  The exchange recently received its pre-registration undertaking (PRU) in Canada, which commits it to meeting several regulatory requirements by a certain date. After that, it will obtain a restricted dealer registration and move to the newly formed Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization, Matheson said, allowing Coinbase to get its full dealer registration and offer leveraged and derivative products to both retail and institutional investors.  “When we think about regulation internationally, we see two types of regulation: regulation by enforcement, like we’re seeing in the U.S., and regulation by engagement, like in Canada,” he said.  As for Coinbase’s near-term goals, Matheson said that he is focused on educating Canadians about the advantages and importance of a decentralized system and expanding the payment options in the country.  Canadian regulators in July proposed capital plans for banks and insurers who hold crypto assets in an effort to bring more clarity on how to treat the asset class when it comes to capital and liquidity.  Several U.S.-based crypto firms have launched their business in Canada in recent months after the SEC initiated its crackdown on the crypto industry in the U.S., including Coinbase, Kraken. Others, like Binance and Paxos, however, have exited the Canadian market due to its introduction of stricter rules.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/24/coinbase-is-talking-with-canadian-banking-giants-to-promote-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eea95d2033abf79ee83c52fa1b406df5ca97dfd-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Newly Launched SHIB Association Unmasked In a rather lengthy X (formerly known as Twitter) post, Shibburn announced the launch of the SHIB Association, a novelty initiation that may play a pivotal role in the future progress of the Shiba Inu ecosystem and the improvement of the SHIB community. Shibburn stated that the SHIB Association was created to facilitate the growth and advancement of SHIB by bringing forward development, utilities, and innovative solutions into the SHIB ecosystem. It also added that the newly launched venture will be facilitating the creation of a dedicated blockchain for the Shiba Inu native token, SHIB. This strategic move may impact the advancement of the SHIB ecosystem following the launch of Shibarium. It will also ensure SHIB community members have an independent blockchain, offering better control and flexibility of the token’s capabilities. “I announced ‘Shib Association’ earlier today, a new venture focused solely on SHIB. We will bring utility, and innovation to SHIB, including its own blockchain. This is another option for people that believe in SHIB, and want the focus to be in SHIB without having to be locked into an ecosystem,” the post read. Token price sitting at $0.00000825 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com What SHIB Association Means For Shiba Inu Price As news of the SHIB Association unfolds and spreads across the crypto space, SHIB community members and crypto enthusiasts have pondered on the impacts SHIB Association would have on the price of the Shiba Inu token. One of SHIB’s community members has asked if the operations of the SHIB Association would influence the SHIB token’s price. In response, the creator of Shibburn refuted the possibility of SHIB Association or SHIB burning exercises or rates causing any positive or negative impact on Shiba Inu’s price, emphasizing that Shibburn and SHIB Association are independent entities. “Please don’t confuse Shibburn with other projects. Shibburn is an independent company. Also, the Shib Association won’t be part of Shibburn, but we will contribute to it,” Shibburn stated. While relaying all the developments SHIB Association has in store for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shibburn highlighted its dedication and commitment to Shiba Inu and its community. The SHIB burn tracker stated that it had no prior affiliations with the anonymous group behind Shiba Inu, Ryoshi when it launched in 2019. However, it started as a burn tracker for Shiba Inu tokens to provide SHIB community members with important information about burns. The tracker has also stated that it has no obligation to reduce significant amounts of SHIB tokens from supply. Adding that every SHIB community member has a significant role to play in the growth and development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. “Many believe it’s my responsibility to remove massive amounts from the supply when I’m just a community member like you. Shibburn doesn’t belong to any other teams. Shibburn is an independent company I created to help out,” Shibburn said.

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Is Showing A Green Signal As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross has now dipped below the -2 mark. The “Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and transaction volume (both denominated in USD). When the value of this metric is high, it means that the price of the asset (that is, its market cap) is high when compared to its ability to transact coins (the transaction volume). Such a trend may imply that BTC is overvalued right now. On the other hand, low values can suggest that the market cap isn’t that much relative to the volume, so the cryptocurrency’s price may be undervalued at the moment. In the context of the current discussion, the NVT ratio itself isn’t of interest, but rather a modified form of it called the “NVT Golden Cross” is. This new indicator aims to pinpoint tops and bottoms in the NVT ratio by comparing its 30-day moving average (MA) with the 10-day one. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross over the past year: Looks like the value of the metric seems to have been heading down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has plunged recently as the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through a crash. Following the latest drawdown, the indicator is now deep inside the negative territory, at a value below -2. In the chart, the quant has marked two lines for the metric that have held some significance for the asset during the past. The first of these (marked in red) takes place at around 2.2, while the other one (green) is at -1.6. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Shoots Up, Pain Not Over Yet? Historically, whenever the NVT Golden Cross has crossed above the former line, the cryptocurrency has generally observed the formation of a local top. Similarly, a break below the latter level has resulted in bottoms for the coin. From the chart, it’s clear that the indicator has now dipped firmly below the bottom line, implying that Bitcoin might be undervalued currently. In the past year, there have been three other instances of the indicator plunging below the line, each coinciding with some sort of low for the price. The first two of these had reached bottom values similar to now, while the third occurrence (which is the latest one) saw the NVT Golden Cross dip much deeper towards the -3.1 mark before the bottom was hit. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Indicator Is On The Verge Of A Bullish Breakout It’s unclear which scenario might play out for Bitcoin this time, but one thing may be clear from this pattern: the bottom could be near for the cryptocurrency, or may even already be in.

Launched on March 29, 2023, this innovation sets a new benchmark for both philately and the digital art realm. Pop-art, stamps, and blockchain Liechtenstein's foray into the world of blockchain technology began as early as 2021, but this recent collaboration with Britto, known for his distinctive public art installations worldwide, including Hyde Park, London, and John F. Kennedy Airport, New York, has undoubtedly generated new attention in the world of post stamps. ""We are proud to have been issuing stamps for 111 years now. The NFTs were created through the digital twin of a painting by Romero Britto, now on display in the Liechtenstein National Museum,"" says Roland Seger, CEO at LiechtensteinischePost AG. Drawing from his personal journey, Britto told CryptoDaily that, ""As art ambassador for the Philately Liechtenstein art edition, things have come full circle for me. When I was a kid in Brazil, I couldn't travel. But stamps let me dream. Through them, I could travel the world in my mind and get to faraway places."" The NFT Art Edition stands out in the novel arena of crypto-based stamps not just due to its blend of tradition and innovation but also because of its message of unity. ""My art, the painting for the philately and the design of the NFT stamps are meant to express joy of life. This style conveys my philosophy: a visual language of happiness! The work in the Liechtenstein National Museum stands not only for friendship, but also for the connection between tradition and the digital world. Mushrooms (through their roots) are the best-connected creatures in our world - just as we are digitally on the internet today,"" Britto reflected. Each stamp, built on Ethereum’s ERC-721 standard, includes a unique SQR code, linking directly to its corresponding NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. This guarantees transparency and authenticity for collectors. Additional physical perks include gold foil embossed packaging and a certificate of authenticity. Britto further emphasized the democratizing power of NFTs, saying, ""Art is for everyone. We should share love and positivity with each other. With my art, I want to convey this attitude. The NFTs allow everyone to participate in the art world. Through this unique project, everyone gets access to a world that was previously only available to a few people.."" A growing field As Liechtenstein's philately dives headfirst into the digital age, their initiatives not only revolutionize notions of authenticity and ownership but also underscore their commitment to evolving while paying homage to a century-old tradition. And notably, they’re not the only players in their field to realize the potential of NFTs. Since the thoughtleader’s first venture into blockchain back in 2021, the release of Stamp 4.0, the world’s first NFT stamp, other postage services in Europe have caught on to the idea. As Cointelegraph reported, the Dutch and Austrian postage services have followed suit and released their own blockchain-based stamps to the public in Fall 2022. The future of philately seems promising, with a perfect blend of the past, present, and future, creating an inviting space for both traditional stamp enthusiasts and new-age collectors. As the world continues to become more digitalized, it seems fair to assume that collectors and even consumers will be seeing more post services leverage blockchain technology. It's even conceivable that postal services will abandon the old-fashioned physical stamps and soon rely entirely on their NFT counterparts for domestic and international mail. One thing is for sure: thanks to collaborations like these, Philatelie Liechtenstein ensures its revered position in philatelic history for ages to come.

42419716,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFWwf,1692899168,"After GOP Debate, Blockchain Bettors See Ramaswamy as Most Formidable Trump Challenger","In Wednesday night’s first debate for the 2024 U.S. Republican presidential nomination, candidates swapped barbs in an attempt to steal the spotlight from former President Donald Trump, the party’s clear front-runner, who opted to skip out on the debate in favor of an interview with recently ousted Fox News host Tucker Carlson.  Assessing any given candidate's election odds typically means turning to polls or pundits. But pundits are a messy indicator for judging a political race, and polls are too slow to measure things in real-time. Enter prediction markets.  Blockchain-based betting platforms like Polymarket and Manifold have thin legal standing in the United States, but their pitch is that they allow users to bet on practically anything. While the accuracy of prediction markets for measuring election odds is debatable, the tools still provide an interesting bellwether of public opinion.  In a nutshell, blockchain bettors didn’t appear to change their odds-making much as a result of Wednesday’s debate, but crypto betting platforms do show that Vivek Ramaswamy, a Bitcoin-friendly entrepreneur who won plaudits for his performance, has overtaken Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in the past week as the clear frontrunner to challenge Trump.  Users of Polymarket, the largest blockchain-based prediction market, have put up nearly $5 million so far to bet on the outcome of the Republican nomination race – this despite the fact that Polymarket is illegal to use for placing bets in the United States. In 2022, the U.S. Commodities Futures and Exchange Commission charged Polymarket with facilitating illegal binary swaps. As part of its settlement with the CFTC, Polymarket paid a $1.4 million fine and agreed to force U.S. users of the platform into “view only” mode.  While Polymarket’s GOP betting lines have been relatively stationary since last night’s debate, one might still expect to see more betting activity (and volatility) as the race progresses given the amount of money that has already flooded the platform in relation to the 2024 presidential race.  As things currently stand, Polymarket’s clear frontrunner – in line with most polling – is Donald Trump.  In betting markets, the higher it costs to vote in favor of a given outcome, the more likely that outcome is considered. On Polymarket, it currently costs 71 cents to bet in favor of a second Trump nomination and 32 cents to bet against. In practical terms, what this means is that if Trump wins the nomination, those who bet in his favor are set to earn $1 for every 71 cents they bet. If he loses, they get nothing.  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis entered last night's debate with the most to win and the most to lose. Once viewed as the biggest GOP threat to a second Trump presidency, DeSantis dropped far behind the former president in most polls following a series of campaign shake-ups and funding troubles. If Polymarket’s numbers are anything to go by, DeSantis’s debate performance didn’t immediately appear to move the mark all that much.  In the past week on Polymarket, votes in favor of DeSantis have decreased from 14 cents to 12 cents.  Entrepreneur and right-wing political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy, meanwhile, was generally lauded by pundits after last night’s debate for managing to distinguish himself in a field of better-known politicians. Polymarket bettors – in line with prediction markets on average – place Ramaswamy cleanly ahead of the Florida governor in the race for the GOP nomination.  Over the past week, bets in favor of Ramaswamy have increased in price from 13 cents to 16 cents.  One might expect to see positive Ramaswamy sentiment on a platform like Polymarket given his pro-Bitcoin policy positions, but his apparent lead in the race for second place is also reflected in polling and traditional betting markets.  As crypto writ large has floundered in recent months, prediction markets have emerged as something of a blockchain mainstay – one of the few crypto use cases that has maintained outside appeal despite its regulatory troubles.  In 2020, bettors in non-blockchain prediction markets reportedly put more than $200 million on the line to speculate about the outcome of that year’s U.S. presidential election.  Polymarket bettors, meanwhile, put up a relatively paltry $10 million on the 2020 showdown between Trump and Biden. The fact that $5 million has already been placed on bets in a far-out, seemingly uncompetitive GOP nomination race suggests this election cycle might break records for blockchain-based betting platforms.  The GOP race has not been the only recent surge in activity for blockchain betting.  When South Korean scientists claimed to have discovered the first room-temperature superconductor in a pre-release research paper last month – a breakthrough that would mark one of the largest scientific leaps in a generation – a corner of the internet took to Polymarket and Manifold to suss out fact from fiction.  Whatever the accuracy of these bettors – many of whom are probably clueless when it comes to cutting-edge material science – the “wisdom of crowds” proved one of the easiest ways for excited non-experts to judge the credibility of the research.  With $2.7 million on the line on Polymarket and 5,600 individual bettors on Manifold, bettors at one point had the odds of the discovery being true at around 50/50; in other words, it briefly cost about the same to bet either way.  Following replication failures and critiques from scientists, however, more recent numbers place the likelihood of floating trains and ultra-efficient quantum computers out of the realm of near-term possibility. On Polymarket, it currently costs 5 cents to earn a dollar if the superconductor research is successfully replicated by 2025.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/24/after-gop-debate-blockchain-bettors-see-ramaswamy-as-most-formidable-trump-challenger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2efd57d031b8390a098fbae91a7867bb06da3712-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16491595,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548725,1692896436,Here’s Why Arthur Hayes Is Not In Support Of A BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF,"Many stakeholders in the crypto industry have welcomed the idea of traditional finance firms offering a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) as they believe it will further drive crypto adoption. However, the former CEO and co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, seems to be against the move. Problems With BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing In a post published on his Substack platform, Hayes made his displeasure known regarding the recent wave of Spot Bitcoin ETF applications by prominent traditional financial (TradFi) institutions, including BlackRock. Contrary to public opinion, he doesn’t believe these TradFi institutions are bullish on crypto. Instead, they are moving to become “crypto gatekeepers” to balance their deposit base, explaining that these companies intend to offer ETFs or any similar investment product with crypto as its underlying asset to achieve this. He stated that since these fund managers will be the “only game in town,” they can charge investors enormous fees in exchange for their investment products. According to him, institutions like BlackRock recognize that cryptocurrencies can be used to hedge against inflation and could have a significant impact on the economy going forward. So they want to have it “under their control” when that happens. He believes the only times these firms have done a “good job” is to paint the crypto industry and cryptocurrencies in a bad light to the government. As such, they will have a hard time changing the narrative to circumvent the federal government’s proposed inflation tax on bank depositors. The Bitmex founder suggested that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) clampdown on the crypto industry was never about the technology itself but who owned it. He believes those who had earlier tried to get a Bitcoin ETF approved faced disapproval based on their status. However, the regulator seems more welcoming to the idea because of the prestige of BlackRock and its CEO, Larry Fink. BTC price falls to $26,300 territory | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com TradFi Doesn’t Care About Decentralization Hayes noted that the banks and financial regulators could collaborate to uphold the dollar’s sovereignty. According to him, this can be easily achieved by both parties agreeing to ensure that all crypto redemptions are made in the US dollar and not the “physical crypto” itself. These US dollars will then be put back into the banking system, which he believes is already compromised. Hayes is more concerned that all this goes against Satoshi’s vision of creating a decentralized financial system and he believes BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink doesn’t care about decentralization. He highlighted that Fink and BlackRock’s business model is built on centralization, adding that asset managers like BlackRock do not add value to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, such as increased privacy or censorship resistance. Instead, these asset managers moving to offer ETFs means they have more control over large voting blocks and can affect governance decisions.

16490210,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548750,1692894103,What are Altcoins? Definition & Different Types,"What is an Altcoin? The word “altcoin” is an abbreviated term meaning “alternative coin”. Altcoin is simply the name given to all the cryptocurrencies that aren’t Bitcoin. Altcoins typically form in two ways. Either an independent developer pursues their own vision and develops a new cryptocurrency from the ground up or there’s developmental disagreement among the creators resulting in some deciding to split off to make their own. For example, Litecoin splintered off from Bitcoin in 2011, believing that greater transaction speeds were the way forward. This led to many of the established cryptocurrencies and altcoins sharing similar characteristics and operating systems – like Arbitrum using the Ethereum blockchain ledger and Solana using the same proof-of-work technology as Bitcoin — growing the number of alternative variants. Types of Altcoin There are many types of altcoins used for a variety of purposes. As some creators tried revolutionizing payments and increasing transaction speeds, others developed altcoins and cryptocurrencies for more niche functions. The main types of altcoins are: Mining-based coins Bitcoin is a mining-based coin. This means that a team of professional miners use software to solve mathematical equations to verify blocks of transactions — when a block is verified, the miner receives a small part of a bitcoin as a reward. As well as the two giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum, many other altcoins — like Litecoin, Dogecoin, ZCash, and Monero — also follow this verification strategy. Unfortunately, it is time-consuming, costly, and uses a lot of energy to mine. Stablecoins Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that have their price fixed through either an artificial algorithm or by linking them to a fiat currency or commodity to uphold its value and prevent wild fluctuations. For example, Tether — a stablecoin based in the United States — is bound to the US dollar. This means Tether’s price can only follow the natural market value of the currency and isn’t at the mercy of supply and demand. Although typically a safe investment, problems can arise when the company or issuer of the coin doesn’t have sufficient reserves to justify its value. Staking-based Some altcoins have a different consensus mechanism for verifying block transactions. While most cryptocurrencies, tokens, and altcoins approve blocks using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, some coins use what’s known as a proof-of-stake mechanism. Holders of stake-based coins have options to stake their coins — this means offering their coins to a third-party reviewer for transaction processing. With each verified block, the participants are rewarded with small portions of the coin as a reward. Altcoins like Cardano, Toncoin, and Polkadot are all examples of proof-of-stake currencies. Governance Some currencies give investors “voting rights” to have a say in the future direction of the cryptocurrency by voting on proposals and suggesting ideas for improving the blockchain project. The idea behind these coins is to decentralize decision-making and allow the investors a chance to have a say on how to improve the operating systems and blockchain infrastructure and give hands-on feedback to developers. How many altcoins are there? Because of the popularity of cryptocurrency and how it’s proven to be a lucrative money-making opportunity – even after the 2013 crypto boom – there are thousands of different coins, each with their own unique blockchain infrastructure and consensus mechanisms. It’s estimated that there are just over 17,000 types of altcoins available on the market. Are altcoins a good investment? For investors looking to add cryptocurrency to their portfolio, altcoins are a great diversifier. Just like a stock, a cryptocurrency can appeal to investors and perform well on exchanges if it has strong market and technical fundamentals. Factors such as whether an altcoin has a positive technical trajectory — like rapid transaction technology, desirable, secure blockchain infrastructure, and a strong demand for supply — can make it a desirable investment opportunity for long-term investments and traders. However, it’s important for investors to research the coins before committing large amounts of capital to them, as the market is still in its infancy. What to consider before buying altcoins Evaluating an altcoin for investment is more complex than just watching candlestick charts and trying to jump in at the right time. Some of the things investors need to know when investing in altcoins and cryptocurrency include: Market capitalisation The market cap of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the number of coins in circulation by the value of the coin. Typically, the higher the market cap, the higher the value of the cryptocurrency and the potential price fluctuations of each coin – making it an integral metric for deciding whether or not to invest. Trading volume Trading volume is the number of cryptocurrency tokens or coins being bought and sold over a specific time frame. The higher the volume, the more desirable the currency, as it shows there’s significant interest — indicating periods of rapid growth or decline. Historic and current price trends Although not guaranteed to yield results, looking at historic pricing — as well as more recent charts — can help investors paint a picture of the general pricing trends of a cryptocurrency. Market sentiment Keeping informed of crypto news is paramount to making an investment. Because cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy, much of their value is derived from consumer hype and faith in a cryptocurrency’s infrastructure. Therefore, news is likely to have a dramatic effect on the pricing of each token or coin — this is especially true for smaller altcoins that aren’t as established as giants like Ethereum, Ether, and Litecoin. Social media sentiment Just like mainstream news can govern market sentiment, social media can too. Positive social media attention can cause the price of a coin or token to skyrocket, as investors swarm to claim a share of the profits. However, it’s important to practice caution when considering social media opinions for many reasons. Although they’re a good source of information, it could potentially be wildly inaccurate. Even worse, social media hype has the potential to be part of a pump-and-dump scheme where influencers and public figures artificially inflate currencies only to release their own holding when it reaches the peak. Future trends in altcoins As technology, consumer sentiment and currency users change, altcoins must adapt to keep pace with new requirements. 2023 is a new year for altcoins and many changes are around the corner. Some of the key anticipated changes are: Addressing crypto’s environmental impact Proof-of-work systems use exorbitant amounts of energy and require expensive, high-power computers to uthorizes blockchains, green-light payments, make transfers, and mine currency quickly. It’s such an expense that Ethereum is moving to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to create new blocks in its blockchain. This not only speeds up payment times for consumers but reduces overhead costs and is kinder on the environment — setting the precedent for many altcoins to do the same. Reviewing how new and existing coins are valued A recent string of proposed government ICO clampdowns in countries like the USA, UK, and Sweden may trigger a change in how new coins are valued at market entry. One of the main issues is that they are completely unregulated, allowing scams to ravage investors’ portfolios without any recourse for repayment. With some governments worldwide forcing cryptocurrency developers to disclose information about the coin, registering it in an index, and implementing investor protection strategies to compensate consumers, this could affect the cryptocurrency landscape — forcing crypto developers into creating coins with real-world utility and avoiding the meme route. A potential boom in the second half of 2023 As investors fled the markets at the start of the year in the wake of a weakened economy and rising interest rates, the start of 2023 saw the cryptocurrency market begin to bear. However, some analysts speculate that the value of some cryptocurrencies — namely, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana — are expected to see sizeable gains, with some others expected to follow suit. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the top 3 altcoins? The cryptocurrencies expected to make substantial gains towards the end of 2023 are, Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), while Ethereum (ETH) has already made substantial gains this year. What is the most famous altcoin? While the first altcoin, Namecoin, holds the title for being the original, Ethereum is arguably the most famous altcoin on the market, being the only alternative coin coming close to rivaling the historic highs of Bitcoin. What are the disadvantages of altcoins? While altcoins are a great diversifier for a portfolio — allowing investors to stake money on emerging assets while being protected by historic hedges like precious metals and commodities — investing in them does come with an inherent set of problems. The main problems with altcoin investments are: They’re incredibly volatile, and therefore, high-risk. Some cryptocurrencies oversupply the demand — stagnating the price. The value of an altcoin is almost solely based on speculation and hype and can be overvalued. There is always a risk with altcoin investments that they’re pump-and-dump schemes — meaning investors have to be careful when researching altcoins and be wary of those with low liquidity. How do altcoins gain value? Altcoins gain value like any other stock, cryptocurrency, or commodity — through increased demand. When news breaks that an altcoin has made a significant step to boosting its real-world utility or investors are swarming to it, the price of the coin will rise as demand increases and supply falls.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/learn/what-are-altcoins/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/16490210.jpeg

Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Optimism Reverses From Range Low With 10% Gain – How Far Can Bulls Go? Algorand Challenges Amidst Brief Rebound Despite the transient recovery in prices, the persistent selling pressure continues to cast a shadow over ALGO’s future prospects. The potential consequence of this is the looming possibility of ALGO establishing a new all-time low in the days to come. This setback is compounded by a development earlier in the year when the US Securities and Exchange Commission designated ALGO as a security. This action was made as the SEC unleashed regulatory measures against the US-based crypto exchange, Bittrex. The reclassification of ALGO has set in motion a cascade of ramifications, affecting both the token itself and its holders in terms of financial regulations. Regulatory Uncertainty And Value Erosion In spite of vigorous resistance from its Foundation, ALGO’s demand has experienced a decline. The overarching reason behind this decline lies in the hesitancy of investors towards assets entangled in regulatory ambiguity. Consequently, the value of the token has witnessed a staggering decline of over 87% since the SEC’s classification. ALGO hits a market cap of $765 million today. Chart: TradingView.com Over the past three months, ALGO has endured a series of successive all-time lows (ATLs). The downward spiral began on June 10, culminating in the most recent ATL on August 17. The token’s efforts to stage a bullish rebound were quashed by the overwhelming weight of relentless selling pressure. Critical Support And Prospective Scenarios Meanwhile, the pivotal $0.09 support level has managed to alleviate some of the selling pressure, although indicators on the trading charts raise concerns about its sustainability. Should the critical support of $0.09 crumble under the pressure, it opens the gates for short sellers to target the price range of $0.05 to $0.07, potentially setting another unfortunate precedent of a new low for ALGO.

42419726,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFX6z,1692892800,"Coinbase, in Uncharted Territory as Public Company Running Blockchain, Pledges Neutrality","Crypto exchange Coinbase released a plan to pursue decentralization and neutrality for its new “Base” blockchain, just weeks after the network went live.  The new framework is known as the “Base Neutrality Principles.” According to a blog post by Coinbase, the principles are meant to align with Optimism's “Law of Chains,” a framework meant to unify various chains built in keeping with the project’s vision for a “Superchain.” (Base is built with technology from Optimism’s OP Stack.)  The release of the plan shows Coinbase’s delicate dance in sponsoring its own blockchain, which is uncharted territory for a publicly traded company; the challenge is to reap the benefits from having an associated network without exerting undue control over it and undermining the purported benefits of decentralization.  The Base Neutrality Principles consists of five standards, and Coinbase has said it will commit to a “set of standards for all OP Stack blockchains and ensure both builders and users can access the neutral and open blockspace of Base.”  The exchange said it will not control the crypto that users bring to Base, nor will it give preference to the order of transactions that occur on the blockchain. Coinbase also pledged not to use private transaction data for marketing purposes and won’t pose any limitations on exiting or withdrawals for users of Base.  The team behind Optimism said in their own blog post that Base’s commitment to the Superchain vision means that Base and OP Mainnet will go through the same upgrades, so that the chains remain compatible. Transactions fees will also be split, and some of it will go to the Optimism Collective through a smart contract.  According to the Optimism, Base users will have the ability to earn up to about 118 million OP tokens (currently worth about $183 million) over a six-year period.  “We want to create a virtuous cycle that ensures sustainable funding for the open-source OP Stack and other public goods that enable Base, thereby creating more innovation and growth,” said Jesse Pollak, the creator of Base, in a blog post.

Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at around $1,640, also a near 3% decline from yesterday's high.  Both assets remain stuck in ""significant downtrend,"" according to CoinDesk Indices' trend indicators, following the sudden tumble in digital asset prices last week.

""The Fed is at an interesting decision point in their rates cycle as we continue to see the economy absorbing the circa 500 bps of tightening in the past 16 months without too much negative impact on consumer and industrial spending, or on unemployment,"" he explained.

All Eyes on Everlodge (ELDG) for Unprecedented 100x Surge,"As Bitcoin's (BTC) momentum seems to be waning, the eyes of the crypto world are shifting towards a new potential powerhouse - Everlodge (ELDG). Currently in its presale phase, Everlodge has quickly garnered attention with predictions of an unprecedented 100x surge. Let's take a closer look at why this new project is so promising. Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives Everlodge (ELDG): Redefining Real Estate Investments Everlodge harnesses the power of blockchain to offer fractional ownership in luxury properties. The ability to own a slice of a $9 million New York penthouse, starting with just a $100 investment, has been a game-changer in the investment narrative. Everlodge isn't merely about trading tokens; it's a holistic ecosystem. By digitizing property details into NFTs, Everlodge ensures transparency, security, and ease of trade. Each token represents a genuine stake in a tangible property, allowing for both the appreciation of real estate and the advantages of crypto trading. The Launchpad feature of Everlodge acts as a bridge between property developers and investors. Now, developers can directly source funds from the community, and in return, investors get early-bird access to high-value real estate projects. Moreover, the Rewards Club introduces a novel concept where investors can earn and enjoy stays in luxury properties or even flip their nights for additional revenue. This mix of luxury experience with investment returns has made Everlodge an irresistible proposition. While Bitcoin has solidified its reputation based on being digital gold, Everlodge's approach of combining the trillion-dollar real estate market with the agility of blockchain presents a unique and compelling investment narrative. Bitcoin will undoubtedly continue its reign, but Everlodge's ascent is a clear testament to the ever-evolving benefit of blockchain technology. Analysts are predicting that the early-bird presale price of $0.010 could rise to $1.00 as Everlodge launches globally. Find Out How To Buy Everlodge (ELDG) Bitcoin (BTC): The Impending Decision on Bitcoin ETF in 2024 Bitcoin's inherent volatility has always been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it offers traders an opportunity to capitalize on price swings; on the other, it can erode significant value in short periods. The oscillation between $24,800 and $31,000 within a week stands a testament to Bitcoin's unpredictable nature. The hope for a Bitcoin ETF had ignited a significant amount of optimism. The prospect of regulatory approval for such a fund could potentially bring in a new wave of institutional investors, translating to higher liquidity and increased acceptance for the crypto giant. Yet, despite this enthusiasm, Bitcoin's inability to break the $31,800 resistance zone highlights caution from the market. Gary Gensler's comments serve as a poignant reminder of the regulatory uncertainties that continue to surround cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's precarious position near the $27,500 support level adds another layer of uncertainty. If this level is breached, a potential cascade effect could push Bitcoin down toward the psychological barrier of $20,000. This bearish sentiment is further compounded by technical indicators suggesting a potential trend reversal on the horizon. Most analysts are agreeing that future price performance depends on whether the ETF is approved or not. The latest news suggests that there is a delay, with a final decision being made in early 2024. With Bitcoin unlikely to move upward until this date, the crypto community is flocking to the Everlodge presale to grab the last remaining tokens during phase 1 of the presale. Time is of the essence as Everlodge is expected to surge 100x from this level.

42419732,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFXDB,1692891900,Fiduciary Duty During Uncertain Times,"The market capitalization of crypto-assets has grown significantly. As of March, 2023 the global cryptocurrency market capitalization was US$1.2 trillion. Moreover, the market capitalization of all stablecoins on February 13, 2023 equaled more than $137 billion. But this growth has come amid large bouts of price volatility.  For example, prices spiked in early May 2021 only to fall by 40% in the same month. Cryptocurrency prices rose once again, peaking in November 2021, only to fall precipitously during 2022. Bitcoin, for instance, hit more than US$65,000 in November 2021 only to lose around 70% of its value by September 2022.  Current market conditions have become known as a “crypto winter”. How can financial professionals support client investment interest in this asset class through this volatility?  Noah Billick, Partner - Director of Regulatory, Funds and Compliance from Rennoco & Co. law firm, shares his perspective from working with financial firms on how advisors can meet their fiduciary duty to their clients in this changing environment.  – S.M.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  How Does the Current Crypto Regulatory Landscape Impact Fiduciary Duty?  In the course of the last five years, investing in cryptocurrencies has evolved from a fringe activity fraught with risk to a much more mainstream practice. In my legal practice I regularly work with advisors and portfolio managers, and the great majority of investment professionals I speak with have told me that their clients are increasingly asking about cryptocurrency investing.  Advisors need to have an awareness of the risks and benefits of investing in cryptocurrency, both from a business perspective and also to comply with their fiduciary duties. Simply put, advisors who cannot intelligently discuss the place of cryptocurrency in a client’s overall investment portfolio are doing their clients a disservice and are putting themselves at risk.  Advisors are professionals. Like any professional, advisors need to continually add to their professional body of knowledge in order to meet their ongoing professional obligations. While the decision to add cryptocurrency to a portfolio still depends on taking the client’s overall circumstances into account, advisors can no longer remain ignorant of this asset class.  As long ago as March of 2021 (a lifetime in the crypto industry) Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Global Investment Committee published a report entitled, “The Case for Cryptocurrency As an Investable Asset Class in a Diversified Portfolio.” Since then the market has matured, allowing service providers (including custodians end exchanges) to refine their offerings and, in many cases, to become regulated entities.  In March of 2022 the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued Compliance Assistance Release No. 2022-01, which warned 401(k) plan fiduciaries to ""exercise extreme care"" when considering adding cryptocurrencies to client portfolios. The guidance identified five areas of concern, being:  1) Speculative and volatile nature of crypto investments;  2) The difficulty for plan participants to make informed decisions;  3) Custodial and recordkeeping concerns;  4) Valuation concerns; and  5) The evolving regulatory environment.  From my point of view, these considerations should be preeminent in the minds of any financial professional advising in connection with cryptocurrencies, whether considering ERISA, outside of that legislative framework in the United States, or north of the border.  The good news is that the industry is progressing on all fronts. While crypto is still speculative, better information about the qualities of different tokens is allowing advisors to gain a more nuanced understanding of the factors that make some coins more or less attractive than others. This information is also allowing individual investors to understand crypto as an asset class, rather than as a speculative lottery ticket type of investment (or, to use more modern terminology, a “YOLO”). Custody and recordkeeping have also matured, with regulated service providers emerging on both sides of the border. As markets become more liquid and transparent valuation becomes less of a concern, especially with the most highly traded tokens. Finally (and while this has been painfully slow to occur) the regulatory environment is evolving. The Canadian regulatory environment is arguably more mature than in the United States (owing, in large part, to the early, high-profile collapse of Canadian-based QuadrigaCX) but American regulators are quickly catching up.  The ultimate proof of the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency as an investable asset class is the approval of regulated products and services. The first crypto fund prospectus accepted by a North American securities regulatory authority was in 2019, when the Ontario Securities Commission approved a bitcoin ETF managed by 3iQ, a Canadian leader in cryptocurrency investment. In July of 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has accepted applications to create spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds from six firms, including BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity and Invesco. Crypto can also be purchased directly through any number of regulated trading platforms. And while inappropriate for most retail investors, crypto derivative products are available for sophisticated investors. With these significant developments there is no longer any question that advisors, in meeting their fiduciary duties, must be able to intelligently and responsibly provide advice regarding cryptocurrency investment.

This article is provided for information purposes only and is not legal advice.  - Noah Billick, Partner - Director of Regulatory, Funds and Compliance, Renno & Co  Ask an Advisor: Setting up Business to Support Crypto  Q: What is your infrastructure allowing the investment in crypto assets and benefits?  A: As a private capital management firm performing many roles, including Discretionary Portfolio Manager, we provide a structure where the client possesses the crypto asset directly, and the funds and coins do not pass through our firm. To do this, we place the capital and coins in accounts in each individual's or company's name with custodians. Our clients want to own the asset directly, which they can not do with ETFs and other funds.  As the advisor, we have the mandate to meet our client's interests in this space. The firm is responsible for the selection of crypto assets, as well as the choice of exchanges and setting up the contracts with the custodians who meet the required qualifications.  We ensure that we meet the tax and reporting requirements for this asset as we do other investments.  – Daniel Fréreault, CFA, Platinium Capital  Keep Reading  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) added crypto risk section for the first time to its annual risk report (2023), citing the novel and unique risks the asset class presents.

The company's second quarter revenues declined Q/Q, indicating weakening trading activity on the platform. Coinbase Global has not been able to post a GAAP profit so far. EPS estimates continue to expect full-year losses in FY 2022 and FY 2023. Coinbase Global did achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in Q2, but poor investor sentiment and regulatory challenges are headwinds for the cryptocurrency's revenue potential. The current broad-scale consolidation in the crypto market is causing me to lower my rating on cryptocurrency trading place Coinbase Global ( COIN ) which has not seen the expected benefits from increased trading activity in the second-quarter. While a favorable ruling about the Ripple cryptocurrency could have helped overall sentiment towards the digital asset sector, both Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the two largest digital cryptocurrencies in the market, have continued to lose ground lately. Given the weak pricing setup for major cryptocurrencies, regulatory headwinds and the failure of the XRP securities ruling to change investor sentiment for the better, I am down-grading my rating on Coinbase Global from speculative buy to hold. Previous rating In An Anticyclical Bet On The Crypto Market I recommended Coinbase Global ahead of its Q2'23 earnings release due to the expectation that the rise in the price of the two largest cryptocurrencies in Q2'23 could have spurred retail trading on the Coinbase Global platform, resulting in a potential boost to the firm's transaction revenues. Unfortunately, this did not happen to the extent that I expected and given the deterioration in the pricing environment in recent days, I would expect trading activity on the Coinbase Global platform continue to weaken in the third-quarter. Second-quarter disappointment Coinbase Global generated only $327.1M in net revenues in the second-quarter, showing a 50% decline year over year. Both retail and institutional investors saw quarter over quarter declines in trading revenues which was surprising to me since I expected retail traders to jump back on the bandwagon after Ethereum and Bitcoin prices appreciated in the second-quarter. Coinbase Global's net revenues, including subscription and services revenues, declined 18% year over year to $662.5M, indicating that the price moves to the upside of Bitcoin and Ethereum have not sparked a trading frenzy on the cryptocurrency platform. Source: Coinbase Global Q2 Shareholder Letter Road to profitability and new product offers Despite revenue declines, Coinbase Global has managed to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in two consecutive quarters, indicating that the profitability trend is overall improving. Coinbase Global did report a Q2'23 net loss of $97.4M, but I think the current profitability situation is much better than in FY 2022. This is because Coinbase Global laid off staff and cut expenses in order to deal with the declining transaction volume on its platform. If the cryptocurrency market goes into another bull market, however, I would expect Coinbase Global to be able to translate positive adjusted EBITDA into GAAP profits as well… just like it did in FY 2021. Source: Coinbase Global New products could help the company to attract an entirely new group of customers to its platform: professional traders that deal with futures contracts. Just days ago, Coinbase Global secured approval from the National Futures Association which means the cryptocurrency platform will be the first such company that offers professional traders leveraged and cash-settled crypto futures. The inclusion of futures contracts is also another step in the direction of driving the industry towards broad-scale legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in the marketplace. Ripple Labs court case fails to recharge investor sentiment A federal judge decided in July that cryptocurrency Ripple was ""not necessarily a security"", thereby countering claims made by the Security and Exchange Commission that cryptocurrency platforms are engaged in the sale of unregistered securities. The ruling led to an initial improvement in investor sentiment, but this didn't last long. Ripple as well as other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Polygon have all seen significant price declines since. Estimates indicate that Coinbase Global will lose money this year and next year I still believe cryptocurrencies have a role to play in the global digital economy and as long as adoption is growing, cryptocurrency marketplaces like Coinbase Global will continue to attract investments from retail and institutional investors alike. Analysts currently project a loss of $1.98 per-share for FY 2023 and a loss of $1.10 per-share for FY 2024, implying an EPS year over year growth rate of 44%. However, EPS projections for volatile cryptocurrency platforms are extremely hard to make and the trajectory of such estimates can change quickly... especially if a new bull market were to emerge. In my last work on Coinbase Global I said I believe the crypto firm could at least achieve half of its 2021 annual EPS ($14.50) during the next bull market in the cryptocurrency market... which I still believe is possible, but it may take a while until investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies turns positive again. Calculating with $7.25 per-share in annual earnings potential, Coinbase Global would be valued at approximately 10.6X (forward) earnings. I believe COIN could be valued at 13X bull market earnings which would give the marketplace a fair value in a range of ~$94 per-share. While I have a hold rating on COIN right now due to the headwinds discussed here, I am not a buyer at the moment. Data by YCharts Risks with Coinbase Global One obvious commercial risk is that the cryptocurrency trading platform is dependent on overall investor sentiment and rising cryptocurrency prices... both of which are unpredictable. Additionally, Coinbase Global has considerable regulatory risks since cryptocurrencies remain effectively a grey area and the SEC was recently allowed to file an appeal against the ruling that Ripple is not a security, meaning regulatory headwinds for crypto investors are here to stay. Final thoughts Price volatility for the largest digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have not translated into a significant headwind for Coinbase Global's transaction revenues in the second-quarter... which was a disappointment. Additionally, while Ripple Labs won a major victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission in July, the security regulator is continuing to challenge the essential legitimacy of cryptocurrencies.

But now the token’s price moves on the daily chart showed the formation of a green candlestick yesterday after many days of posting vivid red ones. According to current stats, SOL’s price has decreased by over 7% in the past week. But from August 23, the coin started an uptrend reflected in its 24-hour price change of 5.75% today, August 24. Notably, the recent news about Shopify’s integration of Solana Pay seemingly reignites investors’ confidence in SOL. Millions Of Businesses On Shopify Can Now Use Solana Pay Solana Labs launched its decentralized payment platform, Solana Pay, on the layer-1 blockchain in February 2022 and now, Solana Pay’s plug-in is now available on Shopify. This allows millions of businesses using the e-commerce giant to use the service for payments. Related Reading: Pantera CEO Calls Ripple Victory A Black Swan, But Is It Bad? According to the reports, the first crypto option for users will be the second-largest stablecoin in the market, USDC. Given its stability and close value to USD, it was chosen as the first to appear on the platform. However, Shopify’s business development and partnerships head, Josh Fried, revealed that more crypto assets such as BONK and SOL will soon be available. Fried also shared with an online news site, TechCrunch, that transactions on Solana Pay are very affordable, given how low the ecosystem charges. Fried said: Credit card processing fees usually cost a business between 1.5% and 3.5% per transaction, but using the Solana Pay option is practically “fee-free. Also, he applauded Solana Pay as a crypto app worth using, saying, “Some people argue the killer app for crypto hasn’t arrived, but it has: it’s payments. [Everyone] should be doubling down on this.” Will SOL’s Current Uptrend Continue? Shopify is a globally recognized platform with a 10% share of the United States’ e-commerce industry. So Solana Pay’s entrance into the e-commerce giant’s hub is expected to boost the ecosystem’s exposure and utility. Already, there are more than 11 million active accounts on Solana and the ecosystem is also a player in the NFT sector, with over 21 million assets minted. It also offers low transaction costs at $0.00025. Related Reading: Optimism Reverses From Range Low With 10% Gain – How Far Can Bulls Go?

The deployment follows a successful testnet phase, and traders can now use the service to trade tokens at lower fees and improved capital efficiency.

EVMs refer to a set of virtual computers in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. A zero-knowledge proof is a way of proving the validity of a transaction without publicly revealing data of that transaction.  PancakeSwap v3 on Linea introduces advanced Swap and Liquidity Provision functionalities, offering users a seamless and efficient trading experience. Liquidity providers – the entities who provide capital on a DEX – can maximize their capital efficiency by concentrating their assets within specific price ranges where most trading occurs.  They can also achieve use of a capital multiplier of up to 4,000x, leveraging their locked token holdings and generating much higher returns during periods of market volatility.

16485476,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548664,1692885933,Terra Luna Classic Price Near-Term Advance – Will LUNC Climb 25%?,"Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) has embarked on a six-month journey marked by a consistent downtrend, largely influenced by the gravitational pull of a so-called descending channel pattern. This pattern, characterized by successive lower highs and lows, mirrors an active market sentiment favoring sales during attempts at bullish rebounds. Mid-August proved to be a pivotal juncture for LUNC as aggressive selling surged, triggering a precipitous plunge from $0.0000658 to $0.0000523. This swift and significant 34% drop led to a critical retest of the support trendline intrinsic to the falling channel pattern. Interestingly, the coin’s value exhibited resilience through multiple instances of dynamic rebounds, translating to intermittent bullish bounces in its ongoing recovery phase. Terra Luna Classic Chart Hints Signs Of Resurgence Delving into the price analysis, the daily chart unfolded a compelling narrative with a long-tailed rejection manifesting at the lower boundary of the channel pattern, commencing on August 17. This occurrence effectively signaled an undercurrent of demand pressure. Capitalizing on this support, the price rebounded vigorously, propelling it upwards by 22%, currently resting at $0.0000638. Source: TradingView Should LUNC’s price sustain its position above $0.6 in the coming days, a beacon of hope emerges for buyers to potentially spearhead a rally of up to 25%, culminating in a rendezvous with the overhead trendline of the channel. Yet, the market’s true affirmation of a trend reversal hinges upon a more decisive signal: a bullish breakout from the resistance trendline.

Consequently, Nova has stepped forward to finance the USTC repeg team, fostering a collaborative spirit. With an appeal for the community to align their interests and redelegate with Nova, a concerted effort seeks to bolster the USTC repeg mission and breathe renewed life into the Terra Luna Classic ecosystem.

Founded by experienced crypto trader 0xfermat, the project aims to redefine the trading experience by prioritizing user demands and delivering a seamless, transparent, and trustless environment. With its upcoming pre-launch in September, Equation is poised to offer traders and Liquidity Providers (LPs) up to 200x leverage, access to near-unlimited liquidity, and enhanced capital efficiency on the Arbitrum network. Visionary Origins Equation's journey began with its visionary founder, known as ""0xfermat"" across social networks. Previously, he served as an algorithm engineer at a prominent algorithm-driven company and later founded a financial technology company offering insurance actuarial and risk management solutions for banks and enterprises. Subsequently, he ventured into the world of cryptocurrency as a professional trader. The impact of the FTX event on his life and finances led 0xfermat to make a crucial decision. He resolved to establish a fully decentralized on-chain protocol, aiming to combat the infringements on market and individual rights caused by centralized exchanges and ""dictators"". Undertaking the creation of Equation's underlying protocol single-handedly, 0xfermat has been instrumental in shaping the project's foundation. With a strong belief in decentralization, anonymity, and open-source architecture, 0xfermat steered Equation towards becoming a community-driven initiative. Operating as a DAO, the team consists of skilled individuals with robust technical backgrounds and superior trading expertise. Embracing the decentralized ethos, Equation's team members maintain anonymity, ensuring a level playing field for all participants. Fairlaunch Principle Equation’s token emission will strictly adhere to Fairlaunch principle, eschewing institutional investors for mining-based token generation. This approach aligns with its commitment to fairness and equal opportunities for all participants. Token holders will not only have a voice in community governance but can also stake their tokens to earn a share of the protocol's fee distribution, fostering a sense of ownership and providing long-term incentives for engagement. This community-driven approach strengthen the protocol's foundation and ensure a fair and inclusive ecosystem for all. Innovative BRMM Model Equation has pioneered the Balance Rate Market Maker (BRMM), an innovative Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, especially tailored for the perpetual contract market. Thanks to BRMM, Equation can offer traders and liquidity providers (LPs) unprecedented leverage of up to 200x. Traders can access larger positions and near-unlimited liquidity. Simultaneously, LPs benefit from enhanced capital efficiency, creating a win-win situation for all participants. Diverging from traditional spot market AMMs, BRMM adopts a unique mechanism centered around the balance rate of the liquidity pool, which results in more efficient price discovery and expanded market-making opportunities. In the BRMM model, liquidity providers (LPs) willingly accept the risk of temporary and manageable liquidity pool imbalances in exchange for the platform's generous fee income. This ingenious approach empowers LPs to participate in market-making flexibly, providing deeper capital pool depth and ensuring traders benefit from a more stable trading experience. By introducing BRMM, the perpetual contract market has witnessed heightened liquidity and improved price discovery functionalities, all while safeguarding the interests of LPs. This novel AMM model is anticipated to accelerate the perpetual contract market's growth, ushering in greater innovations and opportunities within decentralized finance (DeFi). Quote ""I launch Equation because I want to redefine perpetual trading by delivering a seamless, transparent, user-friendly trading experience, prioritizing user demands and streamlining a clear interface with minimal process. Equation is committed to providing a trustless transaction environment that enables users to achieve financial freedom."" — 0xfermat, Founder of Equation Closing The upcoming pre-launch for Equation in September brings anticipation and excitement, as traders and LPs gear up to experience the next level of perpetual trading on the Arbitrum network. Join Equation on its journey to redefine the trading landscape and unlock new opportunities in the crypto space. About Equation Equation is a decentralized perpetual protocol built on Arbitrum. With its innovative BRMM model, Equation provides both traders and Liquidity Providers (LPs) with up to 200x leverage, enabling traders to access larger positions and near-unlimited liquidity while enhancing capital efficiency for LPs. Being one of the pioneering trader-oriented DeFi protocols, Equation stands as a testament to the power of community-driven innovation in shaping the future of decentralized finance. It prioritizes security and transparency, providing traders with a reliable and secure environment for perpetual trading participation.

Among the vast array of choices, PepeCoin (PEPE), Dogelon Mars (ELON), and Elonator (ETOR) take the spotlight, all fostering unique communities and offering immense potential. But can one of them outshine the rest with a refreshing blend of Elon Musk, the Terminator and AI technology? The Powerful and Unexpected Entrance of PEPE People say the best things in life come unexpectedly, and PepeCoin, taking those words to its little frog heart, decided to jump onto the crypto scene as discreetly as possible. Although it didn’t even offer a presale, within merely two weeks, PEPE’s price surged from around $0.000000001 to a whopping $0.00000431, leaving the entire market in awe. One notable thing about meme coins is that they rarely offer real utility, and PEPE is no exception. Regarded by many as the most ‘memeable’ asset on the Ethereum blockchain, this frog phenomenon, unfortunately, holds no fundamental and substantial value. Yet, as we all witnessed, that didn’t stop PEPE from surging to unimaginable heights. But will its meme coin appeal be enough for PEPE to remain among the top 3 meme coins? Now imagine the success of a coin with a meme potential as strong as PEPE’s but with extensively improved utility. Addressing all those technical issues, Elonator emerged with a long list of solutions that will improve the market conditions. Presenting a swap machine, an anti-whale dumping mechanism, a token tracker, a liquidity pool locking, and many more, the team behind ETOR created a first-class ecosystem, making Elonator one of the best 100x meme coins available. Elon Making ELON Surge Trying to replicate the remarkable success of Dogecoin (DOGE), Dogelon Mars emerged as a promising dog-themed meme coin in the market, quickly surging toward the top 3 meme coins rankings. Using the influence of Elon Musk, the man hugely responsible for DOGE’s success, ELON based the whole project around an alien dog, loosely resembling Elon Musk, returning to Mars. The project aims to create an “intergalactic currency” that can be used beyond Earth to foster an inclusive and innovative ecosystem. Realising the extent of Elon Musk’s power, Elonator emerged like a shooting star, making the founder and CEO of Tesla the face of its project. Knowing that the billionaire has a track record of propelling digital assets to grow upon his endorsement, ETOR’s team curated a strategic plan that is bound to succeed. Already exceeding meme coin expectations with its innovative technology, Elon’s approval will make Elonator shine even brighter. > Experience the Power of Top 3 Meme Coins with Elonator With a skillful merge of AI and Elon Musk, Elonator (ETOR) could already make a long-lasting mark on its niche, becoming one of the giants of the industry. But as any genius would, ETOR’s team kept seeking ways for improvement, finding that magical element that made things even better. Knowing that real success only happens when innovation and longevity meet, Elonator channelled the energy of the indestructible Terminator, ensuring ETOR is not a seasonal asset but a long-term profitable investment. The good news doesn’t seem to end there, as Elonator presents one of the best crypto presales ever. With numerous lotteries and valuable prizes, ETOR is poised to attract the attention of investors worldwide, becoming a real force to be reckoned with. PepeCoin, Dogelon Mars, and Elonator in the crypto sea all fight for a spot among the top 3 meme coins. With Elonator merging the most powerful aspects of modern technology and being brand new to the market, ETOR will certainly explode in value. Make sure you seize the opportunity, join Elonator’s community, and enjoy the perks of investing in 100x meme coins!

Youssef’s remarks on Ethereum’s influence over Bitcoin’s growth trajectory were both striking and laden with implications for the future. Related Reading: Whale Moves 2,910 Bitcoin (BTC) To Exchange Amid FBI Warnings, A Bearish Signal? Ethereum’s Challenge To Bitcoin Growth On August 23, Ray Youssef who is also a founder of the Built With Bitcoin Foundation, expressed his view that Ethereum, despite its shared objectives with Bitcoin, presents a significant hurdle to Bitcoin’s broader acceptance. The crypto expert particularly noted: “ETH has been the biggest block against Bitcoin adoption.” Youssef’s rationale? He suggests that the challenges posed by Ethereum overshadow its utility parallels with Bitcoin. The foundational issues, according to Youssef, lie in Ethereum’s inherent characteristics. Further amplifying his viewpoint, Youssef highlighted the potential of CivKit, a platform he believes could mimic the necessities of a financial model. In doing so, he suggests that this would effectively sift out deceptive components, leaving them to scammers. ETH has been the biggest block against Bitcoin adoption. At first I saw utility we could copy but the negatives far out weigh any positives. #civkit will replicate what is needed on ultra sound honest money and leave the rest for the scammers. Nuf said https://t.co/4YIvOX3nAF — Ray Youssef (@raycivkit) August 23, 2023 Building on this, Youssef recently pointed out the potential role of BRICS nations, including Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, in shaping the future of P2P Bitcoin markets. Civ Kit and Drivechain: The Innovations In The Crypto Space? April saw the release of a whitepaper introducing Civ Kit, a product endorsed by Youssef and other Bitcoin enthusiasts like Antoine Riard and Nicholas Gregory. This tool aims to create a resistant, decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace. By combining Nostr architecture with the Lightning Network, Civ Kit promises enhanced privacy and security, offering features like decentralized identity, escrowed trades, and P2P messaging protocol. However, the conversation that initially triggered Youssef’s tweet focused on a discussion between researcher Timoleon Moraitis and Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin. This conversation, highlighted by Bitcoin expert Pierre Rochard, revealed Co-Founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin’s lack of interest in Drivechain, a feature that allows Bitcoin to operate across secondary chains, termed “sidechains.” Rochard commented on the significance of this conversation, noting Buterin’s position could be seen as an informal “veto” of Drivechain’s relevance. I disagree with individual arguments on both sides of this debate, but it’s great to learn from others especially when we don’t align. This conversation is interesting because Vitalik is the ideal “customer” for Drivechains. If he doesn’t want it, that’s almost like a veto. pic.twitter.com/uxG2aFnUvj — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) August 22, 2023 In a further twist, Buterin opined on the changing dynamics of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains since 2019, stating that BTC miners no longer dominate this landscape. Emphasizing the shift in power dynamics, Buterin remarked that even with a majority, miners cannot enforce the acceptance of invalid blocks into the main chain. He underscored that the controlling power now resides with the users.

The company's balanced approach to crypto treasury management makes it a play on both BTC mining and ETH staking. The core mining business has a long way to go to become profitable, given the company's $48k BTC break-even price. When I last covered Bit Digital (BTBT) for Seeking Alpha in mid-June, I gave the company a bullish call at $3.36. Beyond the fact that Bit Digital takes a more balanced approach to managing crypto holdings than most of the other public miners, the company also operates a relatively lean business with very little debt: The company has been making moves over the last two months and I think it remains one of the more interesting miners in the public equity markets given its low debt, spot market rig purchases, and focus on blue chip digital assets. I believe this one is going to continue to outperform and I still like it as a high-upside proxy for Bitcoin bulls. Since that article, BTBT shares rallied over 50% up to $4.80 per share before falling back down below $2.50 two months later amid crypto's broad selloff. Data by YCharts Given the retracement in shares from the high earlier this summer and a setup that I view as favorable for both Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), I think BTBT shares offer a solid risk/reward buy opportunity down here as a blue-chip crypto proxy. Q2 Performance In 2nd quarter 2023, Bit Digital recorded just over $9 million in total revenue. $8.9 million of which was derived from Bitcoin mining with the remaining revenue coming from Ethereum staking. Revenue was up 32% year over year and 8.4% sequentially. Cost of revenue increased from $5.2 million to $5.7 million quarter over quarter. Total opex moved up from $8.8 million to $9.1 million as operating income came in at -$5.7 million for the second straight quarter. Data by YCharts Aided by back to back quarters of currency exchange gains over $4 million, Bit Digital kept basic EPS loss at -$0.03 for the second consecutive period. It's admittedly still negative, but the company's balance sheet management over the last two quarters puts Bit Digital ahead of its similarly capitalized peers in terms of earnings. Balance Sheet As of quarter ended June 2023, the company had $18.5 million in cash and equivalents, $31.6 million in digital assets, and $30 million combined in property, equipment, and deposits. There had been a notable 43% decline in cash and equivalents over the last six months and the company raised $11 million in fresh cash through a private investment from Ionic Ventures in a subsequent event after quarter end. Monthly Crypto Treasury (Bit Digital) Given the company's ETH staking strategy, we've seen the share breakout of Bit Digital's ETH & BTC HODL dramatically change from 85% BTC a year ago to over 53% ETH at the end of the July 2023. I generally view this as smart treasury management because actively staked ETH generates a yield natively on-chain while BTC does not. We can also observe an increase in both BTC and ETH held in treasury since quarter ended June as well. BTBT July 2023 Bitcoin Ethereum Mining/Staking Rewards 133 44 Change in HODL +192 +428 Difference +59 +384 Source: Bit Digital, figures in whole coins Given the fact that Bit Digital's change in both ETH and BTC treasury balances surpassed what the company yielded through blockchain rewards, it appears as though the company has already deployed some of its capital to scale up crypto positions. Assuming purchases close to the average closing prices in July of $30k for BTC and $1.9K for ETH, the increases in HODL that exceed blockchain rewards imply the company put roughly $2.5 million toward buying spot BTC and ETH in July. It's unfortunate that the company could have gotten a better deal on those buys had it waited a few weeks, but balance sheet management otherwise has been strong in my view. In the July update, Bit Digital noted $21.9 million in cash and equivalents as of month end. With just $8.6 million in total liabilities and over $50 million in working capital at the end of June, the company has some runway to be patient with the market and get the best price on its BTC or ETH if it chooses to liquidate to raise capital. Risks Like several other BTC miners with low debt loads, Bit Digital does carry dilution risk. While it's been to a lesser degree over the last month, share issuance has historically been how the company raises capital rather than going to the debt markets: Data by YCharts In July, the Company issued over 3.1 million shares to Ionic Ventures for net proceeds of approximately $11.0 million after broker-dealer commissions. This strengthens the company's cash position further, but it does come at the expense of the common equity shareholders. Furthermore, although it is not the worst in the industry, Bit Digital's breakeven Bitcoin price is a bit on the high side when adding cost of revenues and opex figures and then dividing by quarterly BTC mined: Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Q2-23 TTM Cost of Revenues $6,500,000 $6,000,000 $5,200,000 $5,700,000 $23,400,000 Total Opex $15,500,000 $17,400,000 $8,800,000 $9,100,000 $50,800,000 BTC Mined 429 427 361 318 1,535 Breakeven Price $51,282 $54,801 $38,781 $46,541 $48,339 Source: Seeking Alpha, Bit Digital, analyst's calculations The last two quarters have been better than the second half of 2022. But at a $48.3k trailing twelve month breakeven BTC price, there are other miners in the space that theoretically get to cash flow positive from the core line of business faster than Bit Digital does if the company's currency exchange gains don't continue to offset operational losses in the future. BTBT Valuation Multiples (Seeking Alpha) Finally, at three times book and over 6 times sales, BTBT is price far from growth and is far from ""cheap"" by traditional valuation metrics. It's a highly speculative name and these kinds of stocks could do very poorly if the broader equity markets take another leg lower. Summary Despite the risks and the obvious dependence on digital asset prices to get to profitability, I continue to be bullish Bit Digital at this point. I believe the company's openness to both Bitcoin and Ethereum monetization models will ultimately pay off well in the future. Flywheel (Bit Digital) The flywheel model that Bit Digital is currently running gives the company nice optionality. It has a balanced approach to blue-chip crypto asset management that utilizes ETH for passive yield at minimal cost. I like this about the company very much. If Bitcoin is ""digital gold,"" Ethereum is arguably ""digital gas."" In my view, BTBT is a clean and easy way to wager on future adoption of both BTC and ETH outside of holding the coins directly or chasing arbitrage through the Grayscale funds. All this said, there are clearly a lot of risks with Bit Digital as well. If my math and my interpretations from the company's July update are accurate, Bit Digital is currently underwater on recent BTC and ETH purchases. I expect those positions to ultimately turn around. But it could be a sign of poor execution on a reasonable strategy.

The so-called notional open interest was $1.41 billion at press time, the lowest since July 2022, according to data tracked by Coinglass. Binance is the world's largest digital asset exchange by trading volume and by open interest in both spot and futures markets.  The notional value in ether futures on Binance has declined by 35% in one week, consistent with the market-wide leverage washout seen since last Thursday; the notional open interest in the exchange's bitcoin perpetual futures has slid 17% to $3.02 billion over that same period.  ""On the bright side, this excess leverage in the derivatives market has now been flushed out of the system,"" Reflexivity Research said in a market weekly market update.  Ether's global estimated leverage ratio, calculated by dividing the dollar value locked in the active open perpetual futures contracts by the total number of coins held by derivatives exchanges, has declined from a multi-month high of 0.28 to 0.22. Bitcoin's ratio has slid from 0.27 to 0.21, the lowest since May, according to data tracked by South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant.  It shows that the degree of leverage deployed to magnify returns is significantly lower than a week ago. It also means a lower probability of liquidations-driven volatility in the coming weeks.  ""Don't read much into the recent move; it was exceptionally low liquidity + leverage liquidation,"" lan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email.

Rarity Takes a Stand In a bold move that underscores its commitment to artist royalties, NFT marketplace Rarity announced its decision to sever ties with OpenSea, LooksRare, and X2Y2, effective September 30. This decision is a staunch defense of creator rights amidst an ongoing debate about NFT royalties. Rarity, known as a prominent NFT marketplace and aggregator, has been unwavering in its support for artist royalties. The platform's recent announcement clarified its stance. The statement declared, ""By September 30th, Rarible.com will no longer aggregate orders from OpenSea, LooksRare or X2Y2…We support royalties. We always have. And we always will.” Redefining Paradigms In Web3 Era In its public statement, Rarity commended the potential of Web3, emphasizing its promise for artists and creators. Beyond mining NFTs, the platform envisions a redefinition of how creativity is valued and compensated. According to Rarity, the core principle of royalties aligns perfectly with the spirit of decentralization, claiming it to be an ongoing acknowledgment of the creator's worth in each transaction. The platform asserted, ""We stand in solidarity with creators and artists. That's why we will no longer support marketplaces that neglect royalties.” Shifting Stance On Royalties OpenSea, a significant player in the NFT market, was initially a vocal advocate for creator royalties, offering rates of up to 10%. However, for the completion of its Blur project, it opted to make NFT creator royalties an optional feature. The marketplace introduced the Operator Filter tool to ensure royalty payments, but this initiative lacked universal buy-in across the Web3 ecosystem. OpenSea's CEO, Devin Finzer, acknowledged this shortfall, stating that the desired empowerment of creators hadn't materialized and recently announced his decision to sunset the Operator Filter. The NFT market is witnessing a trend towards optional creator royalties, leaving creators unpaid upon resale. This policy shift has been adopted by various platforms, including LooksRare, Sudoswap, Magic Eden, and X2Y2. While this move aligns with the evolving landscape, it also raises concerns about the financial well-being of artists. Rarity's Trading Surges In the next 24 hours following the announcement, Rarity experienced a notable surge in trading volume. Analytics data from DappRadar illustrated a remarkable 585% spike in 24-hour fiat trading volume on Rarible, surpassing $45,000 on August 23. While these figures might be modest compared to industry counterparts, Rarity's volume leap outperformed OpenSea and LooksRare. The former saw a trading volume decline of approximately 19%, while the latter experienced a staggering drop of around 74%. On the other hand, X2Y2 observed a volume increase of 8.8% over the same period. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42419739,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFXGH,1692880240,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Jumps to $26.5K as Trading Volume Increases,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin posted a sizable advance on Wednesday, rising nearly 5% at one point to just shy of $26,800 alongside a rally in traditional markets as interest rates retreated. Institutional cryptocurrency exchange LMAX Digital noted that trading volume has been trending up over the week but saw a significant increase on Wednesday. “Bitcoin volumes printed $173 million, 59% above 30-day average volume and ether volumes printed $92 million, 70% above 30-day average volume,” the exchange said in a morning note. The uptick for bitcoin’s price and trading volumes stems from traditional markets, said LMAX, “with stocks rallying and the U.S. dollar selling off, cryptocurrencies were able to benefit.”  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX wants to start selling, staking and hedging its sizable crypto holdings, and is seeking to hire Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital as an advisor, according to courtfilings made late Wednesday evening. FTX, which collapsed in November 2022, wants to return funds to creditors in fiat currency rather than bitcoin or ether and hopes careful trading can avoid denting the value of its more than $3 billion in crypto holdings. “Hedging bitcoin and ether will allow the Debtors [FTX] to limit potential downside risk prior to the sale of such bitcoin or ether,” the filing by the FTX lawyers said. “Staking certain digital assets… will inure to the benefit of the estates — and, ultimately, creditors — by generating low risk returns on their otherwise idle digital assets.""  Binance is discontinuing its crypto-backed debit card in Latin America and the Middle East, according to a post on X (formerly Twitter) by its customer support team on Thursday. No reason was provided for the decision, though the cryptocurrency exchange went on to say that less than 1% of its users in the regions would be affected. The card has been in use in Latin America for one year, having been rolled out in Argentina last August and in Brazil in January. The debit card allows customers to use their crypto assets to make transactions in shops or online as they would with a debit card issued by their bank. Discontinuation of the Binance Card in Latin America and the Middle East will take effect on Sept. 21, according to the post.  Chart of the day  The chart shows growth in the total value locked in the decentralized finance protocols that involve real world assets (RWA).  The TVL has surged to $1.2 billion from $100 million at the start of the year, according to data tracked by Matrixport.  ""Smart traders increasingly use those RWA as the equivalent of safe-haven assets as holders collect the yield while waiting for the crypto downside volatility to subside,"" Matrixport said in a market note on Thursday.

One day, an investor triples his investment, and the next day, all of it is gone. So knowing when to sell and exit a position can sometimes be challenging. This is the recent case of a once-DOGE millionaire who has seen the worth of his holdings fall from almost $3 million to $50,000. However, despite the ups and downs, this long-time HODLer believes Dogecoin has staying power. Still Bullish On Dogecoin Dogecoin has come a long way since its creation as a joke. The cryptocurrency saw its value spike dramatically in 2021, making early investors sudden millionaires in the process. At the peak of its rally, DOGE rose from a market cap of $1.2 billion to $75.26 billion in less than five months to reach a price all-time high of $0.74. Related Reading: Kenya’s 17-Member Committee Officially Kicks Off Investigation Into Worldcoin One of these investors who became millionaires overnight as a result of this rise was Las Vegas resident Glauber Contessoto, known as SlumDOGE Millionaire on social media platform X. During the rise of DOGE, this investor saw his holdings reach $2.9 million and was popularly known as one of the first Dogecoin millionaires. The hype bubble has since popped, and the value of Dogecoin has toppled, with the cryptocurrency now trading at $0.06378. This would see Contessoto’s holdings now worth around $50,000. Despite his loss, Contessoto continues to have trust in Dogecoin. According to a social media post, he mentioned how dog theme meme coins have a better chance of spiking than other meme coins. “I feel like they will rise again,” he said. He said this while noting the success of frog-themed crypto PEPE. I honestly don’t think Dog themed meme coins are done. I feel like they will rise again 🤔$PEPE had it’s run, frog was cool 🐸 But dogs are where it’s at foreal 🐶 — SlumDOGE Millionaire (@ProTheDoge) August 23, 2023 Contessoto is not the only one that has witnessed the value of his DOGE holdings fall dramatically. Another investor, Keith Johnson, who suffered losses, made headlines for filing a $258 billion lawsuit against Elon Musk. Known as the Dogefather because of his support for Dogecoin, Musk’s tweets regarding the crypto have regularly led to price spikes. What’s Next For DOGE? Even though Dogecoin has continued to struggle, the meme coin has had its moments this year. In July, DOGE saw a brief spike in price, leading it to become the 8th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. But while the Dogecoin ecosystem has gathered a huge community, things seem to be calm at the moment. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Will Start Implementing ShibPaper, What Does This Mean?

Zooming out to the 2-week time frame, things look so much clearer, and it’s easy to see exactly where bitcoin is in relation to past price action. It’s only when one does this that it becomes apparent that bitcoin is actually holding nicely above the price structure that it has been building since mid-2022. Bitcoin is following the same pattern In fact this same process has been followed ever since the first phase of the bitcoin bull market in 2012, and the succeeding ones in 2016, 2019, and now 2023. The same bottom is made, which in the last two bear markets was a double bottom, and which so far has also been the case for this bear market that bitcoin is currently emerging from. All bitcoin has done in the current phase 1 of its bull market is confirm the support on top of the structure it has built at around $23,000 to $25,000. The current drop in price looks as though it might reconfirm this support. Worst case scenario Of course, looking at the worst case scenario bitcoin could even drop through this support. It could wick down, or it could even go down to revisit the low. However, even this would not negate this phase 1 of the bull market, and would be an amazing opportunity to buy. New investors are full of the stories of how bitcoin did crazy percentage gains to the upside in previous bull markets, but this time it looks to be different. The gains are definitely declining for each successive bitcoin bull market, but even so, a rise to $100,000 is not out of the question, and a 4x in the present financial environment would be an amazing return. Bitcoin is freedom Bitcoin is much more though than a 4x gain in wealth. It is monetary freedom. It is a haven from the madness and catastrophic future that fiat currencies will wreak upon the world. There are all sorts of doubts in finance. Nothing is ever 100% certain, except one thing - fiat currencies will continue to debase and they will all eventually go to zero. If you are able to think back to when you were younger and how prices were so much cheaper, then you are witnessing the debasement of your currency. This is impossible for governments to turn around and prices will only keep rising as more currency is printed into existence. Governments and central banks are enslaving their populations, and should central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) be implemented, their control over the citizenry will be total.

According to the order, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers “can take unlimited advantage of the legal visitation hours” at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York to prepare their client for a weeks-long trial slated to begin Oct. 3. Bankman-Fried will have “frequent access” to a computer to review discovery materials, and can request “selected materials” be loaded onto hard drives for his viewing, the judge said in the order.  The order also references other accommodations made by the Bureau of Prisons in New York, but these were redacted in a letter filed by prosecutors last week.  Judge Lewis Kaplan’s concessions fell short of the defense’s requests that Bankman-Fried be released for daily hours-long meetings at his lawyers’ office in Manhattan or transferred to a lower-security prison in Putnam County, two hours north of New York City.

As of European afternoon hours, the Polygon-based Trump Digital Trading Cards were selling for over 0.13 ether (ETH), or just over $215, up from 0.1 ETH, or $150, last week. The collection has amassed over 17 ether in trading volume, according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea.  Trump released the collection of 45,000 fantasy cards last December for $99 apiece, featuring images of him in a style similar to collectible baseball cards. The collection has over 13,000 unique holders as of Thursday.  Collectors who purchased one of the digital trading cards are automatically entered into a ""sweepstakes"" to receive ""experiences"" with Trump, including a Zoom call, a dinner in Miami, or a cocktail hour at Mar-a-Lago, as CoinDesk previously reported.  The cards sold out quickly at the time. As of Thursday, data shows a wallet tagged ""6D65A7"" holds the highest individual Trump NFTs with 602 cards followed by 72F891 at 500 cards. Neither of the two holders has listed his or her NFTs for sale.  Trump was recently revealed to be a major holder of tokens. The former president and leading Republican candidate for next year’s election held $2.8 million in a cryptocurrency wallet as of early August, as reported, and earned some $4.87 million in licensing fees from the Trump NFT collection.  As such, the NFT collection has steadily fallen in value in the past several months amid a general decline in the broader crypto market.

16479076,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/us-charges-tornado-cash-co-founders-with-laundering-over-1b,1692874800,US Charges Tornado Cash Co-Founders With Laundering Over $1B,"Two Tornado Cash co-founders have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and sanctions violations. On Wednesday, the United States Attorney’s Office announced in a press release the unsealing of an indictment charging Roman Storm and Roman Semenov with conspiracy to commit money laundering, sanctions violations and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The charges against two of Tornado Cash’s co-founders arise from their alleged creation, operation, and promotion of the crypto mixer. According to the press release, Tornado Cash facilitated over $1 billion in money laundering transactions and laundered hundreds of millions from the North Korean cybercrime organization, the Lazarus Group. Strom and Semenov Knew They Were Aiding Money Laundering US Attorney Damian Williams said: “As alleged, Tornado Cash was an infamous cryptocurrency mixer that laundered more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds and violated U.S. sanctions. Roman Storm and Roman Semenov allegedly operated Tornado Cash and knowingly facilitated this money laundering. While publicly claiming to offer a technically sophisticated privacy service, Storm and Semenov in fact knew that they were helping hackers and fraudsters conceal the fruits of their crimes. Today’s indictment is a reminder that money laundering through cryptocurrency transactions violates the law, and those who engage in such laundering will face prosecution.” In the announcement, the US Attorney’s Office said Roman Storm was arrested on Wednesday in the State of Washington, but Roman Semenov remains at large. The Wall Street Journal reports, Tornado’s alleged third co-founder, Alexey Pertsev, was arrested in the Netherlands in August on money laundering charges. Pertsev is under house arrest in the Netherlands as he awaits trial. CNBC quotes Brian Klein, Roman Strom’s lawyer, who said: “We are incredibly disappointed that the prosecutors chose to charge Mr. Storm.” Klein added they believe prosecutors “did so based on a novel legal theory with dangerous implications for all software developers.” Storm’s lawyer further said: “Mr. Storm has been cooperating with the prosecutors’ investigation since last year and disputes that he engaged in any criminal conduct. There is a lot more to this story that will come out at trial.” On Wednesday, the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) also sanctioned Roman Semenov. The OFAC banned Americans from using the cryptocurrency mixer in August 2022. Wednesday’s indictment was a joint effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation unit. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland commented: “These charges should serve as yet another warning to those who think they can turn to cryptocurrency to conceal their crimes and hide their identities, including cryptocurrency mixers: it does not matter how sophisticated your scheme is or how many attempts you have made to anonymize yourself, the Justice Department will find you and hold you accountable for your crimes.” Christopher A. Wray, Director of the FBI, said: “Today’s announcement should remind criminal organizations everywhere in the world that they are neither untraceable nor anonymous. You can’t hide from us behind a keyboard — whether you’re a hacker or facilitator. Those charged today engaged in a conspiracy to launder money for cybercriminals, including for a North Korean cybercrime organization seeking to evade sanctions. As we have with this operation, the FBI is going to keep dismantling the infrastructure used by cyber criminals to commit and profit from their crimes, and holding anyone who assists those criminals accountable.” US Court Dismisses Appeal to Lift Sanctions on Tornado US District Judge Robert Pitman dismissed an appeal filed by Tornado Cash users to lift the sanctions imposed on the crypto mixer. Judge Pitman agreed with the government and Treasury Department on all of its claims and granted a summary judgement in the case. The court filing said: “The Court finds that Tornado Cash is an association within the ordinary meaning of the term and is, therefore, an entity that may be designated per OFAC regulations.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

16478552,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548660,1692873910,Bitcoin And Crypto Face Pressure: Impact Of Rising Real Yields,"The intricate dance between Bitcoin, crypto and real yields is becoming increasingly pronounced. As the world of traditional finance grapples with the implications of shifting real yields, the BTC and crypto market is not immune to these fluctuations. For the uninitiated, the ‘real yield’ refers to the yield on US treasuries, adjusted for inflation. This metric is pivotal in understanding the broader financial ecosystem, and its movements can have profound implications for risk assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Higher Real Yields = Bitcoin And Crypto Down Renowned analyst @tedtalksmacro recently shed light on this intricate relationship, stating, “An important correlation – BTC + US real yields. Simply, higher real yields drive investors to cash and fixed-income… and out of ‘riskier’ assets like BTC and stocks.” This observation underscores the delicate balance that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies maintain with the broader financial market. The path of real yields is determined by two primary factors: inflation and nominal rates. With the Federal Reserve’s hiking cycle nearing its end, nominal yields are potentially at their zenith. However, the trajectory of inflation remains uncertain, and as @tedtalksmacro notes, it will “likely be the greater mover of real yields.” Adding another layer of complexity, the US treasury’s recent influx of longer-dated issuance is exerting upward pressure on nominal yields, especially on the back-end. The 10-year, for instance, is trading at highs not witnessed since 2008. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? On the topic of inflation, expectations lean towards a decline in the coming months. As @tedtalksmacro astutely points out, “If you have been following along, [this would be] conducive to higher real yields. Higher real-yields are bearish for risk-assets.” This observation is particularly salient for the crypto community, as falling inflation, counterintuitively, might spell trouble for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes aim to curb inflation. Yet, the unintended consequence of this strategy, combined with sustained high rates, could be a rise in real yields. This makes fixed-income assets more appealing, potentially diverting investments away from riskier ventures like stocks and altcoins. The crypto community awaits Jerome Powell’s address this Friday with bated breath. As @tedtalksmacro anticipates, Powell is likely to persist with the ‘higher for longer’ rhetoric, a stance the FOMC has maintained since late 2021. “Higher for longer + falling inflation + fresh duration issuance = higher real-yields = lower risk assets,” concludes @tedtalksmacro. Will BTC And Crypto Fall Due To Jackson Hole? Keith Alan, founder of Material Indicators, draws attention to historical patterns and potential market reactions to Jackson Hole. “Remember when FED Chair Powell spoke from Jackson Hole last year and his hawkish tone triggered a 29% BTC dump that took 5 months to recover? JPow returns to JHole this Friday and there are some similarities in the PA we are seeing now and the PA we saw leading up to last year’s speech.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Shoots Up, Pain Not Over Yet? Alan highlights the technical patterns observed in Bitcoin’s price movements leading up to Powell’s previous speech and the current scenario. However, he cautions against drawing direct parallels, emphasizing the changed macroeconomic conditions and Powell’s evolved communication style. “To be clear, the similarities in the current PA, relative to last year’s PA do not mean that price will react the same way this time,” Alan states. He underscores the need for investors to be vigilant, yet not reactive, to the potential market volatility surrounding the upcoming Jackson Hole event. “We must expect JPow’s words to move markets.” At press time, BTC traded at $26,589.

42419728,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFX93,1692873666,U.K.’s Travel Rule Troubles Showcase Global Challenge for Crypto,"On Sept. 1, the U.K. will implement the “travel rule,” an international anti-money laundering law for crypto set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  Crypto firms want further guidance and regulatory leeway for cross-border transfers as they work on compliance.  U.K. crypto firms have just days to implement the “travel rule” designed to curb money laundering – but patchy implementation of the rule globally is not making it easier for service providers to comply, CoinDesk has been told by industry experts.  Norms set by international standard setter the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), including a requirement for firms to identify the names of people behind transactions, have proved controversial for many in the crypto industry. There have been particular tussles over how to adapt it to crypto’s unique features, such as self-custodied wallets that aren’t hosted by any regulated provider.  Others see it as essential in the fight against dirty money, and to improve crypto’s reputation. With just a total of 35 jurisdictions passing the required legislation, FATF in June described the failure to implement the rule as a “serious concern.”  The requirement to gather data on who their customers interact with overseas also poses a headache for crypto firms. There’s a transitional problem which Ilya Brovin, chief growth officer from Sumsub, a verification platform, described as a “sunrise issue” for the law.  “The fact that somewhere it's enforced and in other places it's not enforced.. [so] how do you get players in your jurisdiction where you want to enforce it to be compliant [when] the counterparties they need to deal with are not compliant?” Brovin said, adding that the travel rule will help institutions know which crypto businesses they can trust.  “It's such a novel area, industry players had a million questions … and I'd say in most places, regulators were kind of really slow to provide guidance,” Brovin said.  The U.K. laws are set to take effect as of Sept. 1, and lobby groups like UK Finance and Claire Cross, partner at law firm Corker Binning, are calling for a standardized approach to the travel rule across jurisdictions.  “A lack of harmonization will result in cracks in the system which can be exploited by those involved in criminal activity,” Cross told CoinDesk. “The FCA is certainly on the right track in implementing the rule, let’s hope the rest of the world is quick to follow.”  The problem is that, even in some of the 35 places that have passed laws, they still haven’t taken effect – including in near neighbor the European Union, where the legislation only enters into force at the end of 2024.  Even where implemented, there are discrepancies. Canada, for instance, requires operators to jot down beneficiaries’ postal addresses, while the U.K. doesn’t, and firms are caught in a quandary when handling a transfer between the two, Catarina Veloso, co-chair of lobby group CryptoUK’s travel rule working group, told CoinDesk.  Veloso, who’s also a senior associate for regulatory and compliance at Notabene, praised the open approach taken by U.K. regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, which has tested the issue with the industry as part of its “sandbox” exercises. But the FCA’s August guidelines – which ask wallet providers to make a risk-based assessment when receiving funds from foreign non-compliant jurisdictions – “could use a bit more granularity,” she added.  To fix that, she’s turning to the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG) – an industry body whose guidance can be taken into consideration by regulators and courts. CryptoUK will be writing to the group imminently to call for more details on how to handle inbound transfers, and how to work with non-compatible, closed protocols, she said.  But with the rules taking effect in just one week, she also hopes the FCA will go easy while firms tackle these problems.  “I hope that the regulator is empathetic to these issues … I hope there's some leeway in understanding that these things take time,” Veloso said, highlighting a delicate balance with data privacy. “There will be conflicts and we'll need to see with experience how they ended up being settled.”  The FCA did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request on whether it will indeed show that leeway.

Top-ranking game Dapp Iskra will be one of the gaming category’s features, releasing its latest Free to Play game, ClashMon: Ignition. The ClashMon Collectible Battle RPG offers its first minting opportunity on Base Mainnet during On-chain Summer prior to fully rolling the game out in September. Starting on August 27, the ClashMon Onchain Summer Event allows players to mint a Game NFT Mystery Box and reveal their own ClashMon Monster, ClashMon gear, and ClashMon Tokens. This first mint heralds the game’s launch in September 2023, allowing players to get a head start on building their monster decks. ClashMon is one of the many accessible on-chain games from the Iskra game platform that enhances enjoyable gameplay with the benefits of digital ownership through play, trading, collecting, crafting, and competition Offering the ultimate competitive, winner-take-all experience, Clashmon is designed to be fun but competitive and easy to access through any web browser. Players are able to build and ‘own’ their team of Clashmons for trading, collecting, and fishing (resource farming). Most importantly, the game design emphasizes the spirit of competition. The Collectible Battle RPG comes alive with fast-paced RPG-style monster fights and high-stakes tournament rounds but balances out the pacing with a soothing fishing mode where players can gather resources for gear or pursue other enhancements. In addition, players can simply have fun with a much-loved Galactic Shot mini-game, best described as the penultimate ‘game of chicken.’ Players need to ‘escape’ or run from a launched Penguin before it self-destructs. The longer players can hold their nerve, the higher the reward - if they manage to survive before the explosion. Will Chung, Team Lead for ClashMon, explains, “The team sought to design a game that will let users experience the thrill of winning and competition while incorporating the enjoyment of collecting, trading, and farming game assets. The more you play, the more you can gain and delight in new experiences and immerse yourself more deeply in the ClashMon world.” Iskra believes that onboarding the next generation of on-chain users will be driven by engaging games that demonstrate the actual value of digital ownership. Jesse Pollak, Creator of Base and Head of Protocols at Coinbase, predicts that “On-chain gaming will be one of the key verticals bringing the next billion users on-chain. We’re super excited to work with global leaders like Iskra to deliver Base users a diverse, high-quality gaming experience.” About Iskra offers an all-in-one on-chain game platform that rewards players and developers through a unique community system. Services include on-chain games, wallet, DEX, marketplace, and launchpad. The project is backed by some of the biggest tech and video game companies in South Korea and consistently ranks in the top categories for gaming on Dapp Radar for unique active wallets and engagement.

The developers are diligently addressing the issues that plagued its debut, with hopes of a smoother second attempt. Network Improvement Efforts Underway Following a problematic launch that left the network stalled and funds trapped on a bridge, Shiba Inu's lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has provided an update on the project's progress. Kusama revealed that the team has been diligently working to optimize the network, stating, ""After two days of testing and tweaking parameters to achieve 'ready' state Shibarium is now enhanced and optimized."" This involved the implementation of fail-safe measures to prevent a recurrence of the previous outage. To bolster Shibarium's stability, the development team has introduced a series of further safeguards, including rate limiting at the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) level and an automatic server reset mechanism. These measures are expected to counteract the impact of sudden surges in traffic, which contributed to the network's initial troubles. Testing Success and Initial Hiccups During its testing phase, Shibarium demonstrated its potential by facilitating an impressive 22 million transactions across millions of wallets over four months. However, the official launch encountered severe disruptions. The network suffered an 11-hour transaction stall, leaving funds stranded due to an overload triggered by an unexpected influx of transactions. As reported by blockchain security firm PeckShield, around $1.7 million worth of ETH was stuck in the Shibarium Bridge as a result of the network failure. The development team clarified that the launch failure was not due to a bridge issue, as initially speculated. Instead, the network was overwhelmed by an unprecedented surge in user transactions, causing server failures. The influx of transactions far exceeded the servers' capacity to process them efficiently. Steps Toward Redemption The network has been temporarily closed to the public as the team focuses on resolving the underlying issues. Validators responsible for processing network transactions are now being gradually onboarded to pave the way for the network's reopening. This controlled approach aims to ensure a smoother experience upon relaunch. Shytoshi Kusama's recent update indicates that Shibarium's comeback is on the horizon. Additional validators are poised to join the network, expanding its operational capacity. However, the incident had a short-term impact on SHIB token prices, with a 4.3% drop in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

16476471,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548662,1692870314,"Pantera CEO Calls Ripple Victory A Black Swan, But Is It Bad?","A recent release suggests that Pantera CEO Dan Morehead may have predicted the impact of a Ripple victory long before it occurred. Ripple Victory: A “Positive Black Swan” Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest Panel, held back in June, Morehead was quizzed about what “black swans” the world should expect next, considering that we had just recently experienced a pandemic, complete shutdown, and financial crisis due to the pandemic. Morehead responded and stated that we already had the “massive shoes drop last year,” most likely in reference to the events surrounding the collapse of prominent crypto firms like FTX, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Terra, and BlockFi. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Will Start Implementing ShibPaper, What does This Mean? However, while Morehead believed the worst had happened, he noted that the regulatory clarity was something that no one in the crypto community was expecting but could happen soon. He stated how that could happen and highlighted the three-year ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple Labs as one of the ways. Considering that “black swan” had been used earlier as a metaphor for disastrous events like the pandemic, Morehead quickly labeled a potential Ripple victory as a “positive black swan.” He emphasized that this could be the next ‘shoe to drop’ and could positively impact the crypto industry. Interestingly, when Morehead made these comments, he had no idea of the impending victory for Ripple, as he stated that a ruling could go in favor of either party. About a month later, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple and said that its secondary XRP sales didn’t constitute an investment contract, nor were programmatic XRP sales classified as a security. As predicted by Morehead, Ripple’s victory has undoubtedly had immense impacts on XRP and the crypto community in general. XRP price holds steady above $0.5 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Has Ripple’s Victory Provided Regulatory Clarity? Morehead had predicted that Ripple’s victory would be one of the ways in which the crypto industry attains regulatory clarity. While this may have not yet been attained, it is obvious that Judge Torres’ ruling has provided some form of guidance, especially to firms like Binance and Coinbase. The SEC sued both crypto exchanges in June for allegedly offering unregistered securities on their platforms. Additionally, the regulator also tagged tokens like SOL, ADA, MATIC, ATOM, and ALGO as securities. Related Reading: The $20 Billion Delay: Appeal Court Pushes Back Decision On Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF As such, Ripple’s case provides a precedent for these firms to cite when putting forward their arguments in court. The SEC recognizes the impact that Judge Torres’ ruling could have against it as it continues to clamp down on the crypto industry, and that is why it moved to file an interlocutory appeal against the ruling. However, some experts have predicted that the SEC will likely lose when the case is heard upon appeal.

Polygon zkEVM, which has built its reputation around the utilization of zero-knowledge proofs and EVM equivalence, has taken a strategic step by incorporating managed decentralized data feeds (dAPIs) from the API3 Market. The rise of such a managed data feed service highlights the sustained DeFi appetite, a sector where the Total Value Locked (TVL) reportedly spans tens of billions. The API3 Model API3's model contrasts with traditional third-party oracle mechanisms, focusing instead on a first-party architecture. The novel approach of sourcing data directly and (in a manner that is) cryptographicallyy-backed pushes the boundaries of data transparency in the space. API3's push oracle solution potentially offers remedies to such issues, advocating for a comprehensive, transparent, and possibly more efficient data sourcing model. The key differentiation (it appears) is with how API3 emphasizes first-party oracles, ensuring data is sourced directly, with increased traceability and data integrity. With DeFi's dynamic evolution, the integration and management of oracle services via a DAO become increasingly relevant. Platforms like QuickSwap Perps, Dovish, and MantisSwap have pivoted to embrace dAPIs, signifying a recognition of the potential security and operational advantages these decentralized data feeds might bring. Tropykus, which has roots in AAVE V2, rapidly embraced dAPIs for its framework and subsequently debuted on Polygon zkEVM. Such an integration showcases the flexibility and potential benefits of dAPIs for emerging platforms. Jack Melnick, Head of DeFi BD at Polygon Labs, provided insights on this alliance: ""It's very exciting to see API3 deploying on Polygon zkEVM, enhancing the DeFi ecosystem with an innovative push oracle solution. The integration of managed dAPIs with Polygon's scalable infrastructure marks a significant step towards a more transparent and secure future for decentralized finance."" API3's Market space also helps provide an avenue for developers to interact with dAPIs, a potential game-changer in how dApps leverage real-time market data. This collaboration might signal an industry shift, emphasizing more secure, transparent, and efficient data management methods. Some Comparisons In comparison to alternatives like Chainlink and Pyth, which have been noted for their relatively high fees and questions around transparency, API3’s dAPI stands out. It offers builders an opportunity to tap into decentralized data feeds from multiple sources, all facilitated by first-party oracle nodes integrated with native-chain aggregation. This not only positions API3 distinctly in the market but also sets a potential new standard for oracle transparency and efficiency. This new Managed dAPI service addresses several operational challenges developers face, such as the complexities of gas management, rourtine maintenance, and continuous monitoring. The service is not just a conceptual offering; it's already in operation. Developers on the Polygon zkEVM platform, who previously relied on self-funded data feeds, can now seamlessly integrate aggregated data streams directly from other eminent data providers.

NFTs are a special type of crypto asset that provide its holder ownership over a real or digital asset. The floor price in NFTs refers to the minimum price a seller wants for an item in a collection, serving as an indicator of a collection's popularity and perceived value.  However this metric can be manipulated and does not always accurately represent the true market value of an NFT, with other factors like rarity traits and market conditions causing variations in prices.  On-chain data shows that the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection’s floor price has declined by 27% while DeGods is down by 55%. Azuki, which sold out its ‘Elementals’ NFT mint in 15 minutes in June, ranking in $38 million in the process, saw its floor prices drop by 36%.  Meanwhile, the Nansen NFT-500 index is down 40% year-to-date, while its Blue Chip 10 index is down 33%.  While ether prices usually dictate the value of NFTs, values have dropped faster than the currency they are usually denominated in. Ether is down 9.6% on-month, and is up 1.9% during the last year, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  However, it isn’t all bad news in the NFT market. Some lesser-known collections have seen gains.

The SEC has alleged that John A. DeSalvo allegedly solicited ICO money and specifically targeted police officers and first responders. A Bizarre Scam The charges were announced on the 23rd of August by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the announcement, Desalvo was allegedly able to raise an amount of $623,388 from over 220 investors by selling an unregistered token called the Blazar token between November 2021 and May 2022. Blazar told his unsuspecting investors that Blazar would be replacing traditional state pension systems for police, paramedics, and firefighters and give them staggering returns. DeSalvo allegedly told investors, “Blazar Token is the first token or coin that is able to be purchased through payroll deduction every week. It will be taken out of one’s weekly earnings pretax similar to payment into a pension, 401k, IRA, or any other retirement savings plans.” The Securities and Exchange Commission also alleged that DeSalvo falsely claimed that the Blazar token was registered and approved by the SEC despite never being registered with the regulatory body. He also told investors that there was an initial lock-up period for insiders. He then sold 41 billion Blazar tokens, which were worth around $50,000 at the time, when the token debuted on the PancakeSwap decentralized exchange in May 2022. While investors were barred from selling their tokens, DeSalvo was busy selling his. Just weeks after debuting on PancakeSwap, the Blazar token lost 99.9% of its value. The SEC explained, “DeSalvo’s massive volume of sales placed downward pressure on the Blazar Token’s trading price and drained PancakeSwap of the majority of its liquidity in the investment, resulting in its collapse and substantial investor losses.” DeSalvo Abused Position Of Trust DeSalvo ended up misusing investor funds, sending all the money to crypto wallets owned by him. He also paid for work on a home. Regulatory authorities added that DeSalvo took advantage of his position as an officer, gaining investors’ trust and promoting his fraud investment. DeSalvo now faces civil charges for violating securities laws, while prosecutors have also filed criminal charges. The chief of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, David Hirsch, stated, “Our complaint alleges a brazen affinity fraud that preyed on retail investors’ trust and sense of community. Too often in crypto, we see promoters perpetrate familiar frauds in shiny new wrappers by making claims that are difficult for investors to independently verify. Registering the offer and sale of securities enables critical oversight and improves disclosures to investors.” Not The First Fraud By DeSalvo An official from the Securities and Exchange Commission called the DeSalvo case particularly offensive. This is because his scheme exploited first responders who trusted DeSalvo, thanks to his law enforcement background. DeSalvo had orchestrated another scheme in 2021, where he used social media to recruit investors for a stock and crypto trading venture. DeSalvo was able to trick 17 investors during the scheme, managing to raise $95,000. DeSalvo then put the funds in a brokerage account but ended up losing $17,000, making several risky trades. He then misappropriated the remaining funds and, to cover his tracks told investors that their assets had become worthless due to prevailing market conditions. SEC’s Recent Activities The Securities and Exchange Commission, on its part, reiterated that it would continue to pursue crypto scams and those that fail to register securities. Just this week, the SEC charged Titan Global Management with securities violations. The market regulator alleged that the firm misled investors by misrepresenting performance metrics and slapped a $850,000 fine. It has also taken action against Crowe UK LLP, a London-based, pro-crypto audit firm, over its audit of music streaming service Akazoo. Nigel Bostock, CEO of the firm, along with senior auditor Matthew Stallabrassm, were also implicated for their role in the audit. However, it isn’t all doom and gloom, as it emerged earlier this month that the SEC was set to greenlight the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on ETH futures, marking a big win for crypto.

Using the testnet, developers will be able to deploy RollApps easily using Dymension’s command line tool Roller. The startup said the deployment of its testnet was made possible by a collaboration with the data-focused networks Avail and Celestia, and enables builders to create their first RollApps using customizable virtual machines including the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Dymension is all about bringing scalability to the Web3 world through the use of application-specific rollups, which are based on the same scaling technology that’s used by so-called Layer-2 networks like Polygon, Avalanche, Fuel and Boba Network. What’s different about Dymension’s RollApps is that they’re the only one of their kind that provide full compatibility with IBC and the Cosmos ecosystem out of the box. They’re also data-agnostic thanks to their ability to connect to any data availability network. Although Dymension is competing in a very competitive niche, the potential of its technology is widely regarded. Earlier this year, the startup was able to raise $6.7 million in a funding round led by Big Brain Holdings and Stratos, with participation from DraftKings’ Shalom Meckenzie and DAO matchbox. Dymension has ambitions to accelerate Web3’s growth by helping developers to shift away from Ethereum and its scaling constraints. Dymension’s incentivized testnet follows the successful implementation of its devnet in June, where more than 500 RollApps were deployed by early adopters. Each of those RollApps is connected to the Dymension Hub to provide a secure and reliable bridge to the IBC ecosystem. With RollApps, the task of achieving consensus is delegated to Dymension Hub, paving the way for highly secure and super-fast blockchains with a sub 0.2 seconds transaction finality. The Dymension Hub handles all aspects of interoperability, vastly simplifying the process of interacting with RollApps to enable more cost-effective and scalable dApps. Its biggest impact comes in terms of reducing the infrastructure costs associated with the deployment of dApps, Dymension said. Following the success of the devnet, Dymension says it’s confident that it can attract even more interest in its RollApps from the wider Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems due to its unique status as the only rollup provider that offers IBC as a bridge. When the testnet launches, users will be able to interact with RollApps through the Dymension Portal, which is its primary web interface. From the portal, users can view various ecosystem statistics and bridge over IBC using the MetaMask wallet. Dymension said all RollApps deployed on the testnet will publish their data to Avail and Celestia, with Cosmos and Ethereum to be added in a future update. In addition, Dymension supports a choice of VMs, including EVM, CosmWasm and others. This overcomes another key limitation for developers, who have traditionally always had no choice but to use the standard VM of the ecosystem they’re building in.

According to dYdX, these guidelines have been issued to ensure maximum user protection. Good Practices For dYdX Chain Validators dYdX stated that it was releasing the list of good practices for prospective validators of the dYdX chain. The list has been released to further the foundation’s mission to foster, support, and promote the dYdX ecosystem by enabling communities, developers, and decentralized governance. According to the post, the list would help token holders make informed decisions regarding the selection of validators to stake to. It would also increase the likelihood of dYdX Chain L1 token holders to stake to them. The blog post organizes the list of good practices into six distinct categories. These are MEV, Performance, Operations and Security, Transparency, Governance participation, and dYdX ecosystem considerations. The post states that validators must maintain high uptime and ensure that their node is online at most times. They should also keep mempools across the network more consistent and ensure a better experience for traders. It also stated that chain validators must minimize the slashing risk by monitoring the performance of their nodes. The team added in the post, “It’s inadvisable to use “sentries” given increased latency, but instead opt for a threshold signer.” Other good security practices highlighted in the post include the proper storage of keys, which should be backed up in a separate, secure location. Validators must also implement a system to issue alerts for critical issues and participate in dYdX chain testnets and operating nodes through a legal organization. It also laid emphasis on transparency, urging chain validators and stakers to engage with the dYdX community and keep them informed regarding current developments. “Validators may choose to be transparent about their operations and provide regular updates to their delegations. This includes publishing information about geographic location, redundancy, physical security, node performance, uptime, and rewards distribution, among other things, and full disclosure of the total number of validators operated and the total stake controlled by them.” Strong Stand Against MEV The post has taken a particularly strong stand against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), stating that validators must not engage in any activity that is related to MEV. According to the post, those engaging in MEV-related activities would be subject to punishment, and delegates would also face repercussions should they support any validator indulging in MEV practices. “We expect that the dYdX community will take steps to disincentivize and punish bad actors who engage in MEV activities. As such, a delegator should consider that they may be impacted if they are delegating to a validator engaging in MEV.” The team further noted, “Aligning on potential good practices for validators could be important in guiding responsible participation and decision-making within the dYdX Chain ecosystem.” Maximal Extractable Value or MEV refers to the practice of using arbitrage techniques to extract profit by reordering transactions that ordinary Web3 users execute. According to Flashbots, Ethereum users have lost a staggering $450 million to MEV since the Merge and over $600 million in the two years prior to it. The dYdX Chain The notice from the dYdX foundation comes as dYdX prepares to move from the Ethereum network to a Cosmos-based dedicated appchain. The second public testnet for the dYdX chain was launched on the 10th of August and introduced over 30 markets to the platform. dYdX is a leader in the perpetual DEX markets, with the protocol hosting over $400 million worth of trades on the 21st of August, according to Token Terminal.

16472031,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548630,1692862255,Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today?,"The Bitcoin price experienced a resurgence yesterday, reaching a high of $26,843, a 3.7% increase after its recent crash from $29,000. The reasons behind this uptick are manifold. Why Is Bitcoin Up? According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, significant Bitcoin holders, often referred to as whales and sharks, have been actively adding to their holdings. As of now, there are 156,660 wallets holding between 10 to 10,000 BTC, with a collective accumulation of $308.6M since August 17th. Whale and shark wallets have added 11,629 BTC in the past six days. Michaël van de Poppe, a well-regarded crypto analyst, drew attention to the strength shown by Silver & Gold, especially after the disappointing PMI rates yesterday. He believes that as yields appear to be topping out, Bitcoin might follow the trajectory of these commodities. Related Reading: The Jackson Hole Effect? Powell’s Speech Sparks Bitcoin Fears Amid Similar 2022 Price Action Recent economic indicators from the US private sector provide further context. The S&P Global Composite PMI for early August showed a decline, falling to 50.4 from 52 in July. Both the Manufacturing and Services PMI indices also registered drops from 49 to 47 and 52.4 to 51 respectively. Moreover, the Bitcoin futures market certainly played a certain role in yesterday’s Bitcoin price movement. Yesterday, $28.06 million in short positions were liquidated on this market. After all, this is the third largest amount in August so far, surpassed only by August 17 ($120 million) and August 8 ($37 million). Market intelligence platform Decentrader highlighted the prevailing market sentiment, noting that despite Bitcoin’s price rise, there’s still a sense of uncertainty and fear. This sentiment is further underscored by the continuing negative dip in average funding rates. While this means that sentiment is still bad, it opens up the possibility for more short squeezes if traders are raging into shorts. The Dollar-Index (DXY) and its inverse relationship with Bitcoin also played a part. DXY was rejected just below 104 yesterday and dropped back to 103.5. The SPX showed a nice relief bounce with USD coming off 103.96. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Indicator Is On The Verge Of A Bullish Breakout CryptoCon’s volume analysis offers a broader perspective on Bitcoin’s price movement. Since November 2020, the volume of Bitcoin transacted reveals why the price halted at its current position. The volume past $28,900 acts as a significant barrier. However, the current range of 24,000 to 29,000 for Bitcoin is relatively uncharted, suggesting that Bitcoin is searching for new support and preparing for a potential move to the next resistance zone. What’s Next For BTC? The upcoming Jackson Hole Economic Symposium tomorrow, Friday, where the Federal Reserve will discuss its future strategies, is a pivotal event on the horizon. Keith Alan of Material Indicators recalled the impact of last year’s symposium on Bitcoin, emphasizing, “Remember when FED Chair Powell spoke from Jackson Hole last year and his hawkish tone triggered a 29% BTC dump?” While there are parallels in Bitcoin’s price action leading up to this year’s event, it’s crucial to note that market reactions can be unpredictable and hinge on various factors. With the Bitcoin market poised for the events of tomorrow, the prevailing mood is one of anticipation mixed with caution. At press time, BTC traded $26,464.

Pendle was released last November on Ethereum and has expanded to Arbitrum, BNB Chain and Optimism networks this year.  Developers told CoinDesk that Pendle will use MakerDAO’s Boosted Dai Savings (sDAI) and Flux Finance’s fUSDC stablecoin - both of which generate yields from traditional finance sectors - for the RWA product.  RWA tokenization revolves around establishing a virtual investment mechanism that is linked to tangible assets such as real estate, precious metals, artworks, and collectibles. RWA has been a growing sector in crypto For DeFi, this would mean on-chain access to traditional finance instruments such as the U.S. Treasury Bonds, and the chance to deploy these tokenized assets for use in decentralized application (dapps).  “Fixed Yield and RWA have some of the largest addressable markets that remain untapped in DeFi,” TN Lee, the co-founder and CEO of Pendle, shared in a message to CoinDesk. “I firmly believe these will play a key role in attracting huge, offchain institutional investors onchain.”  “Yes, RWA is already in DeFi, and now Pendle is able to offer a suite of tools that lets you properly hedge or manage these yields. Interest rate derivatives, swaps, fixed income…all these products that TradFi institutions love, they’re already here,” Lee added.

It’s looking to Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy empire to maximize value from the sales.  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX wants to start selling, staking and hedging its sizable crypto holdings – and is seeking to hire Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy as an advisor to help, according to court filings made late Wednesday evening.  FTX, which collapsed in November last year, wants to return funds to creditors in fiat currency rather than bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) – but hopes careful trading can avoid denting the value of over $3 billion in crypto holdings.  “Hedging bitcoin and ether will allow the Debtors [FTX] to limit potential downside risk prior to the sale of such bitcoin or ether,” the filing by FTX lawyers said. “Staking certain digital assets… will inure to the benefit of the estates — and, ultimately, creditors — by generating low risk returns on their otherwise idle digital assets.  FTX is hoping interest on its crypto pile will add to the stock it can distribute to customers who are still waiting for their money back. The company, now run by restructuring expert John J. Ray III, worries that selling all in one go would cause the price to plummet, to the benefit of short sellers and other market participants. It’s turning to market experts to figure out how best to avoid that, for example via weekly sales limits.  “Galaxy Asset Management has extensive experience in areas relevant to digital asset management and trading, including with respect to the types of transactions and investment objectives contemplated,” the document said, referring to the Security and Exchange Commission-approved investment advisor that forms part of Mike Novogratz’s crypto conglomerate.  Galaxy Digital (GLXY), another part of that empire, has previously declared it had tens of millions tied up in FTX at the time of its bankruptcy, and new filings detail the conflict-of-interest procedures that will ensure the asset managers act in FTX’s best interests.  In an April filing, FTX company said it had $3.4 billion worth of major, liquid crypto assets. In July, it said it expected to monetize crypto into cash before returning to customers, though international customers may be able to access a rebooted exchange. Other bankrupt crypto firms such as lender Celsius have opted to make distributions in liquid cryptocurrencies including BTC and ETH.  The requests must be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court, which earlier on Wednesday heard that legal fees were costing the company $1.5 million per day as it seeks to wind up. On Tuesday, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to a rejigged series of fraud charges relating to his management of the company.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/24/ftx-taps-galaxy-to-sell-stake-and-hedge-its-crypto-billions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5dbcd110ab89eb817f921e20c2a35308ef4a5cf6-2558x1439.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419734,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFXED,1692858006,"Bitcoin, Ether Trade Below 'Maximum Pain' Levels Ahead of $2.7B Options Settlement","While bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have chalked out moderate gains in the past 24 hours, prices remain well below levels that are likely to inflict ""maximum pain"" on buyers of August expiry option contracts.  On Friday, Deribit, the world's leading crypto options exchange by open interest and volume, will settle 72,000 BTC August options contracts worth $1.9 billion and 535,000 ETH options contracts valued at $893 million.  The max pain levels for BTC and ETH settlements are currently at $28,000 and $1,800.  The popular theory is that writers or sellers of call options and put options often look to push the underlying asset's spot price toward the max pain level to make their counterparties, the options buyers, suffer the most. They do so by buying/selling the cryptocurrency in the spot/futures markets.  So, assuming other factors remain constant, BTC and ETH could trade close to the respective max pain points in the next 24 hours. The max pain points will become invalid following the expiry. Deribit settles options on Friday at 08:00 UTC. On Deribit, one options contract represents 1 BTC and 1 ETH. The exchange controls nearly 90% of the global crypto options activity.  ""Buyers of BTC and ETH put options are clear winners heading into the expiry,"" Deribit's Asia business development personnel Lin Chen told CoinDesk. ""A lot of put options are in-the-money.""  An in-the-money put is the one with a strike price higher than the going market rate of the underlying asset. It means the ITM put holder can sell the underlying asset at a price greater than the current market rate.  A put option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on a later date. A call gives the right to buy.  Most ether call options are set to expire out-of-the-money, thanks to last week's 8.3% slide. Bitcoin's open interest distribution paints a similar picture, as the feature image shows. The leading cryptocurrency by market value tanked over 10% last week, its biggest slide since the collapse of FTX in November.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/24/bitcoin-ether-trade-below-maximum-pain-levels-ahead-of-27b-options-settlement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ada67267b187fb97e676059ff1bbe478c3cdbce8-1280x640.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16463280,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548614,1692846055,Betrayal In Blue: Former NJ Officer Charged With Crypto Fraud,"In a major development, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged former New Jersey State Correctional Police Officer, John A. DeSalvo, for allegedly orchestrating a fraudulent crypto fraud scheme that specifically targeted law enforcement personnel. DeSalvo stands accused of raising funds through the unregistered offering of the Blazar Token, a crypto asset he created, which eventually collapsed in May 2022. The SEC’s complaint further alleges misappropriation of investor funds, including diverting substantial amounts to his crypto asset wallets and using them for personal expenses, such as a bathroom renovation. Crypto Scam Targeting Cops? According to the SEC, DeSalvo managed to raise a minimum of $620,000 from around 220 investors between the launch of the Blazar Token in November 2021 and its subsequent collapse. The complaint reveals that DeSalvo made “false claims” to investors, stating that the Blazar Token was registered with the SEC and that it would replace existing state pension systems. He further “deceived” investors by falsely assuring them that automatic payroll deductions would facilitate their investment and guarantee extraordinary returns. Related Reading: Solana In Turbulence: Analyzing The Death Cross And What Lies Ahead Ultimately, DeSalvo allegedly misused and misappropriated the funds entrusted to him. Notably, the SEC’s complaint highlights DeSalvo’s deliberate targeting of fellow law enforcement and first responders in his fraudulent schemes. In addition to the Blazar Token scheme, the SEC’s complaint also exposes an earlier fraud initiated by DeSalvo. Beginning in late January 2021, he allegedly solicited investors, primarily through social media, for an investment venture that involved trading stocks, options, and crypto asset securities. Within weeks of raising $95,000 from 17 investors, DeSalvo reportedly lost a significant portion of the funds through speculative investments and misappropriated the rest. He proceeded to inform investors that poor market conditions led to the complete devaluation of the securities. SEC Accuses Former Officer Of Exploiting Trust Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, condemned DeSalvo’s actions, stating: We allege that DeSalvo orchestrated several fraudulent investment schemes that targeted law enforcement personnel and promised astronomical returns, including one involving a crypto asset security that would somehow replace traditional state pension systems. Rather than producing any returns or revolutionary technology, he instead misappropriated and misused investor money. Grewal further emphasized the breach of trust perpetrated by DeSalvo, who “exploited” his former position as a corrections officer to gain the confidence of fellow law enforcement professionals, many of whom invested their “hard-earned” savings with him. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Shoots Up, Pain Not Over Yet? The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, charges DeSalvo with violating antifraud and offering registration provisions of the securities laws. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposition of civil penalties. Simultaneously, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey has announced criminal charges against DeSalvo, further underscoring the severity of the allegations and the commitment to holding him accountable for his actions.

Powell’s Speech Sparks Bitcoin Fears Amid Similar 2022 Price Action,"As Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair, prepares to return to Jackson Hole this Friday, the Bitcoin (BTC) market is experiencing a sense of anticipation due to the similarities in the current price action compared to the period leading up to last year’s speech. Key moving averages have been tested and lost over the past two weeks, followed by a period of consolidation, reminiscent of previous events. However, it is important to note that these similarities do not guarantee a repeat of the past, as market conditions and Powell’s stance have since evolved. Related Reading: Rarible To Stop Aggregating Orders From These Three NFT Marketplaces – Here’s Why Déjà Vu In The Bitcoin Market? According to Keith Alan, co-founder of analysis and crypto research firm Material Indicator, last year, in the two weeks preceding Powell’s speech, BTC’s price broke through crucial technical support levels represented by the 21-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-week Moving Averages (MA). Subsequently, a period of consolidation ensued, followed by a significant price drop in response to Powell’s hawkish tone during the speech. Alan stated: Remember when Fed Chair Powell spoke from Jackson Hole last year and his hawkish tone triggered a 29% BTC dump that took 5 months to recover? Notably, the recent price action in the Bitcoin market has displayed similarities to last year’s pattern. Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin has tested and lost these same key moving averages, and it is currently undergoing a phase of consolidation, mirroring the events leading up to Powell’s previous address. Keith Alan emphasizes that since last year’s Jackson Hole event, there have been notable changes. Core inflation has decreased, and Powell’s approach to communication has become more “measured”. It is uncertain whether Powell will adopt a hawkish or dovish stance in his upcoming speech, making it challenging to predict the market’s reaction with certainty. What is evident, however, is that the market is primed for a significant move. Additionally, Alan suggests that the formation of a lower low in price increases the likelihood of an extension of the existing downtrend. Market participants should be prepared for the possibility of further testing of support levels. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Solana Could Mirror Cardano Price Action – A Buy Or Sell Alarm? As the Bitcoin market awaits Powell’s speech, market sentiment remains dynamic. Traders and investors are anticipating potential market-moving cues from the event. As the date of Jerome Powell’s return to Jackson Hole approaches, Bitcoin has displayed a notable recovery of 2.1% within the past 24 hours, marking a positive upward movement that brings it closer to the $27,000 threshold. However, it is crucial to note that if the outcome of Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday proves favorable for crypto investors and propels Bitcoin’s price to higher levels, the cryptocurrency may encounter a significant obstacle in the form of its 200-day moving average positioned at $27,200.

And in his latest update, lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has revealed plans to start implementing the “ShibPaper.” What Is The ShibPaper? According to the blog post released on August 22, Kusama announced that the implementation of the ShibPaper will begin on August 23 in hopes that Shibarium can accomplish a huge part of its vision of becoming a “decentralized digital nation state” this year. Related Reading: The $20 Billion Delay: Appeal Court Pushes Back Decision On Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Shibarium had, before launch, been touted to become a major player in the DeFi space upon launch. However, users questioned its decentralized nature following the botched launch, with users’ funds reportedly getting stuck on the Shibarium bridge. This isn’t the first time the ShibPaper has been mentioned as Shiba Inu’s developer Kaal Dhairya highlighted the document in a tweet on August 18, labeling it as the “foundation” for Shibarium’s decentralized digital nation. The ShibPaper, written by Shytoshi Kusama and described by him as “the most comprehensive decentralization document the world has ever seen,” is simply a whitepaper outlining the ecosystem’s plans to create a “Shiba Inu State” which will act as a “beacon” guiding the world towards decentralization. According to the document, the Canine Code and Hound’s Constitution will guide the Shiba Inu State.
