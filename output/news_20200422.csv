42431795,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Tjh,1587594870,Openfinance Warns It Will Delist All Security Tokens Without New Funds,"Security token trading platform Openfinance is threatening to delist all tokens and suspend trading next month unless issuers cough up more funds to cover its costs.      The company has not seen transaction activity on its platform grow quickly enough to cover operating costs, according to an email sent to the alternative trading system’s (ATS) users and shared with CoinDesk on Wednesday.      The email is asking issuers with tokens listed on the site to cover these costs with new contracts. If it doesn’t receive new fees, it will delist all existing tokens on May 21 and suspend trading.      Non-tokenized securities will continue trading, the email said, although it’s not clear how many traditional instruments Openfinance actually lists.      “We have asked the issuers currently listed on the platform to renew their listing agreements and cover a portion of our costs, including through annual listing fees, as are common in large, public markets, where issuers pay exchanges for listing services,” the email said.      A company representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      Openfinance launched its ATS in August 2018, allowing accredited investors in the U.S. and investors outside the country to trade and purchase security tokens.      Tokens listed on Openfinance include or at some point included Blockchain Capital’s BCAP token, SPiCE, Current Media’s CRNC token, Lottery.com’s LDCC token and Protos’ PRTS. Openfinance is also supposed to list NBA guard Spencer Dinwiddie’s personal token when it launches.      Openfinance has raised over three rounds from Sharpe Ventures, M25 and Huobi, according to Crunchbase. Its last round saw the company raise $8.6 million.      Kyle Sonlin, CEO of Security Token Market, told CoinDesk that Openfinance closing its security token platform would be “a loss for the industry,” particularly in the U.S.      “It's worth noting, however, that these security tokens can simply be self-custodied and eventually moved to another platform, which is a testament to the functionality and efficiency of security token technology,” he said.      The securities themselves would not experience any disruption in ownership, the email from Openfinance said. The issuers and their transfer agents will still maintain ownership records. Users can also maintain the tokenized records in their own digital wallets.      The email notes that users could transfer security tokens directly to buyers and sellers. User funds will be maintained at Evolve Bank, an FDIC-insured institution in West Memphis, Arkansas.      “We remain hopeful that existing listing agreements will be renewed and any delistings can be avoided,” the email said. “If that is not possible, we will work with our issuer partners to minimize any disruptions and Openfinance will move forward, continuing to enhance its efforts to improve secondary market trading of digital (non-tokenized) securities on our ATS.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Nikhilesh De, William Foxley",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/22/openfinance-warns-it-will-delist-all-security-tokens-without-new-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a66c4c08ad6480ac3b0ca8b183d9dd43cfe22dc7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431804,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6U1h,1587588619,"Market Wrap: Oil Rebounds As Crypto Makes Gains, Especially Ether","The oil markets rebounded somewhat from the stunning, historic lows that started the week. Prices for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) have remained generally above $10 Wednesday, with trading up 9 percent as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. EDT).      European markets saw gains, with the FTSE Eurotop 100 index closing in the green 1.9 percent, driven by oil-related stocks.      The S&P 500 index also ended the day on the plus side, up 2.2 percent. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury bonds sold off slightly as traders were willing to take on a little bit more risk in the equities market. Yields on the two-year, the 10-year and the 30-year Treasury bonds all rose (bond yields rise as prices fall). The yield on the 10-year climbed highest, to 6 percent at 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.      Despite Wednesday’s uptick, crude is not out of the woods. “Although OPEC production cuts are expected to kick off in May, weak demand and high global inventory mean that oil prices remain under pressure,” said Nemo Qin, senior analyst for multi-asset brokerage eToro.    Crypto markets    The price of bitcoin climbed 3.4 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.      After starting at midnight UTC around $6,800, bitcoin saw some buying on spot exchanges like Coinbase. That pushed its prices above $7,000, breaking higher than its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for those who follow technical analysis.      It’s just about more buyers but perhaps fewer sellers in the cryptocurrency ahead of the expected May halving event.      “With the bitcoin halving fast approaching, where miners will see the amount of bitcoin mined from each node reduced by 50 percent, it could be that investors are choosing not to sell their holdings as we might expect,” said Simon Peters, another analyst at eToro. “Instead, they are staying in bitcoin so as not to miss out on the anticipated gains in the months following the halving.”      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Digital assets are up on CoinDesk’s big board for the day. Ether (ETH) climbed 6 percent. The biggest winners today include dash (DASH) up 7.6 percent, stellar (XLM) gaining 6.9 percent and cardano (ADA) in the green 5 percent. All price changes are as of 20:45 UTC (4:45 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.    Ether beats bitcoin    Despite security concerns in the Ethereum-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, the price of ether continues to perform well, trouncing bitcoin since the beginning of the year, according to data from aggregator Coin Metrics. Year to date, bitcoin is flat while ether has seen 30 percent gains.      While ether’s prices have done remarkably well, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has been hit with smart contract security problems. That includes the bZx “flash loans” hack in February, when a hacker was able to drain $350,000 from the Fulcrum lending platform. In addition, more recently, the dForce protocol saw $25 million in crypto drained from the Lendf.me lending platform which was 99 percent of its total balance, although that attacker soon returned most of the funds.      It’s hard to place blame on protocols, says Neeraj Khandelwal, Co-founder of India-based exchange CoinDCX. “The latest news on DeFi’s security flaws have to do with the construction of the architecture on top of Ethereum, and not to do with the Ethereum protocol itself. As such, I do not expect the flaws of a limited number of DeFi projects to affect the price of ETH.""      “The so-called security flaws are merely structural decisions that DeFi companies are making and not indicative of Ethereum itself,” according to Alexander Blum, Co-founder of Two Prime, a crypto asset management firm.      Companies, not protocols, are causing problems with DeFi, and Blum made a comparison to the critical web protocol HTTP - it has been hacked as well, usually due to bad security practices by organizations that cause issues. “Just like how we wouldn't dismiss the entire HTTP protocol due to the hacking of a single website, it will be misplaced to deem Ethereum unsafe and insecure simply based on the flaws of DeFi companies.”      Ethereum as a cryptocurrency computing platform isn’t the only one suffering from hacks. The Factom protocol, a smaller rival to Ethereum, this week fell victim to a $11 million hack of stablecoin platform PegNet. Insiders have said the Factom PegNet hack looks similar to the Ethereum-based dForce attack, a sign hackers can be protocol agnostic with their tactics.      See also: Ethereum Now Matches Bitcoin on One Key Metric      DeFi’s travails most likely doesn’t have an affect on ether’s price performance. Liquidity on exchanges, and not protocol fundamentals, could be ether’s key feature for traders.      “Ether and bitcoin have many similar attributes: easily accessible and tradable on global exchanges everywhere, used heavily for trading pairs, very little friction with cross-border trading, deemed not equities by the SEC,” said Coin DCX's Khandelwal. ""Their values — and in turn, their prices — aren’t necessarily tied to their technical attributes.”    Other markets    Gold also bounced higher Wednesday, with buying volume of the yellow metal keeping its price above $1,700.      “Gold prices are expected to be pushed higher due to investors flocking toward safe-haven assets,” said Nemo Qin, Senior Analyst eToro. “We can expect to see gold and gold-backed investments to continue to grow in 2020.”      In Asia the Nikkei 225 dropped, although only less than a percent, in daily trading as Tokyo’s transportation and real estate sectors were hit with big losses on Wednesday.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | COMMODITY | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/22/market-wrap-oil-rebounds-as-crypto-makes-gains-especially-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6db6273335217b159df7ecc7a04056058ec185db-2600x1564.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431790,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Tbh,1587579614,Italy's Leading Wire Service Is Using Ethereum to Thwart Copycats,"Stefano de Alessandri, chief of Italy’s Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA) newswire, had a problem in early April: Fraudsters were publishing fake COVID-19 articles that masqueraded as his.      These articles looked like ANSA’s. Riding on the branding of Italy’s largest wire service, they wove tales, mostly phony ones, of the Italian government’s coronavirus response. It was a threat to public information. Worse, it was an assault on ANSA’s perception of credibility.      “We had people calling us to say, ‘Why have you published this? Is this true? Are you sure?,’” de Alessandri said of the last three weeks. If readers fell for these stories he worried they might lose faith in the ANSA brand.      ANSA had its answer ready for launch: A blockchain registration system called “ANSAcheck” that stamps legitimate articles with traceable, irrefutable proof an article is among the 3,000 ANSA distributes to its 24 shareholder publishers and 87 news partners every day.      ANSAcheck, which uses the Ethereum blockchain to store this data, debuted on April 9 to combat fake coronavirus news.    Why a blockchain?    Though ANSA deployed ANSAcheck during the zenith of medical misinformation, it had begun designing the system a year before in partnership with Ernst & Young (EY). The hope was that a distributed ledger could be used to rebut the wider scourge of fake and copycat news stories.      ANSAcheck registers vital details including an article's title, timestamp, content hash, ID and publication event on the Ethereum blockchain. It makes this information available through a little green graphic emblazoned at the bottom of nearly every newly published piece on the site.      Readers see this “story of the story” by clicking that ANSAcheck logo, and the true details by clicking through to the certificate, where the transaction’s Block Height, Transaction Hash, Block ID are stored. Most ANSA readers might not understand this jumbled mush of foreign tech concepts, but to those familiar with ethereum, these are the keys that prove the article’s legitimacy.      ANSAcheck attempts to lend credibility to an article's origin. Take a recent piece on a regional Italian governor who walked back his pandemic-era ban on home pizza deliveries. The published article’s green logo is the visual proof it was published on ANSA. A reader can click through to the landing page and accompanying certificate for more granular smart contract details. And the final link to the public register shows everything was recorded at a gas price of $.18.      ANSAcheck ports this information across the entire lifecycle of an article, updating its corresponding smart contract to show edits and secondary runs in a transparent and verifiable medium. Ultimately, it will allow ANSA's third party publications do the same.      “This is the first step to create a link between ANSA and a publisher in the same environment but the idea is to export the same properties applied on the ANSA website to the other publisher,” EY developer Giuseppe Perrone said during an April 22 webinar hosted by his firm.    Social media spread    ANSAcheck combats a fake news epidemic that preceded COVID-19 and is likely to persist long after the virus has faded away.      Fraudsters will likely keep copying trusted news agencies as long as social media sites keep circulating these copycats with abandon. Fake stories’ bombastic bent overwhelms natural skepticism, according to Paul Brody, EY's global blockchain lead. This creates a spread-ready article even more potent when delivered in the wrapper of a trusted brand.      “There’s two things that have to happen in order to spread false information,” Brody told CoinDesk. “Number one, you have to create fake information. Number two, you have to convince people to pass it on.”      So far, social media networks, whose business models largely center on keeping users continuously engaged, have been ineffective at stopping this spread. Forget about banning fake news content, which could face difficult legal hurdles. The sites only haltingly flag suspicious content and, as Brody puts it, are by design vulnerable to their users’ tendency to share.      Newswires such as ANSA, which distributes its 3,700 daily articles to reams of affiliate sites, are vulnerable, too. A site could claim its story is an ANSA story and the reader would have no easy way of spotting the lie.      “If we can start to engineer things in such a way that it's easier to tell the truth than it is to send out something fake, that could be transformational,” Brody said.      Brody said ANSAcheck could be the foundation of that transformation.    Trust but verify    ANSAcheck’s blockchain does not and cannot verify the information enclosed in an article is the truth. As de Alessandri stressed to CoinDesk, it only documents an article originated from a certain site and was published at a certain time.      “We are not saying through this solution we aren’t publishing fake news, but we are saying to our readers that this story comes from ANSA,” de Alessandri said during the EY webinar.      That could still be enough to disrupt the chain of fake news stories that mine their credibility from the reputation of newswires like ANSA, according to Brody. In marking articles with a verifiable provenance, ANSAcheck creates a built-in means to check the source.      “We could make sure that each engine returned legitimate news at the top of the list,” said Brody. “Imagine if you had reputable news organizations that all had authenticity tools. We would be able to surface that data at the top of the list, and if somebody goes to search, it doesn’t matter what bubble they live in if what they see initially is from news organizations that are reputable and truthful.”      At the moment this more sweeping vision of a blockchain-based news is more goal than reality. The ANSAcheck pilot, not yet a month old, is limited to “80 or 90 percent” of ANSA’s articles, and its recognizable green stamp only appears on content native to their site. It’s not yet capable of spreading through the network.      De Alessandri is not as worried about the social media implications of ANSAcheck. During the EY webinar he said that protecting legacy media’s reputation is more immediately important in the system.      “It’s not the final solution, I think, but it's a little step,” de Alessandri said during the webinar. “Any tools that we can apply to defend, to enlarge professional information is a benefit for everybody, not only for the people working in the media business but for democracy and for the people.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/22/italys-leading-wire-service-is-using-ethereum-to-thwart-copycats,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0221d695292f3351ccb2eeade5c420195dd1c1e-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Berkley’s chief innovation and entrepreneurship officer, and Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, assistant professor of finance at the Warwick Business School, found stablecoins serve as tools for investors to react to market movements and not as drivers of price inflation or collapse. Their analysis of trading data shows flows are consistent with investors using stablecoins as a store of value during periods of risk or price depreciation.       Lyons and Viswanath-Natraj also found “strong evidence” of another catalyst for flows from issuer treasuries to secondary markets: arbitrage trading when stablecoins deviate from their pegs.       Whether stablecoin issuances materially affect the price of cryptocurrencies is no small controversy.      In July 2018, research published by John Griffins of the University of Texas at Austin and Amin Shams of the Ohio State University concluded stablecoin issuances “are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in bitcoin prices.” The research further claimed that stablecoin flows and subsequent price inflation during 2017 were attributable to a single entity.      Four months after the Griffins and Shams study was released, the U.S. Department of Justice opened an investigation into whether Tether and Bitfinex have used stablecoin issuances to inflate the price of bitcoin.      A related class-action lawsuit was filed against dominant stablecoin issuer Tether and its sister company, Bitfinex, in late 2019. The claimants alleged Bitfinex and Tether ""monopolized and conspired to monopolize the bitcoin market,"" as well as manipulated the market via stablecoin issuance among other things. A pseudonymous online firebrand known as Bitfinex'd made similar claims about the companies in a series of detailed blog posts several years ago.      Directly contradicting Griffin and Shams, Lyons and Viswanath-Natraj summarize their conclusions by saying:    “We find no systematic evidence that stablecoin issuance affects cryptocurrency prices. Rather, our evidence supports alternative views; namely, that stablecoin issuance endogenously responds to deviations of the secondary market rate from the pegged rate, and stablecoins consistently perform a safe-haven role in the digital economy.”    The industry’s aggregate stablecoin supply has passed $9 billion at the time of writing, according to data from CoinMetrics. At bitcoin’s all-time high in Q4 2017, aggregate stablecoin supply was just over $1.25 billion.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/22/stablecoins-arent-inflating-crypto-market-study-concludes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/696c47f435e8a8722a9f2a4390bdc9330a0ab00d-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431774,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6PVh,1587563177,Tim Draper Firm Launches 'Crypto Exchange' Anyone Can Plug Into WordPress,"Tim Draper's venture studio has released a WordPress plugin it claims will democratize crypto trading.      Santa Monica, Calif.-based Draper Goren Holm said its new ""Cryptocurrency Exchange"" plugin, released Wednesday, would allow anyone to add trading features to websites ""in minutes"" or even create their own branded cryptocurrency exchange.      In a press release, the venture studio said the plugin was open for any website owner, whether bloggers, content creators, media companies or entrepreneurs. Tim Draper, who became a partner of Goren Holm in 2019, said the plugin would ""make us one step closer to the dream of a truly borderless world.""      Alon Goren – a founding partner of the firm and author of the plugin – said 35 percent of the internet was built using WordPress. Launching the product on the massively popular platform means anyone can now have their own cryptocurrency exchange, he said.      While the plugin is designed to be to some extent customizable, it is not an exchange per se. Using the API from crypto swaps platform Totle, the plugin routes orders to decentralized trading platforms said to be listing the best prices. It also doesn't have any built-in facility to store digital assets but is compatible with existing wallet plugins, like MetaMask, Brave and Coinbase Wallet.      See also: VC Tim Draper Eyes India Investments as Nation Enters Crypto ‘Renaissance’      While that may mean the exchange might not be vulnerable to a classic exchange hack, Draper Goren Holm's press release was light on the security features of the plugin.      WordPress – which allowed users to pay in bitcoin until 2015 – may be ubiquitous but users don't always maintain the best security practices. Security specialist WP White Security said more than 70 percent of all WordPress sites in 2013 were vulnerable to attacks due to poor password policies or outdated firewall protection.      CoinDesk reached out to Draper Goren Holm for more details, but hadn't received a response by press time.      See also: New WordPress Publishing Platform Will Offer Blockchain Features      Totle's API is described as providing developers a way to ""integrate aggregated exchange functionality into a product"" for ether and ""popular"" ERC-20 tokens like DAI and BAT. It can execute crypto swaps, send payments, fetch price data on asset pairs and query exchanges.      “Totle has always been focused on making decentralized exchanges more accessible and easy to use,” said David Bleznak, founder and CEO of Totle. “The WordPress plugin is another step towards empowering global free markets.""",POSITIVE,BAT,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/22/tim-draper-firm-launches-crypto-exchange-anyone-can-plug-into-wordpress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4376cc8bbf887f8a633e796c8f2f177f348b46f3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431766,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6PDh,1587558600,Crypto's Zoom Moment Is Coming,"Michael Terpin is the founder and CEO of Transform Group, a diversified blockchain services group based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he is currently sheltered in place.      What more could a burgeoning technology ask for to thrive? Massive global unemployment, cascading in waves as a viral pandemic shutters most parts of the non-digital economy, has put the world on the precipice of the “everything bubble” Satoshi Nakamoto sought to inoculate us against with the creation of bitcoin.      This is both the moment the cryptocurrency community has both eagerly awaited and dreaded. A global pandemic hitting just as sovereign currencies are being architected should serve as an accelerator for rapid issuance and acceptance. This should be true in particular for teetering third-world economies lacking a global reserve currency to inflate their monetary bases without hyperinflationary hell to pay. Additionally, there are undeniable health and hygiene benefits over paper currencies, not just better trackability for tax collection and law enforcement purposes.      See also: How Blockchain Tech Can Make Coronavirus Relief More Effective      The wheels of legislative and regulatory approval grind slowly in normal times, so it is encouraging that a preliminary digital dollar program nearly made it into the congressional aid package for displaced workers and shuttered businesses as a better way to quickly distribute the multi-trillion-dollar creation of magic Federal Reserve money. Sadly, it was pruned from the final bill on the legislative cutting room floor. Instead, we are left to fill out forms downloaded from bank websites that cannot handle the traffic. These loans may take months to process at a time when millions of recently unemployed workers have little to no savings.      Many of the industries where physical contact is required at the last mile are having their legacy supply chains disrupted. Seminars and conferences cannot take place in closed hotels with few planes to fly them in. Restaurants are restricted to take-out in most of the U.S. and Europe, India and large swaths of everywhere else.      Necessity, of course, is the mother of invention and this is where the token foundations and programmers need to step into high gear. They need to finalize and deploy solutions that have been in development for years for smart-contract supply chain management, international global e-commerce payments and remittances, and seamless exchange and wallet onramps and off-ramps to stored value. As the specter of bank runs and closures looms around the developing world, there is substantial demand for reliable asset-backed stablecoins, blockchain-backed precious metals ownership, security tokens sufficiently discounted for risk and for the nascent world of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is currently paying some of the highest interest of any asset class.    Who among us will become the Zoom of easy cross-border payments, of smart contract supply chain management and of clearly superior solutions in a dozen other categories.    Waiting for legacy global fiat off-ramps to embrace the blockchain in a world already hamstrung by multiple redundant KYC/AML approval loops to access one’s own money when the traditional economy is essentially on fire is a banana upon which the banking industry is poised to slip. Just as we now make our own masks and hand-fashioned bandanas for wearing inside supermarkets, we don’t have time to wait for congressional approval to accelerate the adoption curve for cryptocurrency and blockchain-based solutions.      Never has there been a time when Big Tech and Big Consulting are more in need of outside resources to scale solutions to fresh problems in multi-trillion dollar industries. These “too big to fail” firms are already on the pre-approved list for government and Fortune 500 contracts, but they tend to lack the nimbleness, open source ethos, and out-of-the box thinking employed by the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems.      One benefit that has come out of the sudden stoppage of physical events is the rapid rise of virtual events, conferences, seminars, networking lounges. Most of them are free after the price of an email address, others priced far less than online webinars of the past. Zoom and other platforms have done a remarkable job of emulating a real conference, including breakout rooms. Zoom (a company my firm briefly represented in its infancy) had to beat out legacy competitors with much larger funding including Cisco, Microsoft and Facebook with a superior interface and stellar execution to win the race (for the moment) as video webcasting king of the hill.      See also: Why This Global Crisis Is a Defining Moment for Stablecoins      You can even have drinks together. I am in a WhatsApp group of bitcoin old-timers who created a Zoom cocktail party event every Friday afternoon since the pandemic took hold. I am in another group of tech and media leaders in Los Angeles who have used Zoom to both keep its current physical membership connected virtually but also to reconnect with its past members from around the globe for the chance to hear renowned speakers and network each Saturday morning. It’s still not the ability to hug or shake someone’s hand. But with virtual events, you can still look someone straight in the eye.      Now is the time for bold action by governments and industry to embrace the blockchain and crypto communities. We have not done the greatest job of educating one another about what it is we do and why – sometimes, physical events produce a lot of grandstanding and posturing, which seem harder to pull off in the intimate video closeups of the Zoom format. Let’s all do our part to connect the dots of the new virtual world with sound alternatives to the increasingly virtual fiat monetary supply and its creaky legacy framework.      Let’s see who among us will become the Zoom of easy cross-border payments, of smart contract supply chain management and of clearly superior solutions in a dozen other categories.

42431776,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6PZh,1587557349,Bitcoin Approaches $7K as US Passes New $480B Stimulus Package,"Bitcoin is rising so far on Wednesday as stock markets cheer the U.S. Senate’s decision to approve $484 billion in new coronavirus relief.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands near $6,970 at press time, representing a 1.6 percent gain on the day. Prices look to have steadied in the $6,930 to $7,000 range over the last hour or so., according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Meanwhile, the Euro Stoxx 50 – the eurozone’s benchmark equity index – is reporting a 1 percent gain, and there's been a 1.26 percent increase in the value of futures tied to the S&P 500.      The positive moves come after the U.S. Senate passed a new stimulus bill on Tuesday to bolster aid for small businesses, fund more coronavirus testing, and provide support to hospitals facing a deluge of sick patients. The new package comes nearly four weeks after the U.S. lawmakers approved an unprecedented $2 trillion federal stimulus program. This new bill now moves to the House of Representatives for approval before it can be signed by President Donald Trump.      That the trillions of dollars of stimulus is inflationary and could bode well for bitcoin in the long term is generally accepted by now. So far, however, bitcoin has failed to perform as a significant haven asset or an inflation hedge, and has been generally tracking equities through the crisis.    Bitcoin decoupling?    While the cryptocurrency has recovered over 80 percent from the March low of $3,867, the price rally has coincided with the notable recovery in the S&P 500. That said, signs of bitcoin decoupling from traditional markets have emerged this week.      For instance, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the main oil benchmark for North America, fell to $37 below zero on Monday, sending shockwaves across the global financial markets.      Bitcoin wobbled slightly following the oil price slide and registered a 4 percent drop Monday. But the decline was moderate considering the scope of the oil losses and the stressed state of the global economy the event reflected.      Further, bitcoin remained steady near $6,850 on Tuesday even though the June futures contract on the WTI fell by 40 percent and the S&P shed more than 3 percent of its value.      More important, classic safe havens like gold and U.S. Treasurys also faced selling pressure on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar strengthened in the forex markets – a sign of a renewed dash for cash.      A similar cash crunch seen in mid-March triggered a violent price drop. Bitcoin fell by nearly 40 percent on March 12 and printed a low of $3,867 the following day as investors scrambled for liquidity.      This time, however, the cryptocurrency is showing resilience, possibly because the crypto market focus has shifted to bitcoin’s mining reward halving in 19 days.      “Last month’s rush to cash hit bitcoin especially hard. This time around, the impending halving could have mitigated outflows from crypto into cash,” said Marcus Swanpoel, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Luno.      Bitcoin undergoes the halving process every four years, reducing block rewards by half in order to curb inflation.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Many observers expect the supply-cutting event to bode well for bitcoin’s price. These bullish expectations could force investors to hold their coins while heading into the event.      “It could be that investors are not choosing to sell their holdings as we might expect and instead are staying in bitcoin so as not to miss out on the anticipated gains in the months following the halving,” Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset investment form eToro, told CoinDesk.      It remains to be seen if bitcoin remains bid while heading into halving. Luno's Swanpoel thinks more money may come into cryptocurrencies if gold keeps drawing safe-haven bids.      The yellow metal is reporting 2 percent gains at press time and may continue to draw bids, as a V-shaped economy recovery is increasingly looking unlikely.      From a technical analysis standpoint, bitcoin’s immediate bias is neutral because the cryptocurrency is trapped in a sideways channel.    Daily chart    As can be seen, bitcoin has been largely restricted to a range of $6,470 to $7,470 since April 7.      However, within that range, the cryptocurrency printed a bearish lower high at $7,300 on April 18, raising the prospects of a downside move to $6,470. So far, however, the sellers have failed to penetrate the bottom of the range.      The bulls need to keep bitcoin above the descending (bearish) 50-day average at $6,802 to avoid a sell-off.      On the higher side, a move above $7,300 would strengthen the prospects of a range breakout and a rally to $8,000 ahead of halving.

42431779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Pfh,1587556136,First Mover: What the Oil Price Collapse Means for Bitcoin's Halving Valuation,"One lesson of this week's oil-price crash is that markets aren't acting very efficiently during the coronavirus crisis.      On Monday, the benchmark U.S. oil futures contract for May delivery tumbled to an unprecedented negative price, largely because storage tanks are full of a product few can use. How that surprised experienced oil traders might seem a mystery, since energy companies and Texas state officials had been warning for weeks that storage capacity was running out.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Commentators quickly pointed out the price anomaly was limited to the May contract; the futures contract for June delivery, after all, was still trading above $20 a barrel – a better reflection of oil's true price. ""Technical factors explain some of the decline,"" the New York Times wrote. ""Oil watchers don't consider it the most accurate reflection of price action,"" the Wall Street Journal wrote.      Then on Tuesday, that narrative proved fanciful when the June contract tumbled more than 43 percent to a 21-year low of $11.57 a barrel. The May contract settled at $10.01.      The only news was the price discovery: It turns out oil is worth a lot less now than it was at the start of the week, or in early April when it traded closer to $30 a barrel.      The takeaway for bitcoin traders is there might be a lot of factors in cryptocurrency markets that are known but not really reflected in the price.      Those could include the deflationary impact of the coronavirus-induced global recession and the potential inflationary forces of the Federal Reserve's trillions of dollars of emergency money injections. Another might be the upcoming miner rewards halving, due to take place next month on the bitcoin blockchain.      ""The markets are just simply reflecting at this point what's going on in the real economy, which obviously is a lot of volatility,"" Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Heath Tarbert told CNBC on Tuesday, in an interview about the oil market.      The reality unfolds slowly, and the volatility happens all of a sudden.      This might help explain why bitcoin has been stuck for all of April in a range between $6,400 and $7,400, even in the midst of what looks to be the world's biggest health emergency and economic crisis so far this century.      ""Bitcoin barely flinched as negative oil prices sent shockwaves through traditional markets and in relative terms has held up very well,"" the Israeli trading platform eToro noted Tuesday in an email to clients.      Was that the right reaction for the bitcoin market?      There's so much traders don't know about the future course of the pandemic and of its ramifications for business, society and culture. But it's not even clear if markets have properly priced in what traders already know.      Bitcoin is often touted by traders as a hedge against inflation, and many cryptocurrency investors assume the Fed's money injections will eventually spur faster price rises. But Deutsche Bank has predicted in recent reports that the U.S. unemployment rate will rise to a post-World War II record of 17 percent, putting downward pressure on wages. That's deflationary.      For bitcoin traders, squaring the countervailing forces adds to the frustration of trying to divine what sort of speculation the bitcoin market is already reflecting. Is May's halving priced into the market, given that it was put on the schedule 11 years ago when the Bitcoin blockchain was launched? That debate has been raging for months.      The oil price collapse this week shows how bad markets can be at reflecting what's already known until there's a hard reality check on supply and demand.      That might mean bitcoin traders won't know the price impact of the cryptocurrency's potential adoption as an inflation hedge until more mainstream investors actually start buying.      And it might mean the market won't see the full impact of May's halving until it comes – and maybe goes.    TWEET OF THE DAY  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $6,960 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $6,988 | 24-Hr Low: $6,783      Trend: Bitcoin is flashing green on Wednesday as price volatility falls to fresh 3.5-month lows.      The top cryptocurrency is currently trading near $6,950, representing a 1.4 percent gain on the day. The cryptocurrency is lacking a clear directional bias, however, as prices have spent a better part of the last 2.5-weeks trading in the narrow range of $6,450 to $7,450.      Due to the rangebound activity, the spread between bitcoin’s Bollinger bands – volatility indicators placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving price average – has narrowed to $838, the lowest since January 6. The spread was $895 on Monday.      The tightening of Bollinger bands indicates a drop in volatility and often paves the way for a big move up or down.      The daily chart's MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes, is about to cross below zero for the first since March 20. The impending bearish crossover on the MACD suggests the price squeeze could end with a sell-off. The immediate support of the lower Bollinger band is located at $6,571.      However, on-chain metrics are telling a different story. For example, the seven-day moving average of the number of bitcoins held on cryptocurrency exchanges continues to fall, indicating a strong holding sentiment ahead of the mining reward halving due in 19 days.      The average fell to 2,398,564 on Tuesday to hit the lowest level since June 13, according to blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. The metric stood at 2,214,365 a week ago, having topped out at 2,404,786 on Jan. 17.      Investors usually move coins from the exchanges to their personal wallets when prices are expected to rise. Meanwhile, bitcoin balances on exchanges typically rise during bear markets.      It's worth noting the MACD is based on moving averages, which are lagging indicators, and could trap sellers with a bearish crossover. Hence, accumulation signaled by the declining balance of bitcoin on exchanges takes precedence over the technical indicator.      Put simply, bitcoin could rise in the short term and may breach the recent trading range on the high side. Acceptance above $7,450 would open the doors for a stronger rally to $8,000.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/22/first-mover-what-the-oil-price-collapse-means-for-bitcoins-halving-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d08b132fcc76c20918f27e96fdb88cf1a1b38099-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431769,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6PLh,1587547227,"Miners Trick Stablecoin Protocol PegNet, Turning $11 Into Almost $7M Hoard","Rogue miners submitted phony price data that tricked decentralized stablecoin network PegNet into turning a small wallet balance into a $6.7 million stash.      At approximately 05:00 UTC Tuesday morning, four mining entities – which together comprised as much as 70 percent of the PegNet hashrate – submitted data that artificially inflated the price of a ""pJPY,"" a stablecoin pegged to the price of Japanese yen, according to a core developer going by the username ""WhoSoup.""      Beginning initially with a wallet balance of $11, the group pushed the price of pJPY up to $6.7 million and then transferred it into pUSD – PegNet's USD-linked stablecoin. They then tried (unsuccessfully) to liquidate as much as possible on spot exchanges and distribute the remainder in hundreds of different wallet addresses.      PegNet is a decentralized network, built on top of the Factom protocol, where users can trade stablecoins pegged to 42 assets. Besides fiat currencies, there are also digital assets pegged to commodities, such as gold, and other cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ether.      See also: Hacker Exploits Flaw in Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange Bisq to Steal $250K      The network relies on miners to submit price data collected from a series of oracles and APIs to keep stablecoin prices pegged to their fiat equivalents. Each block requires up to 50 data points, and the protocol discards the 25 submissions furthest away from the total average. Most use the third to fourth default sources, but miners are also able to submit their own arbitrary values.      ""WhoSoup"" told CoinDesk this isn't normally a problem as the system works to incentivize miners – with a block reward – to submit price data in line with those of other submissions.      Over Discord, the developer explained the miners essentially performed a form of 51 percent attack by submitting 35 of the top 50 price submissions, skewing the average in their favor and meaning that the remaining 15 price submissions were discarded as outliers.      With the fake exchange rate, the miners converted the inflated pJPY into pUSD so the overall wallet balance rose from $11 worth of pJPY tokens to well over 6.7 million pUSD which, assuming accurate price data, should be worth $6.7 million.      Tuesday's attack lasted about 20 minutes and apparently did not affect other users' funds.      David Johnston, who as well as being Factom Inc. chairman is also one of the main figures behind PegNet, told CoinDesk that group had no control over transactions and conversion of other users, but could only confirm price data. ""This attacker seems to have only affected their own wallet,"" he said.      Johnston added that the attacker had not been able to transfer much of the pUSD into the PegNET's native PEG cryptocurrency, as the protocol's software doesn't allow quick conversions. ""This person was able to generate a bunch of pAssets, but not able to convert them into PEG and dump on the market,"" he said.      The way PegNet is configured means the identity of individuals controlling the mining entities cannot be known. While there were four mining entities that worked in unison, it isn't clear whether these were all controlled by the same person or whether this was the work of a group.      See also: Why This Global Crisis Is a Defining Moment for Stablecoins      But there are still some unanswered questions. The attacker has since reached out to PegNet and claimed they were only trying to ""pentest [penetration test] the network and code logic,"" to identify potential vulnerabilities and notify core developers.      They have also destroyed all the stablecoins in question, sending them all to the PegNet burn address at roughly 14:00 UTC Tuesday.      Both Who and Johnston refused to be drawn on the motives behind the attack. ""I can't speak to intent of this person just their actions,"" Johnston said. ""Their actions were to generate the pAssets and then destroy those pAssets. [It] seems like more of a stunt than an attack given the short time it lasted and their actions since.""      The attacker's decision to burn the assets seems to mirror the actions of the hacker who drained dForce of $25 million at the weekend and then handed back stolen assets after learning Singaporean authorities had their IP address.      Johnston said PegNet would now review some of its oracle mechanisms, to ensure they are robust enough to withstand these sorts of attacks again in the future.      See also: Factom Inc. ‘Faces Liquidation’ After Investors Refuse Request for More Funding      ""I fully expect more sophisticated attacks over time. As values in DeFi networks rise there is ever more reason to attack them,"" he said. ""The key is building systems like PegNet where individual users are not affected by the actions of others in the system. So because PegNet has no reserve or collateral held in a pool, there were no common user funds to drain.""

It’s also the first time carbon offsetting will be possible on a blockchain platform for jewelry.”      See also: Why Tech-Minded Climate Groups See COVID-19 as a Trial Run for Massive Change      Looking beyond gemstones, Everledger is also involved in sustainable supply chain tracking of rare earth minerals such as cobalt and lithium used in batteries, and plans to collaborate with Hyperledger blockchain stablemate Circulor.      Carrie George, VP and head of sustainability for Everledger, said the new platform will provide blockchain certificates to verify energy efficiency and renewable sourcing efforts. “We can connect stakeholders faster and more directly than ever to get their time and money focused directly on the impact they want to achieve,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/22/everledger-offers-diamond-industry-blockchain-based-carbon-offsetting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ebc27832461978573bc4269c6fbab8eb0fb38f7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’s crypto business announced Tuesday it had completed the SOC 1 Type 1 examination in March. The report, conducted by Deloitte, is an attestation that Gemini’s financial reporting obligations work at a given moment.      Gemini Head of Risk Yusuf Hussain told CoinDesk the “independent validation” of Gemini’s financial reporting operations gives credence to the system’s design and mitigates “the risk of significant error, omission, or data loss.”      Gemini, which Hussain claims is the first crypto exchange and custodian to run the gamut of security, privacy, financial reporting and systems control examinations designed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), is now one year away from completing the Type 2 report, which checks that the systems also work over time.      See also: Gemini Continues European Expansion With New Institutional Sales Role      Checking these audit boxes has become a regular feature of Gemini’s compliance and regulatory strategy. It had previously completed AICPA’s security-facing SOC 2 Types 1 and 2 reports, also administered by Deloitte, and plans to repeat the SOC 1 Type 2 report annually.      BitGo has also completed the SOC Type 2 audits for its custody business.      “Providing this level of transparency and building this level of trust is key to broader crypto market adoption,” Hussain said. It has also apparently paid dividends for Gemini, which uses these attestation reports to show potential partners its systems are transparent and up to snuff.      Hussain said such transparency “is a significant factor in our establishing relationships with traditional financial institutions.”      Also see: Circle CEO Claims ‘Explosive’ Stablecoin Demand From Everyday Businesses      He pointed to State Street Bank as one such institution.

42431771,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6PNh,1587531600,UK’s Tech Bailout Could Help Blockchain Devs Weather COVID-19 Shutdown,"Britain's tech startups are getting a tailor-made COVID-19 relief fund.      On Sunday, the U.K. government unveiled a £1.25 billion (US$1.53 billion) rescue package for high-growth businesses, pledging £500 million in loans and £750 million in research funding to keep floundering startups afloat through the coronavirus pandemic. The new package is targeted at tech firms in particular, many of which were unable to tap a previous relief plan.      Blockchain platform startup Chainvine CEO Oliver Oram said his business, like countless other businesses in the U.K. and around the world, went into immediate crisis mode when economies began grinding to a halt earlier this year. Chainvine builds ""frictionless trade"" platforms that digitize import and export records for clients, including the British government.      “‘We no longer have a budget,’” Oram recalled telling his 20-person team at the start of the crisis, “‘we just have costs.’”      Those costs had to go, and fast, Oram said. “It wasn't a question of, like, ‘OK we budget for this month.’ Everything has to be slashed at the moment because you don't even know where normality will come back.”      Oram described the need to enact “draconian” belt-tightening measures after the pandemic interrupted Chainvine’s investment stream.    Some relief      “Future Fund,” the new convertible loan program, will run from May through September with 50-50 backing from taxpayers and the private sector. Loans from £125 thousand to £5 million will go to qualifying non-listed U.K. firms who have raised at least £250,000 from VCs in the past five years, according to the government fact sheet.      “The U.K. is a world leader in innovation and at this hugely challenging time, we know that young, fast-growing firms require tailored support to see them through,” U.K. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said in a press release acknowledging the government’s earlier funding effort, the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS), did not go far enough.      The new fund addresses some of the biggest tech-facing shortcomings of CBILS. That multi-billion pound small business bailout was seen as ill-suited to tech startups, many of which failed to meet CBILS’ basic criteria and thus feared disaster from an economic crisis beyond their control.      Read more: How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive      Through petitions and open letters, tech firms rallied for a more inclusive funding scheme. Oram said part of CBILS’ problem was its reliance on commercial banks who could not properly value the “intangible assets” of tech startups.      I don’t think they’re equipped for that,” Oram told CoinDesk in an interview prior to the launch of “Future Fund.”      “Getting these loans then for a tech startup is even worse because these banks have no idea how to manage or value your intangible asset,” he said.    Better positioned    Chainvine furloughed seven developers, froze new projects, cut the management team’s pay, fired all nonessential-contractors and renegotiated terms with the rest, according to Oram.      He said he could not look to CBILS for help because Chainvine’s “intangible assets” were insufficient for the commercial bankers running that program. Bankers prefer brick and mortar collateral over fintech concepts, Oram said.      “At the moment it's hard enough for banks to understand fintech and build fintech into their systems, let alone for a daily bank manager to actually value a fintech and decide what would be a fair or not fair loan.”      In a follow-up interview, Oram said the Future Fund scheme is far better positioned to rescue high growth tech firms such as his. The program is run through the British Business Bank, an economic development bank. Funding converts into equity if the loan is not paid back. Venture capital firms will match the taxpayer-backed loan, and extend more if needed.      “It’s a pretty good deal,” said Oram, who has not yet decided if Chainvine will apply. His chief financial officer is still reviewing the terms.      Oram said the new funding scheme is an encouraging public-private partnership by a government that initially undervalued the importance of its tech ecosystem and whose first coronavirus relief program put much of Britain’s high-growth startup scene at risk.      “They’re beginning to realize that they can't just let go of their intangible assets, their bright young startups that are coming up with solutions to tomorrow's problems,” he said.      “I think there's a general feeling that you can't lose that talent, otherwise you're going to lose it for years.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/22/uks-tech-bailout-could-help-blockchain-devs-weather-covid-19-shutdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c033b5ecf20df63bf6f9b5f2f753be7c5991e87-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXCD0YB,1587521690,Charlie Lee,"Charlie Lee is the creator of litecoin and the managing director for the Litecoin Foundation. Born in Ivory Coast, West Africa, Lee immigrated to the United States at age 13.      Lee announced litecoin on Bitcointalk, a bitcoin forum initially created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2011 while working at Google. Litecoin is a fork of bitcoin, intended to serve as “silver to Bitcoin's gold,” rather than to compete with it. Litecoin’s price increased dramatically by 395% in 2013.      Lee sought to make litecoin technically distinct from bitcoin in two different ways. First, he aimed to make it possible for the average consumer to mine the coin using consumer grade hardware, as opposed to the specialized mining hardware that bitcoin utilizes. Second, Lee sought to create a network that allowed for faster and cheaper transactions (approximately 2.5 minutes per transaction compared to the 10 minutes bitcoin offered). This faster time and cheaper transaction fee was intended to enable consumers to use litecoin for smaller and more day-today transactions.      After creating litecoin, Lee joined crypto exchange startup, Coinbase, as director of engineering. In 2015, during his time at Coinbase, Lee shifted his focus away from litecoin and development on the protocol stagnated.      In 2017, Lee left Coinbase in order to dedicate his time and attention to the Litecoin Foundation.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | LTC | BTG,John Metais,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/charlie-lee,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
