Bitso  's establishment as an entry point into Ripple's peer-to-peer network means that its customers will be able to more easily transfer pesos, US dollars and BTC across borders.  The company's co-founder and CTO Ben Peters said:  “We are committed to developing the infrastructure required to revolutionize the incumbent remittance ecosystem in Mexico, harnessing the transformative innovations of cryptocurrency.”  Remittances  Since Mexico is the third largest receiver of remittances after India and China, unlocking the market for low-cost bitcoin remittances has long been a goal for digital currency initiatives.  A number of US states have large Mexican migrant populations that send cash back home. Yet, the ability to send money from the US to Mexico is not easy, despite the proximity.  Billions of US dollars are sent from the US to Mexico, and the fees to transmit this money can be prohibitively high. The World Bank reports that the average cost to send $200 USD to Mexico using an operator service such as MoneyGram is 4.45%.  According to BitcoinAverage, Bitso holds 50% of volume for the MXN/BTX trading pair. Its chief competition in the market for exchanging peso for bitcoin is LocalBitcoins, which has similar volume.  Bitso and Ripple  Ripple is a currency-agnostic method of moving money. An offshoot of bitcoin's decentralized network, it is able to move both fiat and digital currencies. There is no fee for gateways like Bitso to use the Ripple protocol.  Rather, Bitso will be required to comply with regulatory requirements and service customers converting currencies into pesos.  This is where Bitso will make its money - by charging a small fee to exchange money via the gateway. If Bitso can charge less than banks or money service operators and make its service easily accessible - possibly with the use of bitcoin ATMs - it could become competitive in the remittance market.  The news also shows that interest for Ripple is translating internationally.  Most recently, Fidor became the first bank to use the Ripple payment protocol in what could be a sign of more announcements to come.

42425682,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewVh,1399926363,New Lamassu Product Upgrades Bitcoin ATMs for Two-Way Transactions,"Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Lamassu has debuted a new ATM stand that allows customers to exchange bitcoin for cash, enabling two-way ATM transactions through its units for the first time.  The Santo Tirso floor stand is designed to augment current Lamassu ATMs and compete against current two-way market offerings, such as those from rival manufacturer Robocoin.  Lamassu CEO Zach Harvey  told newsBTC that the new product enables operators to develop their ATM infrastructure based on consumer demand and business concerns.  Harvey said:    ""It was important for us to give operators the choice of one-way or two-way transactions. Our modular design allows them the ability to choose a cash-to-bitcoin machine, or the option of adding a stand that enables two-way transactions.      Different operators have different market needs, so flexibility is key here.”    The Lamassu Santo Tirso stand will officially debut at the Bitcoin 2014 conference, to be held in Amsterdam later this week.  Product details  The Santo Tirso stand is being offered with a price tag of $5,500 per model. The stand holds up to 1,000 notes in whichever fiat currency the operator chooses.  According to the company, the product is being manufactured on a rolling basis. This, says Lamassu, will give it better flexibility in terms of demand from bitcoin ATM operators.  Customer demand  While the manufacturer didn’t give specifics on the number of orders already placed, Lamassu told newsBTC that operators have expressed interest and are already investing in the Santo Tirso stand.  The floor stand is the second developed by Lamassu, which debuted a similar product - without the cash dispensing component - in March.  The stand was made available for $1,600, and at the time, the company also pledged to reduce overall delivery times for its growing list of customers.

42425676,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewPh,1399919408,Why the ATM Industry Could Launch Bitcoin into the Mainstream,"Roughly six months after the launch of the world's first bitcoin ATM, this sector of the bitcoin industry has expanded dramatically, with more than 15 manufacturers competing for prime installation space in major cities and commerce centres around the globe.  However, a new report from the Electronic Funds Transfer Association (EFTA) and the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA) suggests that these entities could soon have powerful new competition in the market, competition that would potentially further accelerate bitcoin adoption in a way that the digital currency's own native businesses may be unable to replicate.  The report, the second digital currency-focused collaboration between the two organisations, offered up a wide array of research on bitcoin, including a basic overview of the technology and the burgeoning bitcoin ATM sector.  It also provided an interesting new conclusion to the discussion, stating:  ""Bitcoin and digital currency integration could become a profitable value-added service for [traditional] ATM operators, provided take-up of virtual currencies and digital cash continues to increase.""  EFTA and ATMIA went on to suggest that established ATM networks – both those operated by financial institutions (FIs) and non-FIs – could gain 'first-mover advantage' in the bitcoin industry by leveraging their financial resources and technical capabilities to court this market.  While the suggestion may seem far-fetched, though, it's actually in line with recent trends in the ATM industry, according to EFTA CEO Kurt Helwig, who told CoinDesk:  ""ATMs today, they're multi-functional, the whole thing is about an omnichannel user experience. They're not just spitting out cash anymore, they're providing an array of services in order to meet the consumer demand for convenience.""  Furthermore, given that there are roughly 2.5 million ATMs globally, the addition of these networks, he says, could radically expand access to bitcoin.  Natural fit  For Helwig, bitcoin's integration into traditional ATMs makes sense for both the emerging digital currency and for ATM providers.  Most importantly for bitcoin, Helwig suggested, is that by integrating with established ATM networks, the technology can benefit from the high level of consumer trust that ATMs have successfully cultivated.  Helwig indicated this union could serve a way to hedge against the uncertainty that arises when consumers use a new technology, stating:  ""I think that ATMs are a natural fit for something like bitcoin. A mix of the old and new. ATMs are a proven, safe, convenient, consumer-friendly channel that consumers understand very well, and something that consumers around the world have a great deal of confidence in.""  ATMs operated by major financial institutions and third-party businesses, in turn, would gain access to a new and potentially loyal consumer base.  Given this suggestion, it's possible they could even reap the same rewards as notable merchants that have successfully leveraged the promotion and business of the bitcoin community.  Who will be first?  Of course, while there is the potential for benefits to be had for both parties, Helwig suggests it's too early to tell whether FI or non-FI ATM providers would seek to implement bitcoin functionality first.  However, he suggested that both are probably considering the possibilities, saying:  ""I think at this point, at an early stage, I think both are looking into this as a potential channel with which to grow their business.""  Helwig is also still unsure of which country would be likely to lead this transition, though EFTA senior consultant Bob Bucceri suggested that the US may be the best candidate, telling CoinDesk:    ""I'm comfortable with the regulatory structure in this country. We give the market a chance to shake it out and if it doesn't, regulators step in. I think that's why we've become a good incubator for a lot of financial technology.""            Teething troubles  Perhaps most notably, Helwig and Bucceri see a parallel between bitcoin's recent struggles with bad actors and the early days of the traditional ATM market. Helwig explained:  ""[In those days], the bad guys that were cutting corners and not following established procedures to make a quick buck were quickly drummed out of the business, but not before making some very very negative headlines. [...] In many ways, bitcoin is suffering the slings and arrows of being first to market here, not unlike [early ATM entrants did].""  Both EFTA members indicated that the organisation is still working to determine its stance on bitcoin and digital currencies. Still, Bucceri went so far as to say that he is ""optimistic"" about bitcoin adoption, and that regulation will ultimately bring safety and security to its marketplace, adding:  ""It goes back to this idea of safety and soundness, it's a leap of faith when someone puts a card in an ATM. [But] that whittling out process with ATMs took place 10 years ago. You don't have a lot of new coverage on the ATM, its a part of everyone's life these days.""  However, just what part the traditional ATM sector will play in this transition, and if bitcoin can achieve the same success, remains to be seen.

42425681,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewbh,1399915015,CoinTerra Unveils 1 Petahash Hosted Mining Contracts,"Bitcoin mining ASIC processor and systems manufacturer CoinTerra has announced it will offer hosted mining contracts.  The Austin-based company says customers can now purchase plans ranging from 200 gigahashes (GH/s) to more than 1 petahash (PH/s) with immediate deployment.  CoinTerra framed the move as an extension of its mission to bring bitcoin mining to more consumers around the globe.  Ravi Iyengar, CoinTerra's CEO, explained:  ""Many prospective bitcoin miners don’t have the space or power requirements to operate their own bitcoin mining hardware, especially at scale. In addition, some foreign countries have import restrictions on advanced cryptocurrency hardware or punitively high duties.""  The new contract offering, Iyengar said, would allow these consumers broader access to bitcoin mining products.  The hosted mining service will be powered by TruePeta, a new scalable system built on top of the company's GoldStrike I ASIC and TerraMiner platform, which hit its tape-out stage in December. CoinTerra shipped its 5,000th TerraMiner unit in April.  Still, while the offering is likely to find demand in the current market, not all consumers have been satisfied with CoinTerra's service to date, as the company, like many other consumer-focused mining companies, has struggled with performance and delivery issues.  Entering the market  CoinTerra said it now offers a range of hosted mining plans, starting at $999 for a 12-month 200GH/s rental. One PH/s mining contracts, the release suggested, would require a two-year commitment.  Given that CoinTerra manufactures its own equipment, CTO Timo Hanke suggested that the move will allow the company to deploy orders more rapidly than its established competitors in the hosted mining space.  Further, he added that the company is able to provide a host of extra services as well, stating:  ""The systems are monitored by a team of experienced engineers, ensuring 24/7 uptime in a controlled and secure managed environment.""  A maturing mining industry  The move is also notable given that it follows the merger of cloud mining contract provider CloudHashing and enterprise ASIC hardware developer HighBitcoin, which joined forces to form PeerNova in early May.  PeerNova will also be using its own ASIC hardware to provide hosted mining solutions.  Notably, representatives from both CloudHashing and CoinTerra will also be on hand at this week's Bitcoin 2014 conference in Amsterdam. For more on this conference and what's it store for panel topics and guest speakers, see a full schedule for the event here.

42425688,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewnh,1399910657,ATM Maker Diamond Circle to Launch Bitcoin Debit Card,"Bitcoin ATM maker Diamond Circle has announced it will launch a bitcoin debit card this week at the Bitcoin 2014 Conference in Amsterdam, in conjunction with its UK distributor Swiftbitz.  Diamond Circle claims the card will only work with its own two-way, cashless bitcoin ATM, its forthcoming merchant point-of-sale (POS) solution and via its online exchange.  This is a contrast to other bitcoin debit cards tied to established card payment networks like UnionPay, which can be accepted in a majority of outlets without the merchant possessing any bitcoin-specific technology.  The debit cards utilize contactless near-field communication (NFC) technology and will be issued via Diamond Circle's ATM operators, retail merchants, independent distributors and on the company’s website.  Furthermore, the cards will be linked to the user's wallet and may hold up to nine fiat currencies as well as bitcoin.  The bitcoin exchange rate incurred with transactions will be based on prevailing market rates at the time of use, the company says.  Closed ecosystem  Diamond Circle  , which based in Australia, is currently developing a range of devices that promote easy access and secure storage for bitcoin users. This includes the ATM machines mentioned previously, POS card/wallet readers for merchants, and a variety of bitcoin hardware wallets in the form of NFC discs and cellphone 'stickers'.  While it may seem disadvantageous to produce a debit card that cannot be used over mainstream payments systems, with the right infrastructure Diamond Circle could have a hand in all major aspects of the bitcoin economy: purchasing, spending, sending and selling.  'Holy Grail'  The ATM was launched in March, with the company saying it had created one of bitcoin’s holy grails – a cashless ATM that allows bitcoins to be purchased using a credit card, and sold via a direct deposit to users' bank accounts.  Unlike competing ATMs and vending machines that rely on QR codes and cash, Diamond Circle’s solution is based on NFC technology with paper receipt backups. Anti-money laundering (AML) and 'know your customer' procedures can be set up as required by the local regulatory environment.  The company's partner Swiftbitz has been recently created to take over UK distribution of the ATM, which costs $16,000 (around £9,300 or €11,100). European distribution should follow soon.  Diamond Circle's debit card is to be launched at the Bitcoin 2014 Conference, which takes place 15th-17th May in the Dutch capital.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/12/atm-maker-diamond-circle-to-launch-bitcoin-debit-card,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81a8467a27e46fb2c68596f210263be99617f02f-613x434.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425657,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqJh,1399907130,Bity App Sneaks iOS Bitcoin Transactions Under Apple's Radar,"A new bitcoin app for iOS devices was launched over the weekend and its developer claims it is currently the only bitcoin app available for Apple devices that can carry out transactions.  Named Bity, the app lets users send bitcoin only after agreeing that they will not hold Apple responsible for any problems they may experience during the transaction.  Unlike Google, Apple vets all submissions to iTunes and it does not accept apps with bitcoin wallet functionality.  Developers have been working to get around the ban, usually by offering browser-based bitcoin functionality through Safari. One such example is Coinpunk, which employed HTML5 to design a browser wallet last year. However, Bity uses a different approach.  Apple boilerplate  Bity  was developed by independent iOS developer Christian J Moss, who decided to attempt a different, non-techie way of getting around Apple’s wallet app ban.  Firstly, in order to proceed to the 'Send BTC' function, the user has to accept the terms and conditions, under which Apple cannot be held accountable if something goes wrong.  Secondly, the app itself has no wallet functionality. Users must enter a Blockchain wallet ID and password, or alternatively the private key of a wallet, which are saved in the app and used to make transactions.  As well as sending funds, the app also facilitates receiving funds by displaying a QR code for the user's wallet and will update the amount of funds in the wallet as the total changes.  Device differences  This is not the most elegant solution, perhaps, at least not compared to your typical Android wallet, but that is the price to pay for sneaking into Apple’s walled garden.  Bity is a universal app, so it can run on iPhones and iPads with any screen, but is optimised for iOS7 and Retina screens. It is worth noting that, currently, neither the 'Send BTC' function nor the QR code scanning option is available on iPads.  Further to its limited transaction services, the app monitors exchange rates for over a hundred different exchanges and price trends can be displayed in graphs.  The app will be free for a limited time, but there is no word on how much it will cost once the promotion is over. At the moment, the developer is accepting BTC donations to support his efforts.

42425660,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqLh,1399892818,Bitcoin Foundation Members Exit Following Election Controversy,"A number of Bitcoin Foundation members have canceled their memberships, citing frustration with the latest round of appointments and the 'general direction' of the organisation.  The cancellations emerged after annual member Patrick Alexander opened a thread on the Bitcoin Foundation forums stating he would terminate his membership immediately. At press time nine others had followed suit – the foundation has about 150 lifetime membershttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/members/, alongside annual members and 384 anonymous members.  A number of reasons were outlined by those leaving the organization, from recent the board election to broader issues.  Controversial appointments and dealings  Patrick Alexander’s original forum posts sums up the sentiment of those who decided to leave. He argues that certain board members simply don’t have what it takes to represent bitcoin in a good light.  Alexander wrote:  “The foundation members need to emulate very high moral values and ethics in business and in personal dealings, especially as it involves money. So far, the track record of prominent Bitcoin Foundation members has been abysmal. I know that most foundation members are probably swell people and are not like this. However, the actions of a few have overshadowed us all unfortunately.”  Patrick named three individuals in his post: Charlie Shrem, Mark Karpeles and Brock Pierce. “I no longer want to be associated with these people,” he said.  Lifetime member Olivier Janssens also left, along with Stephen Sunderlin, Pierre Rochard, Patrick Levell, Michael Goldstein, Stephen Angelil, Dan Plante and Christian Antkow.  Leaving the foundation, but still committed to bitcoin  Almost all of these members reiterated their commitment to bitcoin, saying they simply wish to distance themselves from the foundation – not the technology.  “I'm sorry, but in light of the recent allegations with the new foundation [board member-elects], I cannot in good conscience be involved with such an organization,” said Antkow.  Rochard said he was always quick to defend the foundation, but found the latest developments “too much”. Sunderlin, the man behind QikCoin, said he is terminating his corporate sponsorship of the foundation.  Janssens went even further. He offered to join the foundation as a Platinum member and pay the $100,000 fee if the foundation announces that it will restrict Brock Pierce from becoming a member of the board. The current board of directors needs to ratify the election before Lee and Pierce officially join the board.  Janssens added:  “I also urge you to update the bylaws to prevent people from joining if they are involved in ongoing lawsuits (of the nasty kind), or have ever been convicted for anything nasty, or if their image is potentially damaging for the foundation.”  Bitcoin Foundation forum admin Brad Wheeler responded to Alexander, outlining the way the foundation operates and why there was little to no vetting of members. He urged the members to read the Bitcoin Foundation's bylaws.  The last cancellation was posted late last night. The thread is relatively short and since it is reserved for members, it does not include comments from bitcoin enthusiasts who are not associated with the organisation.  However, many bitcoiners have taken to reddit to vent their frustrations. Most voiced support for the departing members and went on to criticise the foundation for failing to address their concerns.  The Bitcoin Foundation has since responded to CoinDesk's request for comment, suggesting that user feedback may still have a say in the final appointments.  A representative for Bitcoin Foundation said:  ""Both Bobby and Brock are board member elects. Their terms don't actually begin until June 1 and even then, the board needs to ratify the election before they can officially become board members.""
