42428027,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5Fph,1509407971,Meet Earn.com: 21 Rebrands Social Network In Shift Away from Bitcoin,"21 Inc, once a maker of bitcoin mining hardware, is rebranding to emphasize its new focus on using cryptocurrency to power a social network.  Effective today, the startup has changed its name to Earn.com to drive home the message users can get paid for answering emails and completing tasks, according to a company blog post. The rechristened startup also confirmed it's on track to issue a token that would replace bitcoin as the currency it uses to incentivize people to join the network by the year's end.  Separately, the company notified customers last week that it had discontinued support for the Bitcoin Computer. The pocket-sized mining device, which initially retailed for $400, was once 21's flagship product.  Taken together, the moves underscore how far one of the best-funded startups in the blockchain space has moved from its roots.  In an interview with CoinDesk, CEO Balaji Srinivasan said the new name gives people ""an easier way to understand the purpose of the company."" He described Earn.com as ""the first commercial social network,"" combining elements of LinkedIn and Amazon's Mechanical Turk.  The advantage for users over popular social media platforms like Twitter, he said, is simple:  ""You're not just wasting time, you're making money.""  Sends with benefits  Specifically, users can make money in several ways, according to the company.  They can create a public profile for receiving paid messages; join lists of people with similar skills (e.g. Python programmers) to receive ""microtasks"" such as completing surveys; or set up an autoreply on their email encouraging senders they don't know to pay for responses (with a whitelist, so real acquaintances can be spared the request for money).  As for the senders of mass emails, who aren't used to paying for the privilege, Earn.com claims they can get much higher response rates when recipients have a monetary incentive to write back.  According to the post, offering $1 for the recipient to read and answer an email yields response rates over 30 percent within 24 hours, and $10 gets response rates over 70 percent – crushing the low-single-digit performance typical of cold emails. Senders pay only if they get a response.  'Not an ICO'  Stepping back, 21 raised $116 million from a group of prominent investors in multiple rounds revealed two years ago, when it was still squarely in the hardware space. The valuation reflected 21's early success in bitcoin mining, but that business has since grown more competitive, and Srinivasan (a board partner at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz who joined 21 as CEO in 2015) has been steering the company toward a software model.  According to Srinivasan, the company has plenty of capital left, and fundraising is not the purpose of the upcoming token issuance.  ""It's not an ICO,"" he said emphatically. Tokens will be exchanged for ""labor,"" not capital, he explained.  Rather, the Earn.com token launch is meant to encourage users to join the network sooner. Users earn tokens just by signing up for the platform and getting verified, and the token reward for doing so will be cut in half each time Earn.com's user base doubles. (After receiving that reward for joining, users will be able to earn additional tokens by answering emails or doing tasks, the way they earn bitcoin currently.)  To give the asset scarcity, no tokens will be created after the launch, and supply is capped at 21 million, of which 54 percent will be reserved for users, according to the firm. Another 30 percent will be allocated to Earn.com employees and backers, and the remaining 16 percent will go to outside researchers and developers.  Aside from their function as an internal currency to compensate users for their work, the tokens will also serve as an API key for programmatic purchases, according to Srinivasan. And since they are ERC-20 tokens, they will be eligible for listing on exchanges, giving users a way to cash out, including in bitcoin.  An end, and a beginning  In addition to being the company's first day as Earn.com, Friday marked the ""end of life"" for server-side support of the Bitcoin Computer, 21 command line interface (CLI) and API marketplace, according to the email sent to customers last week.  Despite the wind-down, the email deemed the hardware product a success – because, it said, one of the tutorials published when 21 released the device grew into the current get-paid-to-answer-emails application.  ""Going forward, we're going to be putting all our energy into that product and the corresponding token launch ... because we think the ability to earn digital currency by replying to emails and completing tasks will be one of the most useful applications of the blockchain,"" the note said.

Appearing  before the Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Tax and Revenue, Tony Richards and David Emery – who both hail from the Reserve Bank of Australia's payments policy department – discussed a range of issues, including the institution's views on cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  Notably, the pair (in a prepared transcript of their statements) indicated that the central bank would likely not support any rule-making around the core protocols that make up blockchain networks.  The two stated:  ""The distributed and cross-border nature of digital currencies like bitcoin means that regulation of the core protocols of these systems is unlikely to be effective.""  This sentiment is aligned with an earlier note from 2015, when the two gave another speech to the Senate. At the time, the central bank indicated that ""any benefits of regulation would outweigh the potential costs.""  Indeed, the officials suggested last week that the central bank doesn't see much need for regulating cryptocurrencies in the near-term.  ""From the Bank's payments policy mandate, digital currencies do not currently appear to raise any pressing regulatory issues,"" they said.  The appearance also shined a light on how the Australian central bank sees the technology possibly taking hold – in particular, they highlight that industries with lots of intermediaries could capture the most benefits.  ""The greatest potential is likely to be in sectors where workflows involve lots of different parties with no trusted central entity, and where current practices are quite inefficient,"" the two said.

42428016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5FVh,1509386281,Bitcoin or Bitcoin2x? News & Guides to Navigate November's Fork,"For bitcoin, November is a step into the unknown.  Despite its steadily increasing price, not to mention a growing acknowledgment from the financial mainstream, the technical roadmap for the cryptocurrency has never been so hotly contested.  After years of debate on the best path forward, a new code proposal called Segwit2x is set to put the cryptocurrency – the world's largest by value – to the test. And while it boasts significant support from miners and businesses, it remains unclear whether the new code will change bitcoin's rules, or if another new cryptocurrency will be created (one already being branded bitcoin2x by some).  Quite simply, there's never been a larger change to the platform, nor one that has been the subject of such criticism and scrutiny.  And it might not be all free money. As developers are keen to note, this is bleeding-edge science; in short, we're in uncharted territory, and if past forks are any indication, decisions could lead to consequences – for users, investors and the market at large.  To help readers navigate the upcoming hard fork, CoinDesk is assembling our best content on the issue, allowing readers new and old to get up to speed in real-time.  Segwit2x explained  So, what exactly is Segwit2x? And how does it work?  First thing's first, it's both a proposal that seeks to change bitcoin's technology and a formal written agreement reached between certain parties interested in that change.  In CoinDesk's official explainer, we'll walk you through the basics: from how the protocol works to why Segwit2x represents something we haven't quite seen in the world of blockchain.  https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-segwit2x-bitcoins-next-fork-might-different/  Who supports who?  Now that you're caught up, we can dive into the dissent.  As an open platform, bitcoin thrives on the ""co-opetition"" between various parties. But as the following articles show, this delicate balance has been thrown into discord.  Developers  An open-source protocol, bitcoin relies on a group of volunteer and startup-sponsored developers to fix bugs, propose changes and maintain operations.  As such, it may be particularly noteworthy that on the subject of Segwit2x, members of this group continue to maintain that they're emphatically not involved. Back in May they protested widely, and as our recent reporting shows, not much has changed.  https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-battle-developers-apathetic-segwit2x-fork-approaches/  Miners  The large companies that operate the machinery required to solve bitcoin's puzzles and approve its transactions, miners are a more evasive bunch.  Originally supportive of the move, that confidence may now be waning. Notable here is the decision-making role miners play, and how this indecision could contribute to November's results.  https://www.coindesk.com/split-no-split-bitcoin-miners-see-no-certainty-segwit2x-fork/  Startups  The group that's seemingly put the most weight behind the change, startups use the bitcoin protocol to offer services to customers. In this way, they've perhaps had the most direct relationship with the technology, paying its fees and building infrastructure on its code.  Startups remain optimistic changes to the blockchain will correct concerns around scalability, though as new statements show, they're preparing for worst-case outcomes.  https://www.coindesk.com/free-market-forks-bitcoin-startups-love-idea-brace-reality/  Further reading:  Bloomberg – Bitcoin is Having a Civil War Right as it Enters a Critical Month  Forbes – Will This Battle For The Soul Of Bitcoin Destroy It?  CoinDesk – Why Are Miners Involved in Bitcoin Code Changes Anyway?  The opinions  As shown above, the fork is a divisive issue.  But, that's not to say there haven't been attempts that aspire to look at the situation analytically in an attempt to find a less impassioned perspective and those that don't attempt to do this at all.  Below, we provide a notable selection of reactions and takes that have added to, or helped to represent, aspects of the discussion.  https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-new-scaling-agreement-reaction/  Further reading:  CoinDesk – Why Segwit2x Is Doomed to Fail  Bitcoin Magazine – Why Segwit2x Makes No Sense  BitPay – BitPay’s Perspective on Segwit2x  The backstory  Of course, there's a deep history at play here.  Discussions have gotten taken out of context and arguments have turned fiery, leading to some confusion in the market over who's right and who's wrong, if there's even a direct answer there.  While both sides generally want the same thing – bitcoin to be used by more people – the sides argue whether that's a near-term or longer-term problem.  Still totally lost?

In an article on the Boston Fed's website, Cunha spelled out that innovations using the technology might bring advantages in payments and beyond, saying.  ""DLT has the potential to fundamentally change many areas of financial services, payments being just one. Change is also very possible in securities (sales and post trade processing), derivatives, trade finance, and supply chain to name a few.""  The Fed has been exploring cryptocurrencies since 2011, and DLT for the past four years, according to Cunha. ""We want to understand how [DLT] can impact the payment industry, since our mission is to ensure the efficiency, safety, and accessibility of payments in the U.S.,"" Cunha noted.  However, while there are applications of DLT in the cross-border payments space, most work in that area is occurring outside the U.S, he said, adding: ""So I think there is more potential for change there, but who knows what the future holds back home.""  Cunha, who helps run one of the 12 branches that make up the U.S. Federal Reserve central banking system, continued to explain that the institution has been testing various technologies in the field of payments. And while new technologies, such as data analytics, AI and machine learning, are already disrupting aspects of the financial ecosystem, it is important to find the ""right business case,"" he said.  Earlier this month, Cunha told a fintech conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that blockchain technology will ""wake up Swift and other middlemen"".

42428025,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5Frh,1509367514,The Last Hurdle: Liquidity Alliance Closes in on Distributed Ledger Launch,"A world of frictionless commerce relies heavily on lenders being able to trust they'll be repaid – or if not, that they'll get something else in return.  But this ""something else"" – collateral – isn't nearly as easy to move as the money itself.  To solve this problem, a group of international depositories and stock exchanges called the Liquidity Alliance united this year to launch LA Ledger, a blockchain solution designed to do to collateral what bitcoin did for value transfer. Now, having completed the proof-of-concept, the group is ready to launch a commercial product with only one thing left in its way: regulatory approval.  While the participants have been in conversation with regulators since Q2 of last year, last week, the group transitioned from ""informal conversations"" to a ""more formal presentation"" with regulators, according to Liquidity Alliance member and chief commercial officer for post-trade services at TMX Group Brian Gelfand.  Specifically, the blockchain built using the open-source Hyperledger Fabric is designed to break down borders between pools of collateral trapped within national systems by migrating traditional collateral from a central escrow to a distributed blockchain.  And the technology has proved beneficial.  ""The technical solution is very elegant,"" said Steve Everett, general manager of collateral management at Strate, which is also part of Liquidity Alliance. ""We are meeting with the regulators ... and nine out of ten of the questions – because the solution is so elegant – are more on the legal and regulatory front.""  While many proofs-of-concept have languished on the shelf since the early days of blockchain enthusiasm, Liquidity Alliance's latest push signifies a growing momentum behind central securities depositories (CSDs) seeing their work come to fruition.  Philippe Seyll, the co-CEO of Luxembourg's CSD Clearstream and a member of the initiative, told CoinDesk:  ""The proof-of-concept will remain a proof-of-concept if we don't get the blessing of the regulators.""  Collateral questions  This step of engaging regulators should not be taken lightly.  Each of LA Ledger's CSD and stock exchange participants – which also includes The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited, Norway's VPS and Deutsche Börse in Germany – are subject to different local regulations, as well as regional regulations that transcend country boundaries.  Learning how each member can be compliant with different controls while using the same blockchain is of utmost importance, Gelfand said, adding:  ""One of the keystones of this whole exercise is you're dealing with regulated entities ... and this mechanism has to work and be approved in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.""  It can be quite complex.  For example, among the unknowns is how lenders can ""realize"" (the gain or loss resulting from a sale of an asset) collateral that has been tokenized on a blockchain.  Traditionally, collateral consists of digital accounts of ownership for homes, cars and commercial property, whereby if a borrower defaults, a complicated series of processes are initiated that result in the collateral being forfeited to the lender.  But on a blockchain, where each of those processes are compressed into a single smart contract with the collateral represented as a token, it's possible that certain delays meant to protect borrowers (something regulators will be particularly interested in monitoring) could be undone.  Continuing distribution  In spite of the progress being made with regulators, however, the customers of multiple LA Ledger participants have expressed concern that the true value of a pool of collateral won't be achieved if only a handful of countries participate.  During a joint session held by Liquidity Alliance members Deutsche Börse and VPS last month, a few of their large bank clients were given a deep dive into how the platform operates. While the clients came to the same conclusion as Strate's Everett – saying the technology was sound – they wanted to see more CSDs involved in order to reach ""critical mass,"" according to VPS executive vice president Sveinung Dyrdal.  Drydal and Deutsche Börse's senior vice president Gerd Hartung both agreed that adding more members would be key to the blockchain platform's ultimate success.  Dyrdal concluded with optimism, though, saying:  ""I'm quite sure we will see CSDs that would like to explore the opportunity of renewing their core by using new technology.""

42428032,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5Fxh,1509365110,Making Noise: Bitcoin Price Looks Higher as Global Volumes Grow,"Bitcoin's rally is showing no signs of abating.  Prices surged to record levels on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) yesterday, with the world's largest cryptocurrency clocking a new all-time high of $6,306.58. With the push, bitcoin passed its previous high of $6,183 set on Oct. 21. At press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is $6,218.  As for why the price is trending higher, it seems there was an absence of strong news drivers. However, trading volumes in the BTC/USD pair jumped 103 percent on Sunday – indicating that the rally, fueled by trading activity, looks sustainable.  Volumes jumped to two-week highs on Sunday, and remain well below the Oct 13. high and the 2017 peak registered on Sept. 15.  Further, it's worth noting that volumes appear to be coming from a variety of markets – a deeper look at the volume activity indicates the jump to record high has been fuelled by U.S. dollar, Korean won and Japanese yen trading.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart shows:  Bullish rising channel breakout (bitcoin price closed above the upper end/ceiling of the rising channel on Sunday).  However, a move above 100 percent Fibonacci extension level of $6,196.81 was short lived. The first attempt to cut through the key Fib. level had failed on Oct. 21.  The relative strength index (RSI) is close to overbought level, but it is still sufficiently away from the October highs.  View  Bitcoin is up 500 percent on a year-to-date basis. Thus, there is always a possibility of a healthy technical correction.  Only a break below the rising trend line (dotted blue line) would warrant caution.  On the higher side, the psychological level of $6,500 could be put to test if the cryptocurrency spends the next 12 hours or more building a base around $6,200 levels.  Bearish Scenario: Only a drop below 10-day MA in the next 24 hours would open doors for a re-test of last week's low of $5,376.

In the statement released Oct. 27, the FSA stressed the ""high"" risk factors of digital tokens issued as a way of raising funds from for investors. The regulator aired several concerns over the blockchain use case including price volatility, with the FSA saying ""The price of a token may decline or become worthless suddenly.""  Further, the agency emphasized the potential for fraud in the nascent industry. ""There are possibilities that the projects in the paper are not implemented, or the goods and services planned are not offered in reality,"" the document states.  The regulator warns:  ""You should have a deal at your own risk only after understanding enough the risks ... and the content of an ICO project if you buy a token.""  The statement also stresses that projects launching token sales that ICOs are regulated and may fall ""within the scope of the Payment Services Act and/or the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act"" depending on the structure of the scheme. As a result, ICO holders are bound to comply with certain rules and regulations under those acts.  The news follows other recent ICO warnings from countries including the U.S., Singapore and Canada, among others.

Using blockchain technology, the project aims to build a platform for transparent electronic transactions between the government departments and businesses. The project would also facilitate new methods for storing and verifying information as part of the move towards a digital economy, a press release states.  The new tool is intended to aid the bank in various areas of its business, including investments, project monitoring, procurement, electronic contracting and supply chain.  The news comes days after Russian President Vladimir Putin mandated new rules for cryptocurrencies and ICOs, including use of the tech to create a ""single payment space"" for the Eurasian Economic Union countries.  According to Vnesheconombank chairman Sergey Gorkov, the blockchain tool will help in achieving ""zero human factor impact"" for transactions, helping them become more accurate, secure and transparent.  He further added:  ""The system will be useful not only to the government, but also to business customers. The new mechanism will help businesses interact with their clients and suppliers, improve the document exchange quality, enable stronger data confidentiality and underpin the customers' confidence in the product suppliers.""  The first phase of the project is expected to be carried out by the end of this year or by the start of 2018, the release adds.  Blockchain technology is attracting increased interest from Russian financial institutions and IT companies, among other industries. Government authorities in the country have recently started eyeing potential use cases of the nascent technology in areas of anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, risk management and others.

42400559,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4HB,1509353106,Show of Force: Ethereum Gears Up for Devcon3 Developer Conference,"Ethereum is out to prove itself at its annual developer event, set to begin next Wednesday.  Once arguably the most active corner of the booming cryptocurrency market, it's safe to say enthusiasm for the project has cooled, if only by comparison. Despite meteoric growth that has seen the protocol rise to $29 billion in value, not to mention hundreds of ICO projects launch using its technology, ethereum may be underperforming against its own high expectations.  That's because to many supporters, the project, launched in 2014, had seemed destined to become the first to pass bitcoin in market value (and other key metrics) this year. And while there was a big run in June, the so-called ""flippening"" never came to pass.  Still, suggestions the protocol is struggling are only surface level, according to those involved.  ""I think they are hitting on all cylinders,"" investor and author William Mougayar told CoinDesk. ""It's a real platform with several pieces on top.""  Ahead of Devcon3 this week, being held in Cancun, Mexico, attendees are also hoping for a strong showing of technical talks and project updates that demonstrate the protocol's progress.  Speaking to this restlessness was ConsenSys head of global business development Andrew Keys, who voiced his hope that the conference can show to the world the pace of development that is ongoing in the ethereum technical community.  Keys told CoinDesk:  ""I think it’s time to put up or shut up. We've had enough proof-of-concepts. [It's] time to get things into production.""  That said, others had a perception of what they hope Devcon3 won't be.  Developer Hudson Jameson, employed by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, stated that the event was designed not to be an ""ICO-fest,"" words denoting the backlash that's growing as more projects seek to leverage ethereum in fundraising (and not always to positive headlines).  Rather, Jameson said he expects the conference to serve as a forum for technical discussion, with time spent examining the state of efforts aimed to make ethereum more private and more scalable.  Growing pains  Still, while some see Devcon3 as a showcase of where ethereum is going, others see it as a showcase of the platform's current limitations.  Though there have been countless ethereum test-runs recently (with even the United Nations trialing the technology in its global humanitarian efforts), few are using ethereum – or other blockchains – outside of a laboratory setting. And that's partly because the technology is a work in progress.  Ethereum's recent upgrade Byzantium, one of the largest-ever updates to the platform, brought improvements to the blockchain, but there was still a lot it didn't do.  Still to be achieved are long-promised shifts, such as the migration to a more eco-friendly and egalitarian mining protocol, and top-level applications that make the technology easier to use.  In this way, National University of Singapore computer science Ph.D. candidate and Kyber Network co-founder Loi Luu argued the fork, while successful, didn't meet expectations across the board.  ""I think many people were not happy with the recent hard fork since it wasn't significant enough,"" he said.  Further, it took longer than expected for the not-quite-revolutionary change to occur. First, Byzantium was divided into two upgrades to make developers' jobs easier, then the first fork was delayed.  Others, however, were keen to write off any complaints. Gnosis co-founder and developer Stefan George said he was happy that the fork ""finally happened,"" arguing hat it lays the groundwork for the project's goals.  Open questions  Along those lines, developers stressed that ethereum's weaknesses will be a point of focus at Devcon3. Scalability is one of the biggest hurdles – after all, if all goes according to plan, ethereum would like its applications to replace centralized services like Facebook some day.  Luu stressed the need for more research in this area, expressing hopes that Devcon3 will help galvanize work toward that goal.  ""Ethereum is getting more mainstream now, people are expecting some scalability solution to be deployed real soon,"" he said.  Notably, developers of proposed scalability solutions such as Raiden Network and TrueBit will be speaking at the conference, providing updates on their state of progress.  Also putting pressure on the talks will be the perceived need for developers to move quickly in line with the expectations of the market.  George, for one, cited Dfinity – another blockchain billing itself as a ""world computer"" – as one he'll be looking out for in 2018, but he foresees that there could be others. Still, he argued that rival platforms could be beneficial for the platform, potentially forcing ethereum's global community into action.  He concluded:  ""Serious competition will be good.""

42400569,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4Q2,1509351418,Sony Seeks Blockchain Patent for User Authentication System,"Japanese tech conglomerate Sony may be looking to apply blockchain to a proposed user login system, according to a new patent application.  Released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Oct. 26, the document outlines how the electronics maker might use two different blockchain platforms in conjunction with each other as part of a multi-factor authentication system (MFA).  MFA systems work by giving users two different credentials to log into a website or program. After a user enters a standard username and password, an authentication token generates a code, which they must also input to gain access. The idea is that while an attacker might be able to gain a user's password, they usually cannot also gain access to the token, which generates a different code for every login.  According to Sony's application, one of their proposed blockchain platforms would create these authentication codes, while the other would receive them to confirm a user's identity when they try to commit a transaction through the platform. Possible transactions include data ""transfer, contract generation and asset transfer,"" according to the application.  Whether the work outlined in the patent application dovetails with Sony's previously disclosed work with blockchain remains to be seen.  Earlier this year, Sony announced an educational platform it is developing in conjunction with IBM, set for a launch sometime next year. The platform will use a blockchain to store student records securely, with the idea being that the technology can provide additional transparency for stakeholders.  The company said in a statement that it plans to continue looking into blockchain technology for different fields, including in supply chain and logistics, indicating other areas in which the proposed intellectual property could be applied.

42400566,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4N5,1509336038,BTC to DLT: Why Aren't Banks Giving Blockchain Startups Accounts?,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.      Life isn't easy for a startup.  As anyone who has tried it knows, it's long hours, low pay, constant stress and a relentless march into the unknown. But, it's even harder for cryptocurrency startups.  Earlier this week, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority published a report highlighting the difficulty that blockchain businesses have in getting basic banking services. Many are met with blanket refusals, some are given limited access and others get banking support yanked without warning. And the problem is not unique to the UK.  This makes it difficult for cryptocurrency businesses to operate, let alone get started. (Just try paying for your server space with cash.)  It also contradicts the UK government's pro-innovation stance. Officials have often stressed how vital fintech development is to the economy, and have expressed an explicit interest in harnessing blockchain technology. What's more, a report issued a couple of years ago by HM Treasury deemed cryptocurrencies a low risk for money laundering and terrorism financing.  Even some cryptocurrency businesses accepted into the FCA's sandbox program, which exempts them from full regulatory compliance to encourage experimentation, cannot bank in the UK.  The banks in question are, on the whole, reluctant to comment on this, which leaves the startup community assuming that the financial institutions are afraid of cryptocurrencies.  While there may be some truth to that, the main reason is more likely to lie elsewhere.  Not so scary  By now, most financial institutions have a reasonable idea of what cryptocurrencies are and how they work (there has been no shortage of reporting and conferences on the subject). They see their governments probing deeper, some of their peers experimenting with coin issuance, and they know that many of their customers dabble in digital token investments.  Cryptocurrencies are not the misunderstood threat they once were.  And it's not as if the marginalized businesses are asking the banks to hold their cryptocurrencies for them (not yet, anyway – that business opportunity will emerge). The businesses want the banks to help them manage their fiat income and payments. It's still hard to pay electricity bills and rent with bitcoin.  Furthermore, while banks don't like volatility, fluctuating cryptocurrency prices have a secondary effect at best on a startup's fiat reserves.  Reluctance to lend to cryptocurrency businesses is a different matter. It’s not unreasonable for banks to be selective in who they lend to, especially given their squeezed margins.  But this is a problem for all young startups without a track record, not just blockchain ones. And while a loan or two would be nice, what the startups are most in need of is a bank account from which to make payments.  A sharpened knife  So what are the banks afraid of? Unclear regulation, and fines.  The global regulatory clampdown on financial institutions has taken a heavy toll. Banks have paid over $320 billion in fines since the financial crisis, and with over 200 individual regulatory changes a day, it's understandable that they would rather turn down business than risk crippling charges, or possibly even license revocation.  And while a bank may feel comfortable that a blockchain startup satisfies compliance rules today, they have no idea what the rules will be five years from now, and are understandably afraid of attracting retroactive sanctions.  It's not so much the rules that are the problem – banks are used to adjusting processes to comply.  It's the lack of clarity around the rules, both current and future, that acts as an unnecessary barrier to support.  Let them in  To address this, some are encouraging the U.K. government (and others) to insist that the banks provide services for cryptocurrency companies. However, for many, that is skirting too close to government-controlled financial services, which ironically is what most cryptocurrency enthusiasts are philosophically against.  Another option – a simpler, less expensive and less invasive one – is to officially declare that it is ""ok"" to bank cryptocurrency startups, assuming they meet reasonable requirements. This could take the form of a sandbox-style regulation which absolves certain types of accounts from having to comply with the standard rules.  Or it could be the creation of a new class of entity, with a specific operating license: a special bank for blockchain-based businesses.  This could encourage the birth of a new business model, with fintech startups clamoring to sign up cryptocurrency businesses. The opportunity is significant, given the potential growth in the sector.  It could also encourage banks to establish dedicated subsidiaries to attract a new type of client, to whom they could then cross-sell other services.  The result would be not only a boost to cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses, giving them a safe transactional base from which to operate. It could also help banking to innovate, fintech to find a new avenue of growth, and both to narrow the chasm between fiat assets and blockchain-based ones.  And, as time passes, the financial sector, consumers and regulators will come to realize that the boundaries between the fiat and the crypto world are getting fuzzier – which will, in itself, open up new areas of innovation and opportunity.

42400565,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4L7,1509328843,Politician Ron Paul: US Government Should 'Stay Out' of Bitcoin,"Former U.S. lawmaker and presidential candidate Ron Paul doesn't think cryptocurrencies should be considered money, but he's ""amazed"" by their growth.  In an interview with financial news organization TheStreet last week, Paul put forth a range of views on the subject, stating that while he isn't an expert, he does support the technology insofar as it can help the legalization of alternate currencies in the U.S.  However, while Paul was ambiguous about whether he believes cryptocurrencies will be able to serve as money (noting his preference for gold or precious metals), he was adamant about one point – that the U.S. government's involvement in the oversight of the technology should be limited.  Paul told the news source:  ""If people want to use it, the government should stay out of it.""  Still, Paul ultimately mentioned two main concerns with cryptocurrencies: the first is the possibility of fraud, and the second being government oversight.  For example, Paul believes there is already too much surveillance on existing currencies and how they are used, and he expressed concern this could be applied to crypto assets.  But despite his uncertainty on some aspects, he does think that blockchain technology ""has a lot of future to it,"" statements that put him in the ranks of politicians to come out in support of the technology.  Notably, Paul's son, Rand, began accepting bitcoin for campaign donations this year, following the practice's approval by election oversight groups.
