To be sure, the crypto market, although still in its early years, has seen tremendous growth over the past three years, with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surging roughly 330% as of June 23. At one point during that span, the digital token was up 870%, but a series of high-profile bankruptcies, and consequently, increased regulatory scrutiny tempered the frothy price action. In recent days, though, BTC took center stage after Wall Street giants, chiefly BlackRock ( BLK ) and Invesco ( IVZ ), renewed their bets on the crypto by filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund. That largely contributed to BTC’s climb to new 52-week highs Friday. Also note this past week's launch of EDX Markets , backed by some Wall Street heavyweights, accelerated the enthusiasm. Coinbase’s ( COIN ) June 22 report, which is partly based on an analysis of web3 activity by Fortune 100 firms by The Block Research, found that ~60% of Fortune 100 firms with crypto-focused initiatives have been either in the pre-launch stage or already launched since the start of 2022. “These companies are innovating and investing in these technologies because they know that the century-old global financial system needs updating, that blockchain can be a foundational solution, and that not keeping pace will mean losing ground in this global economy to competitors around the world, among other possible reasons,” Coinbase ( COIN ) said. Even so, a lack of regulatory clarity continued to be a significant barrier to crypto and blockchain adoption, the report noted, with 87% of surveyed Fortune 100 executives reporting that clear rules are important to sustain U.S. leadership of the global financial system. Coinbase ( COIN ) itself was sued earlier this month by the SEC for allegedly operating as an unregistered broker, after suing the regulator in April in its effort to get a ""yes"" or ""no"" to its July 2022 petition asking the regulator to use its formal rulemaking process to provide guidance to the crypto industry. “The US is at risk of losing out on 1 million web3 developer jobs and 3 million related non-technical jobs to other countries between now and 2030 if it continues on its current path of regulation by enforcement,” the report said, adding its share of global web3 development has dropped to 29% from 40% in the last six years. Bear in mind that crypto private investments have been dominated by just a handful of entities – Citi Ventures, Google ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) Ventures, Microsoft ( MSFT ) Ventures and Goldman Sachs ( GS ). The group has “made as many crypto private investments as all other Fortune 100 companies combined.” A raft of companies, namely those in the financials, consumer and tech sectors, have made headlines about exploring blockchain technology for faster transactions, cost savings, increased security, among other uses. Below is a list of 10 popular publicly-traded firms that have pushed into the emerging space (or at least considered doing so): Bank of America ( BAC ) Meta Platforms ( META ) PayPal ( PYPL ) Nike ( NKE ) Walmart ( WMT ) Visa ( V ) Mastercard ( MA ) JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) Goldman Sachs ( GS ) American Express ( AXP ) More on crypto and blockchain adoption: Malaysian Ministry looks to adopt bitcoin, other cryptos as legal tender Voyager Digital CEO says we're still in the early stages of crypto adoption El Salvador officially makes bitcoin legal tender Brazilian President signs crypto payments bill into law Ethereum Flash Loans: How Equitable DeFi Tech Can Upend Traditional Finance",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3982490-over-half-of-fortune-100-firms-are-betting-on-blockchain-coinbase-finds?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14160834.jpeg

If these signals confirm with a June monthly close, the train might have officially left the station when it comes to the next crypto bull run. BTCUSD Momentum Builds Across Multiple Timeframes Imagine a train that’s come to a complete stop. It’s a lot easier to board a train as it’s idle, and before it has gained momentum. Momentum starts off slow, then once the train really begins rolling it picks up seemingly unstoppable steam. Slowing back down takes force, time, and distance before it once again comes to a stop. Getting in the train’s path can prove dangerous. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $30,000: Is The Bull Run Back On? If Bitcoin price can continue to climb through the end of June, strengthening bullish momentum will confirm across nearly every significant timeframe from the daily to the weekly to the monthly. That is according to the LMACD, which in the chart below shows the following timeframes forming a bullish crossover and buy signal: 1D, 3D, 1W, 2W, 3W, and 1M (clockwise). Such a signal could mean the train has left the station. Bitcoin has reclaimed $30,000 | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Are The Stars Aligning For A Bitcoin Bull Run? Much like when stars align, people expect something special, the majority of important timeframes signaling strengthening momentum could mean like a locomotive, Bitcoin is starting to gain steam. And once that begins, and the train leaves the station, it isn’t quite as easy to get on for a ride. However, it isn’t fully clear if yet if that phase has begun, or if the train has a few more stops before it moves onto its final destination. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers Above Critical Level, Why Bulls Could Be Ready To Charge In contrast, the weekly LMACD crossover could fail and cause the monthly crossover to follow and diverge downward. At that point, things could get dicey for crypto and put lower timeframe bullish crossovers in serious jeopardy. Anyone aboard the train currently would more than likely end up disappointed.

However, the most notable feature for Uniswap (UNI) with the upgrade is increased decentralization. Uniswap pushes towards more decentralization, and it’s timed to the exact moment the SEC is probing centralized exchanges. Also, market trends have shown that the SEC can hardly build up any case against a truly decentralized network. Uwerx is another decentralized platform for freelancers currently on its ICO, and the presale is a unique opportunity to be early. And as the saying goes, “Crypto rewards early adoption.” >> BUY WERX TOKENS NOW Uniswap (UNI) V4 Upgrade Uniswap (UNI) is the earliest decentralized protocol on Ethereum and the blockchain landscape at large, and it has been responsible for some great breakthroughs since its launch such as community governance. Uniswap launched as an innovative decentralized solution for swapping tokens. The protocol recently released its V4 draft, and invites community feedback before the launch goes public. The upgrade will efficiently help to keep the costs connected with transactions as low as possible. The V4 version will include new features, including on-chain limit orders, automatic compounding of liquidity provider (LP) incentives, and dynamic fees. Onchain data shows an address accumulating over 878,336 UNI tokens after the V4 announcement from Uniswap. The accumulated token on the address is worth almost $4 million and supposedly belongs to an algorithmic trading firm, Wintermute Trading. Onchain patterns like this consistently demonstrate privileged information from top whales, and small retailers often look to make some profit off this. UNI tokens have some prospects toward launch, but we believe Uwerx could be a better opportunity for gains as the launch comes close. Uwerx (WERX) With Great Prospects As Launch Approaches Uwerx emerges as a top prospect despite a regulatory crackdown on the market. The new freelance platform is offering its native token on its ICO for cheap to raise funds for its initial roadmap. This allows early buyers to get in with a market advantage towards launch. Presale opportunities are pretty unique as they could return massive profits after launch when the token begins to trade towards its actual value. Uwerx, as a new freelance platform, is proving to be quite valuable to the gig market with its unique features enabled by blockchain integration. Merging value across both industries allows Uwerx to look to massive growth when it launches, and early buyers could be the biggest winners of the exciting price trend ahead. Uwerx recently announced the completion of its alpha test, while the project also locked team tokens to demonstrate the founding team’s commitment to growing the platform and building value for early adopters. Uwerx is building a decentralized freelance economy where WERX will be a huge currency and store of value. The opportunity in this is to get in early on WERX as it trades at $0.041 on Phase 5 presale. Also, claim a 15% bonus on presale when you get in now.

14153615,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539503,1687615634,Stacks (STX) Rallies By 29% In The Past 7 Days – Here’s Why,"The cryptocurrency Stacks (STX) has recently experienced a remarkable turnaround, with its price bouncing back after reaching a multi-month low of $0.4412. Investors have seized the opportunity to “buy the dip,” resulting in a continuous upward trend for STX over the past few days. As a result, STX is now trading at $0.7916, marking a significant 29% increase from its lowest level this month. Potential Catalysts For STX Two primary reasons drive the surge in Stacks’ price. Firstly, the decision by Blackrock to file for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission has sparked positive sentiment. However, uncertainties remain regarding the acceptance of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, as Coinbase is slated to serve as the custodian of the coins. Furthermore, the ongoing conflict between Coinbase and the SEC adds to the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the situation. Related Readings: Bitcoin Just Gained Over 18% In Seven Days: What’s Happened When This Has Occurred In The Past? Furthermore, the SEC’s lawsuit against major exchanges Binance and Coinbase is expected to benefit Bitcoin, as both regulatory agencies recognize Bitcoin as a commodity rather than a security. Consequently, many investors in alternative cryptocurrencies may shift their focus to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Stacks, which is closely tied to Bitcoin’s ecosystem and enables the development of decentralized applications (dApps), stands to benefit from this changing investor sentiment. The expanding Stacks ecosystem is another significant factor contributing to the rise in STX price. Bitflow Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, recently introduced an sBTC/sBTC stableswap pool, enabling seamless token swaps. This development enhances the utility and adoption of Stacks, ultimately bolstering its positive price performance. What’s Next For Stacks? From a technical analysis standpoint, Stacks exhibits promising signals. The daily chart reveals the formation of a bullish falling wedge pattern, indicating a potential trend reversal. STX has also surpassed the 25-day exponential moving average and is currently testing the 50-day MA. Moreover, the breakthrough of the key resistance level at $0.5281, the lowest point in March, further reinforces the bullish sentiment. As buyers set their sights on the next resistance point at $0.90, a potential 9% increase from the current level, Stacks continues to attract attention. Related Readings: Mask Foundation Moves 2.5 Million Tokens To Exchanges, Huge Dip Incoming? The Stacks price is $0.79 at press time, reflecting a change of -2.10% over the past 24 hours. The recent price action has left Stacks’ market capitalization at $1,101,401,654.52. Notably, Stacks has demonstrated an impressive 277.22% change since the beginning of the year, indicating its strong growth potential. STX serves as the native token of the Stacks blockchain, which operates as a layer 2 blockchain network leveraging the security of the Bitcoin blockchain for transaction settlement. With its unique positioning and robust ecosystem, Stacks continues to capture the attention of investors and developers alike.

From November 2022 to June of the current year, BUSD’s market capitalization has plummeted from USD23 billion to USD4 billion. Notably, the capitalization suffered an 18% loss in May alone, as reported by CCData, an analysis company. TrueUSD (TUSD) Gains Traction As BUSD Market Cap Declines As the market capitalization of BUSD continues to decline and reach a critical level, representing less than 5% of the overall stablecoin market capitalization, Binance has begun actively promoting the adoption of TrueUSD (TUSD). While TUSD’s market capitalization still falls slightly below that of BUSD, currently standing at over USD3.1 billion, it has surpassed BUSD in terms of trading volumes. According to data provided by CCData, the trading volumes of TUSD have tripled, indicating a growing interest and usage of the stablecoin. Related Reading: Mask Foundation Moves 2.5 Million Tokens To Exchanges, Huge Dip Incoming? TrueUSD (TUSD), introduced in 2017 by TrustToken, has emerged as the fifth-largest stablecoin in the market, trailing closely behind BUSD. Functioning as an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, TUSD secures its value with dollar reserves deposited in multiple US-based banking entities. The company behind TUSD ensures a 1:1 convertibility with the US currency, instilling confidence in its stability and reliability among users. As BUSD’s market capitalization experiences a significant decline, the growing popularity and trading volumes of TUSD serve as a testament to the increasing demand for an alternative stablecoin option. Also, Binance’s shift towards promoting TUSD suggests a strategic response to the changing landscape of stablecoin usage and market dynamics. The steep decline in BUSD’s market capitalization can be attributed to its impending discontinuation. In February 2023, NewsBTC reported that Paxos would cease issuing the BUSD stablecoin due to an ongoing lawsuit filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As per Paxos’ official statement, BUSD will be redeemable until February 24, 2024, marking the potential date for its exit from the market. Investors Move To USDT As It Nears Its All-Time High Capitalization As the market capitalization of Tether (USDT) continues to rise steadily, approaching its all-time high, investors are taking notice and making strategic moves. According to data from CoinMarketCap, USDT’s current market capitalization stands at $82.9 billion (USD), close to its previous peak of $83.2 billion, reached in May 2022.

14150951,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/traders-attempt-to-short-tusd-following-prime-trust-insolvency,1687607100,Traders Attempt To Short TUSD Following Prime Trust Insolvency,"Traders are attempting to short the TUSD stablecoin amidst reports of the stablecoin issuer’s connection with crypto custodian Prime Trust. The TrueUSD issuer has stated that it does not have any exposure to Prime Trust, having announced earlier in the month that it had stopped mints and redemptions through the crypto custodian. Traders Hedge Their Bets Traders are beginning to bet that the TUSD stablecoin could de-peg, putting the markets in crisis. One trader opened a multi-million short position on the TUSD stablecoin after its issuer stopped mints and redemptions through Prime Trust. A user on Ethereum deposited 7.5 million USDC as collateral on the Aave v2 lending platform. According to the available on-chain data, they then used this collateral to borrow 4 million TUSD and immediately sold these for USDC. Borrowing and then selling immediately is a common tactic used by traders who are looking to take a short position on a specific asset. On Aave v2, traders are paying up to 50% APY to short TUSD, while the TUSD Curve Pool is also showing a similar trend, with its currency reserves reaching 61%. Twitter user Etheraltog also noted that users attempting to redeem TUSD are getting it re-minted into their wallets. TrueUSD Tries To Clear Air Traders are rushing to short the TUSD stablecoin after it emerged that Nevada’s Financial Institutions Division ordered cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust to halt all operations. Nevada’s Financial Institutions Division stated that the custodian’s business had declined to a “critically deficient level” and was in an unsafe and unsound position to conduct business. Furthermore, the withdrawal of BitGo’s offer to purchase Prime Trust added further pressure on the custodian. Representatives from TUSD have stated that the stablecoin is not impacted by the situation unfolding at Prime Trust and that it had no exposure to the embattled custodian. They added that TUSD maintains multiple USD rails for minting and redemption purposes. Prime Trust has been looking to raise millions in emergency funding and had been in talks with a number of potential financiers. Executives at the custodian believed that funding of up to $25 million would be enough to stabilize the balance sheet. A deal with BitGo was announced for an undisclosed amount but was later canceled. Volatility Hits TUSD TUSD is usually a very stable asset. However, recent developments have seen the asset face considerable volatility, with its price falling as low as $0.995 and as high as $1.003. The volatility has also had a significant impact on the loan markets for the TUSD stablecoin, especially on Aave v2. Aave v2 is the largest on-chain lending facility for TUSD. According to data from Parsec, the variable borrow rate for TUSD was over 30%, although it was higher at one point during the day.

The Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF will launch on the Chicago Board Options BZX on Tuesday, June 27. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). The Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) will launch on the Chicago Board Options (CBOE) BXZ Exchange on June 27. BITX Goes Live on June 27 An ETF allows investors to have exposure to a particular product without owning them directly. An ETF bundles securities from which investors can buy shares to gain exposure to that product without owning Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin ETFs take two shapes: Bitcoin spot ETFs and Bitcoin futures ETFs. BITX will be a leveraged ETF. In the case of a leveraged ETF, the fund uses debt or financial derivatives as leverage to increase the return of a benchmark index. A leveraged 2x ETF allows investors to gain exposure to BTC by only putting up 50% of the value of BTC. Bitcoin spot ETFs are funds that track Bitcoin’s value rather than futures contracts. Spot ETFs purchase Bitcoin directly, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without buying, storing, or managing it themselves. BITX’s SEC filing indicates the fund: Seeks investment results that correspond to two times (2x) the return of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index. Bitcoin Breaches $30,000 Amid ETF Filings Bitcoin has reacted positively in response to a string of recent ETF filings. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $30,640, holding firm above the $30,000 threshold. The bitcoin price rose this week after numerous financial industry players announced their intention to create Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced last week that it filed an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. While there is optimism that BlackRock’s ETF application would be the first the get approval, analysis indicates that it would be unlikely in the near term, thanks to the regulatory hurdles posed by the SEC and its chief Gary Gensler. As is the case with any financial product, the approval process for a Bitcoin ETF involves rigorous scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the SEC. BlackRock’s ETF filing triggered a series of ETF filings from several firms, including Valkyrie, WisdomTree and Invesco. The rumour mill also suggests that Fidelity is filing an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The CFTC announced that it had began its 90-day review of KalshiEX LLC's self-certified contracts for betting on which major political party will control Congress after the next election. The CFTC will need to make a decision at the end of the 90 days, or try to extend it.  The regulator also announced a 30-day public comment period, seeking input on 24 different questions about the contracts, including whether they are ""similar to gaming"" as defined by CFTC rules, whether the proposed betting is unlawful, how they compare to previous efforts and more.  The CFTC announced a public meeting last week, set to take place on June 26, which was intended to let the regulator decide whether to commence its review. Another press release Friday announced it was canceled.  Kalshi hinted last year that the CFTC would approve its political event contracts in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections in the U.S., though staff later recommended rejecting the contracts, Bloomberg reported. Kalshi later withdrew its proposal before refiling in an effort to address regulator concerns.  CFTC Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Caroline Pham both dissented from the decision to launch a new review period on Friday. Mersinger argued that Kalshi had been operating in good faith to address the regulator's concerns, and that launching another comment period would delay any resolution.  Moreover, Kalsh's self-certified contracts do not fall into any definition of ""gaming"" for the CFTC's purposes, Mersinger said.  ""The Commission should treat Kalshi’s certification in the same manner it treats all DCM [designated contract market] certifications of new products, and then do what Congress provided: Undertake a public rulemaking process to establish a legal framework for exercising its discretion to determine whether event contracts, including those relating to political control, may be prohibited from trading because they are contrary to the public interest,"" she said.  Pham's dissent pointed to an appeals court ruling on another prediction market, PredictIt, which the CFTC ordered shut down last year. After PredictIt sued, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered PredictIt be allowed to continue operating until around two months after a court ruled on the underlying lawsuit.  If the CFTC were to try and suspend Kalshi's political event contracts, that might violate the appeals court order, Pham said.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/24/cftc-kicks-off-review-of-kalshis-congressional-control-prediction-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cf6d5a3ada20c376051ec9efbc9bd8be91cef57-1980x1020.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following this launch, GODS, the native token of the Gods Unchained ecosystem, has rallied 50% from June 2023 lows, expanding in line with the broader cryptocurrency markets spearheaded by Bitcoin, which is currently trading above $31,000. Gods Unchained launches on Epic Games Store The game recently announced its debut on Epic Games Store, a digital gaming distribution platform with over 230 million PC gamers, including a community of digital trading card enthusiasts. As one of the original web3 games, Gods Unchained has been at the forefront of decentralized gaming. Now, intending to attract more mainstream trading card game and strategy gamers, Gods Unchained is undergoing an update, with an updated logo and updated visuals across different points, which would launch with the Epic Games Store release. Related Reading: MATIC Price Recovery Hits Roadblock, When Will Bulls Break Through? The PC game also teased a mobile-friendly design focused on onboarding new users. In a comment about the launch Daniel Paez, the executive producer of Gods Unchained, said EGS will introduce the web3 game to a “massive audience of traditional PC gamers and TCG enthusiasts.” Blockchain gaming, NFT activity recovering The deployment on EGS is timely. Specifically, it is when the cryptocurrency market is recovering after months of lower lows in 2022. During the last bear cycle, cryptocurrency prices crashed from 2021 peaks, impacting activity. Out of this, there was a significant contraction in non-fungible tokens (NFT) activity, which translated to low activity. In the Gods Unchained blockchain games, all trading cards are represented as unique NFTs. These represent ownership and can be transferred between users, even exchanged for cash or other cryptocurrencies. Since trading cards vary in rarity, the value assigned to each can change. According to DappRadar, unique active wallets (UAWs) remain stable at around 1,150 but lower than 2021 peaks when it spiked to over 4,000. At the same time, Gods Unchained generated over $745,000 in active transaction values. At the moment, GODS, the native token of the Gods Unchained game, is rising in sync with the broader cryptocurrency market. GODS is trading at $0.16, up 50% from June lows. GODSUSDT Candlestick arrangement shows that the token is bottoming up after dropping 75% from February 2023 highs. Last year, Immutable Studio, the developer of Gods Unchained, had to let go of multiple employees, including a senior game designer James Wakeham. These restructuring efforts resulted in a 6% reduction in the company’s workforce, yet, Immutable Games remained optimistic about its future.
