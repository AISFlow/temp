42395927,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzzy2,1646263927,First Mover Asia: India Commodity Price Increase Stemming From Russia Invasion Could Hurt Crypto Investment; Bitcoin Loses Momentum,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Markets: Bitcoin's price slips after the powerful rally earlier in the week appeared to stall.  Insights: Russia-Ukraine war starts to affect Asian economies in ways that could ripple through the crypto industry.  Technician's take: BTC downside could persist into the Asia trading day.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  And please sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,835 -0.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,944 -0.1%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM +4.5% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL +3.3% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +2.2% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Algorand ALGO −3.1% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM −1.9% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin Cash BCH −1.8% Currency  The powerful price rally witnessed in bitcoin earlier this week appeared to stall on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed the U.S. central bank's plan to raise interest rates this month for the first time since 2018.  ""Continued uncertainty about the proposed U.S. Fed rate hikes in March and growing tensions in Eastern Europe plagued the market for most of February, though prices rebounded at the month’s end,"" the crypto exchange Kraken wrote Wednesday in an emailed report.  Katie Stockton at Fairlead Strategies sees prices potentially headed higher, toward the $50,000.  ""Our short-term gauges are pointing higher, but risk is heightened in this environment,"" Stockton wrote Wednesday in an email.  The sad saga of the war in Eastern Europe seemed likely to worsen in the days ahead, if not beyond, as Russia escalated its rocket attacks on major Ukraine cities, a 40-mile military convoy barreled toward the capital city Kyiv and Ukrainians continued a desperate and increasingly resourceful defense of the country.  Wednesday also saw the United Nations General Assembly vote overwhelmingly to condemn Russia's unprovoked attack, with 141 member countries voting in favor of the resolution and just five, including Russia, voting against it. China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam and India were among 35 countries that abstained.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was roughly flat over the previous 24 hours, just below $44,000. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was also about where it stood a day ago. Most major cryptos were off slightly.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,386 +1.8%  DJIA: 33,891 +1.7%  Nasdaq: 13,752 +1.6%  Gold: $1,927 -0.9%  Insights  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is still in its early days, but it is already starting to affect Asian economies in ways that will likely ripple through the crypto industry.  Commodity prices rose in India, which is one of the biggest importers of Ukrainian sunflower oil. An increase in commodity prices could eat into Indian investors’ skyrocketing appetite for cryptocurrencies. India remains one of the world’s largest crypto markets in the world thanks to a young populace and rising disposable incomes. Some 20 million Indians signed up for trading accounts in 2021, according to a January Economic Times story. CoinSwitch Kuber, India's largest crypto exchange, saw a 3,500% rise in transaction volumes and reached 14 million users recently.  The country, which relies on Russia for about half its arms and other military equipment, has been cagey in its response to the attack. It was one of just 35 countries on Wednesday to abstain in a U.N. General Assembly vote to condemn the Russian action. (Five countries, including Russia, voted against the resolution.) Last week, a number of officials even suggested they might help Russia bypass sanctions by establishing rupee accounts for executing trade transactions.  China, Pakistan and Vietnam, another large importer of Russian military hardware, also abstained eight years ago in a vote condemning Russia's annexation of Crimea, which some Russia experts have said foreshadowed its Ukraine goals.  Elsewhere, Taiwan's native dollar saw further suppression from traders as markets weighed the possibility of China, emboldened by Russia's attack, ratcheting up its military presence around the island.  In Malaysia, crypto exchange Binance announced a strategic investment in local exchange MX Global, one of the four recognized market operator-digital asset exchanges that received full approval by the Securities Commission Malaysia in July 2021. Malaysia’s crypto market is in its early stages but it is also growing, with local startups like analytics service CoinGecko becoming some of the most-used crypto service providers tools in recent years.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Fades From Resistance; Support at $40K  Bitcoin (BTC) struggled to break above the $44,000 resistance level as overbought conditions appeared on the charts. Momentum is starting to slow, which could point to a deeper pullback into the Asia trading day.  Still, buyers could remain active at lower support levels, particularly at $40,000. At that point, the pullback could stabilize on intraday charts.  On the daily chart, there is stronger resistance at $46,000, which capped the price rally in early February. Buyers will need to make a decisive break above resistance in order to reverse the three-month long downtrend.  Most indicators are neutral, although there has been a loss of downside momentum on the weekly chart, which could be a positive development this month.

A particular focus of the probe are fractional NFTs, in which a token is broken down into many units that are sold separately, according to the sources.  SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known affectionately as “Crypto Mom” for her pro-crypto views, told CoinDesk TV in December that the SEC might soon be taking a closer look at NFTs.  “Given the breadth of the NFT landscape, certain pieces of it might fall within our jurisdiction,” Peirce said. “People need to be thinking about potential places where NFTs might run into the securities regulatory regime.”  SEC chief Gary Gensler has previously said that he believes many crypto tokens are likely securities that should fall under the purview of the SEC.

After suffering three long months of red closes, bitcoin has finally recorded its first green month. This is attributed to the rally that began at the end of the month. However, this is not the first time that the digital asset would mark such a trend and past performance helps to speak to what can be expected from here from the cryptocurrency. 1st Green Month Close For Bitcoin Since hitting its peak in November, bitcoin has consistently closed the following three months in the red. It continued to struggle in this pattern until a late February rally broke and saw it close in the green once more. This marks the first green close after three red closes.

42421855,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSXl,1646260294,How to Use the Strike Mobile Payment App,"Strike is a mobile payment application like Cash App or PayPal with one caveat: Instead of using the traditional payment rails, it uses the Bitcoin blockchain to send and receive money.  It is developed by Zap Solutions, a Chicago-based fintech startup led by entrepreneur Jack Mallers, known for his idiosyncratic TV appearances. The company launched its mobile application in 2020 for U.S. users and plans to expand globally, focusing on emerging regions such as Latin America.  The firm’s goal is to disrupt pricey global transactions and remittances and provide a cheap way to send money across borders by cutting out all the middlemen by using the Bitcoin protocol as a payment rail. As Strike CEO Mallers said at the launch in Argentina, “Bitcoin is the first and only monetary network in human history that works everywhere and is open to everyone. It functions in New York, San Salvador and Buenos Aires equally.”  Strike further boosted El Salvador, the first country to make bitcoin legal tender, as a bitcoin hotbed when it launched in the country in early 2021. Twitter also partnered with Strike to implement Twitter Tips, which lets users send bitcoin micropayments on the social media platform.  How does Strike work?  Strike leverages the Bitcoin blockchain’s secondary layer called Lightning Network to send and receive money instantly. The Lightning Network allows users to sidestep Bitcoin’s blockchain to execute transactions by grouping them together and reconciling them later in a batch, rather than as single transactions. This way, the main blockchain does not get clogged, and there is no need to wait for the time-consuming settlement process on the main blockchain that can take up to an hour.  Read more: What Is Blockchain Technology?  As Strike does not charge extra fees on payments executed on the Lightning Network, it is ideal for sending small amounts of money or for frequent transactions. It also makes it possible to “stream” money in real time by sending a series of micropayments.  Strike's vision is to be a borderless system for sending money from one country to another that is cheaper and faster than bank transactions or solutions such as Western Union that charge hefty fees.  Currently, Strike’s access is limited to residents of a few countries. As of March 2022, the app is available in:  United States  El Salvador  Argentina  Even within the U.S., the app is not available in every state. Users based in New York and Hawaii cannot access the mobile app.  The company has plans to expand globally. When it launched in Argentina in early 2022, the company said in a statement that it will launch in more countries throughout the year, with a focus on Brazil, Colombia and other Latin American markets, with plans for other regions throughout the world following that.  It’s important to note that users in Argentina cannot buy, hold and send bitcoin as of March 2022. The app only supports the USDT stablecoin, Tether, a digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, but local users cannot convert their local currency, the Argentine peso, to USDT in the app.  How to open and fund an account  First, you have to download the Strike mobile app from the App Store for iOS or Google Play for Android. There’s a desktop version that you can download from the Chrome Web Store, too.  You can open a Strike account by submitting your email address, phone number and full name.  First, submit your email address. You will receive an email with a verification code.  Then submit your phone number on the next screen. Again, you will receive a code via text message to verify the phone number is yours.  Then submit the country of residency (U.S., El Salvador and Argentina are the only available options) and your full name as it appears on your ID.  If you want to send or store more than $1,000 on your account, you will need to add more personal information, such as your address and social security number. This is required by regulators to comply with know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules.  How to send fiat currency with Strike  Strike lets you send fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.  First, link your bank account or debit card to your account to fund your account.  Add your debit card or bank account details. Strike uses Plaid to connect with your bank.  Once it’s connected, you type the amount of money you want to send and there you go.  How to buy and send bitcoin with Strike  Strike lets you buy and send bitcoin directly from the app. There are two options to do that:  If you already have a bitcoin wallet, you can connect it to Strike just like your debit card or bank account by scanning the bitcoin wallet QR code.  Buy and send bitcoin directly within the app. In this case, you'll have a crypto wallethttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/zap-bitcoin-lightning-wallet/id1406311960 with Strike, which has a custody partner (Prime Trust) to store and keep your bitcoins safe. Bitcoin holdings are not protected by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) deposit insurance protection.  Read more: What Is Crypto Custody?  What else you can do with Strike?  Recurring purchases for dollar-cost averaging  You can use the app for dollar-cost averaging, an investment strategy to regularly buy small amounts of an asset over a period of time. To set it up in the app, you have to go to the “BTC” tab, click on “Buy,” type in the U.S. dollar amount of bitcoin that you want to buy on a recurring basis and select ""Frequency"" to set the time period. It can be any increment of time, from hourly purchases to daily or weekly, that suits your investment goals.  This feature is available only to U.S. users who have further verified their account by providing identity documents.  Pay me in bitcoin  You can convert a portion of your paycheck into bitcoin automatically. Go to ""Profile"" at the bottom right of the app and click on ""Direct Deposit."" From there, you can view your direct deposit details and configure your USD/BTC percentage.  Cash back  Users can earn rewards and rebates when they pay for selected goods and services with Strike. But the selection of merchants is rather limited compared to most credit cards. To earn cashback, scan a QR code and confirm the payment.  Here's a list of some of the merchants that have partnered with Strike:  BitcoinShirt.co, a bitcoin-only online apparel store (5% cash back).  Bitrefill, offering 4,000 gift cards for businesses from Airbnb to Uber. (5% cash back).  CryptoCloaks, a bitcoin-only online shop (5% cash back).  Lightnite, a video game powered by the Lightning Network that allows you to spend and earn bitcoin inside of the game (15% cash back).  Strike API  Strike API lets merchants, businesses and marketplaces integrate Strike as a payment processor to their website. This is what Twitter uses for its bitcoin tipping.  The company is working on expanding into various emerging markets and rolling out a range of new services. Its plans include providing contactless payment solutions to merchants, issuing debit cards in partnership with Visa and expanding its cashback offering.  Fees and taxes  Sending and receiving money with Strike is free, but it incurs an on-chain transaction fee, which is the cost to use the Bitcoin blockchain. The base fee per transaction on the Lightning Network is the smallest unit of bitcoin, 1 satoshi, which is four-one hundreds of a cent as of writing, which is infinitesimally smaller than bank transactions.  Sending and receiving fiat currency does not incur taxes. On the other hand, if you use Strike to buy bitcoin and later sell it at a profit, you’ll owe capital gains taxes.  Read more: U.S. Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Pros of Strike:  Practically instant transactions.  Deposits are insured by the FDIC (For U.S. users). This means your cash deposit is protected up to $250,000 from theft or the company’s bankruptcy.  Lower cross-border transaction fees than traditional wire transfer or remittance services.  Cons of Strike:  Limited availability (currently in Argentina, El Salvador and the U.S. except New York and Hawaii).  Limited functions (cannot buy bitcoin in Argentina).  Bitcoin holdings are not insured by FDIC.  Hard to find information on their web site about topics such as cashback partners, for example.

According to a press release published Wednesday by former ConsenSys AG employee Arthur Falls, “a group of thirty-five former employees representing more than 50% of all known ConsenSys AG (CAG) shareholders filed a request for a special audit” regarding an August 2020 transfer of assets between ConSensys AG and ConSensys Software Inc.  “We’ve filed to have a court assess the transaction, and if the court deems it necessary, they will appoint an independent auditor to provide further scrutiny,” Falls told CoinDesk in an interview.  As first reported by CoinDesk in November, a number of ConsenSys AG shareholders allege that multiple assets were mispriced during the transaction.  Read more: ConsenSys AG Shareholders Readying Legal Action Over Share Valuation  According to valuation documents prepared by global accounting firm PwC and viewed by CoinDesk, key assets such as MetaMask were valued as low as $4.4 million for the purposes of the transaction. Banking giant JPMorgan also took a 10% stake in ConsenSys Software as part of the deal.  Additionally, the transaction transferred a $39 million personal debt burden owed to ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin from ConsenSys AG to ConsenSys Software.  ConsenSys has been on a fundraising tear, raising $200 million at a $3 billion valuation in November and $65 million at an undisclosed valuation in April. MetaMask – the gateway for many to Web 3 – and Infura – the developer platform that powers many Web 3 applications – are widely seen as the firm’s crown jewels.  Read more: ConsenSys Holds Funding Round Talks With $3B Valuation  Diana Richter, head of marketing and brand at ConsenSys Mesh (also known as ConsenSys AG), said that Mesh “refutes the allegations underlying the legal action as well as those contained in the factually inaccurate press release.”  “The business fundamentals and operating environment are entirely different today than at the time of the transaction, though the group would like to apply a valuation that might be achieved today to a set of projects that were pre-monetization during the darkest days of COVID when the transaction took place,” Richter said.  A ConsenSys spokesperson also characterized the allegations as an attempt to “litigate matters in the media because there is no viable legal strategy,” and said that the group represents less than 50% of the total individual shareholders and an estimated 12% of the shares outstanding.  Falls estimates that it will take three months for the Swiss courts to assess the transaction and appoint an auditor, and he told CoinDesk that the group is prepared to immediately file further actions pending the auditor’s response.  “We’re pretty confident about the case and what the audit will find,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/consensys-ag-shareholders-file-for-independent-audit-of-metamask-infura-transaction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b59bef3c76355a677e4fcd3d0ebe33f0218d8c0-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the central bank is on track to start raising interest rates this month. ""So far, we've seen energy prices move up further and those increases will move through the economy and push up headline inflation, and also they're going to weigh on spending,"" Powell said during his testimony before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee.  The Thomson Reuters Core Commodity Index is up 30% over the past six months, retracing roughly 50% of its decade-long downturn. Further, the price of WTI crude oil has risen by 20% over the past week and reached a decade high above $100 per barrel. The surge in commodity prices could point to slower economic growth and greater market volatility.  Meanwhile, Russia continued to mount missile strikes on Ukraine and to advance its troops on Ukraine despite ongoing negotiations. So far, talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials have not led to a ceasefire.  In crypto markets, BTC spot trading volume is starting to decline from the Feb. 24 spike. The ratio of buy-to-sell volume has been neutral.  Still, some indicators have shown a greater capacity to spend among bitcoin traders, which could trigger an increase in buying volume.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $43819, −0.32%    ●Ether (ETH): $2949, −0.34%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4387, +1.86%    ●Gold: $1929 per troy ounce, −0.71%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.86%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Stablecoin buying power  Analysts are monitoring signs of potential buying power among crypto traders, which could lead to a rise in BTC's price.  In down markets, crypto traders typically increase their holdings of stablecoins relative to bitcoin. Stablecoins are a proxy for traditional dollars in crypto markets, and are often used as a vehicle for entering and exiting bitcoin positions.  Theoretically, a decline in the stablecoin supply relative to the total bitcoin supply could eventually reach a turning point, assuming that traders are comfortable with buying on price dips.  The chart below shows the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR). The ratio is adjusted to demonstrate when levels have reached an extreme, which typically coincides with peaks and troughs in price. Currently, the SSR is not at an extreme low but has risen with price over the past week. That could point to ""the increased potential to push the price of bitcoin higher,"" according to Glassnode.  Still, it remains to be seen whether SSR is a leading or lagging indicator, which means a trader's decision to hold stablecoins or bitcoin could be sensitive to sudden price changes.  Altcoin roundup  Terra’s LUNA passes ether to become second-largest staked asset: A price surge in Terra’s LUNA token over the past week has made it the second-largest staked asset among all major cryptocurrencies in total value staked. LUNA surpassed ether (ETH), which has just over $28 billion in staked value at the time of writing.

42410906,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtG1D,1646253292,Snoop Dogg's NFT Mixtape Invites Remixes. Does It Authorize Them?,"Fresh from acquiring a majority stake in Death Row Records, the label that made him a star, Snoop Dogg has released a set of songs on the NFT marketplace OpenSea – a marketing play based around rights and remixes.  The first new song, “High,” exists as part of a non-fungible token collection called “Dogg on it: Death Row Mixtape Vol. 1” – four distinct audio files, each attached to an image of an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The first contains the vocal track for “High,” sans instrumental track, in an edition of 420 tokens; the second is just the instrumental, in an edition of 500; the third is the instrumental and hook without the verses, in an edition of 250; and the fourth, with 500 editions, is the complete song.  The description for these NFTs reads, “Own it. Remix it. Master it.”  That second imperative is the key to the whole conceit. In releasing the song sections (stems) as NFTs, Snoop – or, more likely, some dedicated NFT consultant (perhaps whoever it was that orchestrated the rapper’s NFT influencer cosplay this past autumn) – is inviting purchasers to put out their own remixes for the track.  “You buy it. You own the rights to it all. Buy the Snoop Dogg beat? Make your own track. 👊🏿👊🏿💫🔥🔥🔥,” reads a post on Snoop’s Twitter account.  The second new Snoop Dogg track, “Feel the Rhythm,” is billed as a collaboration with Mutant Ape #23446 (Mutant Apes are a spin-off of the Bored Ape collection), which appears to be owned by Snoop’s team.  In a collection entitled “Death Row EDM Vol. 1,” you can find one NFT for the instrumental, one for the a cappella, and another for the full track.  Snoop is presenting each of these collections as mixtapes, and has been slowly populating them with NFTs over the past 24 hours.  “Dogg on it: Death Row Mixtape Vol. 1” now includes songs called “My Ape,” and “Wake Up N Workout,” along with several scattered voice memos, all released as NFTs.  An acquired taste  The actual songs are sort of bewildering, lyrically. Snoop’s rhymes have always been known for their emphasis on lighthearted jokes and stoner puns, but here the Long Beach, Calif., rapper adds wonky crypto phraseology into the mix.  “I wasn't gonna do it at first,” he warns at the start of “High,” before clarifying things with an addendum: “I wasn’t gonna come to the metaverse.”  Over a boilerplate beat (it almost sounds royalty-free), Snoop goes on to name-check OpenSea itself, making several references to Bored Ape NFTs.  Here’s a sampling of the choicest rhymes:  “Smoke on, locs on, everybody’s in the place/On the case, in your face, [expletive] we Bored Apes”  “I slid up on her and she handed me her vape/She said she’d rather spend time with Bored Ape”  “Oh boy, OpenSea, so G!”  Also, let the record reflect that OpenSea is a terrible platform for listening to music. Trying to skip through these tracks often ends up playing the song again, on top of the one that’s already playing.  But more interesting than the songs themselves are the questions they raise about digital ownership.  Still Snoop Dogg and NFT  Snoop has said he wants Death Row to become a “metaverse label,” releasing NFTs and other crypto projects tied to the music it releases. To some, the move feels like a lazy cash grab. (“Eazy E won,” quipped one commentator, referencing the late rapper’s beef with Death Row in the 1990s).  If Snoop owns his masters, and he’s already paid off what few collaborators he worked with on these two tracks, he’s theoretically in a position to give away 100% of the rights online. (That’s why Royal, a company that sells royalties to songs as NFTs, only works with artists who own their masters. Legally, it’s simpler.) Which is to say, purchasers would be authorized to monetize the remixes they produce.  Of course, an NFT doesn’t grant any legal ownership in and of itself. There’s nothing in OpenSea’s terms of service about conferring the right to remix a song via purchases. You’ll need a real contract for that – something specifying that the controller of wallet ABC will legally own the rights to the music featured in NFT XYZ – and so far, Death Row hasn’t publicly produced one.  What purchasers get depends entirely on that hypothetical contract, said Olta Andoni, an attorney specializing in NFTs. In this case, the document would need to specify that remixes are within bounds. “I would not think it would make sense if it didn’t include monetization rights,” she said.  Right now, the NFTs for these two Snoop Dogg songs represent a promise of legal ownership, rather than the ownership itself. All you’re getting with your purchase are the tokens.  And perhaps the bragging rights.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION | SPONSORED,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/02/snoop-doggs-nft-mixtape-invites-remixes-does-it-authorize-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/567589c70fe3ccb565e739fa61fdb42292548d47-1440x955.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417123,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6hJ7,1646251297,Review of 6 Crypto Tax Software Packages,"Pull a Marty McFly and beam back to 2018 – the term “crypto” is a byword for “scam” and economist Nouriel Roubini is triumphantly calling the crypto space “La-la land.” Fast forward to 2021 and the L.A. Lakers’ basketball arena has been renamed “Crypto.com Arena,” National Football League legend Tom Brady is trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and El Salvador has made bitcoin (BTC) a legal tender.  Much of the media attention is going to the metaverse, all-time price highs and DOGE with the future of finance is being pushed on all sides. But perhaps the most archaic part of finance is getting a 21st-century makeover, as well. That dinosaur is called the tax industry.  Stephan Roth is a London-based financial journalist who has reported on cryptocurrency since 2018. He has previously worked for KPMG, CNNMoney and ACCOINTING. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  In recent times, the tax industry has made strides in its attempt to understand the industry and flesh out the nitty-gritty tax details that come with a brand-new asset class. However, filing crypto-related taxes can still be an arduous task, with a variety of different forms, calculations and recording of transactions.  That said, a host of young, innovative and ambitious crypto tax companies have risen to the occasion – ready to reduce your tax-related stress before deadline day.  See also: NFTs Are the Latest Crypto Tax Events Nobody Understands  I’ve spent some time going through each company, speaking to key people, analyzing the prices of their products, the number of applications available and using their user interfaces. Here’s what I found.  Accointing.com  The bitcoin bug bit Dennis Wohlfarth in 2014 when he was working in Italy as a mechanical engineer servicing Ferrari. Three years later, a group of founders hailing from Germany, Switzerland and the United States fleshed out the blueprint for Accointing.com, and they subsequently launched the company in 2019.  With a European vibe, Accointing offers crypto tax reporting solutions for Australia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K. and U.S., ranging between $79 and $299 (plus a free tax report), as well as a portfolio-tracking app and desktop solution. Included in its offerings is a product called Trading Tax Optimizer, which can help users optimize their taxes through tax-loss harvesting and analytics.  Earlier this year, the startup partnered with Swiss-based audit giant BDO Global, bolstering its brand as well as cementing a key traditional tax partner in Europe. “We want our team to bring in their personal touch … so we can expand our tax solutions in Europe and then to the APAC (Asia-Pacific). We want to expand our blockchain connections, NFT and decentralized finance (DeFi) tax support [and] our portfolio features,” Wohlfarth says.  CoinTracker  Kickstarted in 2017, CoinTracker is the brainchild of former Google employees Jon Lerner and Chandan Lodha, who have embraced an “engineering-driven culture” and who turned CoinTracker into a unicorn this January, when CoinTracker announced an exclusive partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase, embedding its software directly within Coinbase’s tax center.  Read More:Crypto Tax Prep Business Booms as Trading Surges and IRS Tightens Screws  “We want to be the layer that helps people interact with crypto and not give them headaches in relation to compliance matters,"" said Shehan Chandrasekara, CoinTracker’s head of tax  CoinTracker offers four types of tax solutions covering Australia, Canada, the U.K. and U.S. – with tax packages ranging from a free tax report and paid options ranging from $49 to a $159 package. It also provides an “Unlimited” solution that is priced individually.  Another strong suit is the company’s enterprise solution, with the “biggest players” in the market looking to do business with CoinTracker.  Rounding up its offerings is a portfolio tracker that provides exclusive insights into a user’s holdings and allows the user to tax-loss harvest and track NFTs and DeFi transactions.  This year is going to be big for CoinTracker, Chandrasekara said. “We will continue to hire aggressively and listen to our users. We expect to reach 1 million-plus users on the platform during [this] tax season,” he said.  CoinLedger  CoinLedger – formerly CryptoTrader.Tax – was born of necessity in 2017 because David Kemmerer, Mitchel Cookson and Lucas Wyland were looking to report “over 120,000” trades made through arbitrage investing. “We were pretty frantic,” Kemmerer, the CEO, says. ""There was nowhere to report our taxes, so we had to fix the problem ourselves.”  Tasked with figuring out how to report its own holdings, CoinLedger had to develop the “picks and shovels” for its tax tool, releasing the first version of its tax platform in spring 2018.  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Since then, CoinLedger has built a tax tool offering geared toward the U.S. market, allowing users to tax-loss harvest and benefit from its TaxAct feature – helping users navigate tax season. Prices per tax offering range from $49 to $299, with the most expensive solution allowing reporting for an unlimited number of transactions. It also offers a business-to-business (B2B) solution, helping certified public accountants (CPAs) serve their personal clients.  Back in December CoinLedger partnered with crypto broker and portfolio tracker Voyager, and in 2022, it is looking to launch NFT tracking for its portfolio and release more portfolio tools for its free portfolio-tracking solution. “We want to reduce the friction for participating in crypto, so we’re focusing on our analytics reporting and making sure we get the data right,” Kemmerer said.  TaxBit  Starting out in their parents’ basement, Austin Woodward and his brother Justin Woodward founded TaxBit. The brothers quickly realized the tax burden crypto traders could face following the crash in 2017. “They realized that there was no way this industry [crypto taxes] could go mainstream and be compliant unless people could accurately track their investment,” said Michelle O’Connor, the company’s vice president of marketing.  From its humble beginnings, TaxBit launched in 2018 and has since won an exclusive partnership with the Internal Revenue Service (in May 2021) and achieved unicorn status three months later in August.  TaxBit offers tax services for individuals ranging from a free offering to paid offerings ranging between $50 and $500. It also provides enterprise and government solutions, helping both companies and regulatory bodies remain tax compliant, assisting them to better understand the crypto space. It also offers a portfolio-tracker app, providing key insights into users' holdings as well as the TaxBit network, where users of member companies can access free tax forms. And it looks to “gamify” crypto taxes through its tax optimization feature and its one-of-a-kind NFT dashboard and tracking service.  “[In 2022] we’re going to continue to iterate on DeFi and NFTs, we’ve had a tranche of partnerships that are ready to launch, and we will also focus on our public sector,” O’Connor said.  TokenTax  TokenTax CEO Zac McClure’s life is pretty “eclectic.” Starting off at JPMorgan, he found himself teaching math for Teach for America before embarking on a journey to Zimbabwe to help locals there learn more about personal finance. Following a stint at Imprint Capital where he wrote the firm's investment thesis for Ripple, McClure said, “I fell in love with crypto and I had a finance and accounting background, then markets exploded [in 2017] and friends everywhere asked for my help to figure out their taxes.”  Come 2017, TokenTax was operational for retail investors, and it now offers four crypto tax report plans, covering Australia, Canada and the U.S. with prices ranging from $65 to a $3,500 VIP package offering IRS audit assistance. It also offers specific services for margin trading and tax-loss harvesting.  See also: Crypto Tax Compliance Remains IRS Minefield  “We are expensive, but we solve the most difficult problems. If the other software doesn’t work for you, you go to TokenTax,” McClure said. TokenTax has also been active in its collaborations, joining forces with eToro, Binance and Crypto.com. Staying true to his teaching roots McClure said, “[In 2022] we want to expand our wallet integrations, teach people about taxes and take some of the tax stress off people’s shoulders.”  ZenLedger  Pat Larsen, ZenLedger’s CEO might be as ""stars and stripes"" as it gets. Serving in the military as a helicopter pilot and with two tours of duty under his belt, Larsen got an MBA from the University of Chicago before becoming an investment banker. Noting that the nascent crypto industry would require traders to pay taxes, Larsen said that he believes that “the point of tax services is to take you from a state of stress to a state of calm. It’s to get the numbers right.” Hence the name ZenLedger.  Current U.S.-focused tax offerings include a free tax reporter for up to 25 transactions and products that cost $49 to $399. The company also provides specific NFT and DeFi support with professionally prepared tax plans that range in price from $195 to a $6,500 two-year tax plan. Additionally, a tax-loss harvesting tool is available for users as well as a direct Turbo Tax integration. Partnerships include one with digital asset management company Valkyrie and eToro.  When asked why people should pay crypto taxes, Larsen said: “If you are a U.S. citizen, you should avoid being a felon. The sheriff will come and have a gun on his hip.” In terms of ZenLedger’s outlook for 2022, Larsen said, “We want all hands on-deck and what we built is a powerful offering. The pace of development will also accelerate.”  Aiming to turn the lethargic traditional tax industry on its head, these young guns have taken it into their hands to do the hard thinking for you. Whether that be figuring out how to track coin transactions across DeFi platforms, understanding how to tax NFTs or how to automate tax reporting – the crypto tax tool industry has had to wrap its head around some of the biggest challenges that have come with the rise of crypto.  At the end of the day, hate them or love them, you’re going to have to pay your taxes. No matter if you’re coding solidity at Ethereum or playing with that 100 times leverage on Binance’s margin trading platform – government regulators will be looking to tax your crypto transactions. So, give these tax companies a few minutes of your time and avoid a sticky situation on tax deadline day!

42423736,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2et3h,1646248311,Polymer’s $3.6M in Seed Funding Says IBC Is the Future of Crypto,"From Ethereum and Solana to Tezos and Avalanche, the past few years have seen the proliferation of dozens of blockchains, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and core use cases.  Against this backdrop, Polymer Labs has emerged from stealth with $3.6 million in seed funding to build out infrastructure for a multi-chain future. The round, which was co-led by Distributed Global and North Island Ventures, was also joined by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG).  Polymer Labs’ infrastructure is built to expand the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol, a standard originally developed for the Cosmos ecosystem to provide a way for different blockchains to easily communicate with each other. Typically, an app built on one blockchain is incompatible with other chains – requiring accident-prone, tedious-to-implement “bridges” to connect information from one ecosystem to another.  Cosmos introduced a partial solution to this problem with IBC, providing a uniform set of blockchain-building standards that make it easy for assets and applications to seamlessly move across IBC-enabled chains.  Polymer Labs is facing the reality that not all chains are built to IBC standards, and its routing and rollup protocol, Polymer, aims to make it easier for non-IBC blockchains to interact with chains based on IBC.  “We spent a lot of time surveying the ecosystem and the different interoperability projects and different solutions,” co-founder Peter Kim told CoinDesk in an interview. “What we've found is that Cosmos’s documentation, and the IBC specification that Tendermint [now Ignite] built so far, have been some of the most robust that we’ve seen.”  Growth on Cosmos  By Cosmos’ own count, Cosmos hosts 28 different IBC-enabled blockchains with a combined market cap of $73 billion.  A bulk of crypto activity still takes place on non-IBC chains like Ethereum and Solana, but Polymer’s infrastructure should make it easier for apps on these chains to interact with IBC-enabled chains like Terra and Osmosis.  Polymer is still in its early days and does not yet have a token, but development will eventually be governed by PolymerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that will allow token-holders to vote on proposals determining the future of the protocol. According to a press release from the company, PolymerDAO will be the first DAO focused on IBC infrastructure.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | SPONSORED,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/polymers-36m-in-seed-funding-says-ibc-is-the-future-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/615929b2afab262c5a772aa0406b4915848bfd2d-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421657,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotbB,1646248201,Bitcoiners Were Right: Weaponized Finance Just Created a Post-Dollar Planet,"Vladimir Putin’s Russia is facing a wave of truly unprecedented financial sanctions in retaliation for its widely scorned invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions have suddenly revealed the massive power that lay dormant in the unified global banking system for decades. But it likely also marks the beginning of that power’s end, and the dawn of something more fragmented.  Russia’s dependence on systems like SWIFT bank messaging, correspondent banking and ApplePay is a product of the global dominance of a unified market-capitalist status quo. This status quo represents the neoliberal “End of History” that was widely presumed to have arrived with the fall of the Soviet Union. But there may be no better sign of the end of the End of History than the weaponization of finance happening right now.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The scope of sanctions hitting Russia over the last week has showcased the incredible web of nested cross-border interdependencies that make up the fabric of essentially every contemporary society – and their ultimate fragility. Some Russian banks have been disconnected from the SWIFT messaging system crucial to international transfers. Shares in one of Russia’s largest banks collapsed 95% on the London Stock Exchange. The ruble has declined by roughly 50% against the dollar in just a week, a body blow to the Russian economy that would have long-lasting effects even if it is a short term dip – which it won’t be.  Trade restrictions are looking just as devastating. Taiwan has said it will halt semiconductor exports to Russia. Industry observers believe the Russian commercial airfleet, made up largely of Boeing and Airbus planes, is two to three weeks away from complete shutdown because of an embargo on parts. Apple Pay and other consumer payments services have been cut off for some customers, reportedly causing disruptions including slowdowns in Moscow’s subway system.  The total impact reaches down into the very guts of Russian society. It was seemingly not much of an exaggeration, then, when France’s finance minister promised on Tuesday, March 1 that “We are going to cause the collapse of the Russian economy.”  See also: Apolitical Crypto Networks in Times of Sanction and War  All of this should be considered in a longer historical context – until recently, such opportunities for disruption simply didn’t exist. SWIFT was not created until 1978. As recently as the middle of the 20th century, international banking still regularly involved shipping large amounts of gold around on boats.  …Aaaaand it’s gone  The most frankly insane element of the sanctions, though, is the freezing of the global foreign exchange reserves of Russia’s central bank. This is possible because, as London School of Economics visiting fellow Ousmene Mandeng explained to the Financial Times, “foreign exchange reserves are not held by central banks” but instead by other banks around the world. “Securities and money never move, everything is external.”  This is believed to have affected fully half of the reserve holdings of Russia’s central bank, which recently totaled more than $630 billion. These sizable reserves, according to National Public Radio, were part of a long-term plan to make Russia “sanction proof.” This strongly suggests that Putin has made a massive geopolitical miscalculation about the nature of the global financial system. Russia has behaved as if it trusted European and American central banks to continue honoring its reserves even after an invasion of Ukraine. This would have allowed Russia to continue propping up the value of the ruble, among other things, for months, even in the face of sanctions.  Russia has refused to recognize the sovereignty and property rights of Ukraine, so it has few legs to stand on while complaining about having its lunch money stolen. But these sanctions will also permanently undermine the widespread assumption that global banking is a merely neutral and rules-based system. Adam Tooze, writing in Chartbook, argues that “To do this [reserves freeze] to a fellow central bank involves breaking the assumption of sovereign equality and the common interest in upholding the rights to property.” As Matt Levine pointed out with predictable brilliance at Bloomberg, the sanctions have driven home that the global banking system, like most monetary systems, amounts to “a way to keep track of what society thinks you deserve.”  This is an excellent way to think about the yen for “hard money” that motivates many bitcoiners. While there are ways for nation-states to restrict the movement of bitcoin, such as enjoining its sale via exchanges, bitcoin stored in an on-chain wallet cannot be seized or frozen by the kind of decrees that have cut Russia off at the knees. Bitcoin could be described as a “digital bearer instrument,” and can be moved, bought and held without third parties or intermediaries outside of its own network.  This gives new resonance to characterizations of bitcoin as “digital gold.” Gold has always been a particularly useful instrument during wartime or other disruptions, because its value is considered inherent to the object. (Gold rose nearly 10% in February amid rumors of war). Bitcoin is far more mobile than gold, but also has some disadvantages: in particular, gold has no memory, while the transaction history of each bitcoin is preserved on the blockchain. That presents real potential problems for the trade in formerly “dirty” coins, which could wind up blacklisted by mainstream exchanges even after they’re no longer owned by a global pariah.  An unwelcome vindication  Still, what we’re seeing is a significant vindication of the underlying skepticism of traditional banking that drives many in crypto, and particularly those committed to Bitcoin specifically. It is arguably the exclamation point after years of smaller examples of financial sanctions against groups ranging from sex workers to Canadian truckers.  See also: Humans Are the Last-Mile Problem of Bitcoin Crowdfunding  That doesn’t mean bitcoiners are dancing in the streets, though, any more than someone warning about the U.S. infrastructure deficit should celebrate when a bridge collapses. While Bitcoin is a useful object lesson and model for what a neutral global payments system could look like, it is unlikely that the near future will see huge states using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to depart the banking status quo. Instead, there is considerable speculation among finance professionals that Russia could begin conducting trade using China’s renminbi and banking infrastructure. Though the dollar is currently surging as a safe haven, a Russian move to RMB could significantly accelerate the ongoing decline of the dollar’s global dominance.  That would be a major step towards the repolarization of a world we once thought of as geopolitically flat – or just proof that the dream of neoliberal universality was a delusion all along.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,David Z.

42423721,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2esXh,1646247673,Lawmakers Raise Alarm on Crypto for Sanctions Evasion as Experts Cast Doubt,"Lawmakers are concerned that Russian oligarchs might use crypto to evade sanctions, but these concerns may be more theoretical than practical.  U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and New York Governor Kathy Hochul addressed this concern in separate public statements Wednesday.  The senators sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen asking what steps her department would take to mitigate any such usage, while Hochul announced that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) would accelerate its efforts to contract crypto analytics tools.  The senators said in their letter that they wanted to ""express our concern that criminals, rogue states, and other actors may use digital assets and alternative payment platforms as a new means to hide cross-border transactions for nefarious purposes.""  However, it is unclear whether Russia has any actual plans to use crypto to evade sanctions.  Andrew Jacobson, an attorney with law firm Seward & Kissel, told CoinDesk last week he saw it as unlikely that Russia would be able to turn to decentralized digital assets to evade sanctions. A central bank–issued digital currency also seems unlikely to circumvent sanctions.  ""Venezuela tried to do it, Venezuela issued their own token [and] that token was largely a failure, because of the U.S. sanctions that were issued,"" he said.  The senators directly cited Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a New York Times article that suggested Russian banks or oligarchs could use cryptocurrencies to avoid sanctions imposed on them by the U.S., EU and several other nations. A loose coalition of nations are seizing Russian central bank assets, seizing Russian oligarchs' assets and blocking both these individuals and several of Russia's largest banks from accessing the global financial system.  ""There are growing concerns that Russia may use cryptocurrencies to circumvent the broad new sanctions it faces from the Biden administration and foreign governments in response to its invasion of Ukraine,"" the letter said.  Read more: No, Crypto Won't 'Fix This' for Russia  Growing concern  In Europe, finance regulators are similarly eyeing cryptocurrencies as a potential issue of concern.  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said EU regulators have reached a consensus that they should ensure cryptocurrencies are included in their sanctions regime.  German Finance Minister Christian Lindner echoed Le Maire's comments in a press conference Wednesday, saying sanctioned individuals and entities should be prevented from tapping cryptocurrencies to bypass their sanctions.  ""I would also confirm what I've already said in my introduction, this is one of the most important elements of the sanctions which we have decided to apply against Russia. We have detected and frozen a significant amount of the reserves or assets of the Russian Central Bank. This has led to a devaluation of the ruble,"" Le Maire said.  Another New York Times article noted Russia has spent years trying to ""sanctions-proof"" its economy, including by building a currency reserve of over $630 billion (though the U.S. and other nations announced they would freeze any assets held outside Russia). It did not list any crypto tools.  Treasury officials have said crypto may not be a feasible tool to launder funds at scale.  Todd Conklin, a counselor to Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo, told Politico last week that the department was monitoring any potential spikes in crypto usage.  Bitcoin transactions denominated in rubles did spike earlier this week to about 1.5 billion RUB, matching highs seen roughly nine months ago. Ruble trades with the stablecoin tether also spiked to about 1.3 billion RUB.  ""The scale of what they have to move, and where they have to move things from, [crypto's] not necessarily going to be that concerning,"" Conklin said.  Read more: People Are Sending Millions in Bitcoin to Aid Ukraine's Military as Russia Advances  Overblown?  Still, lawmakers want assurances from Yellen that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces U.S. sanctions rules, will be able to maintain the blocks against Russian banks and oligarchs. Wednesday's letter asked Yellen and OFAC to provide responses to five questions about the agency's work, including whether decentralized finance (DeFi) arrangements could help malicious actors bypass sanctions.  The letter also asked what tools OFAC might need to prevent sanctions evasion using crypto.  NYDFS is similarly looking to ensure it has the appropriate tooling it needs to monitor crypto transactions.  In a statement, NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris said her agency is working with other state and federal regulators to ""ensure the full weight of our regulatory regime is brought to bear in the fight to protect Ukraine.""  ""We know that bad actors will try to evade sanctions through the transmission of virtual currency, which is why it is imperative that we have the ability to monitor transactions and exposure in real time,"" she said.

It has been verified that an airdrop will take place, according to a message from the Ukrainian government&apos;s official Twitter account. A snapshot will be captured and released on March 3rd at 6 p.m. Kiev time (11 am EST). Ukraine Confirms Airdrop After Massive Crypto Donations The Ukrainian government issued a plea to the world last week, providing wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether to anybody who wanted to donate in cryptocurrencies (USDT). This was welcomed with enthusiastic response and a large number of contributions from the cryptocurrency community. So far, the linked Bitcoin wallet alone has received 219 bitcoins for a total of $9.6 million in bitcoins while the Ethereum wallet has received more than $10 million. The TRON community was also said to have donated more than $1.2 million in USDT. Subsequently, the official Twitter account revealed that it is now taking contributions in another cryptocurrency as well, Polkadot.

42423724,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2esjh,1646246224,"'The People's Network' Is Growing Fast, but Would-Be Miners Are Getting Left Behind","The Helium Network – a decentralized telecommunications network powered by crypto – is growing fast, but not everyone has been able to participate in the financial upside.  According to a new class-action lawsuit filed against Parley Labs, a San Diego-based distributor of Helium mining “hotspots,” thousands of would-be miners have faced extensive shipping delays that have left them empty-handed for nearly a year, unable to mine Helium’s native token HNT – and, for many of them, unable to even receive a refund for their orders.  A Helium hotspot is a small device that plugs into a regular electric outlet, taps into existing internet service and extends that Wi-Fi for miles – providing a connection to local devices and acting as a node on the network. Hotspot owners are rewarded in HNT tokens for operating the hotspots.  The ongoing global semiconductor shortage is at least partially to blame for the delays. The impact of the chip shortage has been felt across the electronics industry and has impacted all types of crypto miners – including Helium miners.  Helium boomed in 2021, growing from approximately 14,000 hotspots globally last January to over half a million at the start of 2022. And the growth hasn’t slowed – nearly 80,000 hotspots have come online in the past 30 days, and the network now has over 600,000 hotspots around the world.  Helium is also growing financially. Earlier this month, the company behind the protocol closed a $200 million funding round at $1.2 billion valuation. Helium is backed by major players in the crypto venture capital space, including Andreessen Horowitz, FTX Ventures and Multicoin Capital, and boasts a series of partnerships and integrations with mainstream entities including Dish Network, Lime scooters and the city of San Jose, California.  Though the growing number of hotspots might seem impressive, they represent a small fraction of the Helium miners that have been ordered. According to a representative for Helium, 3.5 million hotspots remain on back-order. And, as the price of the token climbs – nearly 450% in the last year – the people at the other end of those orders are growing increasingly frustrated by what they see as a lost opportunity to get in early.  What’s behind the delays?  Different reasons have been offered up to explain the missing hotspots. Representatives for both Helium and Nebra, a U.K.-based manufacturer of hotspots whose equipment is at the center of the lawsuit, both blame the ongoing chip shortage and pandemic-related supply chain issues. Parley Labs, the hotspot distributor at the center of the lawsuit, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but alluded to issues with its payment processor for the delays in both shipping and issuing refunds during an interview with a crypto YouTuber last month.  In both the lawsuit and on social media, Parley Labs’ customers say they’ve hounded the company for refunds, only to be met with either total silence or stalling techniques. Company representatives told customers they needed to set up a phone call before they could issue a refund but then did not call at the scheduled time, said they had processed refunds that never actually arrived and promised new shipping dates that were never met.  The civil suit accuses Parley Labs and its owner, Bryan Bui-Tuong, of fraud, breach of contract and unjust enrichment.  According to the lawsuit, on Dec. 16, 2021, Parley told its customers that it would issue unilateral refunds due to “uncertainty regarding Nebra’s ability to deliver [hotspots]” and that the process would take up to eight weeks. Plaintiffs in the suit told CoinDesk that they did not receive refunds by the promised deadline – only once they had filed the lawsuit were they approached by Parley about refunds.  Other customers not involved in the suit told CoinDesk that the only way they had been able to get their money back was by disputing the payment with their credit card companies.  “I bought an indoor and outdoor Nebra [hotspot] from Parley and then they just kept pushing back the ship date,” said Bryant Peng, a customer of Parley Labs not involved in the suit.  “Eventually I got sick of it and tried to get a refund, but they refused to help me. I went to my credit card company, and they were able to reverse the charge based on how shady Parley was being,” Peng added.  According to Gerry Grunsfeld, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, the credit card chargeback option was not an option for his clients because most of them were past the six-month time limit for chargebacks by the time they realized they were being “strung along by Parley.”  More importantly, said Grunsfeld, his clients won’t be satisfied with a simple refund. They feel that they’ve missed out on months of mining opportunity, the chance to get in early or even to flip their hotspots online at a profit.  Upon receiving a refund for his order of two hotspots on Feb. 17 – which was only obtained after the lawsuit was filed, and came a full week after Parley’s promised deadline for blanket refunds for all orders of Nebra-made hotspots – plaintiff Bailey Rosmarin wrote Parley:  “At this juncture, the refund does not make me whole, and I will be proceeding in the lawsuit I have filed against Parley.”  Supply chain nightmare  Though customers of Parley Labs have been the most vocal in voicing their disappointment, Parley is not the only distributor or manufacturer of Helium miners facing issues.  Twitter users have complained about extensive delays from other distributors of Nebra-made hotspots, including European electronics distributor Distrelec, as well as delays for hotspots ordered directly from Nebra (though a representative for Nebra told CoinDesk customers have always been kept apprised of shipping delays and refunds are available to anyone who wants one).  Even the biggest manufacturers of Helium hotspots, including China-based Bobcat, have faced lengthy delays – though, according to the lawsuit, Bobcat has fulfilled 99% of hotspot orders placed in April 2021, when the majority of the 14 plaintiffs in the suit placed their first orders with Parley Labs.  In a statement to CoinDesk, a representative for Nebra said that the company’s manufacturing ability has been “severely limited by sudden constraints on component availability” due to the global semiconductor shortage. Despite this, Nebra said it has shipped more than 50,000 miners globally. Over 32,000 Nebra-made hotspots were online at the time of publication.  Brad Lane, a volunteer member of Helium’s Manufacturing Oversight Committee (MOC), confirmed that hotspot manufacturers like Nebra have faced severe shortages.  Lane told CoinDesk that many manufacturers found themselves overwhelmed with demand that exploded from hundreds of hotspots per batch to hundreds of thousands in less than a year – while also battling chip shortages.  “It was kind of the perfect storm,” Lane said. “And the reality is when you’re in a new product field like the hotspots, a lot of the manufacturers are smaller themselves, and they just don’t have as mature supply chain processes in place. They don’t have direct orders with the manufacturers in place. It just became a real challenge.”  Lane also said that the available semiconductors were often snapped up by bigger electronics manufacturers, leaving smaller operations to fight for what was left over or, if they were lucky, reallocate inventory they already had for other products.  “There’s a pecking order in all industries, and this industry is no different,” Lane said.  Impact on Helium  Wannabe miners aren’t the only ones negatively impacted by the hotspot shortages: the Helium network, which relies on the continued spread of hotspots to extend its Wi-Fi availability, has also suffered.  “We acknowledge that hotspot miner shortages have slowed the growth of the Helium Network overall and we share the frustration that this has brought to the Helium community,” a representative for Helium told CoinDesk.  Lane, however, believes that there’s a light at the end of the chip shortage tunnel.  “There are still challenges in 2022, but I think people are optimistic that the semiconductor industry is going to start catching up, and we’re going to see better availability [of chips] throughout the year,” he said.  But even if manufacturers are able to catch up with the demand, many of the would-be miners burned by the delays have given up on the idea of mining HNT.  “The whole experience left a bad taste,” Peng told CoinDesk. “So I gave up on mining.”",NEGATIVE,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TRADING | HNT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/the-peoples-network-is-growing-fast-but-would-be-miners-are-getting-left-behind,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8439affb7918e544d80a2fb163dd8b65ffe0370-4288x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The plan includes up to $30 million worth of shares in the Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTCN), $10 million of the Grayscale Horizen Trust (HZEN), $10 million of the Grayscale Zcash Trust (ZCSH), and up to $200 million in any of its other six publicly traded products, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).  DCG will use cash on hand to fund the repurchases, and will do so in the open market under management’s discretion.  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has been trading at a steep discount to net asset value for months, and in October DCG upped its buyback plan for that product to $1 billion from $750 million. As of Thursday, there was $301.3 million of remaining authorization in that program, and as of Wednesday, the trust was selling for a 24.9% discount to net asset value (NAV).  The Litecoin, Horizen, and Zcash trusts also trade at sizable discounts to NAV.  “Typically when a closed-end fund is trading at a double-digit discount to NAV, the manager will repurchase shares to try to reduce the discount for investors,” Accelerate Financial Technologies CEO Julian Klymochko told CoinDesk. “It looks like DCG is buying (as opposed to the funds), so they must see good value,” he added.  The ultimate solution to the discount will be conversion of the trust to an exchange-traded fund (ET). DCG and Grayscale have made no secret of their interest in doing that.

42420995,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqib,1646242211,Aaron Lammer’s Advice for Making It in Crypto: Just Do Something,"There’s no such thing as a “traditional” career path in cryptocurrency. Everything is nontraditional. Since the industry is so new, almost by definition, everyone has an arc that is surprising, daring and a bit weird.  And then there’s Aaron Lammer.  Even by the unconventional standards of crypto, Lammer’s career has taken a wild twist. Many people know him as the co-founder of Longform.org, the website and podcast that highlights exceptional works of nonfiction. (The website recently shuttered, prompting many tears on literary Twitter, but the podcast lives on.) Others know him as the guy who co-wrote a Drake song (“Karaoke”), or the guy whose band, Francis and the Lights, cranked out a hit (“Morning”) that became the theme song to “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” And still others – particularly CoinDesk readers – know him as the co-host of ""CoinTalk"" (along with New York Times opinion writer Jay Caspian Kang), one of the earliest, most thoughtful, and most engaging crypto podcasts.  Read More: Gerald Cotten and Quadriga: Unraveling Crypto's Biggest Mystery  Now people know Aaron Lammer as the splashy new hire by Radkl, the new crypto trading shop that’s backed by Steve Cohen, the polarizing owner of the New York Mets and inspiration for the Bobby Axelrod character on ""Billions."" Lammer and Radkl have been cagey about revealing exactly what it is he does there, but it seems he’s something of an “Explainer in Chief,” translating what he calls the “wacky funhouse version” of finance into simple, relatable concepts that normal traders can understand.  Lammer’s story is useful – even instructive – for anyone who has long been “crypto curious” and now hopes to do it for a living. Lammer’s secret for cracking open the door? “Do something,” he says. “Actually do something that someone might notice and care about.” Lammer did something. Then he did something again. And again. That’s his philosophy for finding plum new opportunities, instead of trying to “LinkedIn your way through life.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  CoinDesk: Let’s start with your writing. What are some ways that nonfiction helped launch your journey?  Aaron Lammer: Honestly, even the perception that I'm a writer is actually a weird anachronism for me, because I've never been a journalist. I started Longform with a guy named Max Linsky, who was a journalist. At the time, I just wanted to be part of a project. I just wanted to do stuff.  Back in 2007, I had admired the people who were doing internet startups. I was friendly with people who were early at places like Vimeo and Tumblr. But I'm not a skilled programmer. And so [in 2010] I needed to do something very, very easy. And I had this idea to do this website, longform.org.  And that thrust me on this road of being really interested in nonfiction writing and reporting. About three years in, we decided to start a podcast, which made me need to learn how to make podcasts. And so I got deeper into nonfiction writing and podcasting. Once you have an interest in podcasting, very quickly, whenever there’s something that interests you, you feel like it’s a natural thing to do a podcast about it, because you want to have an excuse to talk about it.  I’m guessing this is where ""CoinTalk"" comes in?  I just started getting into it [crypto], and I wanted to meet other people who were into it. And I wanted to talk about it all the time and I wanted to soak in it. Podcasting was kind of like a road in.  And honestly, at the time, there were really only a handful of crypto podcasts. I remember Peter McCormack was doing “What Bitcoin Did,” and I remember DMing with him. It was nascent enough that he was like, “Can you get ads in podcasts? How does that work?” There were a few shows around. I think CoinDesk had a show…  And Laura Shin’s ”Unchained.”  [Nods.] Honestly, Laura Shin wrote me a couple of corrections after early ""CoinTalk"" episodes that explained things I got wrong about Bitcoin, for which I'm forever grateful. I think I said that proof-of-work was something that had existed before Bitcoin, when in fact, Bitcoin is the first instance of proof-of-work.  I think Steve Jobs invented proof-of-work in 1972, right? [Both laugh.] A good chunk of your work at ""CoinTalk"" was “learning by doing.” Of you doing crypto-experiments. What are some of your favorites?  This was when the first few dapps (decentralized applications) were coming out. (Although I feel like the word dapp is used less now, right?) So on the show, we used this prediction market, called Augur. It still exists. I think it's now on V3 or something, but this was V1 Augur. I started a market that was whether the Donald Trump “pee tape” would be released during his first term.  So you didn’t just bet on the pee tape being released, you literally created the market itself?  That’s the way Augur worked at the time. I thought that all this stuff was going to take off in like a month, not in five years. The person who created the market got a small fee from every bettor, so I was like, “Oh, I'll create these viral prediction markets.” At the time, people would ask me to go on Gizmodo TV. So I was thinking, “I'll just, you know, tell a few people about my pee tape market, then the bets are going to roll in.”  Did they ever roll in?  That did not happen. But those experiences were helpful to me in understanding what the possibilities of smart contracts were, and making me realize that crypto was not going to simply be this pure speculation game about buying this stuff and keeping it on Coinbase. That people were actually going to start building stuff in the wild. People were going to take tokens off exchanges into places where they could actually use them, and interact with smart contracts. So that was a good primer.  What is it about DeFi that you find so exciting?  I mean, it’s weird. I almost expect in a couple of years, we're not going to use the term DeFi (decentralized finance), because I think it's a little bit limited. The term “finance” gives it a very specific coloring. What I'm interested in is on-chain stuff. Stuff you can do on the blockchain. And so that would include NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and it would include DeFi, because they're all these on-chain activities. And they're all experiences that people are building on the blockchain.  And a secondary experience I’ve had since then is learning about bridging (when one blockchain connects to another), and getting to explore other blockchains, which is like visiting other countries on the internet or something, where things operate slightly differently, and your native customs are slightly altered, right?  So all of those things have been super interesting to me. I don't think it's surprising that the initial applications have a tilt towards finance, because that’s how you generate money to develop things.  Can you share a concrete example of someone doing stuff on-chain that excites you?  One of the early things I got into was the Ethereum Name Service, ENS. I think it's a really cool project. By the way, nothing I'm saying is financial advice. I don't mean to say that I like the ENS token.  Read More: NFTs Revive Dot-Com Era Hype Over Domain Names  But first of all, full disclosure, I've always been interested in domain name flipping. There's actually a ""Reply All"" episode that's about my attempt to buy longform.com from a domain flipper. So I already had a pre-existing interest in the world of people buying and selling domain names.  And when you look at what ENS does, it's a really cool wrinkle on that, which is to take a domain name, which is this static thing that's supposed to sort of persist into perpetuity, and putting it into an NFT that you can hold in your wallet. And having that be something that you can trade and send around and use as this sort of permanent anchor that can represent everything from a website to an identity, which people can send stuff to … or really anything. It's a very rich object that you can actually build a lot on top of, and yet, it's very simple.  It's just the word .eth, you know. They put a little cover on it like an NFT. But I think the experience of how much you could build into that, and how permanent that is, [shows the] potential future infrastructure for the internet. All of that stuff was like fireworks going off in my head. I was like, wow, if you can do this by just typing something.eth and logging on the blockchain, you're going to be able to build some pretty impressive stuff on top of this kind of technology.  Okay, so how did you go from covering this stuff on ""CoinTalk"" to now working for a trade shop?  If there’s anything I’m good at in crypto, it’s that I’m pretty good at describing complicated ideas to normal people. A lot of that I learned while doing this podcast, ""Exit Scam,” which was about the demise of the Canadian crypto exchange Quadriga. And whether or not the co-founder, Gerald Cotten, might have faked his own death. You’ll have to listen; I simply will not reveal the ending of this.  Fair! And for what it’s worth, CoinDesk’s David Z. Morris gave “Exit Scam” a glowing review.  That story was very challenging, because we always wanted it to appeal to a general interest audience. This has to work for someone who knows nothing about crypto, who does not know what a wallet is, does not know what the blockchain is, does not understand the concept of private keys, and the fact that when your private keys are gone, everything's gone. So wipe out every single thing you know about crypto, and then tell a true crime story in which almost all the clues and evidence are crypto. It really forces you to keep going simpler and simpler and thinking about ways that a person can understand this.  That was the experience I was coming off of. I understand this stuff, I think, in a way that certainly doesn't make me an expert, but makes me maybe better at explaining it to a general interest audience than a regular person.  And so now … You’re helping to explain DeFi to finance-types?  I think the crypto that happens on centralized exchanges is actually fairly easy [for the traditional finance world] to understand on a certain level. If you've traded equities, and now you're trading bitcoin, it's like, “Okay, there's a bid, there's an ask. I’m trying to sell it for more than I bought it for.” It's not like you need that much of a primer.  But then when you start dealing with things like DEXs (decentralized exchanges), you know, interacting with smart contracts, the metaphor very quickly falls apart. You're like, “Wait, who’s my counterparty? I just send money to this pool, and then the pool sends back money? How does that work? How do they know the spot prices? Do people arb[itrage] these pools?”  That’s kind of what led me into working in crypto, more so than I’m some kind of hotshot trader. I try to be helpful in showing people what's going on and my opinions of it, but with less of a directional market slant, and more of a, “Let's just try and understand, let's just try and pick through what's going on here first.”  Are you surprised your career took this turn?  It certainly was not my plan to get a job like this. On the other hand, it was not my plan to start a crypto podcast; it was not my plan to be involved in journalism stuff. So my whole life has been a bunch of things that I haven't really planned for, and I try to stay open to it, and try to generally embrace the idea of being a person who is learning at all times, and ideally, sharing that learning with others.  What’s the toughest adjustment in joining the trading firm?  That's a good question. I think the hardest part is being disciplined and sticking with one idea for a while. There's so much happening in crypto that you can just have your eyes fly all over the place. But doing this in a more official capacity, with a team, you can't just change your mind every two minutes. You need to plan more. Think things through more.  I don't mean it's a tough adjustment in a negative way. It's a positive. It has caused me to think longer term, to plan more and be more disciplined about what I'm interested in, versus what's at the top of my Twitter feed right now, every second.  Like when I see that the Solana Wormhole was exploited, my brain wants to just dig into this event, and I'm super interested in it and I want to read about it. But my job is not to investigate the Wormhole.  What are some ways that having a creative background might give you an almost … sneaky edge in crypto?  Well, I think crypto is a pretty cultural space in general. So having a cultural lens on crypto is helpful. There are people who have a quantitative lens on crypto who I like and respect, but my lens is cultural.  Like who's into this stuff? Why are they into it? What are they into? What kind of people are they, right?  And so when you have a background in creative stuff, it helps you put yourself in the shoes of the people who are building within crypto, and I think the people who are building are the people who are going to have the biggest influence on where things go. I think if you understand the motivations that drive people to build within crypto, you can see where things are going.  Interesting. To your point, I think a lot about how the founders of Bored Ape Yacht Club are creative writers – that can’t be a coincidence.  Oh, really? I didn't know that. [Since our interview, BuzzFeed revealed, or “doxxed,"" the identities of the BAYC co-founders.]  Yeah it’s wild. Okay, last question. What advice would you give someone who has been, like yourself in the past, very crypto-curious, but now they want to work in crypto for a living?  You know, I don't know that much about other people's experiences. But my experience is that going out and doing things is valuable. When you do things in the world you encounter people that you could not have predicted you would encounter, who might be important to your life. And I don't mean, like, being a “reply guy” for every crypto figure, as doing something.  Read More: How to Get a Job in Crypto  I mean, actually do something that someone might notice and care about. It's been helpful to me that I made that Quadriga podcast, because I'll meet a blockchain security expert, who probably would not know who I am normally, but maybe they've heard the podcast. Well, now we have something to talk about, and I've established that I take this stuff seriously and can work at a high level.  So I would advise [people] to not LinkedIn your way through life, but to make things and do stuff that people might find, and then they’ll find you with your work. That's kind of my overall life philosophy.",POSITIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ENS,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/02/aaron-lammers-advice-for-making-it-in-crypto-just-do-something,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23789757a8d3803d4f1c54f005111fdbd0b877f8-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The sale was organized by UkraineDAO, a crowdfunding effort led by Russian art collective Pussy Riot and non-fungible token studio Trippy Labs to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.  Read more: New DAO Raises $3M in ETH for Ukrainian Army  The winning bid for the 1-of-1 flag NFT was placed on behalf of a pool of 3,271 donors through a service called PartyBid, where the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) was able to essentially purchase the NFT from itself through donations from its members.  UkraineDAO says it will airdrop amounts of its LOVE token to wallets that contributed to the sale, proportional to the ether they donated.  The DAO says its tokens will have “[n]o utility nor value, but are a beautiful testament and reminder of your contribution to a noble cause,” according to its website.  The high-value NFT sale is just the latest example of cryptocurrency being used to financially support the Ukrainian government in recent days.

In his prepared remarks, the Fed chair reiterated his expectation that – despite the uncertainties unleashed by the Ukraine war – the U.S. central bank will hike the Federal Funds rate when it meets later this month.

IMA Financial Group, a large U.S. insurance broker and wealth management firm, is opening a research and development facility in Decentraland, the Ethereum-based virtual world where Wall Street megabank JPMorgan recently set up shop.  Denver-based IMA’s foray into the metaverse, dubbed “Web3Labs,” was driven by the rapid growth of the non-fungible token (NFT) market, said Justin Jacobs, senior vice president of marketing at IMA Financial Group and architect of Web3Labs.  “We have this huge asset class worth over $40 billion, for which there’s no traditional insurance products,” Jacobs said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to 2021 research from Chainalysis. “Many NFTs I think would be considered some form of art, and today we transact a ton of business in the realm of specie insurance; fine art, collectibles, things of that nature.”  The crypto insurance question  Insurance and cryptocurrency have thus far been uneasy bedfellows, with spotty cover and a dearth of capacity, limited to a handful of blue-chip exchanges and custodians.  As far as the nuts and bolts of digital asset insurance are concerned, specialist underwriters from Lloyd’s of London working in specie insurance market (policies covering high-value items like gold bullion and works of art held in safe storage facilities) have turned their attention to cryptocurrency locked up in cold storage.  IMA, which is one of the largest private and employee-owned brokers in the U.S. with predicted revenues this year of around $500 million, has connections with Lloyd’s syndicates for some of its business lines, said Jacobs. But for now, there are no insurance products directed at things like NFTs, he said.  Metaverse value chain  As well as simply having a presence in Decentraland, IMA wants to explore the entire metaverse value chain, Jacobs said, including being able to advise clients that might be apprehensive when it comes to things like decentralized finance (DeFi).  As such, crypto, NFTs and the metaverse can be compared to the burgeoning cannabis industry in the U.S., he said, where relatively recently firms were fearful to tread, but which now happens to be a sector where IMA manages a significant book of business.  IMA’s Web3Labs opens with interactive material and content, as well as a tranche of NFTs the firm will be minting, but the hope is to create a location where transactions – such as negotiating insurance cover for an NFT somebody is thinking of purchasing, for example – can take place.  “I absolutely believe we are quickly approaching an inflection point,” IMA executive Paul Washington said in an interview. “There’s of course a big focus on asset building in the metaverse, which needs to be considered from a risk mitigation standpoint, no question.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MANA | MARKET | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/ima-financial-plans-to-start-selling-nft-insurance-in-decentraland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/629972816eea34b4b5f373117c11685212f32fd2-1920x1040.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S., EU and other nations have imposed financial sanctions against Russia in an effort to have it back down from its invasion of Ukraine. Earlier on Wednesday, the European Union cut seven of Russia’s largest banks off from the SWIFT interbank messaging system.  Powell referred to the possibility that terrorists or other malicious actors could use cryptocurrency as further examples of the need for additional regulation.  Powell is testifying in front of the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday on the state of the economy and monetary policy. He will report to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.  Congressman Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) asked about the Fed’s recent reports on central bank digital currencies. Powell referred to the papers, saying the Fed is seeking public comment.  “This will be something that we will invest a fair amount of time and expertise … to get it right,” Powell said, emphasizing that “we have not decided to do it.”  Whether the benefits outweigh the costs of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is an unanswered question, he said.  Powell also indicated that the U.S. central bank would try to mitigate inflation by raising rates later this year. He said that the central bank was set to raise its policy rate but that the situation in the Ukraine may have changed expectations.  Still, he told Congress his expectation is that inflation will peak and “come down” by the end of this year.  Powell said he’s inclined to impose and support a 25 basis point rate hike in March.  Traders have been pricing in a possible rate hike since the Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day meeting in March, however, it was unclear until now by how many basis points.  The CME Group's FedWatch tool showed this morning that futures traders see a 90% chance of a quarter-percentage point hike, as opposed to a half-percentage point, which many thought was very likely just a week ago.

42423726,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2esfh,1646234830,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell Sees Rate Hike This Month as 'Appropriate',"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is telling U.S. lawmakers Wednesday that the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates this month for the first time in three years, because of high inflation, a tight labor market and strong economic demand.  “With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month,” Powell wrote in his prepared remarks that he was scheduled to deliver to the House Financial Services Committee.  Although many traders have already priced in a possible rate hike in March after the central bank hinted at such an outcome after the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in February, questions remain as to the magnitude of any rate hike.  Powell didn’t specify the size of the rate hike he felt would be appropriate..  The Chicago-based CME Group's FedWatch tool shows that futures traders see a 90% chance of a quarter-percentage point hike, as opposed to a half-percentage point, which many thought was very likely just a week ago.  The central bank is concerned about inflation, now at its highest in four decades Powell, however, expects inflation will diminish this year as supply constraints ease and demand moderates because of the shrinking effects of fiscal stimulus and tighter monetary policy.  “We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation expectations and inflation itself from a number of factors,” he said. “We will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.”  Powell also mentioned Ukraine, saying that the implications of the war for the U.S. economy are “highly uncertain.”",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/02/federal-reserve-chairman-powell-sees-rate-hike-this-month-as-appropriate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22914b984f3d9f051bb0af3cc0d320cfc8b91a09-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In doing so, the Hong Kong firm is breaking with major crypto firms, many of whom have kept providing services to Russian users amid the security crisis.  “The legal advice we’ve been receiving is we now have to impose some restrictions,” Animoca co-founder and Chairman Yat Siu told Bloomberg in an interview. He added that “It’s a sanctioned country on par with North Korea. The moment we end up doing business in those areas, we might ourselves become financially excluded from the financial system.”  The decision will apply to subsidiaries such as Gamee and Lympo, but it won't have any material impact on the company's performance because it doesn't have many users in Russia, Siu said, according to Bloomberg.  Animoca's latest valuation in January was $5.5 billion, following a $360 million funding round. The firm has invested in well-known non-fungible token (NFT) and metaverse projects, like Sandbox.  Earlier this week, Binance, Kraken, KuCoin and Coinbase declined a request from the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation to block Russian accounts.  One of the world's largest Ethereum mining pools, Flexpool, said on Feb. 25 that it will cancel all services to Russian users and refund their outstanding balances, in support of Ukraine.  Russian entities, including major banks, have been heavily sanctioned by several countries in the past few days following the Kremlin's decision to invade Ukraine. The rules include warnings to crypto exchanges, the U.S. Treasury said.

42423718,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2esZh,1646230413,Hedge Fund Giant Alan Howard Backs $7.5M Round for ‘Financial NFTs’ Project,"Nested, a social trading platform that enables users to create and invest in “financial NFTs,” has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding in a round led by billionaire hedge fund investor Alan Howard.  Along with Howard, the round saw participation from big-name angels and investors across decentralized finance (DeFi), including Polychain Capital’s Joseph Eagan, and Lily Liu, whose bitcoin startup Earn.com was acquired by Coinbase for over $100 million in 2018.  Nested provides a way for people to invest in crypto portfolios that are hand-curated by the platform’s users. Investing in a Nested portfolio means buying a “NestedNFT,” a non-fungible token (NFT) that is tied to a portfolio’s underlying assets and allows one to buy or sell an entire portfolio in just a click.  Users who create a Nested portfolio are rewarded royalties each time their portfolio is replicated by another user, the company said, and investors in a portfolio can buy, sell or swap their holdings at any time.  Why Nested?  Nested joins a growing crop of DeFi projects, like Index Coop and Housecat, that enable people to easily diversify their crypto investments through pre-packaged indexes and portfolios.  In describing what differentiates his project from others in the space, Nested Founder Rudy Kadoch explained to CoinDesk in an email, “Nested has been built by DeFi-native people for all people, compared to other DeFi platforms built by DeFi-native people for DeFi people.”  Moving forward, Kadoch says his aim with Nested is to democratize access to crypto, using NFTs to usher a new wave of people curious about crypto into decentralized finance.  “My mom knows what an NFT is,” writes Kadoch. “There is considerable hype around NFTs. But more importantly, retail investors, and even the public, have understood the concept of NFTs in a shorter time than it has taken for them to comprehend cryptocurrencies.”  As a new investor, crypto is overwhelming. Though we’re long past the token-crazed ICO mania of 2017, it remains difficult for the lay investor to differentiate established projects from transparent cash grabs – even as an emerging class of blue(er) chip tokens can sometimes seem around the corner.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/hedge-fund-giant-alan-howard-backs-75m-round-for-financial-nfts-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65e0be099315051d58d804aed8ff40fadef5442a-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423731,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2esth,1646230014,"Evmos Looks to Jump-Start Ethereum–Cosmos Interoperability With Airdrop, Mainnet Launch","With a cleverly designed airdrop, novel tokenomics and cross-chain compatibility, the latest EVM-compatible environment may quickly rank among the most popular.  On Wednesday, Evmos announced the launch of its namesake plan to merge the best of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the Cosmos-based Inter‑Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Evmos had been slated for a Feb. 28 launch, but was delayed “to guarantee a smooth launch.”  EVM-compatible environments are popular among developers on alternative layer 1 blockchains because they allow teams to easily port over implementations of protocols that are already running on Ethereum. They’re also typically easier for existing Ethereum users to interact with, as indicated by the total value locked (TVL) rankings on sites like DeFiLlama.  Read more: Oasis Foundation Launches Emerald, an EVM-Compatible Smart Contract Environment  Young EVM-compatible ecosystems are also often ripe with lucrative opportunities for yield farmers and traders as newly-released protocols tend to be more generous with tokens.  In addition to allowing EVM compatibility and bridging, Evmos will also allow for cross-blockchain transactions using the EIP-712 standard, meaning Ethereum-based users can directly interact with contracts on Evmos – creating what Evmos co-founder Federico Kunze Küllmer called in an interview with CoinDesk “the port-of-entry from Ethereum to Cosmos.”  At launch, the chain will be home to a handful of decentralized finance (DeFi) mainstays and forks. A Rari Capital fork and a Uniswap fork were advertised in a press release, and Küllmer also mentioned Balancer fork, a CryptoPunks fork, a lending platform and an Olympus fork, many of which will be deploying with “novel tokeneconomics,” he said.  Additionally, earlier this month the Aave DAO passed a proposal to deploy its v3 implementation to the chain shortly after launch.  ‘Rektdrop’  A highlight of the release is an airdrop aimed at both the Cosmos and Ethereum communities.  The majority of the airdrop will be allocated to various Cosmos ecosystem participants, including Cosmos Hub and ATOM stakers, as well as liquidity providers on Osmosis.  Additionally, however, Evmos took aim at Ethereum users with their initial distribution – specifically, ones that have been “rekt.”  Their criteria included high gas payers on popular DeFi apps, as well as victims of miner extractable value (MEV). In total, over 1.9 million addresses will be eligible for the airdrop, according to Kunze Küllmer.  Half of the project’s 200 million tokens will be distributed via the airdrop.  Tokenomics  Perhaps the highlight of Evmos’ launch is its tokeneconomic structure, one that re-examines the relationship between validators, users who interact with smart contracts and developers.  “When we studied these systems, we saw that miners and validators are the ones that receive most of the transaction fees,” said Kunze Küllmer. “So we wanted to create incentive alignment with all the different types of users, and so we introduced the idea of fee sharing.”  Fee sharing will go partially to validators, but also to the teams that created the contracts that are driving chain usage. Additionally, users will be able to vote on which smart contracts earn “usage rewards” from a community pool, which allocates tokens to users for interacting with chosen contracts.  While other chains have big-budget incentive programs at launch often ranging in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Kunze Küllmer believes that incentives baked into the base layer will help Evmos stand out:  “This is an in-protocol tokeneconomic way to create an incentive, as opposed to all these liquidity programs like Polygon has or Avalanche rush,” he said. “We natively implemented this in the protocol so all users can be aligned.”",POSITIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/evmos-looks-to-jumpstart-ethereumcosmos-interoperability-with-airdrop-mainnet-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7232b507d9466e0db69c5d913e0752fd002afc9-5005x3417.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423730,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2esph,1646229600,Dialect Raises $4.1M to Bring ‘Smart Messaging’ to Solana,"Dialect, a new Solana protocol aiming to solve key Web 3 usability issues, announced Tuesday a $4.1 million seed round co-led by Multicoin Capital and Jump Crypto.  The “smart messaging” platform launched on Solana mainnet this week to bring actionable notifications and wallet-to-wallet chat to Web 3 apps. It joins a crop of projects, mostly on Ethereum to date, that are trying to bring a user-friendly stalwart of the Web 2 world – notifications – to the realm of Web 3.  From emails and follow requests to stock price fluctuations and Slack messages, we’re used to Web 2 apps alerting us to new information right when it becomes available. In Web 3, push notifications have been difficult to implement without the help of services like Dialect, which will monitor on-chain activity and send alerts directly to a mobile device associated with a crypto wallet.  How it works  At launch, Dialect’s tools will help Web 3 developers send out notifications automatically triggered by on-chain events.  Say you bid on an NFT through a decentralized marketplace. Today, you use your wallet to “sign in” to Web 3 apps, and since most Web 3 wallets are browser-based you’ll need to pull out your computer each time you want to check whether you’ve been outbid.  Dialect CEO Chris Osborn told Coindesk that his thesis is “to build products that are delightful in ways to end consumers that haven't been true in Web 2.” Since notifications sent using Dialect will be tied directly to a user’s Solana wallet, they can be embedded with actions that communicate directly with the blockchain. In Osborn’s telling, this will mark a major improvement in Web 3 convenience.  Read more: EPNS Goes Live in Bid to Bring Notifications to Web 3  “Say some proposal gets announced [for a DAO] and I get a notification telling me ‘Hey, this proposal has been submitted by this wallet,’” Osborn explained. “You can read [the proposal] right there in the message. But right there are also the ‘pass,’ ‘like,’ ‘accept,’ or ‘reject’ [options] right in the notification.”  In addition to push notifications, the Dialect team is particularly excited about a tool that helps developers build wallet-to-wallet chat into their Web 3 apps. Like Dialect’s notifications, messages sent using Dialect can be embedded with actions or live information directly pulled from the blockchain.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/dialect-raises-41m-to-bring-smart-messaging-to-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c07d671715509bdc4e55c892412bf66c90be1c01-5734x3823.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Today's show will feature guests:  Tanvi Ratna, founder, Policy 4.0  Kevin Owocki, founder, Gitcoin  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin failed to beat a key price-resistance level early Wednesday amid mixed action in traditional markets and reports of the next round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.  The biggest cryptocurrency by market value reached daily highs at the descending 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle at $45,000 before retreating to $44,000, according to chart platform TradingView. The cryptocurrency was still up 28% from last Thursday's one-month lows.  The total crypto market capitalization rose past $2 trillion, as alternative cryptocurrencies charted a more significant recovery rally alongside bitcoin's bounce. Programmable blockchain Terra's LUNA token rose to a two-month high of $96, taking the week-on-week gain to 92%.  The crypto recovery looked set to continue on increased demand from Russia and Ukraine and as inflation expectations surged and traditional markets priced out prospects of aggressive monetary tightening by central banks.  ""Bitcoin is on a steady footing here, but we may meet increased resistance around $46,000 handle,"" Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, said. ""Recent moves have shown evidence of the correlation between BTC and equities dropping; however, this is a crucial month for economic data that may hold some surprises.""  ""We believe this may sustain in the near term given that there are new fund inflows for the month that must be allocated,"" Dibb added.  While futures tied to the S&P 500 stock index rose, European stocks dipped and the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate slipped to its lowest since March 2020. Markets likely saw the European economy taking a relatively bigger hit from the Ukraine-Russia war and the West's punitive sanctions on Moscow.  Gold took a bull breather while oil, industrial metals and grains were bid again, hinting at hotter inflation in coming months. Even so, money markets continued to scale back bets of monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.

""Binance's 24-hour average basis [spread between futures and spot prices] reached a new all-time low on Monday of 1.17%, below the bottom 1.18% seen on July 21, 2021. This points towards a very pessimistic sentiment among leveraged traders and, yes – a sign of capitulation,"" Vetle Lunde, market analyst at Arcane Research, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.  Offshore crypto trading platforms like Binance and Bybit offer relatively high leverage than the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange and are considered a proxy for retail leverage traders. While Binance offers 20x leverage, the CME offers 2-3x with much stricter margin requirements.  Capitulation refers to a situation when traders liquidate their loss-making positions during extended market declines in fear of incurring deeper drawdowns. It's a sign of extreme pessimism and panic selling typically seen at the end of bear markets.  So, the record low Binance premium perhaps indicates that bitcoin's bear run, which began at dizzy heights of $69,000 in mid-November, has run its course.  Supporting that conclusion is the relative optimism on Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which represents institutions and large traders.  The CME three-month rolling premium has stabilized in the 2% to 3% range since hitting lows under 1% in January, data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew show. Last week, the CME futures traded at a higher premium than those listed on Binance – the first such instance since March 2020.  ""The fact that CME's basis bottom coincided with BTC's January bottom and has since grown suggests that smart money has a more positive outlook on the market onwards, compared to its peers,"" Lunde noted.  Inflows into BITO  The relatively higher premium on the CME at least, in part, stems from increased inflows into ProShares' bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The fund's total assets under management (AUM) rose from roughly 24,500 BTC to 27,500 BTC in the four weeks to mid-February before recently falling to 27,000 BTC, shown by Arcane Research. The ProShares bitcoin ETF was launched in October on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker BITO.  ""Strong inflows to the BITO ETF contribute to CME's stable and subtle growing basis,"" Lunde said.  The above chart shows the fund witnessed outflows early this year as bitcoin cratered on fears of faster U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes. However, the trend has shifted to inflows since mid-January.  As of Feb. 24, ProShares' AUM was up 74% on a year-to-date basis while the AUM of ARK, according to data tweeted by Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas.

Shyft is focused on allowing pseudonymous entities participating in crypto transactions – such as exchanges, custodial wallets and brokerage firms – to identify each other and securely share data about their customers, as per the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its so-called “travel rule.”  The crypto industry has responded to FATF’s recommendations with a number of consortia efforts and technical initiatives that allow personally identifiable information (PII) to “travel” with crypto transactions over a certain threshold. Shyft uses blockchain technology to achieve this goal and also stands out by having large non-crypto firms like Worldpay from FIS and recently global law firm DLA Piper joining its ranks.  Worldpay, which provides card-to-crypto processor services for most of the large cryptocurrency exchanges, will become a member of the Shyft Federation, the companies said on Wednesday.  It’s about how we bridge the crypto world and the traditional world.  Worldpay will be running some of the federation nodes used by Shyft Network to validate transactions and provide data attribution, but it’s also getting involved in Shyft’s “Veriscope” travel rule solution, a smart-contract layer sitting on top of the network.  “FIS and Worldpay are getting equipped for the next generation of payments,” said Shyft co-founder Joseph Weinberg in an interview. “Having a regulatory-compliant data layer becomes critical, whether it be with stablecoins or between VASPs [virtual asset service providers], from a travel rule perspective.”  Read more: Crypto Firms Can't Outrun the Travel Rule  Weinberg views FATF’s travel rule as the beginnings of a broader decentralized identification architecture, but its first phase, which is being enormously bolstered by the likes of DLA Piper and Worldpay, is essentially about onboarding VASPs.  “It’s about how we bridge the crypto world and the traditional world,” said Weinberg. “Having institutions like DLA Piper or Worldpay being able to cross-verify these types of entities really helps establish on-chain trust in ways that we’ve never seen before.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/payments-giant-fis-worldpay-joins-shyfts-crypto-compliance-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e26f4ef1f8b7371893d04e1b517a437d96674d1f-4139x2759.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410923,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGoo,1646224200,What Tokenization Could Do for Ethereum Scaling Solutions,"StarkNet, an Ethereum zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup product created by StarkWare, made an announcement that its goal is to move to community control in either the third or fourth quarter of 2022.  While StarkNet declined to comment on whether this signaled the release of a token, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)/governance model has often relied on a governance token to establish voting rights and align the protocol’s governance with investors in the platform. Many projects in crypto have tokens, and so why would StarkNet’s potential launch be important in the industry? Ethereum’s layer 2 protocols have thus far been conflicted on whether a token is needed or whether ether should be the core token for all rollups, as well.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism use a “wrapped” ether as their base token, which pays for gas and acts as the main DEX (decentralized exchange) pairing on many decentralized finance (DeFi) assets. To post the batched rollup transactions to a mainnet, the protocols must pay on-chain transaction fees that are subsidized by the users of the rollup.  In that sense, it is understandable that Ethereum-scaling tools would use ether as the native asset. Yet rollups have struggled to gain a following comparable to what we’re seeing in alternative layer 1s, like Solana, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain. In the short term, the tokenless layer 2s are facing an uphill battle against layer 1s with billion-dollar war chests that provide the ability to incentivize builders and users to contribute to the network.  Ethereum’s Scaling Solutions Compete for Total Value Locked  By looking at the performance of tokenized Ethereum scaling tools (Polygon, Metis, Boba) vs. tokenless layer 2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, all ZK rollups), it's clear that the launch of a token economy allows networks to generate hype, build community and establish grants used for innovation and security. The total value locked (TVL) may not be permanent, but the launch of a token or an incentive program generates attention and financially encourages builders and users alike to bridge to the network.  Metis is looking to get even more creative with its tokenomics, using the Metis token for transaction fees and returning 30% of the gas paid to protocols that build on the network. The program better aligns Metis and the projects building on the network, as they now both benefit financially from stealing market share from other chains and creating a stronger ecosystem.  Outside of DeFi, Metis also uses its native token to encourage decentralization and security. Metis’ Andromeda is an Optimistic rollup, which uses sequencers to verify transactions much like Abitrum and Optimism do. However, instead of relying on a single sequencer run by the team behind the protocol, Metis intends to allow third parties to also run sequencers by staking Metis to financially prove their honesty.  The token is just one of several differences between Optimism and these other tokenized layer 2s, and so multiple factors like user experience, decentralization and transaction fees are also at play in driving adoption. Yet, it seems likely that layer 2 ecosystems would thrive like alternative layer 1s if they could also make use of the speculative valuations that are seen throughout the crypto industry.  All of this is not to say that tokenization solves everything. In fact, the tokenization of layer 2s may cause some issues within the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Crypto is so strongly narrative-driven that liquidity can become fragmented while users chase incentives. This dispersal can render applications and chains inefficient as users and liquidity are split across hundreds of applications and multiple chains.  Furthermore, tokenization can lead to short-term thinking among both developers and ecosystem participants, slowing true innovation and creating a negative feedback loop. (This same dynamic is often seen with executives and stock options.)  So while tokenization is no one-size-fits-all solution, it will certainly give select layer 2s a tool for encouraging growth and innovation. A large rollup provider like Arbitrum, Optimism or StarkWare could easily create a domino effect by launching a token, forcing other networks to follow suit to stay relevant. Surely a big player in the Ethereum rollup game will give way to the demands of ecosystem participants and venture capital firms in the near future.

Validated takes  The Aave community unanimously approved a proposal to launch the Aave ecosystem on StarkWare in February. BACKGROUND: The bootstrapping will be executed over an estimated three months, in a move to offer Aave V3 on Ethereum rollups. Deliverables for this project include “smart contracts (Ethereum/Starknet) for wrapping and bridging of aTokens,” as Aave V3 focuses on a multi-chain borrowing and lending experience for users.  The arrival of zkEVM signals the first EVM (Ethereum virtual machine)-compatible ZK rollup on Ethereum’s testnet. BACKGROUND: zkSYNC 2.0 is intended to be a key component in Ethereum’s scalability endgame. The newly deployed tool for Ethereum’s scaling issues is the first implementation of a ZK rollup that would allow developers to build and deploy decentralized applications in a low-fee, highly scalable layer 2 environment using Ethereum’s native programming language, Solidity.  An Ethereum address has received over $5 million worth of ETH to help Ukraine repel the Russian invasion. BACKGROUND: The official Twitter accounts of the Ukrainian government and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov – @Ukraine and @FedorovMykhailo – provided this wallet address in an effort to streamline global support for Ukraine against Russia. Cryptocurrency has again proven to be an effective measure for crowdsourcing and funding.  KPMG in Canada bought a World of Women non-fungible token just weeks after its first BTC purchase. BACKGROUND: Global accounting firm KPMG’s Canada branch recently marked its entry into digital collectibles by purchasing an NFT from the World of Women collection for 25 ETH. KPMG’s entrance into digital collectables is a step toward the firm building a corporate NFT strategy for its clients.

The LUNA price is moving within the historical high and has every chance to break it. The trading volumes does not yet indicate a high level of buyers&apos; aggression and remain consolidating. The main scenario we talked about in the previous analysis of 3 February has worked out. Buyers were not only able to test the $79 mark, but also surpassed themselves. Is there a high probability of the LUNA cryptocurrency correction? Yes, but before that, buyers can successfully break the historical high or a false break and stop in the range of $100, or make the final impulse to the mark of $148. https://www.tradingview.com/x/7hFqWMs8/ Currently, the LUNA cryptocurrency is one of the strongest cryptocurrencies that can actively grow while increasing Bitcoin dominance.

Another good chance to buy LUNA will come after a failed break of the $100 mark. In that case, we will expect an aggressive fall wave to the $60 range.

42416565,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVdIr,1646221152,EU Excludes 7 Russian Banks From SWIFT,"A coalition of countries blocked seven of Russia’s largest banks from accessing the SWIFT interbank messaging system in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine.  The European Commission announced Wednesday it would remove VTB Bank (Russia's second-largest lender), Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Rossiya Bank, Sovcombank and VEB (Russia's development bank) from SWIFT. Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, and Gazprombank, its third-largest lender, are not on the list.  ""It shall be prohibited as of 12 March 2022 to provide specialized financial messaging services, which are used to exchange financial data,"" to the specified banks, the bloc said in its official journal.  The bloc, alongside the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Germany and Italy, announced it was “committing” to the move on Saturday. Russia invaded Ukraine last week on a pretext of either supporting breakaway regions as independent nations or “denazification.” Various countries announced sweeping sanctions on Russian entities and oligarchs in response, including freezing assets belonging to VEB Bank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank and Sberbank, Russia’s largest financial institutions.  Cutting these banks off from SWIFT takes these sanctions a step further, preventing them from even trying to send transactions outside of Russia.  SWIFT, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a messaging system that supports international bank transactions. The network does not process transactions itself but is a critical cog in their execution.  U.S. officials said removing Russian banks from SWIFT was still “on the table” after announcing earlier sanctions last Monday. Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for international economics, told a press briefing that it would not be in the initial package.  “We have other severe measures we can take that our allies and partners are ready to take in lockstep with us, and that don’t have the same spillover effects,” he said. “But we always will monitor these options, and we’ll revise our judgments as time goes on.”  A senior EU official also said Wednesday the European Commission is checking the extent to which crypto is being to evade sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, according to a report by Reuters.  Escalations  The new restrictions on Russia's participation on SWIFT are part of an escalating series of sanctions placed on the country by the U.S., U.K., European Union and several other nations.  U.S President Joe Biden, who announced the second slate of sanctions against several major Russian banks and oligarchs, said he believed preventing these financial institutions from settling transactions in dollars or within the U.S. might be more severe than removing Russia from Swift.  ""The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence – maybe more consequence than SWIFT – number one, [and] number two, it is always an option. But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,"" Biden said earlier this week.  The U.K., Japan and EU similarly blocked Russia from their respective financial systems.  Trading volume between the ruble and bitcoin increased to a nine-month high on Monday following a plunge in the Russian currency. A similar trend was observed in the ruble-tether trading pair.  Much of the trading activity was concentrated on Binance, said Clara Medalie, an analyst for crypto research provider Kaiko. The exchange has said it would not unilaterally block Russian users, though it has committed to preventing any sanctioned individuals from using its services.  However, these sanctions have not blocked transactions with Russia outright. The U.S. even emphasized that transactions for oil and gas would be allowed, if not encouraged.  Similarly, blocking Russia from SWIFT would not completely disconnect the country from the global financial system.  Moreover, disconnecting Russia from SWIFT might accelerate any efforts the country is making to find an alternative messaging system.  Andrew Jacobson, an associate at law firm Seward and Kissel, told CoinDesk that cutting off from SWIFT might not have any long term impact on its own.  ""SWIFT is just a messaging system. It'd be an inconvenience in the short term, but ultimately in the long term, countries that have been cut off of SWIFT has still found ways to operate within the global financial system and operate domestically as well. And so I think Europe has been hesitant to cut off SWIFT,"" he said.  Swift expelled several Iranian banks in 2012, but not the whole country. Some critics of the move at the time expressed concern that Iranian officials would be able to bypass restrictions by using a non-expelled bank.

Ukraine received $1.1 million in ether (ETH), $6 million in DOT and other cryptos, after the announcement on Wednesday. This would take the country's total crypto donations to over $40 million.  Before the airdrop over $33 million in crypto had been donated to Ukraine’s war efforts.  An airdrop involves sending free tokens as an incentive for an action. Usually project creators airdrop tokens as a way of building adoption.  It’s not yet known what Ukraine's airdrop would entail. Ukraine has said that any Russian soldier who surrenders would get a payment of approximately $48,000, and crypto could play a role in this.  Tax authorities in Ukraine have said that captured Russian equipment such as tanks do not need to be declared as taxable income as “combat trophies ... were acquired not as a result of the conclusion of any type of transaction.”  However, for Ukraine tax residents an airdrop would likely be taxable income under current guidance. Tax authorities have not given a clear position on the tax liability of a non-fungible token (NFT) of a captured Russian tank.

The floki Inu coin was advertised on London's buses and metro network last year under the slogan ""Missed Doge? Get Floki.""  The ad regulator concluded the ads ""irresponsibly exploited"" consumers' fear of missing out and trivialized investment in cryptocurrency.  By suggesting that consumers who had not purchased dogecoin should invest in a newer alternative, the ads for loki inu implied it, too, would be likely to appreciate quickly in price, the ASA said.  Floki Inu had argued the ad was aimed at the ""informed customer"" and that the ""average customer"" – who was not well versed in crypto investment – would be unlikely to engage with it.  The ASA concluded, however, that crypto is a ""high profile and topical matter"" and the ads were addressed to a ""general audience.""  The ads must therefore not appear ""in the form complained about.""  Floki inu, which launched in July 2021, is priced at $0.0000444 according to data from CoinMarketCap. It hit an all-time high of $0.0003437 on Nov. 4.

BTC has retreated to roughly $43,912 on Wednesday, but is still up nearly $10,000 in the last five days and is on the verge of reclaiming January levels. Bitcoin price rose more than 5% Monday as markets processed new developments in Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, despite risk aversion pushing down blue-chip and technology sectors, which cryptocurrencies have been linked to for weeks. Markets may be underestimating the economic repercussions of Russia&apos;s financial isolation. Sanctions against Russia were placed to cripple its economy and financial systems.

LUNA surpassed ether, which has just over $28 billion in staked value at the time of writing.  Data from Staking Rewards shows over $30 billion worth of LUNA is now staked directly on various platforms, representing a majority of the token’s $34 billion market capitalization.

Cross-chain protocol Orion.money holds over $2 billion in staked LUNA, the largest among all staking applications that support LUNA. Its 43,000 stakers generate nearly 7% in yields.  Prices of LUNA rose nearly 70% in the past week amid strong fundamentals and positive sentiment among the community for Terra.

The rewards are referred to as “yields” and are usually higher than those offered by traditional institutions on deposits.  Solana’s SOL tokens remain the most staked asset with over $40 billion worth of SOL staked on various platforms. Stakers earn some 5.86% in yields annually.

Before Johnson fired Millegan, he was a vocal supporter, tweeting that he had “never seen Brantly treat anyone as different or lesser because of who they are.”  The initial decision to fire Millegan was met with some hostility from the ENS community, with members highlighting the irony of a decentralized service censuring someone for his religious beliefs.

Mikhail Mishustin, Russia’s prime minister, announced the ban during a government meeting on Tuesday. It is scheduled to go into effect on Wednesday.  The move is aimed at halting capital flight from the country, which has been hit with increasingly harsh economic sanctions from the U.S. and Europe after it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. A growing list of Western companies, including BP and Shell, have announced plans to halt investments in Russia because of the invasion.  Mishustin said that the ban would give foreign investors a “chance to make a considered decision” before selling off their Russian assets.  “In the current sanction situation, foreign entrepreneurs are forced to be guided not by economic factors, but to make decisions under political pressure,” Reuters quoted Mishustin as saying.  In addition to the ban, the Russian government movedhttps://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/russia-temporarily-bans-non-residents-044800861.html Monday to prevent brokers from selling foreigner-held securities on the Moscow Exchange.

The punk fetched a sales price of $31,300 in February 2021, the last time it was sold. The donor has a collection of several other Punks, according to his wallet address.  It landed amid a banner streak for Ukraine’s fast-accelerating crypto campaign: over $10 million raised in ETH, DOT, USDT, BTC and other crypto tokens on Tuesday alone, the single-largest day since Ukraine began asking for donations on Feb 26.  Earlier Tuesday, Michael Chobanian, a Ukrainian crypto exchange founder who is helping the Ministry of Digital Transformation handle donations, told CoinDesk TV that at least $14 million of donated crypto had already been spent on military hardware and supplies for civilians, including food and gas.  “The majority of spending is actually done in crypto,” Chobanian said at the time. He previously told CoinDesk that Kuna, his exchange, operates the wallets used by the Ukrainian government.

42421644,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotQr,1646189805,How to Make Blockchain a New Kind of Economic Engine,"The blockchain industry seems unique, new and frantic, but the evolutionary pattern of new industries over time is eerily consistent. Consider the California gold rush, the global oil boom or the rise of the internet.  Each of these economic disruptions saw a similar pattern. The first is a shift from speculation to substance. Each industry that survived began with the promise of riches, with speculation in these new worlds accelerated by marketing, often highlighting the sizzle. All of it is designed to create true believers and drive adoption.  W. Sean Ford is chief operating officer of Algorand, a blockchain platform that powers the creator economy and a range of projects that converge traditional and decentralized finance.  The second element of economic disruptions is shifting demographics. Over time, the mix of people who are early adopters changes, and other types of individuals, institutions and companies start to move in. These new participants then put pressure on the field to introduce what is necessary to successfully build these new industries.  Third, the value that's created in these new sectors often comes after the initial dust settles. It's the second wave of participants that start steering things toward building real businesses, with fundamentals that become the foundation for sustained growth.  The blockchain industry is shifting to substance. The fundamental understanding of what is possible is far clearer. We've seen lots of use cases. The demographics have shifted. Institutional capital is entering the space. You know you're starting to get somewhere when there is the potential or actual use of blockchain by tens of millions of people who don't necessarily even know that they're using blockchain.  The good news for blockchain is that an increasing number of people want to understand the technology and how to create value in a meaningful way. The more sophisticated the participant is, the greater the demands placed on the industry. Traditional models for understanding value in our space do not conveniently translate from what was used in the past.  The question is, with an industry that's often been so focused on short-term value, how do we create enduring value, and what does it look like?  There's no great definition of enduring value. However, I’ve adapted a concept from Michael Porter, who wrote a number of books on competitive advantage and strategy, which focuses on long-term economic decision-making. According to Porter, the core attributes of value creation remain consistent, regardless of technology and pace of change. If we apply this thinking now, then all the hype around the blockchain and crypto market volatility is irrelevant to the essentials of value. What really matters is what this technology ultimately enables – real, long-lasting value.  From the beginning, this long-term focus has been a core part of how we think about building value at Algorand. When we launched the company in 2019, I struggled with how to describe what we were trying to build. The best I could come up with is that we were building a new type of economic engine, like a national economy or country, where all types of value, data and immutable records can be created and exchanged on a global scale.  What are the qualities you seek in a traditional economy?  Infrastructure quality – the roads, bridges, pipes, bandwidth, etc. These grant the ability to confidently exchange value.  The ease of doing business. What are the barriers to participate for the broader group of people that are in your economy? Those can be the difficulties of starting a business, taxes and tariffs and a country’s immigration. All these issues create barriers.  Access to education. You need to be able to create a place where people can easily access information and understand how to build. The reason for that is it becomes the core of innovation in your economy. If you don't, it will likely stagnate.  Sustainability. For example, major automakers are now shifting to electronic vehicles. Of course, economic activity is at the center of that.  A simple view is that the combination of all these attributes working together dictates the pace of innovation. For example, Singapore invested heavily 50 years ago in education, technology, favorable trade practices and simplifying the ease of doing business. Its per capita gross domestic product 50 years ago was less than $1,000. Now it’s about $60,000 per capita.  The question is, what's the biggest variable to performance from one nation to the other? How much friction exists in each of those areas? More friction leads to a slower pace and these four pieces working together more ineffectively. Imagine if you could build a new economy from scratch. What if you could do it in a way that removes the friction?  The blockchain where the future of finance will be built is one that has zero downtime, zero forking and complete finality. It will need a strong community of active developers, and a growing number of users and use cases. It would also need to be built with sustainability in mind.  The ultimate winners in this space will be those who are relentless in their pursuit of removing friction and focus on building enduring value.  Where does the blockchain industry go next? The best thing we can do is try to roll out a robust standard of economic indicators that are consistently measured and applied across all web protocols. We will find the right measures and metrics to show which projects create real value and to let the real winners succeed and progress quickly.  The blockchains that succeed will continue to innovate, build and create a new kind of economic engine that has an enduring value on the best technical infrastructure in the world. That is what ultimately matters.",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,W.

42416584,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVe8D,1646179935,"First Mover Asia: China’s Potential SWIFT Competitor CIPS Won't Help Russia Much; Bitcoin, Ether Rise Again","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Markets: Cryptos continued their momentum from Monday.  Insights: China's interbank payment system lacks the reach to replace SWIFT.  Technician's take: BTC buyers could remain active at lower support levels, particularly at $40K.  And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $44,224 +2.5%  Ether (ETH): $2,959 +1.7%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Bitcoin BTC +2.7% Currency Chainlink LINK +2.1% Computing Ethereum ETH +1.9% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP −4.1% Computing Filecoin FIL −2.8% Computing Bitcoin Cash BCH −1.8% Currency  Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptocurrencies continued their momentum from Monday even as Russia escalated its efforts to take control of Ukraine.  On Tuesday, a 40-mile-long Russian convoy of armored vehicles, tanks and towed artillery chugged relentlessly toward Kyiv. Ukraine's capital and Kharkiv, its second largest city, were rocked by rocket explosions as an estimated half-million people, including foreign nationals who study and work in Ukraine, fled the country.  Crypto's performance veered markedly from equities, particularly risk-on stocks. Among the major indexes, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively. A number of analysts say that the invasion has highlighted cryptos' potential usefulness for investors.  According to an estimate by Forklog, a Russian-language crypto news outlet, various organizations raising crypto for Ukraine have received over $58 million in donations over the past six days. And Arcane Research in a Tuesday report wrote that Ukrainians were ""buying crypto as never before,"" fearful that the country's banking system ""may collapse.""  Meanwhile, Russian investors have been looking at crypto as a workaround to economic sanctions by the European Union and U.S. In its report, Arcane Research wrote of a ""massive increase in the ruble pairs on Binance, particularly in USDT,"" and in bitcoin volume. The group speculated that Russians were seeking ""stablecoins to get dollar exposure ahead of possible sanctions directed toward Russian crypto traders,"" or because ""market makers seeking to eliminate their ruble exposure.""  At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading at about $44,200, up about 3% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was changing hands at a little below $3,000, a more than 2% increase. Almost all other altcoins in the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap were trading higher, with SHIB and SAND both up about 5%.  ""Investors are speculating that crypto will become increasingly important as apolitical, trustless money in a time of escalating geopolitical uncertainty,"" Arcane Research wrote.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,306 -1.5%  DJIA: 33,294 -1.7%  Nasdaq: 13,532 -1.6%  Gold: $1,945 +1.9%  Insights  Wannabe SWIFT competitor CIPS doesn't have the reach to help Russia much  As the reality of sanctions sinks in for Russia – an energy superpower and a top 15, global economy – so do the warnings that this is a moment for China’s financial infrastructure to shine.  China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) can step up to the occasion to replace the SWIFT interbank messaging service, argued some observers, for Russian banks that are now disconnected from the world.  “When payment systems are politicized, then you have to be sure you're on the right side of the leviathan at all times,” is how one ex-venture capitalist put it in his Twitter thread.  (It's unclear if the civilians in Ukraine who are being bombed think of their situation as being ""politicized"" or have a stronger term for it.)  Despite numerous calls that these sanctions are the beginning of the twilight of dollar hegemony, China’s financial infrastructure just isn’t up to the task of replacing it.  It’s important to remember just how small CIPS really is.  According to data published on its website, the service pushed through 388 billion RMB, or $61 billion a day, in February. Binance does that in turnover in less than 72 hours, and FTX, another crypto exchanges, does it in 18 days.  Of course, those comparisons are specious; Binance CEO Changpeng Zhou and FTX Trading CEO Sam Bankman-Fried aren’t our new financial overlords. They just run exchanges. We aren’t going to pay for things in Binance’s BNB or BUSD tokens.  But the idea that CIPS could seriously compete with SWIFT is also specious when some crypto exchanges are already larger entities.  The system still relies on SWIFT for messaging (the bank-to-bank ledgers that show fund transfers). While CIPS can do transfers within China and Hong Kong, moving funds abroad requires SWIFT’s rails. And that’s going to make the whole operation redundant as sanctioned Russian banks can’t touch SWIFT.  So then how big is CIPS compared to SWIFT? Really, really small.  According to its own stats, SWIFT pushes through 50 million messages a day compared with CIPS' 15,000. And its daily volume? SWIFT messages enable $5 trillion to move worldwide each day.  SWIFT counts 11,000 members as institutions. CIPS has 75 direct participants and 1,205 indirect participants. There just isn’t a comparison in size and scale.  If there’s a ‘bull case’ for CIPS rocketing to the moon and taking on SWIFT, there’s also a case – maybe even a stronger one – of Ripple’s RippleNet messaging service doing the same. Yes, the same Ripple that’s being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently reported on Twitter that the network is about to eclipse the $10 billion mark in volume and continues to grow.  The important thing is that the underlying currencies used on the RippleNet are liquid. China’s yuan is not. For CIPS to challenge the world, there needs to be a freely convertible currency behind it.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Bounce Stalls, Resistance Between $44K and $46K  Bitcoin has rallied 13% over the past week as bearish sentiment waned. The cryptocurrency, however, faces immediate resistance at $44,000 to $46,000, which could stall the price recovery over the short term.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is overbought, similar to what occurred in early February, which preceded a pullback in price. This time, however, there has been a significant loss of downside momentum, which means buyers could remain active at lower support.  For now, bitcoin is stuck in a range of between $37,000 and $46,000, pointing to a potential reversal of a three-month-long downtrend. That means buying volume will need to increase on pullbacks in order to cause a shift in trends.
