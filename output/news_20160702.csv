42378803,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmUJ,1467470193,Controlling the Perception that Bitcoin is Broken,"Jim Harper is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.  In this opinion piece, Harper reflects on recent elements of the bitcoin scaling debate and what it means for perceptions of the digital currency's viability.  Bitcoin doesn’t care. It continues to develop a monetary, financial, economic, intellectual, and social ecosystem around itself. But a pair of reports in the mainstream media makes Bitcoin look broken. Arguing with the messenger is an option. But the better path is to get on with the hard work of fixing up Bitcoin in perception and reality.  Unfair? Perhaps. A Planet Money podcast finding that Bitcoin wouldn’t relay a simple transaction appears to have been conducted on software that didn’t supply the fee required under current conditions. In light of such reports, new users may hesitate to get involved. Their reluctance may retard Bitcoin’s growth and slow desirable advances in global financial inclusion, financial privacy, autonomy, and monetary and financial stability, as well as Bitcoin’s growth in value on exchanges worldwide.  For Bitcoin’s technical sophisticates, doing a transaction that way is just dumb. But there is a good argument that transaction fees were supposed to supplant mined bitcoins over the next hundred years. Wallet software and the knowledge to use it in a market for transaction-inclusion services were arguably meant to evolve over that span, not in the last year.  So if New York Times reporter Nathanial Popper was playing the role of everyman when he sent his transaction to oblivion, he represented a large number of Bitcoin users and a huge number of non-users. The technical and social capital for transaction fees is still in the earliest stages of development.  In his Times piece on mining in China, Popper sounded notes that must surely rankle Bitcoin Core developers and their supporters. He characterized them as having “resisted changing the software,” when in fact they’ve been working hard to optimize the software for their preferred 1MB blocksize limit.  Now Bitcoin is broken – at least in the eyes of millions of New York Times readers and Planet Money listeners. It is looking to them like Bitcoin is a technically constrained payment system that is hard to use.  What to do? The expression “never argue with someone who buys ink by the barrel” needs updating, but its import is unchanged. When the ink hits the paper or the editor hits “publish,” what’s done is done.  Bitcoin Core’s philosophy and plans are not well understood. The community around Core has not communicated effectively with Popper and others outside their circle. They have yet to establish in the popular mind that they have a vision for a fully secure Bitcoin ecosystem with capacity to rival or supplant today’s dominant payment and monetary systems.  Some in the Chinese mining community may share these concerns. At the time of this writing, rumors are swirling that a recent meeting in China produced an agreement to shift away from Core to a software version that supports bigger block sizes.  There are reasons why they might make this change. Core offers miners increased fees, which are surely welcome (if constraining, as Popper’s reporting suggests). Over the long term, Core’s plan for off-chain transactions would diminish the role of the blockchain, with uncertain results for miners.  The alternative, a bigger blocksize and greater on-blockchain through-put, doesn’t promise much in near-term fees. But it does support the simple vision of a massive blockchain-based payment system, supported by increasingly valuable digital money.  Core may offer miners the role of “big fish in a small pond.” Bitcoin Classic might make miners big fish in a big pond. For the Core side, of course, that skates dangerously close to mining centralization, which threatens Bitcoin’s very foundations.  There is no way forward but forward. Miners, node operators, and ordinary Bitcoin users should constantly assess whether the software version they run is the best for the ecosystem and themselves. Proponents of different software versions should make their cases in the most persuasive terms they can. This means open debate that avoids rancor, personal attacks, technical attacks, and censorship.  Why is it important to conduct the debate on a high plane? The third actor. The blocksize debate is not just about competing versions of Bitcoin’s philosophy, future, and software. It is an exhibition for non-Bitcoin-users about the type of people that adopt cryptocurrency. Every side in the blocksize debate is displaying to the wider world what the “crypto world” is like.  Bitcoin is not broken, though news reports may have convinced some people that it is. The goal of stalwarts on any side of the development debates must be to ensure that their own actions help rehabilitate Bitcoin’s public image and don’t bring down what they are working so hard to build.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jim Harper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/07/02/controlling-the-perception-that-bitcoin-is-broken,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/041671ef679df6cff05152769d0acb79a09268ec-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378801,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmQX,1467468970,Political Party Envisions How Blockchain Could Enable Brexit Revote,"Australia's Flux Party wants democracy to be more like technology.  Built on the idea that cryptocurrency tokens riding on a blockchain network can act as a platform for online voting, the Flux Party is seeking to lower the hurdles for passing legislation, thereby helping governments better keep pace in today’s connected, fast-growing world.  More broadly, though, the minor political party wants government to operate in a constant state of change, and to use blockchain technology to deliver on this goal.  According to co-founder of the Flux Party Max Kaye, the main problem with politics is that it’s stagnant and slow-moving, an environment where those that make it to the top, stay at the top, and those who make it prefer wheeling and dealing for their benefit to doing good for the people.  This is especially prominent in Australia, the Flux Party contends, where corruption is rampant and constituents are disillusioned with those currently in power. As evidence, the group cites how the two major political parties opposed a federal commission against corruption like the state-based Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC).  The Flux movement is all about the reorganization of power and direct empowerment, a similar goal to most cryptocurrency projects. Although many times, these things are easier said than accomplished.  Cryptocurrency projects that have tried similar initiatives have been plagued by governance issues, often trying to give everyone a say no matter how educated or emotional they are about a particular topic.  For instance, bitcoin enthusiasts are still split on relatively minor protocol details such as the size of its transaction blocks, and since The DAO got attacked, some in the ethereum community want to pursue technical changes to regain control of lost user funds. Others think that would be an overstep of the ethereum team’s power, but complicating matters is that the network lacks an effective or inclusive governance process dictating how this decision will be made.  But Kaye and his co-founder, Nathan Spataro have thought a lot about such issues and believe they have novel solutions.  In Kaye’s mind, the systems could work like this: If a lot of constituents decided not to vote on allowing the death penalty because they didn’t think it would ever get passed, and then it does, a new ballot could go out the next day. And because the death penalty is very much disavowed in Australia, people would turn out to vote to undo that.  Preventing a Brexit  It’s envisioned as a highly reactive system, one that some UK citizens might wish they had. After some 'Brexit' – the UK referendum to vote to leave or remain a part of the European Union – supporters came out saying they regret their decision as the economic repercussions of the country’s uncertainty magnifies.  And, according to Kaye, the Flux Party’s democracy-as-a-service platform is impregnable to corruption. Within the platform, every constituent gets one voting token per issue that can be spent for a ""yes"" or ""no"".  There are also tokens called ‘political points’ that can be traded if a constituent doesn’t want to vote on a particular issue and instead wants to give his or her vote to another person. Political points can also be used to put an issue forward for a vote.  ""We try and isolate the monetary economy from the voting economy,"" Kaye remarked.  The Flux Party adds opportunity cost into the equation to stop people from voting randomly for issues they are not well-versed in or don’t care about. Because users can gain political points by not voting, they are given positive reinforcement to vote only on issues they care about.  It's a bit like an auction where individuals can make bids on voting tokens not being used. Political points will be created all the time and then distributed equally among all users.  In an effort to dissuade speculation, the tokens cannot be exchanged for real-world value such as fiat money, which should also discourage electoral training or the means of buying votes, a process banned in many countries and looked down upon in most others.  ""We go to great lengths to make sure this is a very egalitarian project that gives everyone a say,"" said Kaye. ""It’s like capitalism if you had a large tax on income plus a basic income as well.”  Vote for idealism  Currently, the Flux Party is aiming to get one representative in Tasmania's Senate during the 2nd July election. In Australia, he said, this isn’t such a long shot since someone can get elected with as little as 14,000 votes.  While Flux’s membership is currently only 3,048, it’s one of the more popular minor parties in the country. And Kaye says the party is starting a $25,000 social media campaign in the weeks leading up to the election.  Throughout the rest of the year, the Flux Party will be putting representatives up in state elections and council-level elections. The candidates are all volunteers (plus Kaye and Spataro), but none of these participants will be voting with their consciences.  Instead the representatives will vote in proportion to how their constituents vote on the Flux platform. For example, if 50% of constituents vote in favor of a bill and 50% vote against a bill, three Flux representatives will vote for and three will vote against.  In an effort to keep the Flux platform decentralized, the platform will anchor all votes to the bitcoin blockchain. This decision, they argue, keeps Kaye and the Flux startup out of a powerful role holding the voter data.  The startup will use a distributed hash table that’s stored off chain which is linked to one hash stored in a bitcoin transaction that can represent a million votes.  While this may sound esoteric, and many reports have called the Flux Party's antics – running on a platform of parliamentary reform instead of the traditional platform of jobs and growth, etc – idealistic, Kaye thinks it’s more pragmatic than a starry-eyed vision of an equitable future.  ""If we’re right, this is the sort of thing that makes democracy 10 times better than what we have now,"" he said, adding:  ""It’s worth the gamble.""
