42398036,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE4K,1414620016,Bitcoin Gambling Site SatoshiBet No Longer Accepting US Customers,"Popular bitcoin gambling site SatoshiBet has announced that it will now restrict US customers from accessing its platform.  In its announcement posted on Reddit, SatoshiBet cited both the uncertain future of online gambling regulation in the US and future legal problems that could result from servicing American customers.  The move comes amid a tightening legal environment for companies that offer bitcoin-denominated gaming and gambling. Last month, a move by the Spanish government to deem bitcoin an electronic payment system resulted in bitcoin gambling site operators needing to obtain licensure.  SatoshiBet said its legal team advised it to avoid the US market entirely to reduce potential legal exposure, adding:  “This does not mean SatoshiBet or gambling with or without cryptocurrencies is illegal in the US. The definition by US courts is as of yet highly unclear, adding cryptocurrencies to the equation only further clouds a definite judgement.”  SatoshiBet founder Adrian Scholz told CoinDesk that any US customers who had funds deposited on the site at the time of the lockout should contact the company for instructions on how to receive funds.  A proactive move  In its announcement, SatoshiBet stressed that the move is unrelated to any government action or investigation. Rather, the company said, it is looking to stave off any potential future conflict given its past activity in the US market.  The company explained:  “To be clear, we have not been in contact with any government institutions, this is solely a proactive measure as a reaction to the fast moving regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies.”  SatoshiBet added that it has never handled any currencies other than bitcoin, ostensibly in an effort to distance itself from any action that could make the company run afoul of money transmission regulations in the US.  Customer funds accessible  The move will also likely affect the popularity of the website, as Scholz told CoinDesk that roughly 20% of its traffic comes from sources in the US.  Still, he indicated that the company is seeking to end its involvement with customers responsibly. He said all balances belonging to US customers will be returned upon request, saying:  “All existing US players will get their remaining balance if any returned. Most players deposit/play/withdraw, so the total amount that needs to be returned is fairly reasonable.”  He added that SatoshiBet could one day return to the US market, but such a move would only happen if enough legal security is established in the future.  “We of course hope that at some point in time sufficient clarity is established by lawmakers, that perhaps allows us to reenter the market,” Scholz said.

42398030,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFDzP,1414618520,Study: Half of US Small Businesses Aren't Ready to Accept Bitcoin,"A new study suggests that consumers and businesses in the United States remain apprehensive about the prospect of using digital currency, as well as digital payment tools and platforms currently available on the market.  Software research firm Software Advice surveyed roughly 400 small business owners and customers, who answered a series of questions regarding their willingness to use digital currencies should they become more widely adopted.  About two-thirds of consumer participants suggested that they are unlikely to use bitcoin or other digital currencies, with 49% specifying that they are “not likely at all”. 50% of business owners surveyed said their companies are not equipped to handle digital currency usage, though 19% said that they have taken steps to accept it.  The results of the survey echo previous surveys of consumer and business sentiment toward bitcoin in which those groups have expressed an unwillingness to buy or use digital currencies.  As the report noted:  “When respondents were asked about their likelihood to use digital currency in the event that it becomes more broadly accepted, the results were split. Approximately half (49%) were ‘not at all likely’ to use digital currency even if it were widely accepted. Another 18% reported that they were ‘minimally likely’ to do so.”  Business owners cite unreadiness  While the regulatory framework for digital currency use as a mainstream payment method is still taking shape, companies may have to face tax requirements and transaction reporting standards if they operate in the US or do business with with American customers.  Many companies that took part in Software Advice’s survey suggested that they aren’t ready to handle the reporting requirements that would come with accepting digital currencies. 39% said they had no preparations in place to do so, and an additional 14% suggested they had minimally prepared to report digital currency earnings.  At the same time, 34% of businesses in the survey indicated that they had plans in place to report digital currencies in their Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filings. Of that number, 27% said they were “very prepared”.  A larger number of small businesses said that they aren’t ready for the financial reporting requirements they may be subject to in the future, according to Software Advice.  The firm says in its report:  “Readiness here was lower than for tax preparation, with the majority being ill-prepared (42% ‘not at all prepared’ and 17% ‘minimally prepared’). 17% were only ‘somewhat prepared’, while the smallest numbers of respondents were ‘very prepared’ (15%) or ‘ahead of the curve’ (9%).”  Small businesses also expressed broad apprehension to working with companies in the digital currency space. 54% said they weren’t prepared to make deals with firms in the bitcoin space, though roughly 30% said they had taken steps to make such partnerships.  SMB software challenges  The same group of business owners expressed concerns that their existing software infrastructure isn't ready for digital currencies.  70% suggested they are unconfident about having the necessary means to accept digital currency, with the remaining 30% indicating they have such means.  Software Advice explained in its report:  “A number of businesses still had faith that their accounting software would be able to meet the needs brought about by digital currency, with 13% being ‘moderately confident’, 11% ‘very confident’ and 6% ‘extremely confident’.”  The report didn’t indicate how small businesses feel about the prospect of having these concerns addressed in the future. However, it cited the emerging business-to-business ecosystem for digital currencies as a positive sign for US companies, and noted how the evolving nature of bitcoin regulation on both the state and federal levels could result in more clarity – and comfort – for business owners.

42398034,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE3L,1414612851,Argentina's Stock Exchange Hosts VCs and Finance Pros for Bitcoin Roundtable,"The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange played host to the Argentine Venture Capital Meeting yesterday, an annual presentation and networking event meant to connect Argentina's financial markets and venture capital industries.  The event was free for attendees and planned by financial social network Puerto Finanzas in collaboration with Buenos Aires-based VC fund Primary Ventures and the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, the organisation responsible for the operation of the country's primary stock market.  Six panelists  showcased their ideas on different subjects ranging from the role of central banks in global finance to money laundering and know-your-customer (KYC) policies. The meeting focused on bitcoin in an effort to bring members of both industries greater understanding of a topic that the main organizer, Puerto Finanzas founder Augusto Hassel, sees as increasingly relevant to VCs and financial professionals.  Hassel said that while many entrepreneurs in Argentina are trying to launch new bitcoin ventures, these efforts have so far failed to gather traction.  He said:  “They are a bit unorganized and they don't know the formal market from the investment standpoint. They are against everyone – against the central bank, against venture capitalists, against everyone because they think that bitcoin is only anarchy.”  For attending members of the stock exchange, he said, the event was meant to serve as a primer on how bitcoin could affect their work.  ""I wanted to include bitcoin this year because I think it speaks to everyone at the event [...] those trying to invest in the new bitcoin industry and those in the finance industry as I believe bitcoin will transform this industry."" he said.  Silvia Torres Carbonell, director of the IAE Business School Center for Entrepreneurship; Carlos Lerner, head of business development and SMEs in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange; Diego Gonzalez Bravo, managing partner at Cygnus Capital; Carlos Maslatón, head of Xapo Network; Lisandro Bril, managing partner at AxVentures and​ Holdinvest Tech Funds, and; Francisco Buero, cofounder and COO of Bitex.la were present for the discussion.  Bitcoin’s third wave  Maslatón, who delivered the presentation on bitcoin, told CoinDesk his goal was to show attendees how bitcoin provides a private, self-regulated, worldwide monetary system that competes but does not seek to combat other currencies, government-backed or not.  Maslatón explained that bitcoin is now in its third wave. The first, he said, took place between about 2010 and 2013 when just the existence of bitcoin was a goal.  “They were mostly technological developers, including miners,"" he said. ""The great bullish trend we saw until the area of the $1,200 was naturally corrected down, as always happens with any financial product or real estate good.”  This year has been a short wave; a year of price consolidation, he said, and the beginning of a bullish period toward the digital currency now that bitcoin has resisted many attacks from regulators worldwide, from the mainstream media and public opinion.  In its third phase, Maslatón predicts that bitcoin won't be a mere investment instrument but that will also “operate as a normal currency” – something which Xapo will help it to achieve.  He said:  “Xapo is more concentrated on bitcoin uses than in creating a new exchange where people simply buy and sell. This new bitcoin wave is for those that have no comprehension of the mining procedures and, more than that, have no interest in involving mining or of understanding the mining processes.”  Latin American presence  Latin America is often cited as the market with the greatest potential for bitcoin to flourish. Speaking to CoinDesk, Maslatón said that regulated markets, central planning, statism, socialism, banking crises and inflationary and deflationary recessions have created what has become a common mentality in the region where citizens favor the informal economy.  He added that Xapo’s statistics show the number of bitcoin users in Argentina as being “overrepresented” in comparison to the 41 million people that live there.  Still, for people in countries like Argentina or Venezuela that can’t purchase foreign currencies outside the black market or transfer funds freely, bitcoin has been the solution in most cases, Maslatón said.  He estimated:  “I would say that with the present government policy, Argentina has to be the number one country in the world in terms of annual percentage of increase in the transactions in comparison with its population. And the government, really, has not any chance to discover these, for themselves, informal operations.”  Note: Some comments were edited for clarity.

42398040,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFEAE,1414608057,Vogogo Secures Key Payments Partnership Ahead of US Expansion,"Vogogo has announced a new partnership with Knox Payments that will enable its future US clients in the digital currency industry to accept payment from any US bank account and to better access commercial banking.  More specifically, the agreement will connect the Calgary-based regulatory and risk compliance specialist to its new partner's USD payments network and domestic banking connections. Vogogo raised $8.5m in funding in August to extend its solutions to new target markets, including the US and Europe.  Vogogo  CEO Geoff Gordon positioned the news as an important step in the international expansion of his company, albeit one that would benefit the wider US bitcoin industry as it seeks to bolster its compliance and risk management in line with direction from regulators.  Given the banking challenges facing the bitcoin industry, Gordon told CoinDesk that bitcoin exchanges and processors are already lining up to apply for the service:  ""Our sales queue is already very, very long. We already have more merchants than we could possibly handle in terms of processing. Of course, we're talking to everybody, [but] we're to have to be very selective about who we work with in these early days in the US market. There's certainly a lot of business out there.""  Launched in 2008, Vogogo serves clients in the e-commerce space as well, providing risk management, compliance tools and online payment services. The company's backers include Beacon Securities, Clarus Securities, Cormark Securities, Genuity Corp and Salmon Partners.  Expedited US launch  Gordon indicated that the partnership with Knox will allow Vogogo to push up its US launch by an estimated two to four weeks, while using the company's proprietary cross-payments platform, which transacts payments in real time.  Gordon said the companies were able to find a way to benefit each other, with Vogogo providing its experience and Knox its banking relationship.  ""We brought the missing piece of the puzzle for them, that's the result of this agreement,"" Gordon said, stressing his hope that Vogogo's service will now enable more businesses in the bitcoin and wider digital currency space to obtain the tools they need to serve US customers effectively.  ""At a very base level, [cryptocurrency companies] are struggling to get access to banking, because they don't have the risk management and the compliance to effectively convince a bank to work with them and to work with them in a commercial capacity,"" Gordon explained.  Knox takes interest in industry  Knox Payments CMO Charles Merritt emphasized in an interview that the ACH payments specialist will in turn gain the ability to serve clients in the cryptocurrency community with an innovative compliance product.  Merritt framed his company's interest in bitcoin as part of its wider goal of enabling better and more cost-effective digital transactions.  ""Cryptocurrency is the outcome of some very large developments in technology and shifts in how we think about money as a store of value and our hope with Vogogo is to understand a little bit about how that market works,"" Merritt said.  Merritt added that he has purchased bitcoin because he believes it is ""personally fascinating"", and that a number of employees on the Knox Payments staff are passionate about the potential applications of the technology.  Launched in February with $900,000 in funding, Knox is currently working in a number of sectors of the payments space, including cryptocurrency, though the company said it will not seek to specialize in any one area.

42398037,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE6I,1414603119,Coinbase's New Multisig Vault Gives Users Control Over Keys,"UPDATE (29th October, 21:30 BST): Updated with comment from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.      Coinbase announced today it is adding multi-signature (multisig) features to its Vault product, giving users greater control of their own security.  The company's Vault feature initially launched in July and is aimed at users wishing to store larger amounts of bitcoin in a more secure manner over longer periods, with delayed withdrawals and multiple approvals.  Different than Coinbase's regular wallet, Multisig and regular Vault accounts are not intended for everyday spending, and lack certain convenience features like API access, two-click checkout, pre-authorized debit/subscription payments and off-block chain microtransactions.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong sought to frame the new service as one that would appeal to the platform's more tech-savvy bitcoin users as well as new institutional clients that want a secure way to manage their bitcoin holdings.  Armstrong said:  ""The multisig vault will [...] help onboard large institutions such as hedge funds and high-net-worth individuals who don't want the counterparty risk of Coinbase storing their bitcoin.""  Customer demand  In a blog post this morning, Coinbase said several Vault users had demanded control over their own private keys in the wake of security breaches leading to money loss at other exchanges.  ""Users are rightfully cautious about anyone claiming to store their bitcoin,"" the post said, adding that Coinbase now stores more bitcoin than any other company in the world, as far as it knows.  Multisig private keys will be optional for users who feel safer with this option, while Coinbase will still maintain its own security systems for regular Vault users.  Coinbase will not be able to move funds from multisig storage by itself, protecting users from potential contingencies like hacking attacks or bankruptcy of the company. It also means that Multisig Vault users assume responsibility for storing their keys, which the company is now unable to decrypt and produce if a user forgets his or her passphrase.  In statements, Armstrong acknowledged the larger arguments surrounding how it handles customer funds.  ""I think even if some customers choose to let Coinbase manage security for them, they will appreciate the fact that we provide this option since then it will be their choice,"" he said.  Notably, the company has also produced an open-source tool for users to be able to retrieve their coins should the site go offline.  Multiple keys  Multisig Vaults for individuals feature the 'two-of-three' key structure, where Coinbase and the customer retain one key each, and Coinbase will keep a third shared key that is encrypted by the user's passphrase.  Users can withdraw spend bitcoins using just their own private key and the shared key, without needing to go through Coinbase. For organizations or families, there is also the option to create 'three-of-five' Multisig Vaults with multiple key holders.  Armstrong stressed that he feels that Coinbase's adoption of multisig technology continues an industry-wide trend that has been ongoing this year.  ""I feel multisig was a very important innovation for the bitcoin community and there have been some great product announcements now as a result of that in 2014,"" he said.  Multisig Vault, like Coinbase's regular Vault, is a free service and available to all users from today.

42398025,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFDuU,1414598480,GoCoin Brings Altcoin Payments to Shopify Merchants,"GoCoin has become the latest payment processor to be integrated into the Shopify e-commerce platform, joining Coinbase and BitPay in offering cryptocurrency payments options to merchants on the platform.  Unlike Coinbase and BitPay, however, GoCoin will allow merchants to take payments not only in bitcoin, but also the altcoins dogecoin and litecoin.  Eric Benz, GoCoin's business development advisor, said the deal has been months in the making, and was only completed because Shopify merchants like GAW Miners asked the e-commerce platform for altcoin payment options.  Benz explained:  ""In the beginning when we reached out to [Shopify], they were quite unresponsive ... but a lot of the merchants we work with actually power their platform ... They actually pushed for Shopify to work with us.""  Louis Kearns, Shopify's product director in charge of integrations, confirmed that merchant demand was a factor in its decision to work with GoCoin.  ""GoCoin facilitates payments for additional cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin. This was requested by certain shop verticals. GoCoin took advantage of our open gateway APIs, so we could add them to our platform without much work,"" he said.  Focus on boys' toys  With the integration, GoCoin will be made available as a payment option to more than 120,000 merchants who conduct their online sales through the Shopify platform. The list of merchants using the platform now includes companies like General Electric and Tesla Motors.  Benz said that a pilot programme to test the integration between GoCoin and Shopify showed rapidly growing payment volumes from merchants. GoCoin, he added, has worked with several existing clients, predominantly cryptocurrency miners, to test the Shopify integration over the last eight weeks, with payment volume for those miners increasing threefold over the period.  GoCoin will be focusing on Shopify merchants like miners and tech-focused retailers to promote their integration with the e-commerce platform. The firm will also push for services providers, like developers of social games, to use its services for sales completed through Shopify, Benz said.  Special projects, promotions and generate media attention will be developed for merchants in those categories, he added.  ""Our focus is on the miners, electronics – 'boys' toys',"" he said.  'Victory for altcoins'  Benz described the new partnership as a major victory for the altcoin markets and a signal that his firm had become a serious contender in the payments processing business.  ""This is a big boost to the altcoin market that we're really excited about ... it shows that we want to compete with the biggest names in the business. There are only three processors on Shopify now and we're one of them.""  Kearns told CoinDesk that Shopify had already processed ""tens of millions"" of bitcoin transactions from ""thousands"" of merchants to date.  The firm welcomed the ability to provide more payment options to its merchants, he said, adding:  ""We're always looking for new technologies that will help our merchants ... the partnership with GoCoin provides anyone on our platform with the option to accept multiple cryptocurrencies.""  Last week, GoCoin announced that it had signed up the regulated gambling platform Cozy Games to allow bitcoin and altcoin payments for players on its platform.  Just days before that announcement, mining hardware and services company BitFury said it had completed a strategic investment for an undisclosed amount in GoCoin. The firm said it would seek to use the payments company as the default processor for its global vendors.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/29/gocoin-brings-altcoin-payments-to-shopify-merchants,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5198385edc935c000d7002e41ea767e856567af-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398035,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE5J,1414590675,"Bitcoin-Over-Tor Anonymity 'Can Be Busted for $2,500 a Month'","Using bitcoin over the anonymity network Tor leaves users at greater risk of having their identities revealed, according to academics at the University of Luxembourg.  If that seemingly paradoxical finding isn't enough to scare privacy-loving bitcoiners, the researchers also determined that an attack could be mounted on an ""economy"" budget of just $2,500 a month.  Such an attack could expose the identity of a bitcoin and Tor user, and allow the attacker to meddle with the victim's transactions, they said.  Ivan Pustogarov, one of the two researchers working on the issue, explained:  ""The problem here is with anonymity. When people are connecting through Tor, they are expecting to have a higher level of anonymity ... it does provide some level of anonymity, but it is not that hard to break this.""  The attack is laid out in a paper titled, Bitcoin Over Tor Isn't A Good Idea, written by Pustogarov, a doctoral student at CryptoLUX, the University of Luxembourg's cryptology research group, and Alex Biryukov, an associate professor who leads the group.  Pustogarov said the paper is to be submitted for peer-review to be presented at a cryptography and information security conference.  'Virtual bitcoin reality'  The sort of manipulation described by the authors is known as a 'man-in-the-middle' attack (MitM) and, if successful, could reveal a user's IP address, which can be used to locate the user, and allow an attacker to 'glue', or correlate, the transactions performed by that user from different bitcoin addresses.  The paper states:  ""A low-resource attacker can gain full control of information flows between all users who chose to use bitcoin over Tor. In particular the attacker can link together user's transactions regardless of pseudonyms used ... and a totally virtual bitcoin reality can be created for such ... users.""  As a result, a victim would also be at the attacker's mercy regarding information about his transactions, since they would be able to delay or discard a victim's transactions or blocks.  In an extreme scenario, a bad actor could even dupe a victim into thinking they had received bitcoin when in fact they had not (a so-called 'double-spending attack'), Pustogarov said.  This sort of attack would have ramifications for privacy-seeking merchants, on dark web markets, for instance. A dark web merchant would also be at risk of being outed by rival businesses or disgruntled customers by such an attack.  Despite the MitM's ability to compromise a victim's privacy, it would not, however, be able to steal a victim's funds. Their wallet and transactions are safe, even if the attack was successfully mounted, the researcher confirmed, adding:  ""The wallets are safe; bitcoins cannot be stolen. The attack is not that great.""  How the attack works  Pustogarov and Biryukov dreamed up the attack by focusing on a little-known aspect of the bitcoin protocol, its built-in protection against a denial of service attack (DoS). To protect themselves, bitcoin servers award points to clients that send them problematic transactions. When a client racks up 100 points, the server bans it for 24 hours.  In an earlier paper, also focused on anonymity risks on the bitcoin network, the authors described a way to exploit this DoS protection to prevent Tor from being used to connect to the bitcoin network.  They explained that, when a Tor user connects to the bitcoin network, his or her IP address is not revealed. Instead, the bitcoin server sees the address of the connected Tor 'exit node', a type of server. As a result, an attacker could send enough bad transactions over Tor to get all the exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network.  The authors build on that approach in their current paper. They say that a smart attacker could set up a number of bitcoin servers and Tor exit nodes before exploiting the DoS protection system to ban other Tor exit nodes from the bitcoin network.  When a victim uses Tor to connect to the bitcoin network, he will be left with only the attacker's bitcoin servers to connect to, since he has been banned by all other servers. The attacker is now in control of all the information relayed to the user.  Pustogarov and Biryukov estimate that the attack can be mounted for between $2,500 and $7,200 a month. This range would be required to guarantee sufficient bandwidth and/or multiple IP addresses for the attacks.  At the lower limit, an attacker could control a significant portion of Tor exit node bandwidth, allowing him to direct a victim to a malicious bitcoin server. With this amount of bandwidth, a victim would take under three minutes, on average, before connecting to a bitcoin server controlled by an attacker, Pustogarov said.  Detection and fixes  There is some good news, however. Pustogarov noted that such an attack could be monitored fairly easily, by creating a program to check the percentage of Tor exit nodes banned by the bitcoin network at any given time, explaining:  ""If somebody decides to monitor if this attack is being carried out, he will be able to detect it immediately.""  The paper also outlines some ways of countering the attack, although they all require fundamental changes to the bitcoin protocol. The DoS protection system could be changed so that it only runs on half of all servers, by random selection, at any given time, for example.  The use of Tor to increase anonymity with other applications has also proved problematic in some cases. For instance, earlier research showed that using BitTorrent, the popular decentralised file-sharing protocol, over Tor resulted in IP addresses getting leaked.  ""Tor is not a panacea ... and not all applications are anonymised equally well when combined with Tor,"" the paper states.  Pustogarov is optimistic that continued research will dispel myths around the levels of anonymity afforded by the digital currency:  ""Right now, users and researchers are starting to understand more about anonymity of bitcoin. When I heard about black markets like Silk Road that were using bitcoin, I had the impression that bitcoin is anonymous.""

42398023,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFDsW,1414582946,MIT Undergrads Can Now Claim Their Free $100 in Bitcoin,"Half a million dollars-worth of bitcoin is being given away to undergraduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as part of a scheme to encourage use and awareness of the digital currency.  From yesterday, each MIT undergrad became eligible to claim $100 in bitcoin (0.290272 BTC at press time) by completing a surveyhttp://bitcoin.mit.edu/bitcoin-project-is-live/ hosted by The MIT Bitcoin Project, the student organisation that is organising the giveaway.  However, students looking to obtain the free funds will have to hurry. The survey must be completed before the scheme ends on 2nd November.  The survey results will form part of a study conducted by the organisers to promote the university as a ""global hub"" for bitcoin research and business.  The MIT Bitcoin Project was announced in April after two MIT students, Jeremy Rubin and Dan Elitzer, raised $500,000 from university alumni and members of the bitcoin community.  The fund-raising objective was to distribute the funds in bitcoin to the more than 4,500 undergraduates enrolled at MIT to spur academic and entrepreneurial activity at the campus.  Spending the free coin  Students who receive the free bitcoin already have a couple of options if they want to spend them on campus. The university bookshop, for example, began accepting bitcoin last month. Textbooks, school supplies and an array of MIT-branded merchandise will be available for bitcoin purchasers.  Then there's Fireflies, an application being developed by MIT students that will allow users to crowdsource goods and services for bitcoin. It won the 'Awesome Award' and a prize of $1,500 at the summer-long MIT BitComp, a contest to encourage the development of bitcoin-focused apps.  The Fireflies team told CoinDesk last month that it would focus on making its services more easily available to MIT students, particularly to complement the planned bitcoin giveaway.  The MIT Bitcoin Club, where Elitzer is president, has also proved to be one of the most active chapters of the College Cryptocurrency Network, a fast-growing group of student organisations focused on digital currencies.  ""As one of the longest-standing CCN chapters, we've been in the position of providing assistance to newer and prospective members,"" Elitzer said, adding:  ""Even though a lot of students look to the MIT Bitcoin Club as a prime example of a successful CCN chapter, they should realise that everything we've done was built during the past year.""

42398031,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE0O,1414577658,Small Australian City Plans for a Big Bitcoin Economy,"A plan to build the ""world's largest"" local bitcoin-based economy is underway in the city of Launceston, Australia, with support from local businesses and even government.  Project organizers say the compact Tasmanian city with a population of 106,000 will make a good high-density testing ground for bitcoin. The plan is aimed to cover various levels of the business supply chain, allowing users to both receive and spend their bitcoins, rather than simply converting them to Australian dollars.  A notable part of the 'Launceston Launch' plan would be to have the local government, the Launceston City Council, accept bitcoin for taxes and rates. At least two members of the 12-member council have shown support for the idea.  Plan director Adam Poulton has talked of bitcoin's potential to put the spotlight on a city not often seen in international headlines, saying:  ""Bitcoin is a currency in use in all developed countries in the world and has turned over $20bn in the last 12 months. It’s time Launceston got its share.""  This, along with several tourism and real-estate projects, plus a social media campaign, would hopefully attract more affluent tourists to the area, who would in turn be encouraged to spend bitcoin there.  Launceston Launch is designed to be a mainly closed-loop system, beginning with traders accepting digital currency and then targeting other merchants up the supply chain, keeping most of it within the city as its cost-saving benefits are realized.  Receipt of bitcoin payments and conversion to dollars, if requested, will be handled by Sydney-based payment processor BitPOS.  Gold sponsors signed  At least two supporting businesses have signed up for the project's Gold Sponsorship, including Dr Roger Bernard, a medical clinic operator who has studied bitcoin since early 2013.  Bernard said:  ""I am an eager participant in the Launceston Launch project, and this is why I immediately joined as a Gold Sponsor.""  Bitcoin could also open his practice to international clients and help sell his skincare products overseas, he added.  Raising awareness  A public education campaign is also underway to raise awareness of the project, coordinated by Melbourne-based bitcoin activist and documentary maker Dale Dickins. There are also plans to install four bitcoin ATMs around the city centre, with more to follow if the project proves a success.  Marketing efforts would initially target female consumers aged 25–45, as the demographic with the highest percentage of smartphone usage and who visit the widest variety of shops.  Initial responses from local businesses had been positive, Poulton said. Despite overall awareness being low, most begin to see bitcoin's potential for savings and convenience after an informative 15-minute chat, he added.  Issues discussed include that fact that bitcoin is not too complex technologically, the Australian Tax Office has confirmed legality with a ruling, it integrates well into an e-commerce site and merchants would have the ability to cap the number of bitcoins they receive if needed.  Some concerns have stemmed from businesses not knowing what to do with a sudden influx of bitcoin-using customers. The 'Bartercard' local currency initiative of previous years caused headaches for some small businesses who collected the system's trade points, but complained they were unable to spend them on practical expenses like taxes and supplies.  This is not an issue with bitcoin, Poulton said, since payment processors like BitPOS are ready to exchange bitcoins for dollars if needed and a sudden jump in bitcoin trade is unlikely.  Other small but relatively high-density locations around the world have similar plans to promote bitcoin acceptance and businesses in their area, including islands the Hague, Bali, Jersey, and the Isle of Man.
