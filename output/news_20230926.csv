18094515,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552954,1695769218,"Ethereum Open Interest Barrels Past $5.2 Billion, Is It Time To Buy?","The Ethereum open interest has been on an upward trajectory that has culminated in it crossing the $5.2 billion mark. This surge is important to Ethereum’s native token ETH in a number of ways as it could point to how investors are viewing the cryptocurrency at this point. Ethereum Open Interest Sees Rapid Rise Data from Coinglass shows that the Ethereum open interest has risen rapidly in recent times. Over the last week, the open interest has grown, eventually crossing $5.2 billion at a time when the crypto market continues to struggle to loosen the grip of bears. Related Reading: Cardano: Factors That Could Drive ADA Price As High As $12 One thing about open interest is that it can point to how investors are viewing the cryptocurrency and whether they are bearish or bullish. When open interest rises, it points to investors becoming more bullish. On the other hand, a drop in open interest suggests that investors are more bearish and expect prices to drop. ETH open interest jumps above $5.2 billion | Source: Coinglass This time around, with the open interest being on the rise, it suggests that crypto investors are turning bullish once more. This reflects the Crypto Fear & Greed Index showing that investor sentiment has been improving during the same time period. The chart above shows that the ETH price has often rallied when open interest has surged, which could happen in this case. If this holds true, then the ETH price could be looking at a rise toward the $1,700 level once more. ETH Could Rally With Crypto Market The turn to bullishness marked by the increase in Ethereum open interest is not limited to the cryptocurrency alone. Looking at the long/short ratio on Coinglass shows that long volumes have begun to recover while short volume has plummeted. Ethereum long volumes are currently sitting at $574 million compared to $548 million for short. This comes out to 51.28% for longs with 48.72% for shorts. And while these differences are not especially significant, it does show that crypto investors are betting more on a recovery for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Sees Exponential 627% Jump Liquidations have also shown that short traders are losing more in the market. Ethereum currently has a 24-hour liquidation volume of $6.63 million. $1.57 million of this is long positions while $5.06 million is accounted for by short traders.

42392494,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7Hfx,1695768295,"SEC Extends Ark, Global X ETF Deadlines as Government Shutdown Looms","As Congress nears a cliff on its budget negotiations and the federal agencies prepare for the worst, the Securities and Exchange Commission pushed off a couple of its deadlines to respond to ETF applications.  The SEC has formally postponed its responses to the applications of spot bitcoin ETF listings for Ark 21 Shares and Global X.  The efforts from Ark 21Shares and Global X to list spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) must now officially wait longer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to either approve or reject or deny their applications as the agency moved to extend deadlines Tuesday.  As the federal government braces for a potential shutdown brought about by a budget impasse in Congress, the securities regulator extended its next deadlines for the two applications well before the interim deadlines arrived. The SEC has a total of 240 days to make a final decision on any application after it starts reviewing, but there are a number of potential time marks during that period in which it has to do certain things or extend the time it’s allowed.  Ark Investment Management and 21Shares, which have been seeking an ETF approval since 2021, filed for their first potential bitcoin ETF again earlier this year after a second effort was rebuffed by the SEC. The formal deadline for an SEC response is now set at Jan. 10.  Global X, which filed last month to become the ninth active spot-bitcoin application in the SEC’s hands, now has until Nov. 21 to await its response. If approved, the fund would grant investors ""exposure to bitcoin with important protections that are not always available to investors that invest directly in bitcoin,"" lawyers said in the filing.  The regulator has rejected spot bitcoin ETF products, citing potential market manipulation and inadequate investor protections against, but a federal court ruling last month said the agency had been “arbitrary and capricious” in its ETF decisions and must reconsider its position.  These deadlines were expected, as the SEC has traditionally taken the full 240 days to make a final decision. However, the threat of a looming shutdown seems to have pushed its interim decision up to Tuesday. Normally, the SEC waits until a few days prior to the deadline. In 2019, during the last shutdown, the SEC asked an applicant to withdraw its filing entirely.  In the Tuesday filings, the SEC said that it “finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action,” giving the regulator “sufficient time to consider” its decision.  Earlier on Tuesday, a bipartisan group of members of the House Financial Services Committee sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, calling for immediate approvals of the pending spot ETF applicationsz after the agency’s court loss.

18093055,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553004,1695765622,Huobi (HTX) Troubles Mount: Justin Sun Accused Of $2.4B Shortfall In User Funds,"HTX (formerly known as Huobi), one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has been embroiled in a new controversy as Justin Sun, Tron’s founder and BitTorrent’s CEO, faces allegations of a staggering $2.4 billion shortfall in user funds. Adam Cochran, Managing Partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, has shed light on the intricate details of the alleged malpractice, revealing a web of “financial manipulations.” Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Price Continues to Climb Higher Level, Will It Surpass $1500? Huobi Crisis Unveiled? Cochran’s analysis raises concerns over Huobi’s financial stability, questioning the integrity of the exchange’s claims regarding its holdings of Ethereum (ETH) and USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. As seen in the chart above, while Huobi asserts assets worth $200 million in ETH, Cochran’s investigation, corroborated by defillama data, reveals a discrepancy, with the actual value amounting to under $113 million, even when considering wrapped ETH (WETH) and staked ETH (stETH). The situation further unravels when examining Huobi’s purported $624 million USDT holdings. However, Cochran’s findings indicate that only $119 million of USDT resides within the exchange, while the remaining balance is in staked USDT (stUSDT). What raises suspicion is that Justin Sun has enabled staked USDT (stUSDT) a staking feature, which allows users to stake either USDT or TUSD (TrueUSD) to earn stUSDT, as reported by NewsBTC. Allegations Mount Against Justin Sun Instead of following the expected protocol of burning staked assets to claim the cash and take it offline, these funds are redirected to Justin Sun’s addresses or utilized to support JustLend, a lending platform associated with the Huobi ecosystem. Contrary to Huobi’s claim that it burns the stUSDT with Tether, Cochran’s investigation reveals that the counterparties for USDT on Huobi are the exchange’s deposit wallets or Binance. This suggests that Justin Sun may utilize USDT from user balances on Huobi to generate stUSDT, subsequently leveraging the underlying USDT to support JustLend or repurchase TUSD on Binance. Cochran concludes that this complex financial arrangement, including TUSD deposits into stUSDT, effectively mints “fake assets” against an unknown equity. As a result, Cochran estimates that Justin Sun’s alleged debt to users across the Huobi and Tron ecosystems amounts to approximately $2.4 billion, all while users remain unaware of the situation. Related Reading: BULLISH: Bloomberg Analyst Points Out Two Key Bitcoin Metrics Demonstrating Historic Strength Huobi has not yet formally responded to these allegations, leaving the situation’s outcome uncertain. However, the possibility of Huobi’s insolvency raises significant concerns regarding the security of user funds and the overall trustworthiness of the exchange. It remains to be seen how this situation will develop and what actions will be taken to address these concerns effectively.

This news drew interest from various quarters, including prominent financial educator and “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki, who tied it to Bitcoin. Using the X (formerly known as Twitter) platform, Kiyosaki expressed curiosity about the potential ramifications this could have for Bitcoin and the US dollar, igniting a flurry of responses from the online community. Related Reading: Why This Bank CEO Wants 99% Of The Crypto Industry Gone Citibank’s Dive Into Tokenization Citibank’s recent dive into the realm of blockchain technology marks a significant shift for the institution. Their new offering, a tokenization service, specifically focuses on cash management within the finance sphere. This latest development is tailored to cater to institutional clients’ unique needs, leveraging blockchain technology’s features and smart contracts. The announcement by the bank provides a deeper insight into the vision behind this initiative. According to the update, Citibank intends these smart contracts to act as modern substitutes for long-standing banking instruments like bank guarantees and letters of credit. The decision symbolizes not just an adaptation to current technological trends but a response to the changing dynamics of the financial world. At its core, Citibank’s strategy revolves around recognizing and meeting the growing demand for ‘always-on,’ flexible financial services. This demand comes in an age where businesses operate globally, and the need for instantaneous transactions is paramount. To address this, Citi Token Services is poised to change how institutions handle their finances. The service promises to enable uninterrupted cross-border payments, ensure liquidity, and deliver automated trade finance solutions, all operating on a 24/7 basis. Kiyosaki’s Inquiry And The Crypto Community’s Response Kiyosaki’s inquiry on the X platform was straightforward: with Citibank’s new technological adoption, is this the end of Bitcoin and the US dollar as we know them? The crypto community was swift in its response, dismissing any looming threats to Bitcoin due to Citibank’s tokenization initiative. BYE BYE Bitcoin & US Dollar? Citibank announced today it is offering bank block chain technology to turn institutional savings into Citibank tokens which can be used for instaneous 24/7 cross border transactions. Bye bye BC & US $? — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) September 26, 2023 Shivam Sharma, a user on the X platform, emphasized the unique value proposition of Bitcoin, noting that Citibank’s tokens are essentially digital ledgers. They operate in a different space, he suggests, from Bitcoin, which has carved its niche as a decentralized currency. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Dream Fading?

18090270,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552933,1695758445,Upcoming Optimism Unlock Threatens To Drag OP Below $1,"The Optimism native token OP is now in the line of fire with millions of tokens set to be released into circulation. This threatens the altcoin’s price which is already on a downward spiral after carrying out its 3rd airdrop. Optimism Set To Unlock 24 Million Tokens In the latest iteration of its token unlock events, the Optimism network is looking at over 24 million tokens being unlocked and brought into circulation. On-chain token tracking website Token Unlocks reports that the 24.16 million token is worth approximately $30.7 million at current prices. Related Reading: Market Analysts Outline When The First Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved The token unlock event will take place on September 30, which is less than four days from the time of writing. This will see the equivalent of 3.03% of the total OP supply being released into circulation at once. 24.16 million tokens set to be unlocked | Source: Token Unlocks This is coming just one month after the network locked an equivalent amount on August 30. Just like the August unlock, the 24.16 million tokens are allocated to two groups. 12.75 million tokens worth $16.19 million are going to Core Contributors and 11.41 million tokens worth $14.49 million will go to Investors. The Optimism unlock event is the largest of the over $54 million in token unlocks expected to happen over the next seven days. Other notable unlocks include SUI unlocking 4.9% of supply worth $16.92 million and Yield Guild Games (YGG) unlocking 6.7% of supply worth $2.55 million. Gauging The Impact on OP Price A good way to figure out how the OP price might react is to look at historical performance during similar events. In the case of the OP price, there is no need to look too far back as the last token unlock event happened only a month ago. On August 30, Optimism unlocked an identical number of tokens and the price reacted negatively to this new supply. OP initially held tight around the $1.5 mark but once the unlock was completed, the price of the token nosedived, dropping from $1.5 to $1.3 in the span of two days. Related Reading: $200 Million In Crypto Lost As Mixin Network Comes Under Attack This shows that token unlocks, especially with the size of the upcoming Optimism unlock, are inherently bearish for price. If the historical pattern holds, then the OP price could easily succumb to the bears and threaten the $1 mark. At the very least, the impact of this new supply could lead to a 10% decline, which would put the OP price just above $1.1. Even now, OP is already feeling the impact of the incoming bearish sentiment. Over the last week, the price has plummeted more than 10%, bringing it below the $1.3 resistance.

42392486,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7HGJ,1695757569,U.S. House Lawmakers Push SEC’s Gensler to Approve Spot Bitcoin ETF ‘Immediately’,"Four members of the House Financial Services Committee – including Rep. Tom Emmer, the majority whip in the House leadership – called on the SEC to move forward to approve ETF applications, and they'll be able to ask him about it at a hearing this week.  The industry is waiting for the regulator to act after the SEC lost a court fight over its decision to reject Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF application.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should listen to the courts and give up efforts to block bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) from regulatory approval, a bipartisan group of lawmakers argued Tuesday in a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler.  On the eve of his scheduled appearance before the House Financial Services Committee, four members of that panel sent Gensler a letter contending that a spot bitcoin ETF is “indistinguishable” from the crypto futures ETFs for which the agency has already granted its blessing. Because of that, the agency should sign off on applicants requesting SEC approval, such as Fidelity, BlackRock’s iShares and Grayscale Investments, which shares CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.  “The SEC's current posture is untenable moving forward,"" said the letter from Reps. Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) and Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.). ""Following the Court of Appeals' decision, there is no reason to continue to deny such applications under inconsistent and discriminatory standards.""  Last month, a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' instructed the SEC to rethink its view on these applications. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote that the agency’s rejection in the Grayscale case had been ""arbitrary and capricious.""  The House lawmakers urged the SEC to approve the outstanding applications “immediately.” Gensler is set to appear in an SEC oversight hearing in that committee on Wednesday, so the members will have a chance to question him on the topic.  A bitcoin ETF could allow investors a much easier way to put money into the cryptocurrency market, because ETFs are designed to be simple to trade in and out of through brokerage accounts.  Emmer, who is a member of the House leadership as majority whip, Flood and Torres are members of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus in the House.

42392489,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7HQZ,1695756096,Blocknative to Suspend MEV-Boost Relay After Economics Fail to ‘Materialize’,"Blocknative, a provider of tools for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, said Tuesday it’s exiting services related to its MEV-Boost Relay – a type of software used by network validators.  The decision followed internal discussions among the company’s leadership and board of directors, according to a post on X (formerly Twitter). In the post, the company admonished users to “remove the Blocknative Relay from your validator configurations” by Sept. 27.  Blocknative will continue in other core services, according to CEO Matt Cutler. The company’s website lists products including mempool explorer, transaction simulation, Ethereum gas estimator and Polygon estimator.  In an interview, Cutler told CoinDesk that the business wasn’t delivering on the company’s economic expectations.  “What started out as an economically interesting opportunity turned into not a very economically interesting opportunity,” Cutler said. “We made a bunch of efforts that are still ongoing, both publicly and privately, to try to introduce economic incentives at the relay layer, but those didn't really materialize.”  MEV, or Maximal Extractable Value, is sometimes known as an “invisible tax” that validators and builders can collect from users by reordering or inserting transactions in a block before they’re added to the blockchain.  The main way that validators on Ethereum earn MEV is through MEV-Boost, a middleware developed by research and development firm Flashbots that allows validators to request blocks from a network of builders.  The businesses of running a relay and block-building services represent “a lot of work,” Cutler said. “It's a lot of expertise, it's a lot of engineering and not a lot of economic incentive for someone in our position as a credibly neutral player.”  Blocknative has provided tools for MEV-Boost, and was one of the five entities that has proposed over 90% of blocks on Ethereum. Some figures in the MEV-Boost space expressed concerns on X that the business is becoming excessively centralized.  “We're not really excited about some of the trends that we're seeing in this category in terms of the centralizing forces at play and the very small number of actors that are happening here,” Cutler said.

42392498,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7HqD,1695755626,How Staking Rates Can Drive the Crypto Economy Forward,"While the world eagerly awaits the approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. there is another crypto innovation that promises to unleash a fervor of economic activity, enabling an even greater wave of mainstream adoption and convergence across the global financial system.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week."" Christopher Perkins is a managing partner and president of CoinFund.     This is the arrival of crypto-native staking rates, made possible by proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum that will deliver the identical utility of traditional interest rates – closing a vital gap in its evolution and development for the crypto economy.  In traditional finance, interest rates underpin the largest markets in the world and serve as a fundamental pillar of economic activity. Staking rates can do the same for the crypto industry by delivering a new class of standardized benchmarks, powering next generation financial products, improving risk management and unlocking new functionality for institutions and consumers alike.  Staking rates are to crypto what interest rates are to traditional financial markets.  Interest rates drive modern economies. In traditional finance, interest rate decisions are highly centralized, controlled and reserved for the very upper echelons of government. Eight times a year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets to determine monetary policy and sets interest rates in the United States. Each decision by its 12 members has far-reaching effects on the global economy, impacting monetary policy, unemployment rates and consumer behavior.  Interest rates serve as important financial benchmarks for borrowing and lending and are used in valuations and asset pricing. They determine the cost of capital for businesses. Interest rates also power trillions of dollars of financial products, and the interest rate swap market alone underpins $500 trillion in notional exposure, making it the largest derivative asset class in the world.  Until recently, the crypto industry was completely devoid of anything close to fiat interest rates, leaving a major gap, slowing its evolution and leaving it relatively inaccessible to a large swath of market participants.  However, with Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake following ""The Merge,"" a standardized staking rate for the protocol — similar to a traditional “risk free” rate — was born. Standardized staking rates, like CoinFund's CESR composite ether (ETH) staking rate, measure the returns paid to eligible validators by observing the average, annualized protocol awards and transaction fees they receive. (Disclosure: CESR is based on CoinFund’s staking rate methodology and is calculated, published, and licensed by CoinDesk Indices.)  This decentralized and truly global version of traditional interest rates can deliver identical utility to market participants, helping measure performance, hedge risk and create new financial products. And it can be offered without the opacity and centralized control of central bank decision-making.  In traditional finance, borrowing, lending and derivative products are often priced relative to a standard benchmark that provides a basis for comparison and evaluation. This gives market participants a degree of transparency and certainty as they pay or receive a rate that is priced above or below a known reference rate, calculated by a third party, rather than be subject to something potentially arbitrary and bespoke. As a result, service providers can compete relative to a common reference. Applied to the crypto industry, staking providers that pay yields relative to an industry benchmark promises to attract a new class of clients that require the transparency of a standardized rate.  In addition to financial benchmarks, standardized staking rates can serve as reference rates in derivative contracts including listed futures, swaps and options. Derivatives enable risk management (i.e. hedging) and speculation by transferring risk in an economic system.  In traditional markets, interest rate swaps allow users to swap fixed and floating liabilities, making fixed rate products possible. Demand for fixed rate financial products is nearly unquenchable: interest rate swaps are the largest derivative markets in the world. Staking rate swaps (fixed versus floating) can provide the same utility to the crypto industry with the adoption of standardized staking rates. By entering into staking rate swaps, staking service providers could offer fixed yields that would be attractive to a new class of institutional and retail clients.  Staking rates are to crypto what interest rates are to traditional financial markets.  Meanwhile, other industry participants may be attracted to the real yield of floating side while others may seek to hedge spikes in transaction fees when gas prices balloon and the floating rate spikes.  Derivative markets become liquid when they deliver real utility to hedgers while also attracting speculators to take risk. All of the elements of deep, liquid derivatives markets are abundantly present in the crypto economy with the introduction of standardized staking rates. Cleared staking rate swaps and listed futures have the added benefit of mitigating counterparty risk – a challenge across the crypto industry – by delivering segregation and central clearing, while DeFi derivatives and perpetual swaps can also play a role in hedging and speculating going forward. Basis swaps can serve as a new on-ramp for investors who have a view of the relative trajectory of traditional interest rate yields versus those of staking rates.  Standardized staking rates will play a crucial role in new financial products. While a spot ether ETF would be welcomed in U.S. markets, investors will demand a total-return ether ETF powered by standardized staking rates. A new class of structured products can help investors benefit from the real yield offered by staked ether, which, as a sometimes non-inflationary asset, competes nicely with many of its traditional peers.  See also: Ether Turns Inflationary as Network Usage Slows  With nearly infinite use cases, standardized staking rates will give rise to a new staking economy. Like traditional interest rates, they promise to unlock a new era of innovation across the crypto ecosystem as a new staking economy is born. As a forward curve emerges, staking rates can also be used to inform valuations as a discount rate, calculate Sharpe ratios and do everything that its fiat interest rate peers can do without the need for central control.

However, the bears appear to be in control, with the premier cryptocurrency trending toward the $26,000 mark in the past few days. Despite the struggling Bitcoin price action, investors seem uninterested in taking short-term interests or cutting their losses, with BTC spot trading volumes hitting lows rarely seen in years. “Macroeconomic Scenario” Responsible For Bitcoin Volume Decline According to recent research from on-chain analytics provider CryptoQuant, Bitcoin spot trading volume has declined to a six-year low. This latest data, which tracks trading activity on various exchanges, shows the decline BTC volume has experienced in recent weeks. CryptoQuant data revealed that the transaction volume of Bitcoin across exchanges roamed between 8,000 and 15,000 daily transactions in the past week. This reflects an abrupt decline from the 600,000 daily transactions recorded in March 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales Return To Selling Mode, More Downside Soon? Cauê Oliveira, a contributing analyst at CryptoQuant, attributed the growing fear around the macroeconomic scenario as one of the reasons for this short drop in BTC transaction volume. “The actions of the United States Central Bank perpetuate a constant feeling of uncertainty, leaving investors waiting for a possible recession,” Oliveira added. Last week, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) opted to keep the interest rates at the current level, ranging between 5.25% and 5.5%. This move aligned with existing economic policy in the United States and market expectations. Additionally, Oliveira referenced this downward trend in BTC spot volume as an interesting sign of “rising investor confidence.” It demonstrates that Bitcoin investors opt to hold their coins rather than sell them. Cauê Oliveira added: Instead of seeking quick profits through short-term trading, more and more people are viewing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment. They are more interested in holding their coins, believing in their future value, than selling at the first sign of profit. According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin is currently valued at $26,154, with no significant price movement in the past day. BTC maintains its place as the largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of nearly $510 billion. Long-Term BTC Holders Continue To Show Faith A recent on-chain revelation by IntoTheBlock adds more weight to Oliveira’s analysis. The crypto analytics platform disclosed that Bitcoin long-term holders seem unfazed by the current market conditions as they continue to hold their assets. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the cryptocurrency’s long-term “hodlers” hold 13.44 million BTC, which is merely short of the record of 14.599 million. This amount currently held by long-term “hodlers” accounts for 69% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.

Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the Southern District of New York, resolved the majority of outstanding in limine, or pretrial, motions in a 16-page order Tuesday, allowing the DOJ to admit certain evidence. He also denied the DOJ's motions to block the defense team from cross-examining witnesses about privileged issues, and denied Bankman-Fried's team's motion to block any evidence tied to the cryptocurrency exchange's bankruptcy.  He denied the DOJ's motion to block the defense team from ""cross-examining witnesses about their recreational drug use,"" though he added that the defense team ""shall not introduce the subject in the presence of the jury absent prior notice to the Court and the government.""  He did allow the DOJ to bring forward evidence that suggests Bankman-Fried not only created the FTT token, but directed Alameda to hold a large amount of it and supported market manipulation of the token.  ""The alleged manipulation of the cryptocurrency tokens, which resulted in an alleged manipulation of Alameda’s balance sheet, was an act 'done in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy' and therefore is considered 'part of the very act charged,'"" he wrote. ""Moreover, defendant’s alleged directive to [former Alameda Research CEO Caroline] Ellison to manipulate the price of FTT is direct evidence of their 'relationship of mutual trust.' The probative value of this evidence outweighs any risk of unfair prejudice. It is admissible.""  The judge added that certain issues which may sway the jury could be addressed with a jury instruction, which he ""would entertain if requested.""  He declined to rule on the defense's motion to introduce evidence that Bankman-Fried's use of autodeletion policies on messaging apps was at the direction of the FTX founder's former lawyers, and denied without prejudice a DOJ motion to admit certain out-of-court statements from witnesses. The DOJ can try to bring those statements up, but the judge needs to know the specifics of what those statements are about, he wrote.

The company claims the upgrade will push the XRPL to the next level. According to an official announcement shared with Bitcoinist: This isn’t just a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic move to reshape the very foundation of the XRPL, ensuring a sustainable, efficient, and inclusive future for all participants. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction – Will Recent Correction Trend Push XRP Under $0.50? XRP Ledger Upgrade Goes Beyond? Implications For The Network Xumm believes the XRP Ledger has an “advanced” infrastructure, but they aim to address some key issues impacting “flexibility” and performance. The company believes that with its present capabilities, the network has difficulty processing transactions and fetching historical data. In the long run, these issues could affect the ledger’s capacity to onboard new users and use cases. Xumm’s new update is set to improve the ledger’s capacity to avoid bottlenecks while enhancing local node connections and “ensuring” access to real-time data. As seen in the image below, the infrastructure upgrade will allow entities operating on the ledger to filter out transactions, avoid scam accounts, reduce network fees, and improve scalability. The company decided to donate the upgrade via software to the XRPL Foundation. Wietse Wind, founder and CEO of XRPL Labs, stated: This is, without a doubt, the most monumental upgrade to the XRPL infrastructure since its inception, marking a pivotal moment in our pursuit of a healthier, sustainable XRP Ledger. New Rewards For XRPL Users, The Airbnb Network In addition to improving the XRPL’s infrastructure and ecosystem, Xumm wants to introduce a new monetization strategy to reward node operators. In that sense, the company claims to have “rebuilt the XRPL Cluster Software” to encourage users to stop relying on third parties. This change will put more financial pressure on major platforms, such as non-fungible tokens or crypto trading platforms, rather than on the small individuals operating on the ledger. The company added: In this ecosystem, quality hardware will be monitored, and users can plug in their node to the cluster, receiving queries from nearby sources. Those contributing resources will earn the lion’s share of the billing from larger consumers. It’s akin to an “Airbnb for XRPL infrastructure.” Some of the benefits of this infrastructure update include: Better stability. Guarantee real-time transaction processing. Connection Consistency across the ecosystem. Overall, individuals will benefit from these improvements. Xumm concluded: This development ensures a flexible in-ecosystem platform where supply and demand can dynamically be matched. Keeping public infra flexible, scalable, and cheap.

Blockchain data shows that a total of 318,180 wrapped Binance ETH (WBETH) derivative tokens – worth $502 million – were minted on Saturday and Sunday in five, roughly equal $100 million installments. The tokens then landed on a crypto address labeled as “Binance 8,” a cold walletwhere the exchange holds users’ assets.  These latest transactions followed another $573 million in inflows earlier this month, prompting discussions among crypto observers about the seemingly irregular nature of the movements. While rival exchange Coinbase’s liquid staking derivative cbETH saw regular inflows and outflows every day over the past weeks, inflows to WBETH have been intermittent and taken place in large chunks.  Binance explained in a social media post that the transactions were part of the exchange’s previously announced action to gradually convert the original Binance-issued staked ether (BETH) tokens to WBETH.  In April, Binance introduced an upgraded version of BETH called WBETH, a liquid staking derivative that lets investors use the tokens for borrowing and lending on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols outside of Binance while earning staking rewards. When users lock up (stake) ETH to participate in staking through Binance, they receive a derivative token that represents the staked assets.  The exchange announced a month ago several measures to boost the new token and curb activity with the old one, including “progressively” burning BETH tokens held in Binance wallets.  Blockchain data shows that Binance burned 330,000 BETH on Monday, roughly similar to the amount of WBETH minted during the weekend, so the movements didn’t change substantially the overall amount of staked assets through the exchange.  With 1.2 million ETH stakes, Binance is one of the largest players on Ethereum’s staking network behind Lido Finance and Coinbase, according to crypto investment firm 21Shares’ Dune dashboard. Now, WBETH represents about 765,000 of the staked assets, per data by DefiLlama.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/26/binances-liquid-staked-ether-jumps-to-12b-in-tvl-after-sudden-500m-inflow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00520a67e148ec4d92613b1d15f2c84b3e8ae0ef-1598x900.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Majority Of Bitcoin Mining Industry Uses Clean Energy Sources One of the main criticisms against BTC is that the sector uses a considerable amount of energy and, thus, releases a notable amount of emissions. Things appear to be developing for the better and quite fast. In a new post on X, the co-founder of CH4Capital, Daniel Batten, has shared a few charts that look into the sustainability of the BTC network and how it compares with other sectors. The first chart displays the trend in the percentage of sustainable energy used by Bitcoin mining and other industries over the last four years. The trend in the clean energy used by the various global industries | Source: @DSBatten on X As shown in the above chart, most industries have seen minimal growth in using sustainable energy during this period. The Banking Sector, the second largest in terms of clean energy usage, saw a rise of 2.6%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales Return To Selling Mode, More Downside Soon? On the other hand, the Bitcoin mining sector has observed an increase of a whopping 38%, which has taken the share of sustainable energy powering the blockchain to 52.6%. This growth has naturally made BTC mining the most sustainable among these global industries. An even more interesting chart is this one that compares the emissions of the network (in terms of megatons of CO2 emitted) with the various indicators related to the blockchain’s growth. Looks like emissions on the network have gone down in this period | Source: @DSBatten on X Three Bitcoin metrics are being considered here: the mining hashrate, the price, and the total number of users. The first has grown by 475% during the past four years, the second by 164%, and the third by 289%. Despite these growths, however, the emissions of the mining sector have gone down almost 10% in the same period. Batten notes that even if you double these metrics during any four-year cycle, the emissions will be the same as at the start, which no other industry has achieved. The fact that the hashrate, which is a measure of the total amount of computing power that miners have connected to the blockchain, has been able to rise while total emissions go down would imply that the emission intensity (that is, the emissions per kWh of power used) has declined. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Media Talk Drops To 3-Month Low, All Eyes On Altcoins? Indeed, as the data would confirm, the BTC network’s emission intensity has dropped by more than 50% in the last four years, making the mining sector the most emission-efficient among the global industries. All other industries have only seen a slight decrease in this metric | Source: @DSBatten on X Finally, Batten has also shared the energy composition of the network, noting that the largest power source is hydro. 23.1% of the network is powered by hydro energy | Source: @DSBatten on X This means that the Bitcoin mining sector is also the only one that doesn’t have its largest source of power coal.

18084643,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552932,1695744044,BULLISH: Bloomberg Analyst Points Out Two Key Bitcoin Metrics Demonstrating Historic Strength,"As the bear market continues to linger, several market analysts have pointed out key metrics or factors that show that the Bitcoin bull market might not be far off. This time, Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts has identified key Bitcoin adoption metrics that provide bullish signals to the crypto community. What Are These Key Bitcoin Metrics? In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Coutts noted that “HODLers” and transactions on the Bitcoin network were at an all-time high. According to the update he shared, the number of addresses holding more than 1 BTC is at its highest over the last five years. Related Reading: Market Analysts Outline When The First Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved In the past month, there has also been close to a 1% increase in persons holding more than one 1 BTC. Meanwhile, the volume of Bitcoin transactions, entity-adjusted ones, has surged by over 9% in the past month. This metric also has a 99.8% percentile over the last five years. These two metrics form part of key metrics used to determine how widely the Bitcoin network and token are adopted. Their being in the green is undoubtedly bullish, especially considering that many have been said to have left the crypto market because of the lingering conditions. The first metric shows that more addresses are accumulating BTC, and a significant chunk of it, even though the crypto token has been tepid for a while now. The entity-adjusted metric is even more significant as it measures the number of unique Bitcoin users rather than active wallets. However, there are some negatives from the Bitcoin on-chain update that Coutts laid out. The value of this entity-adjusted bitcoin transactions has dropped by over 30% in the past year (although it is up by %30 in the last three years). The median transfer value has also decreased drastically (over 98% in the last three years), putting it also in the bottom percentile over the last five years. This shows that the economic value of the network is down even though adoption is currently at an all-time high. BTC price looks strong above $26,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Worrying Concerns Around Bitcoin’s Adoption There has been increased institutional interest in the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, especially with traditional fund managers moving to offer several Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, following this interest, many have become wary about the true intentions of these fund managers and how they could make Bitcoin more centralized. These concerns are likely to be further fueled by a recent revelation made by Coutss. In a tweet released on September 26, he pointed out that three asset managers (Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street) are major investors in the three biggest publicly traded mining companies. Related Reading: Number Of Ethereum Addresses Losing Money Just Reached A New All-Time High While he stated that his statement shouldn’t be taken as FUD, he raised concerns about what this could mean for the Bitcoin network as these fund managers account for “about 8.9% of the global hash.” According to him, there might be the risk of “creeping influence that might conflict” with the network’s values. He believes these companies could go as far as censoring transactions with such influence. This development is more significant because BlackRock is one of several fund managers that have filed to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF.

42392501,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7I0T,1695744000,"Almost All Crypto Employees Take Pay in Fiat, Pantera Study Finds","Many crypto-industry employees believe that cryptocurrencies will eventually play a much larger role in the overall financial and payments system.  For now, though, almost all of them take their salaries in government-issued currencies, or ""fiat"" in the industry lingo.  Some 97% of people in the nascent industry are paid a base salary in fiat, while only 3% are paid in crypto, according to a new study from Pantera Capital, a digital-asset investment firm. The 2023 compensation data was based on 1,046 responses.  And of those who got paid in crypto, the vast majority took the pay in the dollar-linked stablecoins USDC and USDT, with 13% opting for bitcoin (BTC).  The median pay globally among 570 engineers surveyed was $120,000, with those in North America getting $193,000, up 1.5% versus the prior year, according to the study.  That compares with an estimated $166,100 for engineers in North America in traditional tech or ""Web2"" roles.  ""Senior engineers in Web3 make slightly more than their peers in Web2,"" the Pantera report concluded.

42392533,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7GlX,1695743916,Why Binance and Banking Giant MUFG Want to Issue Stablecoins in Japan,"Binance’s Japan unit on Monday said it’s working with financial giant Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation (MUTB) on developing stablecoins.  MUTB and Binance Japan are running a joint study on issuing stablecoins pegged to sovereign currencies like the yen that comply with local laws – but the stated goal is driving Web3 adoption in the country.  “Through this joint study, both companies aim to issue new stablecoins to help accelerate the mass adoption of Web3 in Japan,” a press release said, adding that the companies hope to start relevant operations by the end of next year.  The study does not translate to a promise to issue stablecoins, and Binance Japan still has to secure “applicable regulatory approvals” before issuing anything. However, Japan’s Web3 ambitions and new stablecoin rules may actually set the necessary conditions for incubating such a project.  Involvement of a TradFi giant like MUTB also adds some legitimacy to the initiative as it leads a consortium of banks and trust banks that plans to issue stablecoins on private and public blockchains through a compliant platform called Progmat Coin, which Binance Japan also intends to use.  The platform has permissions under new stablecoin rules that kicked in this June that let Japanese exchanges apply for a special license to trade stablecoins – even those issued overseas, like tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). In fact, USDC issuer Circle hinted it may take advantage of the new rules to make the stablecoin available to the Japanese market.  Other jurisdictions like the European Union and even the U.K. have taken more stringent approaches to regulating stablecoins, particularly after one such cryptocurrency, terraUSD, rapidly lost parity with the U.S. dollar last year, leading to the collapse of not just the issuer but a string of other prominent players in the crypto world.  Japan has seemingly embraced Web3 and stablecoins where other jurisdictions have shied away, with the country publishing a roadmap to drive Web3 growth back in April and promising more oversight to ensure consumer protections.  MUTB also claims its Progmat platform could help mitigate some of the risks inherent in stablecoins that regulators fear.  “Progmat is a neutral infrastructure that enables the issuance of various brands of stablecoins with the greatest flexibility of use and the least risk of de-pegging,” Tatsuya Saito, founder and CEO of Progmat Inc and vice president of product at MUTB said on a Monday press release.

42392495,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7Hl5,1695740863,The Barrier to Mainstream Crypto Adoption Isn’t UX — It’s Product-Market Fit,"Discussions about accelerating adoption of crypto often focus on improving user experience. (UX). The popular thinking goes: Web3 products lag behind from a user experience perspective, onboarding poses multiple points of friction, and technological concepts come with learning curves. Web3 is missing a seamless experience for apps that will unlock greater adoption.  While improving crypto UX is certainly important, I believe that the more significant and urgent barrier to adoption is building things that people want. Web3 has a product-market fit problem, not a UX problem.  Li Jin is a co-founder of Variant, which co-published this article.  Product-market fit is when a product satisfies a strong market need. For consumer builders, the elegance and challenge in building for consumers is that humans have remarkably consistent needs across time. That’s why Maslow’s hierarchy of needs continues to resonate nearly a century after its introduction, with universal needs ranging from the physiological (food, shelter, clothing) to psychological (belonging, love, entertainment, esteem).  See also: Cami Russo: Crypto's Theater Is Becoming More Surreal | Opinion  The history of consumer startups is one of continual innovation in solving for human needs in novel ways. Though people often dismiss new consumer apps as incremental innovations in flippant categories (“teens making dance videos”), the truth is that successful startups offer a step-function improvement in enabling people to achieve a core need. Amazon sold us books(and everything else) in just a few clicks, dramatically easing the process of procuring goods. Facebook enabled us to connect with those we care about instantly. Tinderexposed us to an order of magnitude more potential romantic partners than anyone could stumble on in real life.  There is a lot of evidence that when the user benefit is great enough, users are willing to jump through UX hurdles and learn new behaviors, in crypto and beyond. Examples include the first iPhone (which lacked a touch keyboard), the internet itself, and all crypto assets and applications that have had significant adoption to date (non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, during the last bull market being a primary example). For products that solve a core need, unfamiliar and complicated UX hasn’t been a blocker.  Despite the long list of multifaceted user needs, so far, explorations of the opportunities that crypto can uniquely address have been largely limited to the financial realm. While income is a widespread need, products where income derives from speculation work when the market goes up, but lose their appeal as prices fall. It’s a tough sell, especially when there are alternatives for users to attain income with less risk and uncertainty.  There is an opportunity for crypto builders to build products that better address other human needs, such as belonging, community and entertainment. What could that look like?  On a small scale, NFT communities and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have satisfied some people’s need for belonging, forging novel social graphs on the basis of asset ownership. To those who say that shared financial interest can’t be the basis for “real” relationships, consider that many of our real-world connections are predicated on ownership, whether that’s neighboring homeowners, startup employees or Pokémon card collectors.  For products that solve a core need, unfamiliar and complicated UX hasn’t been a blocker  There’s an opportunity to leverage onchain assets as the basis for new communities that solve for belonging, esteem and connection. In August 2023 alone, 94.5 million NFTs were minted across Ethereum and its layer 2 scalability protocols; as the volume of user activities grows, imagine inferring users’ interests based on onchain actions and exposing connections based on a rich activity history.  Onchain media expands our entertainment options, giving us skin in the game for what we consume and create online. On platforms like Sound.xyz, Friend.tech and Zora, users can bet on media and creators they believe in, enhancing their experience of the content and turning these networks into financialized games. In a world where all media is incepted as NFTs, there will be a new economic dimension that can enrich our experience of the internet.  These are just starting points for what it could look like for crypto to find product-market fit and address needs beyond just income. There’s room for much more experimentation from here.

18083393,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552498,1695740825,Swiss Web3 Tornado,"Coin Fam🇨🇭☀️ In the last article we teased VESA being in Switzerland, and how the country is advancing leaps and bounds in the eyes of the international crypto community, but today we will give you the lowdown on what the Swiss Web3 Fest was all about and who are the people in the ecosystem behind it. To preface why the following is important, it’s good to mention something. VESA has been working with a bunch of people, from big to small companies and beyond, and what is quite frightening is the ratio of competent people even in big organisations, who have their shit together. It is R A R E. So, let’s get to it.The Crypto Oasis founders (from left) Saqr, Ralf, and Faisal with us at the Art In Space gallery in Dubai earlier From Crypto Oasis to Crypto Valley and back 💫 If you have been connected to the crypto scene in Dubai at all, you must have heard of Crypto Oasis. The spearhead pack is the fastest growing crypto ecosystem in the world, but not everyone knows of their strong presence, and co-founder origins, in Switzerland. Grace under pressure The teams of Crypto Valley and Oasis were like fish in water when D-day finally came. The type of pressure that producing a large conference brings didn’t seem to faze them. It wasn’t an act when the curtains finally opened. Quite the opposite. The day before the WEB3FEST was set to go, the meeting room was still full of laughter and the team was constantly aware of opportunities to connect and support those already arriving early. VESA has been to some 400+ events and behind closed doors in many of them you don’t hear laughter this close to showtime- that’s for sure. While we are most familiar with Crypto Oasis, Ralf, and Saqr especially, at Dubai’s end, the home ground advantage that Crypto Valley and Inacta Group had in Switzerland was tangible. It is clear that this network that drapes over the two countries and more is legit, and expanding fast. Valley or desert, some people know how to execute. What bear market? The WEB3FEST kicked off and the feeling had that same kind of buzz that was Miami during the height of the bull market in Jan 2018 at the North American Bitcoin Conf. Many of the attendees had a personal connection to one or several of the Founders of the Fest and as their repertoire is not only crypto, the peaks and valleys of its cycles wasn’t such a pressing topic on everyone’s mind. It’s one thing to keep being in this space through the rough seas of the bear market, and quite another to pack electric conferences during it. Captured from the plane ride over The Swiss Alps lent its majesty as the backdrop of the affair as the attendees flew in and were greeted by the opulence and wealth of the country. First time visitors were quickly educated on the cost of living in the country, as grabbing a bottle of water at the airport set you back a distinguished 7,30 euros. NFT ART DAY IN ZUG It’s great to get in contact time and time again with the art world at large – from the point of view of crypto art & NFTs. Legacy art is still so far behind in understanding why digital certificates done right matter that it’s scary. Culturally, we feel the touch of history, as we delete and censor expression all the time. Culture and tastes change, and recently we see deletion of conversations, ideas and people. It’s always been like this. Statues are being torn, and some are still pissed that the library of Alexandria was burned. We can never take knowing history for granted. Now that AI is mixing reality unrecognisably, being verified on the decentralized blockchain matters more than ever. It was most excellent, as always, to see, hang out and party with the powerful Brittany Kaiser and my trusted gallerist Tomas Cermak from Cermak Eisenkraft Gallery. DFINITY & Internet Computer Sponsoring and co-hosting the Fest were DFINITY and their innovative project Internet Computer, who were prominently visible throughout the WEB3FEST. Lomesh Dutta gave a couple of keynote speeches on the mission and vision of the project and partied with us to Ibiza tunes late after the Unconference ended. The DFINITY Foundation’s mission is to build, promote, and maintain the Internet Computer — the world’s first web-speed, internet-scale public blockchain. It enables smart contracts to securely serve interactive web content directly into the browsers of end users, making it possible to build dapps, DeFi, open internet services, and enterprise systems that can operate at hyperscale. It helps credibility that they have a whole building to themselves. The Data-Cleopatra This title will make sense a bit later.. VESA and Brittany are going to Cairo later this year. One of the most magical aspects of in person events is that they bring together partners that you have an open folder with. Brittany Kaiser, who visited Finland in November 2021 to shoot an NFT project with VESA on data ownership and her entire life story, was present at the WEB3FEST. A major theme of the entire Fest was environmental consciousness and green initiatives. Brittany in VESA’s studio in 2021, filming a project, which is about to get energised from Egypt to complete post production via Mercantura Forum Featured initiative by the WEB3FEST founders was the Green Block. The Green Block is an initiative by Crypto Oasis Ventures to create an Ecosystem for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) related Blockchain projects and platforms. This is the first Global initiative of Crypto Oasis Ventures in commitment to the UAE’s COP28 initiative. Unlike in many other green initiative groups, this one is not afraid to have the battle of ideas inside of the group either from fear mongering to green washing – it was all on the table to figure out what is real. The Green Block is going to be an Ecosystem that aims to foster a sustainable future by bringing together stakeholders to develop and implement solutions for corporate governance, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility. The Green Block concentrates on promoting, leading, and connecting the industry to align with the goals of the UAE for COP28 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for the World. The conversations and connections evolved throughout the WEB3FEST and by the end of the conference, something beyond huge was already brewing. The first phone calls for this new development are taking place as we speak, more on that soon. Brittany had also embarked on another venture. She told VESA that she is in the process of tokenizing high-value real estate assets, namely heritage castles in France, and had her eyes on other parts of the world as well. The Fork & Flip piece from 2017 made an appearance at the back of the main ballroom at the Unconference. Faisal killed it as a moderator when Brittany was talking about green mining, the new castle project etc. Not much can be made public about the castle project yet, but you can enquire about it via join@chateaushi.com It was good to also reconnect with Matti Liukas, his lovely wife Brynne Kennedy & business partner Antonio Beja to catch up. As with every conf, there are late nights, possibly cigars, and a pissed off kitchen staff to bring in 5 times the amount of food ordered. Guess they didn’t want to be dragged back into the kitchen by a bunch of party animals 🤷 All handled with laughter & good spirits. BR8VE and Fork & Flip Two VESA pieces that have an impressive pedigree are the commission piece for an anonymous crypto OG, THE BR8VE and an early crypto art called Fork & Flip. The works were exhibited at the Fest as large fabric pieces. In themes both works are right in the core of crypto art, the predecessor to NFTs, and tell the story of the decentralized movement. It’s pretty fire to say the BR8VE could be the Guernica of Crypto, but I challenge anyone to look at the substance and see for yourself. The WEB3FEST coincided with new VESA NFTs being released on Tokengate, an NFT platform associated with the Crypto Oasis and Arte community. The highly curated and sophisticated platform immediately felt like home for the new Mirror- series, which explores transcendental, symmetrical shapes in motion and colour. What ever your art form is, when the attitude is to get things done, you hang from ceilings and help others who are coming to contribute. We always go beyond what is expected and don’t give up when things look less than optimal. The large fabric piece is now available via the website shipping almost anywhere within 10 days. It was also a pleasure to meet this Saudi gentleman Zeyad Alkhelaifi, a CAMO Aircraft Engineer, who was our guest at his first ever crypto conference. The piece Fork & Flip can be found here. Visiting the Unpaired gallery with Georg Bak Swiss NFT Association Swiss NFT Association – Assemble! Another piece of the armada forming in Switzerland is SNA – Swiss NFT Association, which held its ground as a part of the entire Swiss Web3 Fest. It was called the Unconference, held by the Swiss NFT Lakeside as it wrapped up the action-packed week of keynotes, connections, panels, and workshops. The whole experience felt like a mere glimpse into the potential firepower of the ecosystem and the Swiss NFT culture. It was great to get to know Victor and Josephine a bit, and start discussing further Swiss contributions. Pioneer gifts Early Bitcoin art gifts – verified on the #BTC chain – to early Bitcoin people and their incredible teams pushing this space forward.

It’s now verified on chain via @verisart “BitCover I”now dedicated and given as a token of appreciation to @GLRalf @DxBlockChain @Faisalsz for our past, present and future. Link to the video on insta https://instagram.com/p/BomJ_bugKIW/ As Arnold Schwarzenegger says in his Netflix docu series, no one is self made. This took an all star team. It was great to connect with Luca making sure we all got to where we needed to be, Saed connecting us to new people like Kareem from Mercantura Forum, Manal, Maria, Fabio and Mic as a new acquaintance. Tom from Tokengate was hanging with me in the ceiling attaching the large BR8VE artwork last minute. Pascal was there always to lend a hand or an idea, and was good to reconnect with Dennis as always. VESA wasn’t able to connect with everyone but many are left unmentioned. So yea. It was a vortex.

Despite rock-bottom prices on popular collections, some of them are just expanding into the real world away from digital marketplaces in search of a new audience.  Pudgy Penguins, one of the most popular and valuable NFT collections, will today debut its Pudgy Toys collection across 2,000 Walmart stores in the U.S., a representative told CoinDesk via email. These toys have been available online since May.  Each toy would come with a unique birth certificate that allows the user to claim unique traits for their digital ‘Forever Pudgy’ character inside Pudgy World, an online virtual world built on the zkSync Era blockchain, by scanning a QR code.  “Pudgy Penguins is bridging the gap between our physical and digital worlds of play for kids in a really engaging way,” said Brittany Smith, vice president of merchandising – toys, Walmart U.S.  Walmart is the biggest retailer in the U.S. and was the world’s largest company by revenue in 2022. The Pudgy Toys plushies and collectibles will now be sold alongside legacy consumer brands – aiding the collection’s popularity outside of the crypto industry.  Pudgy World’s immersive multiplayer digital environment would let users walk around, play games, and fully customize their Forever Pudgy character.  Pudgy Penguins has clocked $400 million in sales since its 2021 launch. Unlike most collections, the brand has extensively used social media and experiential marketing techniques to gain an audience went most NFT brands fizzled out.  Mainstream media has increasingly written off NFTs for their dismal price performance and how they have poor demand in a competitive retail market. However, selling physical products on recognized platforms is part of how NFT collections can interact with a real-world audience, and, hopefully, build a stronger brand.  “Walmart’s inclusion of Pudgy Toys in their stores is a testament to the evolution of how consumers engage with brands in the digital era,” explained Luca Netz, CEO of Pudgy Penguins, in a statement.  Walmart will carry 16 different types of Pudgy Toys, ranging between $2.99-$11.97.

Bitcoin Investors With More Than 10,000 BTC Are Selling Again As explained by analyst James V. Straten in a new post on X, the BTC whales, who had earlier been in a phase of accumulation, have switched their behavior to that of distribution now. The relevant indicator here is the “Trend Accumulation Score” from Glassnode, which keeps track of whether Bitcoin investors have been buying or selling during the past month. This metric finds this value by looking at the balance changes in the addresses of the holders. The score also puts a higher weightage on the larger entities, meaning that the accumulation of a few large holders would be more significant for the indicator than the behavior of the smaller hands. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Media Talk Drops To 3-Month Low, All Eyes On Altcoins? When the Trend Accumulation Score has a value close to 1, it means that there is a trend of net accumulation in the market right now. On the other hand, values close to zero imply distribution is the dominant behavior currently. Now, here is how this score has changed for the various Bitcoin investor cohorts since the start of the year: The data for the Trend Accumulation Score for various groups | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X As you can see above, the entire Bitcoin market had been displaying a net distribution behavior during August as the accumulation trend score had been a shade of red for all the cohorts (with the deeper shades naturally being closer to the zero mark). During this selloff period, BTC had registered a significant drawdown. At the start of September, most of the investor groups had still continued to sell, but interestingly, the largest cohort in the sector, the holders carrying more than 10,000 BTC ($262.7 million at the current exchange rate) had started accumulating instead. This group may be called the “mega whales,” since these investors stand out even among the whales. From the data, it’s visible that while these mega whales had been buying earlier in the month, they have recently again shown a shift in their behavior. The Trend Accumulation Score has declined for these humongous entities and now it’s leaning toward distribution. This may suggest that while these investors had thought the earlier lows presented ideal entry opportunities, the fact that the coin has only continued to stagnate recently may have changed their minds. At present, though, the mega whales aren’t dumping Bitcoin at too large a scale. The same is not true for the rest of the cohorts, however, who have taken to some pretty heavy selling recently, as the Trend Accumulation Score has turned deep red for them.

42392510,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7RbR,1695737796,Gary Gensler Is Wrong About Proof-of-Stake Tokens,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has long taken the position that the majority of crypto tokens should be treated as securities. In March 2023, Gensler stated:  “The investing public is investing anticipating a return, anticipating something on these tokens, whether they're proof-of-stake (PoS) tokens, where they're also looking to get returns on those proof-of-stake tokens and getting 2%, 4%, 18% returns. Whatever they're promoting and putting into a protocol, and locking up their tokens in a protocol, a protocol that's often a small group of entrepreneurs and developers are developing, I would just suggest that each of these token operators ... seek to come into compliance, and the same with the intermediaries.”  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week."" Graeme Moore is the head of tokenization at the Polymesh Association.  This is a false or misleading position as proof-of-stake, or PoS, tokens are not securities – even if some PoS token holders purchase them as investments with the expectation of profit. Even if most token holders purchase PoS tokens due to an economic incentive, not every purchase made as an investment is an investment in a security. People often treat sneakers as investments, but this doesn’t make buying a pair of Yeezy’s automatically the same as buying a stock.  Actual tokens themselves are not securities simply because some people expect their price to appreciate.  PoS tokens are a critical component of proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. Their function is to secure the blockchain by providing economic incentives to align participants’ behavior. Staking PoS tokens enables token holders to benefit economically from their tokens, but the primary purpose is to secure the network.  See also: We Need to Reclaim the Narrative on Staking | Staking Week  Gensler is wrong to blanket an entire token class as securities only because some can be loosely bent to fit provisions of the Howey Test. He would classify your house as a security if he could, citing that it is an investment in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others (contractors, painters, landscapers).  An increase in disclosures required for investors looking to purchase PoS tokens could make sense, so that individuals can decide if it’s the right investment for them. However, classifying things that are not securities as securities is where we must draw the line. PoS tokens, as United States District Judge Analisa Nadine Torres pointed out in the recent XRP ruling, could be sold in such a manner that would necessitate an investment contract (i.e. sales by an insider team to investors clearly expecting profit), but the actual tokens themselves are not securities simply because some people expect their price to appreciate.  And that's the case, no matter how much a regulator wants to inflate its own importance.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Graeme Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/26/gary-gensler-is-wrong-about-proof-of-stake-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f775081eaaf6db92b22b17751a2ac84ecfaa3d8-2048x1046.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392518,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7S6D,1695735760,IRS Proposed Rule on Digital Asset Broker Reporting Could Kill Crypto in America,"Nearly two years ago, the Infrastructure and Jobs Act (IIJA) passed – a bill that expanded broker information reporting to digital asset transactions and mandated Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulemaking to implement the statute. Late last month, the IRS’s long-awaited proposal arrived, and it could kill crypto in America.  The proposed rule would require newly designated brokers to report sales and exchanges of digital assets. Although the rule would exclude stakers and miners from reporting requirements, the proposal’s breadth would harm all parts of the ecosystem.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week."" Sarah Milby is senior policy director for Blockchain Association.  By expanding the definitions of “digital assets” and “broker,” the proposal would pull in people and projects who would not otherwise fall within the scope of these tax reporting obligations. These new brokers would be required to collect personal information of users – including their name, address and tax identification number – and then furnish them with a form 1099 to help calculate the gains and losses for the digital asset sales that the brokers helped “facilitate.”  The proposal raises a number of concerns for users – especially regarding their privacy, security and ability to access decentralized protocols.  Most importantly, the proposal would create unworkable reporting requirements for a wide array of participants in the digital asset ecosystem and would cause projects to shut down operations or move offshore, inhibiting U.S. innovation in blockchain technology.  In fact, due to the nature of the reporting requirements, compliance would be impossible where there does not exist a central point of control. This could have catastrophic consequences for the decentralized use of digital assets by forcing centralization, creating intermediaries where none exist and rendering decentralized technology virtually impossible to access or develop in the U.S.  In short, the proposal – as currently written – spells the end of DeFi in the United States and shows the catastrophic, far reaching effects that rulemaking can have.  Digital assets have unique characteristics that deserve individual consideration when applying the tax code  Although the IRS has finally released its proposed rulemaking, it did so nearly two years after the IIJA was passed. If the digital asset ecosystem is to have clarity in tax matters, it will require the IRS to provide both timely and well-informed guidance — something it has fallen short of doing to date. For instance, in July the IRS released guidance that said staking rewards should be taxed at receipt as gross income. However, this guidance does not take into account the realities and complexities of staking.  The IRS staking guidance relies on an overly simplistic description of staking that fails to recognize the many forms that staking can take. The guidance, for instance, does not tell us whether the taxpayer’s staking reward consists of transfers of existing digital assets from other holders or whether the reward consists of newly minted digital assets. The tax treatment under the first scenario could be vastly different from the tax treatment under the second scenario. Additionally, the guidance does not contemplate liquid staking or delegated staking.  See also: Staking Brings Decentralization Back to DeFi | Opinion  The guidance states that staking rewards should be taxed as gross income when they are received. Instead, staking rewards should be treated as property created by the taxpayer and therefore should be taxed upon sale, not receipt. As a general rule, a taxpayer who creates property does not realize income at the time of the property’s creation but at the time the property is sold. For example, a farmer who grows corn does not pay tax on that corn until it is sold because the sale is the point where income is realized. The same should apply to staking.  Staking is just one area in which there is room for more clarity in the taxation of digital assets, but there are many others that demand attention. Not only must clarity be provided, but it must not inhibit the development, innovation and utility of digital assets. Digital assets have unique characteristics that deserve individual consideration when applying the tax code to this emerging space.  If there is any hope in improving the proposed rule and the tax treatment of digital assets, industry must clearly communicate to Washington that the IRS’s digital asset tax agenda is unworkable and must be fixed. Consider submitting a comment for the proposed rule — the Department of the Treasury and IRS are accepting responses until Oct. 30.  The new proposed broker rule should stand as a warning to show how quickly broad definitions and applications of tax policy to digital assets could spiral into deadly outcomes for a new and emerging industry.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sarah Milby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/26/irs-proposed-rule-on-digital-asset-broker-reporting-could-kill-crypto-in-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0228f48f345481c6eb51c437e52f21d1270dbcbc-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Recent on-chain reports have revealed that liquid staking protocols have recorded a new milestone in the number of Ether (ETH) staked, reaching a staggering 12 million ETH mark in just a few days. Ethereum Liquid Staking Gains Momentum With Ethereum 2.0 thriving, liquid staking protocols in the DeFi ecosystem have been growing rapidly despite recent market volatility. Research data from DeFi TVL aggregator, Defillama, revealed on Monday, September 25, the tremendous growth of Ethereum holdings in liquid staking platforms. According to the data, the ETH in liquid staking protocols has risen to approximately 12.31 million and may continue rising. Related Reading: Number Of Ethereum Addresses Losing Money Just Reached A New All-Time High Reports uncovered that a staggering 370,000 ETH were staked in just five days, allowing liquid staking protocols to reach their current 12 million mark. Liquid staking platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, Coinbase, and Binance are among the list of prominent protocols that led to the recent upsurge in Ether staking. According to Defillama TVL rankings, Lido holds the top spot for the amount of Ethereum staked with a TVL of $13.997 billion in liquid staking. The protocol secured over 8 million Ether on September 20, and another 30,000 after that. Lido Finance dominates ETH liquid staking | Source: DeFiLlama Coinbase is presently ranked second in Defillama’s TVL rankings, holding approximately $2.155 billion, a significant gap from Lido’s TVL. Coinbase has about 1.3 million Ether presently in its reserve. Whereas, Rocket Pool holds the third position in TVL rankings and has increased its Ether holdings from 940,496 to 945,402. Binance Liquid Staking Platform Takes The Lead Binance liquid staking platform has been the driving force behind the recent spike in ether influx in liquid staking protocols in the DeFi ecosystem. According to reports, Binance added a startling amount of ether to its already substantial ether reserves. The liquid staking platform which previously recorded 445,000 ETH in its reserve, added 318,605 ETH and now holds 764,105 ETH. Research data have revealed that Binance amassed a considerable amount of ETH tokens to support its staking token, Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH).

Although the key protocols steering the surge are Lido, Binance, and Rocket Pool. Other upcoming liquid staking protocols like Davos and InQubeta are persisting, driven by the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade and investors desire to maximize their earnings through Ethereum staking.

""If we think you're making a payment related to crypto assets, we'll decline it,"" the email said, adding that customers are free to use a different bank or provider to invest in crypto.  However, finding a crypto-friendly bank in the country may not be the easiest thing, as U.K. credit institutions have a history of blocking or limiting customer access to crypto. The local financial watchdog – the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – recently said it had facilitated discussions between banks and crypto firms because lenders have shown a reluctance to offer services to that industry.  In the email, reviewed by CoinDesk, Chase said it was banning crypto payments because “fraudsters are increasingly using crypto assets to steal large sums of money from people” – a reason cited by other U.K. banks that have previously imposed similar limitations.  “We’re committed to helping keep our customers’ money safe and secure. We’ve seen an increase in the number of crypto scams targeting U.K. consumers, so we have taken the decision to prevent the purchase of crypto assets on a Chase debit card or by transferring money to a crypto site from a Chase account,” a spokesperson for Chase U.K. said in an email.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) has registered with Spain’s central bank to provide exchange and custody services, the company announced Monday. Registration with the Bank of Spain is a mandatory step toward offering crypto-related services, and registered firms have to comply with the country's anti-money laundering standards. While the country does not yet have a licensing regime for crypto firms, Spain will be required to implement one under the European Union's recently finalized MiCA regulation for crypto issuers and service providers set to take effect in 2024.  Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has renewed a request for temporary release from jail during the course of his trial, according to a letter from his lawyers to the judge overseeing the case filed late Monday. The request saga started in August, when his release on bond was revoked and he was locked up after a judge ruled he'd probably tried to tamper with witnesses. On Sept. 12, Bankman-Fried's request to overturn that decision was denied. An appeals court rejected an attempt to overturn the ruling on Sep. 21.  The global economy may not be ready to face the worst-case scenario of the U.S. interest rate rising as high as 7% with stagflation, according to the CEO of investment banking giant JPMorgan (JPM), Jamie Dimon, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised the benchmark borrowing cost by 525 basis points to the 5.25%-5.5% range to tame inflation. The so-called tightening cycle was partially responsible for last year's crypto market crash. According to Dimon, the Fed may have to keep raising rates to subdue persistent inflation and impending increases will likely be more damaging to the global economy.

But is the bullish momentum strong enough to push MKR to the $1,500 price mark? Let’s find out. Related Reading: Market Analysts Outline When The First Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved MKR Stands Among Top-gaining Cryptocurrencies MKR ranked number one among today’s top-gaining cryptocurrencies, gapping Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash by 2%.

However, amid the sparse buying activities in the general market, MKR recorded a 47% increase in trading volume. This observation depicts increased buy action in the Maker market. But while this increased buying strength could fuel the coin’s price rally, it’s important to identify the factors behind it. The buzz around the new proposal to deploy Spark Protocol on zkSync Era Mainnet has boosted investor sentiment. This proposal will include wETH, rETH, wstETH, and DAI as initial collaterals for borrowing on the Spark Protocol. Also, if adopted, the proposal will set a 2 million liquidity goal to spur Spark Protocol’s growth on zkSync. Already, 100% of the Maker community voted yes to launching Spark on Gnosis Chain. This development makes DAI, Maker DAO’s stablecoin, the native gas token of Gnosis Chain. In addition, it allows users to earn increased yield when lending their DAI tokens. Given this benefit, this development yielded positive sentiment in the Maker ecosystem. This positive sentiment must have translated into increased demand for MKR, the governance token of the Maker protocol, a plausible reason behind the surge in trading activities. MKR Strives To Conquer The Key Resistance Level: Is $1,500 Possible? The daily chart shows that MKR has formed two consecutive bullish candlesticks around the $1,300 price. This set-up depicts high token demand and increased buying strength around this zone. The increased buy actions have pushed MKR above a key support level of $1,086 and a critical moving average of $1,166. But, the bulls met strong opposition at the $1,354. The sell activities from profit-taking traders, evident in forming two bearish candlesticks at this level, hinder further strides. Furthermore, MKR has remained a few pipes below $1,354 since opening today’s trading session at $1,338. However, the Relative Strength Index, which increased from 63 to 64.97, approaching the overbought area, signals rising buying strength. It suggests that more buyers are entering longer positions, ready to counter the selling pressure resisting rally.

That's according to Fairlead Strategies' Founder, Katie Stockton, who informed clients on Monday that the counter-trend buy signal from DeMARK Analytics' TD (Tom Demark) Sequential indicator could lead to ether defending the weekly Ichimoku cloud support at $1,580 even as other studies favor a deeper price slide.  ""A counter-trend ‘buy’ signal from the daily TD Sequential indicator suggests support [at $1,580] will hold, given the success of other recent ‘red 13’ signals,"" Stockton said in a note to clients.  DeMark indicators help market participants gauge the state and health of the current trend and potential inflection points and are quite popular on the Bloomberg terminal.  DeMark Analytics' daily sequential indicator generates a buy signal after three conditions are satisfied, according to the CMT Association.  First, nine or more consecutive daily UTC closes must be below the corresponding closes four days earlier. Second, the high of any day on or following the eighth day must be greater than the low of any day three or more days earlier.  Once the above conditions are satisfied, traders count the number of days with a closing price lower than the close two days ago. When this count reaches 13, a buy signal is generated.  The TD sequential is marked by red numbers on the above chart. The latest 13 count comes as some analysts worry the lack of activity on Ethereum may push its native token, ether, lower.  The MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength, is teasing a bearish reversal with an impending drop below zero. Per Stockton, the way the MACD is positioned favours a downside break of the support at $1,580 and move toward $1,350.  However, the MACD's bearish signal is likely to be overshadowed by the bullish TD sequential, as the latter correctly marked short-term trend reversals early this year.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/26/ether-flashes-bullish-demark-signal-technical-analysis-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f14d0efb743e9175397ba0cc961da5ac3d6722dd-1670x1133.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This critical level has held firm for nearly three years, emerging as a significant accumulation point for savvy investors. The recent daily candle hints at a somewhat neutral stance in the market. This slight uptick in price suggests a potential dissipation of the strong bearish sentiment that has lingered, with traders now recognizing renewed buying interest hovering around the $0.24 mark. Bullish Hopes Rest On Breaking Sustained ADA Resistance The eyes of Cardano enthusiasts are now fixed on a key resistance level, as breaking free from this barrier could set the stage for a significant trend reversal. According to a price report, should Cardano manage to surpass this critical resistance point, it could spark a rally, potentially pushing prices upward by approximately 6%, with the next major hurdle resting at $0.25. Should this upward momentum persist, it could further drive the coin’s value towards the coveted $0.28 mark. Related Reading: Is Terra Classic Planning For USTC To Be Pegged To The Dollar Again?

The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), which was in March confirmed to be supervising the sector, said its guiding principles are meant to strengthen customer protection by ensuring transparency, sound asset custody methods, and reinforcing firms' internal controls and management.  Under the new guidance, crypto issuers would have to publish a white paper, and exchange platforms must set up a review mechanism for listing and delisting virtual assets. Among other requirements, the regulator said firms should also custody platform assets and customer assets separately. Overseas firms will have to register locally in accordance with company and anti-money laundering laws before serving customers.  Crypto regulation is intensifying globally following the spectacular market collapse of 2022, with added scrutiny on how firms custody clients' assets after court filings in crypto exchange FTX's bankruptcy proceedings revealed customer funds may have been mixed up with company assets.  The FSC referred to new crypto regulations from the European Union, Japan and South Korea in strengthening its own frameworks, according to a press release on the guidance publication.  Industry and self-regulatory bodies will have to set up norms based on the new guiding principles to further enhance customer protection, the FSC said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/26/taiwan-issues-crypto-guidance-as-it-steps-up-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6bcf111577bebeb370ab71d4fb608c559b852437-6913x4611.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392523,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7SLb,1695722400,"Overcrowded, No Heat, Little Light: Inside SBF's Prison Digs","Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has traded his palatial Bahamas bunker for a bunk bed as he transitions from luxe to lockup.  Bankman-Fried is staying at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, one of the nation's most notorious correctional facilities. Conditions at the jailhouse, where Bankman-Fried has resided for six weeks since losing his bail, are a far cry from the former billionaire's old Caribbean stomping grounds: The internet is slow, the living quarters dirty and the cafeteria offerings slim, his lawyers have argued.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  ""[He’s] subsisting on bread and water… sometimes peanut butter,"" the defense told a federal judge last month.  Former residents of the famous facility and their lawyers, however, have said there's much more to tell about the notorious lockup. They’ve likened conditions at the jailhouse to those faced by ""prisoners of war"" and Hannibal Lecter in the horror movie ""The Silence of the Lambs.""  But what’s MDC really like on the inside? Here’s what we know about the infamous detention center:  MDC Brooklyn is a large prison complex encompassing two buildings and housing more than 1,600 male and female prisoners, many of whom still await trial. As a mixed-security facility, the MDC houses inmates with a variety of criminal histories, including terrorism, organized crime and drug smuggling, a report from the Bureau of Prisons shows. Current inmates include Juan Orlando Hernandez, a former president of Honduras who has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges, and Guo Wengui, a Chinese businessman who has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges.  Others who have previously served short stints at the jailhouse include Epstein-accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and pharma bro Martin Shkreli.  Regimented day-to-day life  Bankman-Fried likely has a rigid schedule at MDC.  Inmates wake up at 6 a.m., and must make their beds, mop the floor and tend to their trash, an orientation handbook from the facility shows. From there, inmates like Bankman-Fried might go to work around the facility, serving as prep cooks in the jail's kitchen, providing janitorial services throughout the complex or assisting at the facility's maintenance shop.  At 11 a.m., they eat lunch. Dinner is served at 4 p.m. Meals are supposed to consist of a meat such as turkey, a starch like rice and a vegetable or fruit, but prisoners are actually served cold cuts, sandwich bread, moldy pound cakes and other ""unidentifiable food[s] from the kitchen,"" according to a petition on Change.org.  If Bankman-Fried, a vegan, doesn't like what's on offer at the cafeteria, he can use his $150 weekly commissary allowance to buy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, worth $3.65 each. He can buy up to two of those per day, according to the complex's rules.  Shared dorms, no heat and no yards  In between meals and work, inmates are allowed breaks. However, there's no prison yard for recreational activities at MDC. Instead, Bankman-Fried will have to hang out with his fellow inmates in indoor community rooms, where they can play cards, talk and watch television.  Bankman-Fried can also take showers during his downtime in one of five separate, individual shower stalls, according to former inmates. Lines to use the showers are often long.  At the end of each day, Bankman-Fried may retire to a communal dorm with rows of bunk beds, according to former prisoners’ accounts. However, it's also possible he has been put in protective custody and has his own cell.  Either way, getting some shuteye may not be easy. Fluorescent lights keep the dorm, and other rooms across the jailhouse, semi-lit 24 hours a day, inmates’ writings show. In addition, inmates can often be heard shouting across cell blocks at all hours of the night, former prisoners have said.  Uncomfortable heat and cold is another potential issue Bankman-Fried may encounter during his stay at MDC Brooklyn. According to several local news reports, many parts of the MDC lack heating, and air conditioning units are sparse throughout much of the facility.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/26/overcrowded-no-heat-little-light-inside-sbfs-prison-digs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18075360,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552890,1695720652,Market Analysts Outline When The First Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved,"In a recent development, analysts at asset management firm Bernstein have predicted when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely approve the first Spot Bitcoin ETF. When Will The First Spot Bitcoin ETF Be Approved? According to the analysts, the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications could be approved early next year. They made this projection in line with the recent court ruling in the Grayscale case, which they believe could force the SEC’s hands. Related Reading: $200 Million In Crypto Lost As Mixin Network Comes Under Attack The court had ruled in favor of Grayscale in a case in which the asset manager argued that the Commission had acted arbitrarily and capriciously by not giving its Spot Bitcoin ETF application the same regulatory treatment it did to Bitcoin futures ETFs. As part of its ruling, the court ordered the Commission to review the application again. Many saw this as a major win and proof that a Spot Bitcoin ETF was imminent, with Bloomberg analysts also weighing in and increasing the likelihood of these pending funds launching this year to 75%. They stated that “the unanimity and decisiveness of [the] ruling was beyond expectations,” with the SEC having little or nothing to hang on to. The analysts at Bernstein also seem to adopt this view as they noted that the SEC would simply go the “middle route” and be more open to approving these ETFs rather than “inventing another reason for refusal” and sticking to the strict approach which they have taken on the crypto industry so far. This projection also seems feasible since the SEC must decide (approve or deny) on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF by January 10, 2024. Considering that the court has overruled the primary reason why the SEC has continued to deny these applications, the Commission might have difficulty coming up with another convincing reason to deny the application. Before then, the SEC will be expected to decide on some pending applications in October. However, the Commission can delay its decision on them once again. ETFs Integral To The Crypto Asset Management Industry Bernstein’s analysts also project the crypto asset management industry to grow from its current level (between $45 to $50 billion) to over $500 billion in the next five years. These ETFs, which they project could launch early next year, are part of the factors they believe could spur such growth. Related Reading: Number Of Ethereum Addresses Losing Money Just Reached A New All-Time High According to them, there will be increased demand from institutional investors in crypto assets, and funds such as a Spot Bitcoin ETF will be their go-to option. A Spot Bitcoin ETF will allow these investors to invest directly in the flagship cryptocurrency in a regulated manner. In line with this, they expect the ETFs to hold 10% of the Bitcoin and Ethereum market cap and “5-6% share for liquid crypto hedge funds.” BTC price sitting above $26,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview.com",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/analyst-spot-bitcoin-etf/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/18075360.jpeg

42392531,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7SvV,1695718449,Ethereum Staking in 2023: A Year of Growth and Transformation,"The Merge upgrade, which effectively brought the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to Ethereum, was activated almost a year ago. The subsequent Ethereum Shapella upgrade, which allowed staked ETH withdrawals, is about six months old. With these two monumental changes, we saw the rise of the Ethereum staking industry, which already counts more than $40 billion worth of staked assets and has generated over $1.6 billion in total staking rewards, a proxy for total revenue.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Staking Week.  Below we look at three prominent matters for Ethereum staking going forward.  Growing institutional interest in staking  By any conceivable metric, the Ethereum PoS transition was a tremendous success. According to data from Staking Rewards, the total amount of staked ETH currently stands at $41.5 billion, representing 46% of the total staked assets across all blockchains. Staked ETH already represents 21.7% of the total supply, versus 6.5% and 15.1% when the Merge and Shapella were activated, respectively.  When measured against other supply metrics, the adoption is even more striking: The supply of ETH staked has recently surpassed 50% and 65% of the supply active over the past year and six months, respectively.  Notably, during this intense ramp-up period, the network has been operating smoothly, except for two relatively minor incidents, in which the network failed to finalize blocks for a few minutes but managed to recover on its own.  Institutional investors took notice, of course.  One measure of how ETH staking has been incorporated by institutions is the difference between ETH and BTC basis (i.e., the difference between futures and spot prices) in the CME, a venue used exclusively by institutional investors. The reason is simple: Given that ETH now derives a native yield and BTC does not, the difference between the BTC and the ETH basis should approximate this yield because it reduces the futures contract carry cost.  Read more: The State of Staking: 5 Takeaways a Year After Ethereum's Merge  The chart below shows the evolution of the difference between BTC and ETH annualized basis on the CME futures contracts. It indicates that institutional investors are considering staking in their pricing process. This difference, which was negligible until about a year ago, currently stands at 3.2% and 3.5% for the most liquid contracts (30 and 60 days to expiration). This difference is close enough to the Composite Ethereum Staking Rate (CESR) of 3.9%.  Will Ethereum staking fervor cool?  But it’s not all rosy skies. Early signals indicate that the Ethereum staking adoption fervor could start to slow.  Ethereum's staking participation rate (22% of total supply staked) still significantly lags behind other PoS networks such as Solana (71% staked), Cardano (62% staked), and others. This is largely expected, given that ETH has a much more distributed holder base and is more used as a network resource.  The question is to what extent this gap will close.  Consider the number of validators wanting to stake their ETH and waiting in line because the network can only handle a certain number of new entrants simultaneously. After the Shapella upgrade, this number grew to nearly 100,000 in less than two months. This far exceeds the number of people wanting to remove their staked ETH, which has been virtually zero for most of the time.  Since June 2023, the number of validators in the activation queue has consistently declined. It now stands at under 30,000, the lowest level since May. If this trend remains for a few months, the rate of increase of ETH staked will taper down in a couple of months.  One factor behind the slowdown is that broader macroeconomic conditions have shifted from a tailwind to a headwind for investors looking at crypto for yield generation. The Composite Ether Staking Rate shrunk from 5.5% at the Merge upgrade to 3.9% due to more validators and lower network activity. For comparison, the two-year Treasury interest rate climbed from 3.8% to 5.2% over the same period.  Another, perhaps more controversial, concern is the dominance that Lido, the leading staking provider that now controls a tad under a third of the total staked ETH, was able to maintain after Shapella. The one-third threshold is relevant because it could allow an attacker who owns this much staked ETH to start impacting the Ethereum network finality.  Recently, some staking providers committed to self-limit to less than 22% of the Ethereum validators, but Lido voted not to self-limit. The good news is that the protocol is working on further decentralizing their operator set and recently added seven more members. Moreover, further initiatives will contribute to network decentralization, including proposer-builder separation (PBS), which can democratize access to sophisticated MEV, and distributed validator technology (DVT), which will allow validators to be controlled by multiple entities. Lido itself is working on adopting DVT.  The future looks bright  2023 will mark the year in which Ethereum staking took off despite crypto’s longest bear market.  We expect the Ethereum staking industry to keep gaining momentum going forward. Institutional investors can now use increasingly seamless staking platforms geared to their specific needs. DeFi users are witnessing a burgeoning set of new primitives that leverage staked assets for new use cases, such as sophisticated interest rate trading.  Nothing in crypto evolves in a straight line, but it’s hard not to get excited about the long-term prospects of the Ethereum staking industry.

18073571,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552868,1695716124,Bitcoin Price Predictions For 2024: Insights From Major Banks To Hedge Funds,"With anticipation around Bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco, and an expected halving in April 2024, forecasts for Bitcoin’s price next year show a significant range. From JPMorgan to Standard Chartered Bank, here are the most notable estimates for 2024: Pantera Capital: $150,000 In their August “Blockchain Letter”, Pantera Capital, led by Dan Morehead, predicts a possible rise to $147,843 post the 2024 halving. Employing the stock-to-flow (S2F) ratio, they believe the price model suggests the valuation of Bitcoin against its scarcity will become more pronounced. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings with $147.3 Million Purchase Specifically, Pantera Capital stated, “The 2020 halving reduced the supply of new bitcoins by 43% relative to the previous halving. It had a 23% as big an impact on price.” With history as a reference, this could indicate a hike from $35k before the halving to $148k after. However, not all Bitcoin supporters are on board, having witnessed failed predictions based on this model in the recent past. Standard Chartered Bank: $120,000 In a recent research report from July, Standard Chartered Bank offered a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. The British multinational bank now expects Bitcoin’s value to ascend to $50,000 by the end of the current year, with the potential to soar as high as $120,000 by the close of 2024. This revised forecast from Standard Chartered marks an increase from their previous April prediction, where they projected a top of $100,000 for Bitcoin. The upward revision in the bank’s forecast is underpinned by several determining factors. Notably, one primary reason cited for the potential price escalation is the ongoing banking-sector crisis. Additionally, the report sheds light on the rising profitability for Bitcoin miners as a pivotal factor influencing the price trajectory. Geoff Kendrick, the head of FX and digital assets research, emphasizes the instrumental role of miners. He notes, “The rationale here is that, in addition to maintaining the Bitcoin ledger, miners play a key role in determining the net supply of newly mined BTC.” JPMorgan: $45,000 Per Bitcoin JPMorgan, one of the world’s leading investment banks, anticipates a more restrained growth for Bitcoin, predicting a rise to $45,000. This forecast is influenced by the surging gold prices. Historically, Bitcoin and gold have shown correlation in their price movements, and with the gold price recently surpassing the $2,000 mark per ounce, it has bolstered JPMorgan’s conservative outlook on Bitcoin. In a detailed note from May, JPMorgan strategists explained, “With the gold price rising above $2,000, the value of gold held for investment purposes outside central banks stands at about [$3 trillion]. Consequently, this suggests a Bitcoin price of $45,000, based on the premise that BTC will achieve a standing akin to gold among private investors.” Matrixport: $125,000 By End-2024 In July, Matrixport, a prominent crypto services provider, predicted that Bitcoin’s price could surge to as high as $125,000 by the close of 2024. This optimistic outlook was based on historical price patterns and a significant signal: Bitcoin’s recent breach of $31,000 in mid-July, marking its highest level in over a year. Historically, such milestones have signaled the end of bear markets and the beginning of robust bull markets. By comparing these patterns with historical data from 2015, 2019, and 2020, Matrixport estimated potential gains of up to 123% within twelve months and 310% within eighteen months. This translates to potential Bitcoin prices of $65,539 and $125,731 within those respective timeframes. Tim Draper: $250,000 Tim Draper, a prominent venture capitalist, maintains a highly bullish outlook on Bitcoin. While his previous prediction for Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by June 2023 didn’t materialize, he remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. In a July interview on Bloomberg TV, Draper attributed recent regulatory actions in the United States, such as those against Coinbase and Binance, to BTC’s short-term downtrend. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Drop To $20,000? EURUSD Correlation Indicates It Might Despite these challenges, Draper continues to believe in Bitcoin’s transformative power and sees it potentially reaching $250,000, albeit now possibly by 2024 or 2025. His confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to revolutionize finance and retain its long-term value remains unwavering. Berenberg: $56,630 At Bitcoin Halving The German investment bank Berenberg revised its prediction in July, pointing toward $56,630 by April 2024. This upward adjustment was supported by improved market sentiment attributed to the anticipation of the Bitcoin halving event expected in April 2024 and the growing interest exhibited by prominent institutional players. Berenberg’s team of analysts, led by the insightful Mark Palmer, emphasizes their expectation of significant appreciation in Bitcoin’s value in the coming months. This projection is driven by two key factors: the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event and the growing enthusiasm displayed by significant institutions. Highlighting their confidence in the market, Berenberg also reaffirmed its buy rating on the stock of Microstrategy. The bank has revised its share price target for Microstrategy from $430 to $510, driven by a higher valuation of the company’s BTC holdings and an improved outlook for its software business. Blockware Solutions: $400,000 Blockware Intelligence, in an analysis from August titled “2024 Halving Analysis: Understanding Market Cycles and Opportunities Created by the Halving,” delved into the intriguing possibility of Bitcoin’s price reaching $400,000 during the next halving epoch, anticipated in 2024/25. A central factor identified in the research is the role of the halving in shaping Bitcoin’s market cycles. The report asserts that miners, responsible for a significant portion of sell pressure, receive newly minted BTC, much of which they must sell to cover operational costs. However, the halving events serve to weed out inefficient miners, leading to reduced sell pressure. With supply diminishing due to halvings, the research emphasizes that demand becomes the primary determinant of BTC’s market price. Historical data indicates that a surge in demand typically follows halving events. Market participants, equipped with an understanding of the supply-side dynamics introduced by halvings, prepare to deploy capital at the first signs of upward momentum, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation. This surge in demand is particularly evident in current on-chain data, validating the positive sentiment surrounding halving events. Beyond these notable forecasts, there are a plethora of other price predictions for BTC, ranging from Cathie Wood’s (ARK Invest) ambitious $1 million projection to Mike Novogratz’s (Galaxy Digital) $500,000, Tom Lee’s (Fundstrat Global) $180,000, Robert Kiyosaki’s (Rich Dad Company) $100,000, Adam Back’s $100,000, and Arthur Hayes’ $70,000 prediction, underscoring the diverse perspectives on Bitcoin’s future value.

42392515,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7Rqp,1695715501,Sam Bankman-Fried Refiles for Temporary Release Ahead of Trial,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has renewed a request for temporary release from jail during the course of his trial, according to a letter from his lawyers to the judge overseeing the case filed late Monday.  The request saga started in August, when his release on bond was revoked and he was locked up after a judge ruled he'd probably tried to tamper with witnesses. On Sept. 12, Bankman-Fried's request to overturn that decision was denied. An appeals court rejected an attempt to overturn the ruling on Sep. 21.  In its latest ruling the court ""did not foreclose a further application from the defense,"" Bankman-Fried's lawyers wrote, adding that it is ""exceedingly difficult as a practical matter"" to prepare for the trial. The legal team said it appreciated government efforts to provide Bankman-Fried with case materials and counsel.  Practical realities such as the government providing the defense a list of over 50 potential witnesses, thousands of pages of material and more than 1,300 exhibits, argue for a temporary release, the lawyers said. They added that they didn't know which witnesses the government would call or in which order and so would not be able to prepare for the ""next day’s witnesses and exhibits in the hours when we are not sitting in the courtroom.""  The renewed attempt asks for Bankman-Fried to be released on Oct. 2, the day before his trial, and comes with five conditions he is willing to adhere to.  When not in the courtroom, he must be with his attorneys at his attorneys’ offices or offsite workspace, or with a security guard in a temporary residence in New York City. He will be able to leave the courthouse with his attorneys and travel with them to their workplace to prepare for trial.  Bankman-Fried will consent to a gag order prohibiting him from speaking to anyone but his attorneys, parents and brother during the course of the trial.  He will also be accompanied by a private security guard starting at 10 p.m. to ensure he does not have access to any computers, cell phones, the Internet, television, or any electronic devices. Defense lawyers and prosecutors previously argued over Bankman-Fried's access to a laptop computer.

The crypto fund management business could have assets of as much as $650 billion within five years as the expected launch of spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. is likely to bring more capital to the market, broker Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  The current ""cottage industry"" has about $50 billion of assets under management, equivalent to about 4% of the present size of the crypto market, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. At press time, the total crypto market capitalization was $1.08 trillion.  The research comes months after the likes of BlackRock filed for a spot-based ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Early this month, the regulator delayed making a decision on all of the spot ETF applications until October. The crypto market is hopeful that an eventual launch of spot-based ETFs will unlock the floodgates to mainstream money.  Bernstein expects demand to be driven by ""investment advisors, wealth and private banking integrated products and easier access to ETFs in direct broker accounts.""  That would imply a 10% ETF share for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) market cap and a 5-6% share for crypto hedge funds, the note said.  ""Crypto financial adoption follows hype cycles, and we expect a hockey stick adoption, with 2024 as the landmark regulatory year for approval of ETFs,"" the report added.

There have been objections to the plan, including from the U.S. Trustee. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York will hold a confirmation hearing for final approval on Oct. 2. The Judge overseeing the case had approved the voting procedure in August 2023.  Most of the classes in the bankruptcy claim were passed by more than 98% votes in favor of the reorganization that would also see the sale of assets to crypto consortium Fahrenheit Holdings that includes Arrington Capital and miner U.S. Bitcoin Corp. Fahrenheit won a bid to acquire the insolvent lender Celsius Network in May 2023.  The overwhelming vote marks another step towards the end of Celsius' bankruptcy and the return of funds to customers. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July last year as the crypto winter set in and its Chief Executive Officer Alex Mashinsky resigned as CEO in September 2022. In July 2023, Mashinsky was arrested on fraud charges and for manipulating the price of the CEL token, which he has denied.  As Mashinsky was arrested, Celsius made a $4.7 billion settlement with the U.S. over fraud allegations and said this would not affect reorganization plans.

The price action for LTC in September has remained primarily bearish, with sellers maintaining control over the market. While LTC has a history of volatile price swings, recent times have seen it mirroring the sideways movement of the overall market, largely influenced by Bitcoin’s fluctuations, which rose from $25,000 to $27,000 before dropping to $26,000. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, Litecoin is currently trading at $64.63, with a 24-hour gain of 0.7%. However, over the past seven days, LTC has experienced a decline of 2.9%, reflecting the prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, according to a recent price report. Related Reading: Is Terra Classic Planning For USTC To Be Pegged To The Dollar Again? Chasing Litecoin Bulls and Avoiding The Bears For those looking for a bullish revival in Litecoin’s price, a price report notes that the key level to watch is the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which stands at $69. Breaking above this level could open the door for further gains, with potential targets lying at $78 and $80. On the other hand, if the flat trading volume persists, bears may exert further pressure, potentially leading to a drop in LTC’s price to the $60 mark. Source: Coinalyze Market speculators have not been particularly enthusiastic about Litecoin’s recent sideways movement. The Open Interest (OI) for LTC has continued to decline, with data from Coinalyze indicating a $9 million drop within the past 48 hours. This suggests that traders and investors are becoming increasingly cautious as they monitor the developments in the Litecoin market. Litecoin’s Investment Appeal in Q3/Q4 Despite the recent lackluster performance, some analysts believe that Litecoin remains an attractive investment opportunity in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Litecoin’s established reputation, solid ecosystem, and upcoming halving events are factors that contribute to its appeal. LTC market cap currently at $4.7 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Halving events have historically had a positive impact on Litecoin’s price, reducing the rate at which new LTC coins are mined and potentially increasing scarcity. Related Reading: Will Dogecoin Bounce Back To $0.07? Here’s What To Watch For Market participants are closely watching the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $69 for signs of a bullish revival, while a continuation of flat trading volume could see LTC drop to $60. Despite recent market concerns, Litecoin’s strong fundamentals and upcoming halving events make it an investment opportunity worth considering as we move into the later part of the year.

The so-called liquidity tightening cycle was partially responsible for last year's crypto market crash.  Per Dimon, the Fed may have to keep raising rates to subdue persistent inflation and impending upticks in the borrowing cost will likely be more damaging to the global economy.  ""Going from zero to 2% was almost no increase. Going from zero to 5% caught some people off guard, but no one would have taken 5% out of the realm of possibility,"" Dimon said, during an interview with the Times of India. ""I am not sure if the world is prepared for 7%.""  ""If they are going to have lower volumes and higher rates, there will be stress in the system,"" Dimon added.  Rates at 7% with stagflation or persistent high inflation and joblessness would increase the risk of U.S. economy falling into a recession, an undesirable outcome for risk assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. Besides, continued tightening would lift the already elevated U.S. Treasury yields to multi-decade highs. Bonds already look most attractive since 2009, threatening to drain capital from risky investments.  Dimon's comments contradict the popular view that the Fed's tightening cycle has peaked. The central bank has said it intends to keep borrowing costs higher for longer.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/26/world-may-not-be-ready-for-us-interest-rate-at-7-jpmorgans-ceo-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8c5bf4ca64a5395a65f8ba25596aa1f909055a0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

An online record at the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Department site shows one ""Benjamin Charles Armstrong"" was arrested for ""loitering/prowling"" and for ""simple assault by placing another in fear"" with a bond amount of $2,600.  Armstrong was apparently carrying a gun in the backseat of his car, and was traveling with one other person, a live-stream snippet on X indicated.  BEN tokens, floated by Armstrong earlier this year, dropped 30% as reports of the arrest leaked early on Tuesday.  Armstrong sent a tweet acknowledging the incident.  Armstrong was previously ousted from his media company, BitBoy Crypto, following a unanimous decision, as per an August announcement, which likely led to Monday’s altercation.

XRP price could take a hit if it fails to recover above $0.512. Ripple’s token price is attempting a fresh increase above $0.508 and $0.512 against the US dollar. The price is now trading above $0.500 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major contracting triangle forming with resistance near $0.505 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might gain bullish momentum if there is a close above $0.512. Ripple’s Token Price Holds Key Support In the last XRP price prediction, we discussed the chances of more gains in Ripple’s XRP against the US Dollar. The price did climb above the $0.515 resistance level, but upsides were limited, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price struggled to clear the $0.525 resistance. A high was formed near $0.5254 and the price saw a downside correction. There was a move below $0.512 and a spike below $0.50. A low is formed near $0.4907 and the price is now consolidating. It is back above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.5254 swing high to the $0.4907 low. XRP price is also trading above $0.500 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.508 level. Besides, there is a major contracting triangle forming with resistance near $0.505 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. The triangle resistance coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.5254 swing high to the $0.4907 low. Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $0.5120 level. A close above the $0.512 level could send the price toward the $0.525 barrier. A successful break above the $0.525 resistance level might start a strong rally toward the $0.555 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $0.580 resistance. Downside Break in XRP? If ripple fails to clear the $0.512 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.50 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). The next major support is at $0.490. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.490 level, XRP’s price could extend losses. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.460 support zone.

18062736,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552837,1695686453,"NEAR Protocol’s Daily Active Addresses Spike, Will Prices Follow?","In the past month, there have been more daily active addresses on the NEAR Protocol than in Ethereum and its layer-2 protocols, including Arbitrum and OP Mainnet, Artemis data from September 25 reveals. Artemis, an institutional data platform for digital assets, shows that the number of daily active addresses on NEAR Protocol has been consistently above the 400,000 level in September. Daily Active Addresses On NEAR Protocol Surging Looking closer at the data confirms that the number of daily active addresses on Ethereum, the pioneer smart contract platform that hosts most decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) activity, has been dropping. To illustrate, the number of daily active on Ethereum rose above 1 million in mid-September but has since more than halved to below 400,000. The same trend can be seen in Arbitrum, which dropped from around 200,000 in late June to 150,000 when writing on September 25. During this time, NEAR Protocol’s daily active addresses have rapidly spiked from around 40,000 in late June to above 400,000, outperforming Ethereum in this metric. With rising daily active addresses, there has been a spike in daily transactions over the past month. According to trackers, the NEAR Protocol processes more transactions than Ethereum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Media Talk Drops To 3-Month Low, All Eyes On Altcoins? Public ledgers like NEAR Protocol and Ethereum depend on a community of users who actively transact—moving value or running protocols—or validators- to secure the network. However, the number of daily active addresses can provide valuable insights into the level of adoption, user engagement, and the network’s overall health. Besides user engagement, rising daily active addresses might also point to changing market sentiment, which could significantly impact prices. Bears In Control As DEX Trading Volume Remains Relatively Stable When writing, NEAR, the native token of the NEAR Protocol, is trading at around 2023 lows. Changing hands at $1.107, the coin is down 61% from 2023 highs and remains under pressure. The candlestick arrangement in the daily chart points to consolidation and stability above the primary resistance level at $1. Bears have the upper hand if prices remain below $1.23, a critical resistance level marking the August 17 highs. As evidence shows, the network activity and price action diverge. Although the transaction count also rose, the number of unique addresses interacting with NEAR Protocol decentralized exchanges has mostly been stable. Looking at the numbers, DEX volume on the platform is significantly lower than those registered in Ethereum and its popular layer-2 platforms.
