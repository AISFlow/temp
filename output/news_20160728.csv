42399181,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZue,1469740635,Coinbase’s First Employee is Leaving to Start His Own Hedge Fund,"While the firm does not yet have investors or even its own website, Carlson-Wee believes that his vision for Polychain Capital will be enough to turn it into one that generates significant returns for those who invest, given that the fund plans to invest solely in cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based tokens.  In interview, Carlson-Wee asserted that, owing to the poor returns shown by VCs so far in the industry, investors are better off investing in bitcoin, ethereum, steem, as well as projects like The DAO.  Carlson-Wee told CoinDesk:  ""Most of the hackers I know have made 50x returns and they’re not VCs. I think we’re entering a new model, where people who will be rewarded are the token holders themselves. You’re supporting the protocol, not a company.""  That said, Carlson-Wee believes he’s identified three reasons why large investors aren’t already active in digital currency markets.  For one, he noted that it’s a difficult and financially dangerous process, given that they trade on rapidly changing markets that are open for business 24 hours a day. Sometimes, he said, large investors simply can’t jump into the fray due to legal reasons.  ""If you’re a VC fund, and if you have limited partners, you can’t buy cryptocurrencies, and its difficult to keep on what’s going on. You find out by forum announcements and have to participate in some weird pre-sales,"" he said.  The solution, according to Carlson-Wee, is that Polychain Capital will create an actively managed portfolio of blockchain-based assets, something he argued makes sense for investors who believe broadly in blockchain, beyond simply the major digital currencies.  Carlson-Wee said:  “If you invest into the hedge fund, you’re getting access to this tech, but you’re diversified across risk. No matter which tech emerges, I’m capturing gains the whole way.”  Leaving Coinbase  Founded in 2012, Coinbase is one of the largest and earliest bitcoin startups, having raised $117m in venture capital across five funding rounds. So, why leave Coinbase? After three-and-a-half years, Carlson-Wee said he was ready for a change.  Carlson-Wee said that he prefers to work in a small environment, and that he, perhaps, doesn’t function best in places with “protocols and people and communication”.  “I think, fundamentally, I do better in a very small entrepreneurial environment,” he said.  To start, Carlson-Wee’s team will be small, in that he’ll be the only employee, outsourcing legal work to attorneys. It’s notable also that Carlson-Wee’s first professional job was at Coinbase, and that he hasn’t worked for another company.  That said, Carlson-Wee said he isn’t deterred by the difficulty of navigating a new environment. Plus, he argued that what he lacks in experiences, he makes up for in deep subject-matter expertise.  ""I have the core things that matter a deep knowledge of crypto protocols, and what’s going to do well and what’s not going to do well,"" he said.  Multi-blockchain future  But Carlson-Wee isn’t alone in offering a digital currency-focused hedge fund. Larger industry players like Pantera Capital and Crypto Currency Fund, for example, have been offering the service for years.  The difference with Polychain Capital, according to Carlson-Wee, lies in his vision for the future, and how he intends to position investors to capture earnings created through developments in the blockchain industry.  He noted that this thesis is in line with industry trends, and that today, more and more people are beginning to believe that there will be more than one blockchain in the future.  ""I saw this emerging and I think the really interesting stuff isn't happening on the bitcoin blockchain, it’s happening on ethereum and with different blockchains,"" he said.  In particular, Carlson-Wee believes ethereum’s digital currency, ether, as well as the digital currencies that could one day be created on the platform to represent decentralized applications, will be a significant area of development going forward.  He concluded:  ""The big returns and the best way to invest will be in the tokens themselves.""

42399167,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZjp,1469733914,Bitcoin Startup Founder Resigns Board Position Amid Fraud Charges,"The former executive chairman of a publicly listed Australian digital currency startup has been indicted by the US government for his alleged involvement in a fraudulent text messaging scheme.  Zhenya Tsvetnenko was among three parties named in a superseding indictment unsealed last week in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Tsvetnenko co-founded DigitalX, which was originally a bitcoin mining firm called DigitalBTC before it moved to launch a payments app called Air Pocket.  US prosecutors have alleged that Tsvetnenko, among other defendants named in the case, was involved with a scheme to sign consumers up for recurring text messages without their consent and make money off of the ensuing monthly fees.  According to the indictment, as many as several hundred thousand mobile phone users were allegedly signed up as part of the scheme. Prosecutors further alleged that those involved pocketed millions of dollars in revenue.  Tsvetnenko was charged with wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, according to court documents. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison.  According to Australian news reports, Tsvetnenko has denied the allegations and plans to fight extradition to the US from Australia, where he resides.  Tsvetnenko resigned from his executive chair position at DigitalX, according to a 25th July announcement, which came three days after US prosecutors announced the charges. DigitalX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The full superseding indictment can be found below:    US. v.

42399170,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZko,1469725626,Ethereum's Two Ethereums Explained,"What started as an attempt to rescue investor funds in a high-profile project has resulted in a schism that has effectively split the community on the second-largest public blockchain.  The split is not only psychological. Thanks to the design of public blockchain systems, it is also technical, with competing visions manifesting in two very real blockchains, or versions of the project’s transaction history.  As of this weekend, there are now two groups working on two competing versions of a project called ethereum, a blockchain-based platform designed to enable decentralized application development.  If bitcoin envisioned how a distributed group of users could create and manage a currency, ethereum sought to allow a distributed group of users to create and manage a decentralized, uncensorable app store. (You can learn more in our latest CoinDesk Research report).  However, there are now two slightly different versions of this platform available to users – ethereum, the 'official' version of the blockchain maintained by its original developers, and ethereum classic, an 'alternative' blockchain maintained by a wholly new team.  Both offer the same technology platforms, and according to developers, they're in agreement on a formal roadmap for steps forward. But, the small differences have created two markets, both with a combined value of roughly $1.2bn.  How did we get here?  Let’s start with The DAO.  Long the most notable ethereum project, The DAO, short for distributed autonomous organization, raised $150m in ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – earlier this year during a public crowdsale. Held online, anyone who had ether could participate. The idea was simple, in theory. Investors would send money to The DAO and receive voting tokens, and then those who invested (and voted) would decide democratically how The DAO should disperse those funds.  Just as votes were starting to be held, however, The DAO was hacked, attacked or otherwise compromised, depending on your point of view. To some in the academic community, the early problems were obvious, and debates about their severity had already begun.  But, this all came to a halt when an individual or individuals used a valid action in the code to withdraw the funds to another DAO he or she controlled. To the ethereum platform, the action was valid to the extent it was able to be executed according to contract terms; to others who invested, it was a much more contentious action.  Skipping ahead, the ethereum community eventually held a vote, with the majority of participants agreeing that they wanted to change ethereum’s code to get the funds back to investors – and away from the attacker.  Enter ethereum classic  What happened next is that a small minority disagreed with this choice, and then took action.  While the majority argued that blockchains can and should be altered if enough people agree, other developers asserted that, in order to provide a sound history, a blockchain has to be censorship-resistant and free from tampering.  So, instead of making the switch when ethereum created an entirely new blockchain, the vocal minority continued to mine the old version of the blockchain. Effectively, ‘ethereum classic’ is a parallel version of the blockchain where funds were never returned to ether owners who lost funds in the demise of The DAO. Ethereum, by contrast, is a blockchain that has moved those funds to another address.  But this seemingly small disagreement had an outsized impact.  “Ethereum Foundation responded to DAO debacle in the worst way possible,” reads the ethereum classic website, and explains further:  “We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can't shut down, running irreversible smart contracts.”  Project organizers followed up with a crypto manifesto outlining the rules that blockchains are supposed to follow in their eyes, including openness and, perhaps more vitally, immutability – the idea that once transactions are made, in this case a hack, they shouldn’t be reversed.  ""Not all blockchains are created equal,"" it reads.  And by staying on the unchanged version of ethereum, they’re preserving these values.  Who's involved in ethereum classic?  The ethereum classic team currently has four developers, according to its lead organizer, named Arvicco (he won’t reveal his identity), but theoretically, anyone can join. Just like ethereum itself, ethereum classic is supported by an open-source community.  A number of notable developers have also voiced an interest in helping the ethereum classic project, including early ethereum CEO Charles Hoskinson (who left the team in 2014 over differences detailed here).  What’s important to note, though, is the blockchain is not merely being supported for ideological reasons. A growing number of ethereum miners have devoted computational power toward the classic blockchain, seemingly, because they see a value in securing its transactions and winning the associated mining rewards.  At press time, the hash rate for the network was 544 GH/s, or about 13% of the ethereum network’s hashing power, an arguably impressive figure given that the blockchain has only been around for a matter of days.  Why is profitable?  The question of what gives classic ethers (ETC) value is still up for debate, but in short, it has value because people believe in the project, and those interested in supporting it can invest in (or speculate) on the market now that it’s listed on exchanges.  Since ethereum classic is essentially a clone of the digital currency, ether holders can now make money by making an account on the ethereum classic version of the blockchain and duplicating their balance.  As ethereum classic is a replica of the original blockchain, except for a few key changes regarding The DAO transaction reversals, everyone who had tokens on ethereum at the time of the fork now has the same amount of tokens on ethereum classic. To traders, this is essentially free money.  If you owned $100 of ether at the time of the fork (when it was worth roughly $12), you’d have had about 8 ETH, which means you now have 8 ETC, or an extra $16. However, those who held more ether, now have a lot more free money.  This has since caused problems for exchanges, as, even if they don’t want to list classic ether tokens, they’re arguably holding what could be called customer funds anyway simply by possessing ether at the time of the split. But major exchanges have picked up the alternative ethereum coin, so it’s now possible to trade ETH for ETC.  Poloniex, an ethereum exchange, was the first. Kraken, Shapeshift, and Bitfinex followed shortly after, meaning most of the exchanges that support ethereum now support ethereum classic.  There’s also been the opportunity for profiting by switching between currencies, and one startup founder has even wondered if this is a new way to double spend currency, a problem that the bitcoin blockchain was design to solve as it doesn’t require a central authority.  Who's impacted?  Ethereum token holders on both blockchains could be affected by ""replay attacks"" if they don’t properly “separate” their addresses to differentiate them on each blockchain, which looks like a complicated process for each individual user to follow.  Since, again, much of ethereum classic is the same as the old network, most users with a balance on one of them can use it on the other, but this could theoretically result in some funny mistakes, like unintentionally moving funds on one of the other networks.  Poloniex has decided to automatically take precautions for its users and ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin suggested that ethereum classic update its code to solve the problem.  What does this have to do with bitcoin?  Speaking of important takeaways, whatever happens with classic is new insight that might be used in bitcoin.  The debate around expanding bitcoin’s block size, a technical upward bound on the size of transactions that the network can support, might not seem relevant to the split, but it is.  One point Bitcoin Core developers continued to argue during the long-standing debate was that contentious hard forks are dangerous and can have unexpected consequences, such as splitting a blockchain into two competing blockchains.  Many in the community, for example BitPay Co-Founder and CEO Stephen Pair, think that ethereum classic’s sudden popularity shows that these were valid concerns.  Adding to the debate is that ethereum’s hard fork was immediately branded as a success by many Ethereum developers and others in the bitcoin industry. For example, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that they’re ""not something to be feared that results in multiple coins"".  But this analysis might have been premature, and he indicated as much in a new blog post.  In a weird twist, some bitcoin developers appear to support ethereum classic for this very reason, if also to demonstrate what the potential risks of switching to a new blockchain in order to update the codebase without consensus.  What does this mean for ethereum?  The attention currently on ethereum classic could fizzle out, or it might not. Taking bitcoin classic as an example, the bitcoin classic subreddit is still active even if it never replaced bitcoin as its engineers intended.  There could be two ethereum’s that continue to develop along different paths into the future.  For now, one of them has the same functionality that ethereum is supposed to deliver, mainly smart contracts that help to construct versions of Twitter that are safe from censorship and decentralized autonomous organizations. But it’s both cheaper and more of a hassle to use without an ecosystem of developer tools built around it.  Ethereum itself is also impacted as some users and miners are staying on the old chain, decreasing the number of total users and the network security.  Now that it’s happened though, and ethereum classic exists, the community has tons of questions. These include whether hard forking the blockchain, or rewriting the code to reverse transactions without near-unanimous consensus, is worth the risk, and if ethereum developers forked again to solve a similar problem, would it split again?  Either way, it’s not clear if the rise of ethereum classic is a bad thing for the technology.  The protest blockchain gave the minority a chance to build their own system, and some people think it’s an exciting development.  What do you think? Share your thoughts below.

42399178,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZqi,1469724593,KPMG: DAO Failure Won't Hinder Private Blockchain Progress,"As major financial institutions began to show interest in blockchain earlier this year, many were vocal in their praise for ethereum, a public blockchain-based platform for decentralized application development.  But as has been illustrated by high-profile issues such as the collapse of The DAO and the recent contentious hard fork, the second most popular public blockchain platform is still showing signs of growing pains, ones that could lead to new questions of its underlying technology despite enterprise interest.  However, KPMG US blockchain lead Eamonn Maguire says he doesn't believe enterprise clients see the events as an impediment to progress for the industry at large.  While he acknowledges events like the DAO collapse and the hard fork could create poor market optics, he said it hasn’t yet happened as a result of recent events with ethereum. Rather, Maguire said KPMG sees the issues as learning experiences, as well as indications that more attention needs to be given to the security of private blockchain projects.  Maguire told CoinDesk:  ""We see it as a step in the evolution of blockchain that reminds people of the kinds of security solutions that need to be built.""  Specifically, Maguire said this means developing better standards on how blockchain data is secured and accessed, including potentially applying more conventional or previously tested protocols for use in blockchain environments.  Maguire went on to stress that it perhaps remains too early to tell what specific issues were at play and how future projects implementing similar concepts can be improved.  However, Maguire said that the ethereum platform ""is not in question"", while stating that any client relationships have not been impacted by these events.  ""I see it as more of a hiccup. It’s one that I wish had not occurred, [but] we're not seeing it have impact in market confidence,"" he said.

42399159,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZeu,1469717408,Bitcoin Sale Ends With Knifepoint Robbery in Florida,"A Florida man was reportedly robbed at knifepoint during a sale of $28,000 in bitcoin this week.  According to the Sun Sentinel, a Palm Beach, Florida-based news service, Steve Manos, a 32-year-old Lake Worth resident, arranged to meet two individuals in West Palm Beach to exchange cash for the digital currency.  Manos is said to have told local authorities that he had met with the two previously for other bitcoin sales. Yet, on 26th July, one of the two sellers pulled out a knife after Manos provided them with $28,000 in cash (worth about 40 BTC at press time). In the ensuing struggle, one of the alleged robbers attempted to take a gun owned by Manos, and ultimately the two individuals fled with the money.  The Palm Beach Sheriff's Office went on to arrest 34-year-old Andre Allen after Manos provided the office with a phone number he had used to initiate contact for the sale. Manos later identified Allen in a police line-up.  Allen was booked and held on a $31,000 bond. Local arrest records indicate that he was released on 27th July.  The Palm Beach Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when reached.  Real-world attacks  The attack is the latest in a series of notable bitcoin-related robberies perpetrated in Florida.  In 2014, a bitcoin mine based in Tampa was robbed by a former employee. During that incident, roughly $35,000 in bitcoin at then-current prices was taken, along with more than $150,000 worth of mining equipment.  But, Florida isn't the only place where in-person bitcoin sales have resulted in crime. For example, last summer, a New York man was robbed of more than $1,000 in bitcoin at gunpoint during an attempted sale.

42399175,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZpj,1469711592,Why Florida's 'Bitcoin Isn't Money' Ruling Could Have Limited Impact,"Stephen D Palley is a lawyer in private practice in Washington, DC, focusing on construction, insurance and software development, including blockchain and smart contract design.  In this opinion piece, Palley argues that a recent court case in which bitcoin was deemed not be ""money"" has questionable precedential value despite claims to the contrary.  A Miami, Florida, trial court recently dismissed a criminal case against a defendant who had sold bitcoin to a police detective as part of an undercover investigation.  The case, Florida v Espinosa, has been already been cited by some potentially important precedent for future cases, particularly those where bitcoin's status as ""money"" or ""currency"" is at issue. Bitcoin industry advocates will also cite the case when arguing for legislative reform and greater regulatory clarity.  But, as legal precedent, Espinosa's value may be limited. It’s a single decision from a Florida state court trial judge regarding state specific statutes.  It's not an appeals court decision. It's not binding ""precedent"" in any other state or in Federal Court. Half of the opinion has to do with proving criminal intent, but little to do with bitcoin.  Finally, the Court’s analysis of whether bitcoin constitutes ""money"" or ""currency"" differs from approaches other courts have taken, and may (or may not) be adapted in other circumstances.  The analysis  Precedential or not, the case illustrates how courts apply well-established legal principles and procedures to new technologies. Consider how the court reached its conclusion.  It's a process familiar to anyone who has read a case or two. Find the facts, then apply the law, render judgment.  Count I of the criminal information charged the defendant as an unlicensed ""money transmitter"" because he'd sold bitcoin to an undercover detective for dollars.  The court dismissed these charges, holding that:  The statute didn't apply to a direct transaction without a ""middleman""  Bitcoin isn't a ""payment instrument""  The defendant wasn’t a ""money transmitter"" because he hadn’t charged a “fee"".  The first two prongs of the analysis involve fairly standard statutory analysis (""the law says this"", ""the alleged conduct is this"", ""therefore the law does/does not apply."")  The third prong is a bit more elaborate.  Citing case law, the court reasoned that to be a ""money transmitting business"", a fee must be charged. While the defendant made a profit (in bitcoin) on his sale, the court held that a cryptocurrency ""profit"" isn't a fee. According to the court, to qualify as a fee, a payment must be made in fiat money.  In support of this conclusion, the court observed that ""bitcoin has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money"".  This last point is not one that all courts have accepted, and it’s a somewhat surprising conclusion. (See SEC v. Shavers, in which the Court held bitcoin ""is a currency or form of money"" for purposes of determining whether or not security in under Federal Securities laws).  The charges  The court also dismissed two counts of money laundering, holding that the defendant didn't have the kind of criminal intent required by the applicable Florida statute.  An undercover detective told the defendant that the purchased bitcoin would be used for an illegal purpose. The court said that this wasn't enough to meet intent requirements under the Florida money laundering statute, which the court court also said was too vaguely written to apply under the facts of this case.  The court says that anything can be used for money-laundering, including bitcoin. It just happens that there wasn't enough evidence of the defendant’s criminal intent, and (according the court), the word ""promote"" in the statute wasn't clear enough.  Given slightly different circumstances (or a different judge) a different outcome isn’t hard to imagine.  Selling something for a profit with the express knowledge that a third party will use it to commit a crime (and the intent to help them commit it) could be problematic, depending on the facts and jurisdiction.  A defendant might risk being charged as ""accessory before the fact"", among other things. Other courts, in other circumstances, have rejected the notion that bitcoin's status as a virtual currency is so unique as to protect a criminal defendant from conviction.  Precedent unclear  In this respect, Espinosa is also consistent with the court's decision in the Silk Road case, in which the defendant didn't make out as well, but where the court says that bitcoin use in and of itself isn't a problem — it's ""how"" you use it. The same seems to be the case here.  It’s just that the court didn’t think that Mr Espinosa had done anything wrong. Will Espinosa prove to be important or persuasive authority in the future? It's too soon to say.  For now, it's a fine example of law's adaptability and the power that judges and lawyers have to shape it.
