The discount rate hit 47.8% at the time of writing, and GBTC shares haven't changed hands at a premium to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) since March 2021. GBTC shares cratered about 80% in the past year versus bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) 66% drop. The move comes as contagion effects from the recent failure of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) continue spreading, adding bearish sentiment to an already troubled market. “The fact that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is now trading at nearly 50% discount is just awful for holders of GBTC. It really highlights the vast differences in structure quality between different investment vehicles,” Bradley Duke, co-CEO at crypto ETP provider ETC Group, told Seeking Alpha via email. The lending business of crypto brokerage Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale Investment's parent company Digital Currency Group, halted redemptions and new loan applications shortly after FTX ( FTT-USD ) collapsed last month. Taking to Twitter on November 16, though, Grayscale reassured that ""Genesis Global Capital is not a counterparty or service provider for any Grayscale product,"" thus ""recent events have had no impact on product operations."" Earlier this week, hedge fund Fir Tree was said to be suing Grayscale to secure details regarding its flagship GBTC ( OTC:GBTC ) fund to determine whether mismanagement and conflicts of interest took effect. Fir Tree, which manages $3B, is seeking to use that information to drive Grayscale to resume redemptions and lower fees, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The popular coffee chain opened the Web3 extension to its Starbucks Rewards program to a ""small group of waitlist members,"" including employees and customers, allowing them to engage in interactive ""Journeys"" that earn ""Journey Stamps"" in the form of Polygon-based NFTs. In addition, users also get ""Odyssey Points"" that will open access to new benefits and experiences in the future, including virtual espresso martini-making classes, exclusive events and trips to Starbucks roasteries and coffee farms.  ""Starbucks Odyssey is an experience, surrounded by a digital community, where members can come together, interact, and share their love of coffee,"" the company said in a statement. ""Starbucks is using meaningful elements of Web3 technology to reward members in innovative ways.""  The company says it will send monthly invitations to others on the waitlist beginning in January. Members who were invited to the beta launch will also have access to the Starbucks Odyssey market powered by Nifty Gateway, where users can buy and sell their digital collectible Stamps. Odyssey participants can purchase Stamps directly with a credit card, without the need for a crypto wallet or using cryptocurrency, according to Starbucks.  Andy Sack, co-founder and co-CEO of Forum3, which helped to bring the Odyssey project to life, told CoinDesk the idea was sparked by a desire to ""delight the consumer with unique digital experiences."" Sack started Forum3 with former Starbucks Chief Digital Officer Adam Brotman, who led the creation of Starbucks' loyalty mobile app which boasts over 50 million registered users.  ""Adam and I had been sort of deep in NFTs and digital collectibles since early January of 2021,"" he said. ""We were contacted by [Starbucks interim CEO] Howard Schultz ... and so that set of relationships aligned."" Brotman is also close with Brady Brewer, Starbucks' chief marketing officer, who was key in making the idea a reality.  Sack refers to the new program as a ""next-generation loyalty platform"" aimed at building a brand relationship between customers and Starbucks. He told CoinDesk that other brands are starting to integrate blockchain technologies, making Web3 experiences more accessible to a mainstream audience.  ""Web2 brands are awakening to the opportunity for a clear use case of the blockchain. And it exists in the form of next-generation loyalty – we have a word for that, we call it experiential loyalty.""  ""Particularly, younger consumers are looking for ways to engage with their favorite brands get to be acknowledged and delighted digitally,"" he continued.

5314675,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511692,1670540408,Bitcoin Consolidation At $17K Could Be A Calm Before The Storm,"Bitcoin and crypto market twist has brought unexpected changes to almost all assets. Prices have been declining with little or no hope for a reversal. The FTX exchange fiasco intensified the performance as several losses have been recorded in the entire crypto space. Following the events, the price of Bitcoin dipped below its critical resistance level of $20K. Since then, the primary cryptocurrency has plummeted as the value slipped toward the $17K region. Related Reading: Data Suggests Ethereum Layer-2 Tokens May Experience Explosive Upside Over the past 24 hours, BTC could not make any significant positive movement. Hence, the token has resolved to consolidate around the $17K level. But many doubts are brewing if a storm could follow this new calmness in the future. Bitcoin Calms Around $17K Bitcoin has failed to trigger enough volatility that could push the price higher. The cryptocurrency has stalled around the $17K level during some trading hours. As of yesterday, BTC managed to hit up to $17,424. But the surge couldn’t last long as the bears suddenly took over. According to data from Binance, the primary crypto dropped to an intraday low of $16,867. However, the coin is gradually climbing upward. At the press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $16,835, indicating a drop. It boasts a market cap of about $326.81 billion, and its dominance over the altcoin is at 38.33%. Over the years, several interpretations for prolonged periods of reduced volatility have been given. One such is that it stands as a precursor toward a massive surge. Hence, the speculation on Bitcoin’s current consolidation could represent the calm before the storm. Altcoins In Red Zone The crypto market has experienced an overall drop as prices keep dropping. With the strong presence of the bears, the altcoins have painted the market red. This declining trend has cut down the overall market cap more. At the time of writing, the cumulative market cap sits at $853.33 billion. It shows a drop of about 1.39% over the past 24 hours. The performance of the altcoin has not been impressive. Most recorded a decline between 2% and 6% over the last day. The worse performers over the past day are BTSE Token and GMX. While the former dipped by 8.3%, the latter plummeted by over 7.2 % within 24 hours. Other losers include ETH with a 3.41% drop, DOGE dipped by 6.47%, XRP by 2,57%, BNB by 2.38%, MATIC by 3.17%, ADA by 3.11%, and others. However, the market saw just a few exceptions to the southward move. The best performers are Axie Infinity’s AXS and Synthetix Network’s SNX. While AXS surged by 4.4%, SNX recorded an increase of 5.4% in the last 24 hours.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  GBTC is a way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle. GBTC was trading at a discount rate of 47.3%, according to data from crypto index provider TradeBlock.  “The fact that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is now trading at nearly 50% discount is just awful for holders of GBTC. It really highlights the vast differences in structure quality between different investment vehicles,” Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a note to CoinDesk.  Bearish sentiment surrounding the trust deepened over the last few weeks as fears surfaced that crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), could file for bankruptcy. DCG is also CoinDesk's parent company.  Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Genesis Global Trading announced on Nov. 16 that it would halt customer withdrawals from its lending unit, Genesis Global Capital. Amid speculation about a possible filing, Genesis said in a note to clients on Wednesday that a resolution of the lending unit’s withdrawal freeze is likely to be a matter of “weeks” rather than days.  GBTC shares haven't traded at a premium to bitcoin since March 2021. Prior to that date, the trust benefited from strong institutional demand and traded at a double-digit premium to its net asset value.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading around $17,200, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours. BTC was hovering below the $17,000 mark earlier in the day but then jumped around 1:20 p.m. ET to trade as high as $17,293. Equity markets also turned green, with the S&P 500 index closing up 0.75%.  Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency in market value also turned green, recently jumping 3.8%. The rally came after Ethereum developers determined the network’s next hard fork, called “Shanghai,” will have a target release time frame of March 2023. This upgrade will include code known as EIP 4895 that will allow Beacon Chain staked ETH withdrawals. Ether fell 17% last month, breaching an ascending trendline connecting June and October lows.  Wave (WAVES): The native token of the Waves blockchain was trading down 8.8% to $2.10 after South Korea-based exchange Upbit warned its users against investing in WAVES. WAVES is a digital asset used as collateral for USDN, a stablecoin aiming to peg its value to 1 USD with an algorithm. Currently, the value of USDN is not properly linked to $1 dollar, according to Upbit.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: How Confident Are Institutional Investors About Bitcoin? COT Report May Offer Clues  By Glenn Williams Jr.  The three-month rolling, annualized basis for BTC remains below zero, reducing the incentive for traders to place market neutral carry trades.  When the basis is positive, traders are inclined to simultaneously buy bitcoin in spot markets and sell BTC in futures markets, pocketing the difference in yields. The same holds true for ether (ETH), whose three-month basis has been below zero since Nov 12. Bitcoin’s chart highlights recent price inelasticity. Since Dec. 1, prices have moved a total of .001%.  Ultimately, this market favors investors with long-time horizons and significant comfort in BTC’s valuation. Friday’s Commitment of Traders (COT) report will provide insight into the degree to which institutional comfort may be shifting.  Read the full technical take here.

The new staking effort is designed to help secure the quality of the project’s price feed for the cryptocurrency ether (ETH). Under the system, participants and node operators commit their holdings of Chainlink’s LINK tokens as a form of guarantee, in exchange for 4.75% annualized rewards.  The Chainlink team tweeted at 1:51 p.m. ET on Thursday that the staking community pool’s limit of 22.5 million total LINK tokens was “100% filled.” While community allotment has been filled, node operators are still able to stake their LINK tokens because the overall staking pool is capped at 25 million LINK. This leaves node operators with roughly 730,000 remaining LINK tokens to stake.  General access for the staking program opened earlier in the day, after an early-access period started Tuesday and had seen rapid uptake. At the current price, the staked tokens are worth about $170 million.  Staking is a key part of the project’s “Chainlink Economics 2.0” plan, described on its web site as “a new era of sustainable growth, cryptoeconomic security and deeper value capture.”  According to a Chainlink blog post, “Stakers will earn rewards for helping secure the Data Feed, specifically by participating in a decentralized altering system that flags if the Data Feed has not met certain performance requirements regarding uptime.”  The overwhelming interest in the new staking effort shows that some cryptocurrency investors and users are still eager to sock money into digital-asset projects, even with the nascent markets mired in crypto winter and bellwether bitcoin (BTC) down 64% year to date.  For its part, the LINK price is down 65% so far in 2022, including a 10% decline over the past week.  There are roughly 508 million LINK in circulation, so the staked LINK represents about 4.8% of the circulating supply.

Moreover, firms may be required to share information with their investors regarding their crypto holdings as well as their risk exposure to bankruptcies in the emerging space. They should also consider risks pertaining to a company's liquidity position, according to the guidance. The guidance comes after the once-mighty crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) filed for bankruptcy protection in November after traders rushed for the exit en masse upon discovery of its multi-billion dollar balance sheet shortfall, marking its demise as the industry's most high-profile downfall. FTX is facing a number of federal investigations, including by the SEC. That mess sent shockwaves through the crypto ecosystem and caused high-profile crypto lender BlockFi to file for Chapter 11 . “Recent bankruptcies and financial distress among crypto asset market participants have caused widespread disruption in those markets,” The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance wrote in a sample letter. “Companies may have disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws related to the direct or indirect impact that these events and collateral events have had or may have on their business.” The crypto market downturn has been highlighted by huge drawdowns in some of the largest digital tokens by market cap, including bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dropping some 70% from its November 2021 all-time high.

42413458,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9KsE,1670534773,SEC Tells US-Listed Companies They’d Better Disclose Crypto Damage,"Crypto’s pains are being shared by a wide array of companies. The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is warning public companies that if they have a stake in the industry’s recent torments, they’d better tell investors.  “Recent bankruptcies and financial distress among crypto asset market participants have caused widespread disruption in those markets,” the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance advised U.S. public companies on Thursday. “Companies may have disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws related to the direct or indirect impact that these events and collateral events have had or may have on their business.”  A sample letter to such companies is asking, for instance, if they face any risks to their businesses “due to excessive redemptions, withdrawals or a suspension of redemptions or withdrawals, of crypto assets.”  The Division of Corporation Finance is the SEC’s disclosures arm, advising securities-issuing companies about how to properly inform investors about meaningful threats to their businesses.  The wider SEC has been in a general standoff with much of the crypto industry, insisting that many of the digital assets platforms should be registered exchanges, while many of those firms argue that they’re either not involved with securities or the agency hasn’t properly defined crypto securities.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler reiterated his views again that the agency has made clear what crypto companies should do, telling a reporter on Wednesday that “the rules are there” and that “law firms know how to advise their clients to comply.”  Thursday’s document said the sample questions it would send out are not “exhaustive,” saying that companies should evaluate their own specific risks and concerns.  The crypto industry has faced a number of high-profile failures and bankruptcies over the past several months, with crypto exchange FTX and multiple lenders revealing that they owed thousands of people millions of dollars’ worth of crypto.  These companies’ ties to traditional financial institutions are also under scrutiny. On Wednesday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) wrote a letter to bank regulators, asking them to examine these ties and pointing to Moonstone Bank, a firm FTX invested in, as one example.

That still needs to be worked out, said Carole House, a former director of cybersecurity and secure digital innovation for the White House who co-authored President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto.  She told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday the March executive order took what she called a “balanced” approach to overseeing the crypto industry, but there are still “gaps” that need to be filled.  “White House staff was looking at what every stakeholder was saying, including a lot of people that we disagreed with, or agreed with,” she said.  However, “I think the executive order really pointed to the fact that … there's not a clear picture of exactly all of the different things that need to be put in place to fill some of the existing gaps. But there's also an acknowledgement of the already long-existing framework that covers so much of the activity in this space, and the fact that absence of sufficient compliance with those long-existing obligations still has to be sufficiently prioritized and enforced,” she said.  Read more: Coordinating the Federal Government's Approach to Crypto  House acknowledged the ongoing discussions in Congress on how to regulate crypto. However, where those areas of enforcement should be “expanded, strengthened and clarified” and by which agency have yet to be defined.  President Biden issued his executive order to ask federal agencies to coordinate how they deal with the digital asset industry. The first-of-its-kind order is focused on consumer protection, including financial inclusion and stability risks, as well as crypto’s illicit use cases, responsible innovation and maintaining a position of leadership in the global economy.  House, now an executive-in-residence at venture capital firm Terranet Ventures, said the executive order “was properly balanced” and it focused on mitigating risks while still adhering to the potential innovation behind blockchain technology.  The administration “has an opportunity to take a position,” according to House, with the ultimate goal of helping to influence legislation on which agency should be responsible for regulating the crypto spot market.  The result could spread beyond U.S. borders by setting standards for crypto, which could in turn prompt other countries to follow suit, according to House. “The United States is really the key country that’s bringing enforcement actions,” she said.

This On-Chain Condition Hasn’t Been Met Yet,"A Bitcoin on-chain metric still hasn’t formed the same condition as in the previous bottom, suggesting that the current low may not be in yet. Stablecoin Exchange Inflows (Top 10) Hasn’t Shown Any Spikes Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the top 10 stablecoin exchange inflows saw a rise during the July 2021 bottom. The “stablecoin exchange inflows (top 10)” is an indicator that measures the sum of the ten largest stablecoin transactions that are heading towards exchanges. The metric includes data of all types of stablecoins. Since the top ten transfers are usually from the whales, this indicator can tell us whether whales are active on exchanges or not. Usually, investors shift to stables when they want to escape the volatility associated with most other cryptos. Once these holders feel that the prices are right to re-enter these markets, they buy into other coins using their stablecoins, thus providing a buying pressure to them. When the value of the top 10 stablecoin exchange inflows is high, it means whales could be sending large amounts of stables to exchanges for buying other coins. Such a trend could therefore be bullish for the prices of cryptos like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Continued Upswing Of VIX Signals Doom For Bitcoin; But Friday Will Be Crucial Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this on-chain indicator over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been muted in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the stablecoin inflows (top 10) to spot and derivative exchanges have been displayed separately, since spot platforms are what investors use for converting their coins. It seems like when the Bitcoin bottom formed back in July 2021 during the mini-bear period of the time, the spot exchange version of the metric sharply rose up. This implies that whales participated in some heavy buying during that time with their stablecoin reserves, paving way for a bullish reversal in BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Show Rapid New Accumulation For First Time This Bear, Bottom Signal? In recent weeks, the top 10 stablecoin inflows to spot exchanges haven’t shown any significant movements, which means whales aren’t providing any significant buying pressure yet. If the past trend is anything to go by, this could be an indication that the current Bitcoin bottom still hasn’t formed. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16.8k, down 2% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 18% in value.

COT Report May Offer Clues,"Friday’s Commitment of Traders report will show whether recent increased longs are an aberration or sign of increasing confidence.  The most recent COT, which measures weekly trading trends among institutional investors, showed such organizations increasing their exposure to bitcoin last week, even as overall markets remained quiet.  The current report, reflecting data for the week ending Nov. 29, came as BTC was trading 1.4% higher than the prior week. Following three successive weeks of reduced BTC exposure on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, institutional investors reversed course, adding 147 new long positions. They currently account for 33% of all long open interest on the CME, and are 80% long as a collective.  The degree and direction to which these figures change, if at all, will be a key point in tomorrow’s release.  Correlation to macroeconomic factors  As digital asset prices once again appear highly correlated to macroeconomic factors, increased exposure tomorrow would signal that institutions are relatively confident about next week’s interest rate decision, and comfortable with current BTC entry points.  Recent macroeconomic data has not surprised markets. Thursday’s 230,000 initial jobless claims aligned with forecasts. Continuing jobless claims of 1.67 million were higher than expectations for 1.6 million. The irony in the data is that higher-than-average continuing claims are likely viewed more favorably, as markets wade through a “bad news is good news” climate.  Projections for a 50-basis point increase in the fed funds rate during next week’s meeting fell only slightly to 75%, from 78% following the data release.  Long-term investors appear to be taking advantage of BTC now trading at an opportunistic discount.  On-chain metrics reflect little conviction, whether bullish or bearish, specific to short-term price movement. At the moment, signs point to an asset with minimal momentum, trading at a compelling valuation.  Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, remains below zero, implying that BTC is undervalued. The metric has declined slightly since Dec 6.  Moreover, the three-month rolling, annualized basis for BTC remains below zero, reducing the incentive for traders to place market neutral carry trades.  When the basis is positive, traders are inclined to simultaneously buy bitcoin in spot markets and sell BTC in futures markets, pocketing the difference in yields. The same holds true for ether (ETH), whose three-month basis has been below zero since Nov 12.  Bitcoin’s chart highlights recent price inelasticity. Since Dec. 1, prices have moved a total of .001%.  Ultimately, this market favors investors with long-time horizons and significant comfort in BTC’s valuation.

42413464,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9Kv2,1670530392,US Lawmakers Want Environmental Agency to Study Crypto Mining's Energy Impact,"U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) introduced a bill Thursday that would, if passed, direct the Environmental Protection Agency to study the energy usage and environmental impact of crypto mining.  Cautioning that crypto mining threatened U.S. energy goals and local power grids, the lawmakers said the Crypto-Asset Environmental Transparency Act would direct the EPA to produce a report examining the effect miners using more than 5 megawatts of power have on greenhouse gas emissions.  In a statement, Markey said the mining firms were ""undermining decades of progress in our fight against climate change by putting profits over the promise of our clean energy future.""  ""Ensuring crypto mining companies report their greenhouse gas emissions is a necessary step toward holding them accountable and protecting communities across the country that rely on the grid to heat their homes, cook their food, and go about their daily lives,"" the statement read.  Markey also warned that utility companies may have to raise prices for other consumers, an issue that's led some communities to try and impose restrictions on mining firms in the past.  The bill itself refers to concerns about climate change and its growing ecological impacts, including droughts, wildfires and unusual weather events.  ""Crypto-asset mining operations ... are often designed to generally increase computing requirements over time, which can lead to increased energy consumption,"" the bill said. ""A crypto-asset network, Bitcoin, consumes more energy annually than countries such as Chile or Bangladesh consume.""  Noise and water pollution are two other concerns mentioned in the bill. Furthermore, the bill would impose the same energy recommendations on mining facilities already imposed on data centers.  The document recommends the EPA propose rules to cover the crypto mining industry to ensure it is bound by greenhouse gas emission reporting and other similar rules, and assess whether any mining facilities are operating without the requisite permits.  Merkley pointed to mining facilities being powered by fossil fuels in a statement, saying this practice ""has an environmental impact on climate chaos equivalent to putting 30 million gas-burning cars on the road! And a lot of that fossil electricity is generated at power plants that have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged and frontline communities, making bad environmental justice issues worse.""  His statement also mentioned mining machines being discarded after they burn out and the ""strain on fragile electric grids.""

EthereumPoW still commands a top 100 crypto market capitalization despite having virtually no DeFi footprint, and very little NFT activity. Based on network usage metrics, the token is incredibly overvalued, even at just $3.60 per coin. In mid-September Ethereum (ETH-USD) successfully moved from a Proof-of-Work consensus blockchain to a Proof-of-Stake consensus blockchain. It was one of the most important developments in the cryptocurrency market this year but has since been completely, and rightfully, overshadowed by the drama surrounding FTX ( FTT-USD ) and Alameda Research. ""The Merge"" from PoW to PoS was telegraphed for years but was still met with some level of contention from a small fraction of the Ethereum community. The biggest issue for Ethereum miners at the time was a move to PoS meant the block reward from running expensive GPU-based mining machines was going away. This directly impacted companies that were mining Ethereum for the block reward; notable examples include HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) and to a lesser degree Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ). There was enough backlash from foreign-based Ethereum miners to fork the Ethereum chain and create an entirely new blockchain called EthreumPOW (ETHW-USD). EthereumPoW remained a Proof-of-Work consensus blockchain, preserving the block reward for GPU miners. Roughly three months later, we can check in on ETHW and see how the network has progressed. Price and Token Specifics While still well below highs following the launch of the chain, the price of ETHW has experienced a rather large increase over the last few days; rallying from $3.09 on November 29th up to $4.25 on December 2nd. The rally was coupled with a fairly large 7x boost in real volume from roughly $2 million to over $15 million though daily volume has again fallen back to low 7 figures. After a brief pullback in coin price late last week, the coin again went above $4 intraday on Monday. Volume vs Price (Messari) As of writing, ETHW finds itself at $3.62 with a $391 million dollar market cap. This gives EthereumPoW the 79th ranked market capitalization in the entire cryptocurrency landscape. It's ranked ahead of some fairly well-known and widely used projects like Curve DAO ( CRV-USD ), Ethereum Name Service ( ENS-USD ), Optimism ( OP-USD ), STEPN ( GMT-USD ), and Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ). Price pops are common in crypto and don't necessarily mean an asset is a good hold. Does the fundamental activity on-chain for EthereumPoW justify a valuation like this? Probably not. DeFi TVL Collapsing Part of what makes smart contract chains so useful is how easily they enable blockchain-based ownership and decentralized finance transactions, or DeFi. It's important to note that after just 3 months from launch, it's certainly not fair to expect EthereumPoW to be on the level of a top 10 or even top 20 blockchain from a DeFi perspective. Still, the trend that I'm seeing for EthereumPoW's DeFi activity is not a good one. A key metric is TVL or total value locked. This allows us to see how much a chain is being used for DeFi purposes. ETHW is way down at #100 in the TVL rank list measured by USD. Rank Chain Protocols TVL MC/TVL Ratio 97 Kintsugi 1 $1,952,963 0.51 98 XDC 3 $1,856,266 157.08 99 Fuse 10 $1,790,808 7.47 100 EthereumPoW 15 $1,624,876 241.14 101 Callisto 1 $1,548,482 7.68 102 Tombchain 1 $1,481,520 5.33 103 Energi 1 $1,464,325 8.03 Source: DeFi Llama The good thing from this table is ETHW has more DeFi protocols, or applications, being built on the chain compared to peers with similar TVL figures. That said, the MC/TVL ratio is 241 - that is very high. Given the recent declines in the crypto coin prices, we have to adjust the TVL to native assets to really get the full scope for how a chain is performing. This is where ETHW actually gets pretty ugly: TVL in ETHW (DeFi Llama) After peaking at little over 1 million ETHW in TVL on November 10th, the ETHW locked in EthereumPoW DeFi protocols has collapsed about 60% in less than one month. This level of native asset decline is not what we're seeing on stronger chains or from chains that have similar TVL either. The other thing to consider when analyzing a public blockchain's DeFi footprint is how reliant a chain is on one or a handful of protocols. The more distributed the TVL is among protocols, the healthier the activity is. Additionally, the more multi-chain applications that have integrated with a blockchain, the more validity the network has in the eyes of the broader crypto community. Here again, we're seeing a pretty brutal picture for EthereumPoW: TVL Protocol Breakout (DeFi Llama) The top protocol on the network is Uniswap, not to be confused with Uniswap ( UNI-USD ). Not only is EthereumPoW dependent on just two applications for 76% of its DeFi activity, but there isn't any major DEX or pool that has integrated with EthereumPoW. Of the 15 protocols on ETHW, just one has integration with another chain that isn't EthereumPoW. This makes EthereumPoW DeFi a very closed, consolidated ecosystem. Other Applications It's important to remember that strong networks don't have to be completely dependent on DeFi activity to justify coin valuation. There are other ways to use smart contracts. EthereumPoW has an airtable page that lists a few dozen integrations with the network; many of them are DEXes but there are also some domain projects and independent block explorer apps. NFT ownership is another popular way to use a blockchain. There are a handful of NFT marketplaces on ETHW. One of them that I checked out wouldn't load any data. This is a screenshot from a more responsive one called Nuwton: ETHW NFT Volume (Nuwton) That marketplace shows pretty awful 30 day change metrics for the top 5 NFT projects on EthereumPoW. Most of them show sales volume declines somewhere between 80-90% over the last month. And those monthly change figures are coming down from what were already very low sales figures. Summary There are numerous risks associated with buying EthereumPoW. The blockchain network has very little actually being developed on the chain. There isn't much engagement with the few applications that have been built developed. Furthermore the broad trend in both the coin price and the DeFi footprint is incredibly negative. When you factor in that crypto in general is risky and is dealing with drawdown pressure, I don't see how it makes any sense to allocate to a fledgling blockchain network that is struggling. The EthereumPoW team hasn't tweeted anything yet in the month of December. It hasn't posted a Medium update since November 6th. The website has virtually no information whatsoever. The optics suggest this is not a network that is seriously trying to grow and my initial theory that EthereumPoW was never meant to be a long term project from the beginning is aging fairly well. If the network somehow survives crypto winter there will likely be plenty of opportunity to buy the coin cheaper than current prices. If you're holding this coin I'd probably consider selling it if you can.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4563302-ethereumpow-3-months-after-fork?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5309907.jpeg

42411296,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMlzc,1670529551,Most Underreported Trend in 2022: Crypto Is Embracing Mobile,"While 2022 will likely most be remembered as the year of “The Merge” as well as the fall from grace of industry stalwarts such as FTX, Three Arrows Capital and Terra, another less-appreciated but influential trend emerged in 2022: Crypto finally woke up to the importance of mobile.  Almost every investor and founder in crypto says their focus is onboarding the next billion users to crypto. Most estimates put the total number of crypto users at 300 million or so. Which means we need to get to the first billion before we can get to the next. We will never do this without really embracing mobile tech.  Estimates suggest that more than 90% of the world have mobile phones and 83% (i.e., 6.6 billion people) have smartphones. Meanwhile, less than half of the world’s population have computers in their homes.  Metaverse projects also emerged on the global stage this year as well as a seminal book on the field: “The Metaverse,” by Matthew Ball. Yet, despite all the buzz around virtual worlds, my bet is 10 years from now most of the world will not own VR goggles but will be leveraging mobile tech and still engaging in the real world, albeit increasingly enhanced with AR, more than virtual worlds with goggles on.  In 2022 the crypto industry made several collective strides towards improved user experience and even hardware to support mobile adoption of crypto. Solana made a real splash earlier this year when it announced the launch of a crypto-based, Android phone called Saga. To be honest, like many other crypto observers, my initial take was to dismiss it because Saga is only going to seamlessly support Solana wallets and the Solana ecosystem. However, it turns out Solana is open sourcing the platform in ways that will allow Ethereum and other layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains to provide support for apps on other blockchains. Polygon also recently announced its intention to collaborate with phone manufacturers to make it easier for Web3 users to transact on the phone. Meanwhile, Celo is a mobile-first layer one blockchain that emerged in 2022 with growing developer interest.  Not to be outdone, the Helium Network, which says it has more than 1 million decentralized hotspots for its internet of things (IoT) network, announced the launch of Helium Mobile in August. Helium Mobile is the first people-powered 5G mobile network. Recent reports, however, have cast doubt on the validity of Helium’s claims and the actual utility of Helium Mobile as the network functions mostly indoors due to an overreliance on indoor radio antennas for the network.  Then there is more on the application side. I fully agree with many who believe that gaming could be the path to onboarding the first full billion and helping accelerate the second billion, too. But, again, to reach the masses, games will need to be accessible and enjoyable on mobile devices.  This year witnessed the emergence and rapid growth of several Move2Earn games including GenoPets, SweatCoin and Stepn. While it is not easy to build a sustainable economic model with Move2Earn, the potential to leverage the hardware in smartphones to encourage people to game on the move and earn from doing so is quite cool.  The latest news suggests Apple sees the dollar signs on the non-fungible token craze and has now planned to apply its 30% extractive platform fees to NFT sales from native apps hosted in Apple’s app store. While some applauded the move as further evidence of the mainstreaming of crypto, as a founder of an NFT-based Move2Earn game I am horrified at the thought of Apple applying a 30% take rate off the top. This is a main reason so many of us embrace Web3 as a path to more inclusive community-owned projects where the value creators and contributors share more than the Web 2 gatekeepers. Furthermore, Apple is applying restrictions on NFT-based apps that leverage NFT for in-app utility. That is to say, Apple is happy to monetize 30% of digitally owned “JPEGs” but not NFTs with utility, which is counter to the direction most NFT projects are headed.  The year 2022 in crypto will likely be remembered most for the bear market exacerbated by several bad actors. However, from a building perspective it should also be the year that marked a turning point in the crypto industry’s commitment to user experience, user interface and hardware for mobile devices. If we are to onboard the next hundred million and billions more, mobile must be front and center.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | AR,Boyd Cohen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/08/crypto-embraced-mobile-in-2022-opinion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8046c55b496ef339c15f676136fa8178e89f21b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the Fed raises rates in an attempt to slow inflation, we could see additional macro pressure on Bitcoin from traditional markets. Investors need to factor in the potential for a further leg down when all liquid assets are under sell pressure from a crisis. The Question Is the bottom in? Is it safe to begin buying Bitcoin (BTC-USD) now? I see a lot of analyst speculation on whether the crypto ""Enron and Lehman Brothers"" moment is over with the Alameda / FTX (FTT-USD) debacle, or the string of failures and bankruptcies will continue. But even if the crypto contagion is contained and the market stabilizes, there is a larger looming threat from the traditional financial markets. If we see another financial crisis in the next year, all liquid assets -- including Bitcoin -- will quickly sell off, just like the pandemic panic event in March of 2020. First, is Bitcoin Going to Die? I've been a Bitcoin fan since 2013. It's a brilliant assemblage of breakthrough technology that enables secure payment transfers without the need for a middleman. From its origin as a white paper concept, and through many major price crashes and recoveries, Bitcoin has been a fascinating story. Fun fact: my first Bitcoin article to this publication was submitted in March of 2014, but was turned down because at that time it was a niche topic and there was no appreciable effect on any traditional stock. This was well before Grayscale launched their Bitcoin Trust product (GBTC) in 2015. We are seeing a lot of negative press with detractors once again making claims that Bitcoin will go to zero. This is nothing new. Mainstream media outlets have declared Bitcoin dead 466 times between 2009 to 2022, including 21 times in 2022 alone. On average this occurs about 36 times every year. The European Central Bank recently felt the need to write their own obituary of Bitcoin dismissing any price stabilization as a ""last gasp before the road to irrelevance"" and publishing the misinformation that it ""is rarely used for legal transactions."" Jake Chervinsky, General Counsel, Compound Labs, has responded to similar allegations made by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen: ""It's disappointing to hear Dr. Yellen repeat the mistaken view that crypto is mainly used for illicit activities. Her statement is demonstrably false... That said, it's important to remember that crypto is a relatively small issue compared to everything else the Treasury Department is responsible for, so she likely hasn't spent time deeply considering it yet."" Financial processing has always required a clearing house, a trusted third party centralized system to verify transaction validity. Banks clear checks, credit card companies authorize, clear, and settle transactions. But Bitcoin allows direct payment securely on a peer-to-peer basis, with no middleman required. For the first time in human history, this protocol enabled a method of decentralized, distributed trust. Central Banks like the ECB desire to maintain their status quo by gatekeeping technology and innovation. They believe they are the anointed elite to run financial systems, and nothing should exist outside their authorization and control. Bitcoin threatens this. This was detailed in my earlier article, The Financial Elite: Bitcoin Bad, CBDCs Good, Stablecoins Meh. But governments and Central Banks could make owning Bitcoin difficult by heavy handed regulation or by outright bans. However, when China banned mining last year, operators simply migrated to friendlier nations. Unless all governments simultaneously criminalize it, a very low probability event, it will certainly live on. The Current Crypto Environment In the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) there was no way to leverage any digital assets. Over time this changed until the industry was rife with CeFi lenders who were re-hypothecating customer deposits and making incredibly poor risk management decisions. One example of this is Voyager Digital (VYGVQ), who offered a $650 million unsecured loan to Three Arrows Capital, apparently with little or no due diligence into their operations. As it turns out, Three Arrows was upside down on investments including GBTC. In this way the crypto industry mimicked TradFi and produced its own version of the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. But instead of the housing bubble collapse as a catalyst, the crypto dry tinder was provided by the price decline of GBTC and fire started with the crash of the algorithmic stablecoin Terra ( UST-USD ) and its companion token ( LUNC-USD ). I wrote more on that in my article, USD Coin Stablecoin Interest Update: CeFi Implosion . Many crypto institutions were probably insolvent early in 2022 but continued to gamble in the misplaced hope they could recoup their losses. This led to the further questionable decision to park funds on the Anchor Protocol because it promised 19.5% yield for Terra stablecoin deposits. When UST and LUNA crashed in May, institutions not only lost the much needed interest payments but were left with massive holes in their balance sheets. Bottom line, the companies now filing for bankruptcy -- Three Arrows, Voyager, BlockFi, and Celsius (CEL-USD) -- are all culpable for a lack of risk assessment of counterparties like FTX and Alameda. This is not a problem with Bitcoin, it's a case of the worst aspects of the TradFi system infesting the marketplace. As Senator Pat Toomey has said, ""The code committed no crime"" (I can't give the reference as SA doesn't allow YouTube links, but check out his podcast with Bankless). BTC is not responsible for poor risk management and fraud. As painful as these wash outs have been, Bitcoin's value proposition has not been broken and the industry will ultimately be stronger going forward. How to Avoid Future Rug Pulls and Scams FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried was almost universally acclaimed as a genius. Zhu Su and Kyle Davies of Three Arrows Capital were considered the smartest people in any room. They all leveraged their reputations to avoid hard inquiries into their company's balance sheets. Alex Mashinsky often proclaimed customers' money was safer with Celsius than with traditional banks . In contrast, Vermont state officials have recently claimed that Celsius had been insolvent since early 2019 . Some industry pundits and analysts saw the suspicious actions of these players but unfortunately few said anything about it. Many podcasters and You Tubers were paid to promote Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi and FTX. Other prominent voices in the industry who secretly suspected the worst were intimidated into silence by the implied threat of being blackballed. This raises the question, where can we find honest commentary going forward? Who will alert us about the next set of scams? Here are the best sources for unvarnished questioning of the industry I've found. Cory Klippsten is the CEO of the Bitcoin centered firm Swan.com and was an unflinching critic of both LUNA and Celsius before they collapsed. Dirty Bubble Media is the alias of a researcher who foresaw the issues with both Celsius and FTX. Please note, he is extremely critical of all crypto, so be prepared to have your basic assumptions challenged. Stephen Findeisen, aka Coffeezilla , is a YouTuber who exposes crypto scams. Lately he's been very active investigating FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried. Finally, FatManTerra is a researcher primarily known for documenting events with Terra. He also calls out other bad actors in the space. Any other sources you have found valuable in separating the wheat from the chaff in crypto? Let me know in the comments. The Macro Economic Environment Although the crypto contagion is not contained and the fate of Genesis Global and Gemini is yet undetermined, there is another huge set of potential challenges. Make no mistake, Bitcoin is still very much tied to the macro economic conditions. If the market panics again as it did early in 2020, all liquid assets including Bitcoin could quickly sell off. Bitcoin crash in March 2020 (Coingecko) The next 12 months could be precarious due to the Federal Reserve jamming on the brakes by hiking interest rates for the sixth consecutive time this year. The Fed seems bound to continue this policy until inflation demonstrably slows down or something breaks. What market fragilities might be exposed? There are some troubling economic indicators beginning to surface. In the most recent quarter ending in September, total consumer credit card balances increased by 15%, the largest year over year increase measured in more than 20 years . New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel / Equifax As inflation drives up the cost of basic goods and services, more Americans are forced to use credit cards just for necessities. Worse yet, when interest rates go up, so do credit card rates. A retail store credit card recently notified me the APR was increasing to 29.99%! About 12% of consumers missed a credit card payment this year . Although 37% say they forgot to make a payment, others cited the following reasons for missing a payment: Had to pay for food or groceries (31%) Had to pay utility bills (29%) Had to prioritize other forms of debt (26%) Had to pay for an emergency (26%) Had to pay their rent or mortgage (25%) Did not have enough income to make the payment (24%) Total household debt has reached $16.51 trillion in Q3 2022 as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Center for Microeconomic Data All categories showed increases except student loan debt; probably due to the discharged debt from some loan forgiveness programs. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Center for Microeconomic Data Serious delinquencies ticked up across the board except for student loans, which are still on repayment pause. But what happens when households with already thinly stretched budgets must begin paying those loans again? U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis The personal savings rate, which looked great during the pandemic, has fallen off a cliff in the past year. Decreasing savings and increasing debt is a problematic combination. The housing market merits an article by itself but suffice to say the price bubble is beginning to burst. For the quarter ending in September, home prices declined at an 8.5% annual rate. New mortgage applications are also down 46% since this time last year. Case-Shiller, EPB Research Conclusion So what will break in the economy? Where is the hidden fragility? Black swan events are impossibly difficult to predict but in hindsight we can piece together what led to the Great Financial Crisis in 2007-08. The pattern is familiar, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions and the bursting of the United States housing bubble. The crypto industry was also absolutely guilty of excessive and horrendous risk-taking. That coupled with the GBTC premium decline and demise of the Terra LUNA ecosystem brought about the cascading institutional failures. The collapse of FTX and Alameda may cause even more bankruptcies. The problem with both crypto and TradFi is that risky investments and scams are often hidden during good times. As Warren Buffett famously said, ""Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."" We must challenge our assumptions and listen to those raising concerns. For me, Bitcoin is a long term blue chip crypto asset to hold. But over the next 12 months the prudent investor must be vigilant and prepared for a further leg down due to sell pressure from whatever traditional finance crisis is currently brewing behind the scenes. So have we seen the bottom for Bitcoin yet? In my opinion, there's good reason to believe we haven't.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4563295-bitcoin-lower-price-likely-damage-fed-rate-hikes?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5309278.jpeg

The coin also formed a head and shoulder pattern, often connected to a downtrend. In the shorter time frame, MATIC might act bullish before it again starts to drop its value. The $1.30 mark remains crucial for the coin, as the bulls have barely traded above that mark. Before the coin gets to the $1 mark, the technical outlook forecasts another drop for the coin. This fall could bring the MATIC price to $0.70. The coin traded at a 68% discount to its all-time high in 2021.

The altcoin has been struggling below $1, which has acted as a strong barrier for the altcoin. MATIC has established the $0.80 mark as the support line. The path to $1 will not be smooth for the MATIC price, as it has to encounter two other resistance levels of $0.92 and $0.97, respectively. Losing the $0.90 price level will bring the MATIC price down to $0.80 and then to $0.70 before recovering again. The amount of MATIC traded in the last session was green, which signified that buyers attempted to return to the market. Technical Analysis Buyer interest started to return in small proportions on the one-day chart. The Relative Strength Index remained slightly above the half-line, indicating demand for the altcoin. MATIC is still undervalued. Correspondingly, the MATIC price moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which meant that the buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. The market outlook for MATIC indicates that the coin will soon fall below the 20-SMA line, bringing sellers into power. A small rise in buyers has indicated an increase in capital outflow for MATIC. The Chaikin Money Flow was above the half-line, which meant that inflows exceeded outflows. Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates a reversal of momentum and trend. There was a bullish crossover, which was good news for buyers as that marked a buy signal for the altcoin. Only a move above $1 will stabilize buying strength over the long term.

Auditors randomly select assets and require cryptographic proof of ownership. Despite recent fears, Coinbase has been and continues to safely store Grayscale's digital assets. These fears are creating an opportunity through the Trust's discount to NAV. Legal pundits think the SEC is acting arbitrarily in disapproving spot Bitcoin ETFs while approving ""similarly situated"" Bitcoin futures ETFs. Fears of large sales by DCG of their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holdings may prove overblown as Genesis and DCG have other means of raising liquidity. Two new fears directly related to the FTX collapse are extending the discount to NAV of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). These fears have exacerbated basic price declines from the ongoing correction in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as well as declines related to the Trust's regulatory setback this past summer. But much maligned Cathie Wood is maintaining her conviction in the blockchain thesis and the Trust; Ark Invest has tactically added about 450,000 shares of the Trust to its holdings since the FTX bankruptcy filing. From my perspective Wood's timing on the GBTC adds is almost right. This is especially true for those with a longer-horizon allocation to digital assets and as an earmarked portion of core Bitcoin holdings. And the article below details three arguments of why the current discount to NAV represents an opportunity for those willing to forgo self-custody: Questions concerning the Trust's reserves are unwarranted and the extensive recent FUD from both crypto and mainstream media is overblow. Coinbase ( COIN ) Custody is a literal and figurative fortress. From a trust point of view, Coinbase has simply been vetted differently than FTX. The Trust's discount to NAV likely eventually reverses. There are a couple of mechanisms, but one reasonably probable and near-term solution relates to the Trust's litigation against the SEC concerning its proposed transition to an ETF. Legal pundits think the Court may find the SEC discriminated against the Grayscale transition to an ETF when compared to ""similarly situated"" Bitcoin futures ETFs. Both Grayscale and Genesis are subsidiaries of the Digital Currency Group. The lending arm of Genesis is facing a liquidity event and rumored bankruptcy. Genesis is also reportedly facing a securities investigation that is likely related to their lending activities. Uncertainty and bad news rein, but the direct blowback onto Grayscale and the Trust's pricing long-term may be somewhat overblow and limited for legal, technical and practical reasons. Data by YCharts Grayscale Bitcoin Trust: Trusting Coinbase Custody A November 18th blog and email from Grayscale set off a firestorm of criticism when the company stated they would not be publicly providing a proof-of-reserves for their funds. Due to security concerns, we do not make such on-chain wallet information and confirmation data publicly available through a cryptographic Proof-of-Reserve, or other advanced cryptographic accounting procedure. Safety, Security, and Transparency , grayscale.com, November 18, 2022 In the days following the collapse of FTX, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had argued industry participants should eventually publicly provide a Merkle tree-style proof-of-reserves and begun the process by providing wallet addresses, quantity and block heights for Binance's large-cap holdings. All assets underling Grayscale’s digital asset products are held by Coinbase Custody. Coinbase has already been using a more traditional means of proving assets, though they do use some cryptographic proofs as well. As a publicly listed , U.S. based company their financials are externally audited on a quarterly basis and an extensive annual statement is provided to the SEC. When external auditors come in to look at our cold storage reserves, they randomly sample addresses that we claim to own, and require us to move those funds to demonstrate ownership, going through our key signing ceremony. How crypto companies can provide proof of reserves , coinbase.com, November 8, 2022 Coinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong. Both the company and Armstrong have been scrutinized over a relatively long period. There is no record of credit losses from any financing activities or a record of exposure to customer or counterparty insolvencies. There is also no real fear the Grayscale assets could become entwined in a Coinbase bankruptcy. Consider the following: Coinbase is not going bankrupt. Beyond maintaining strict 1:1 customer holdings, at the end of Q3 the company itself had $5.6 billion in near cash assets and over $600 million in digital assets. Liabilities total just over $4 billion of which $3.4 billion is conservatively financed, longer-term debt. Lastly and importantly, it now appears highly likely Coinbase will operate within its $500 million EBITDA loss guardrail for this year. If Coinbase were to go bankrupt, the probable interpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code Article 8 would be that customer assets are not the property of Coinbase and not claimable by its creditors. Custody style assets may be further siloed from creditors by not being balance sheet listed, like platform user assets are under Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 from the SEC. Coinbase has been and is safely storing Grayscale's digital assets. Grayscale's Lawsuit Against The SEC Over the summer, the SEC disapproved of Grayscale's proposed conversion of their Bitcoin Trust to a spot backed Bitcoin ETF. Trading as an ETF would provide a mechanism for the product's price to align with the holdings value and remove the 43% discount to NAV. Grayscale has filed for review of the SEC decision at the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. If Grayscale wins the lawsuit, the SEC disapproval order would be vacated and the Trust likely would be allowed to convert to an ETF. Grayscale's main argument in the lawsuit is that the SEC is acting arbitrarily because their conversion proposal is being treated differently than ""similarly situated"" Bitcoin futures ETFs. In their opening brief, Grayscale's explains: When approving bitcoin futures ETPs, the Commission necessarily determined -as the Exchange Act requires- that the risk of fraud or manipulation in the spot bitcoin market (which bears directly on the price of bitcoin futures) was sufficiently low that bitcoin futures ETPs could be approved without creating unacceptable risks for investors. But that risk is exactly the same for spot bitcoin ETPs like the one proposed by the Trust. It was entirely arbitrary for the Commission to conclude that any such risk was no obstacle to approving bitcoin futures ETPs and then to reverse course and find the identical risk to be too great to allow approval of spot bitcoin ETPs. Grayscale v. SEC, Brief of Petitioner , 10/11/22, p. 24 Put differently and more succinctly, Grayscale has argued the following: If the Exchange's surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME is sufficient to detect and deter fraudulent or manipulative activity in spot bitcoin markets, then spot bitcoin ETPs and bitcoin futures ETPs are equally protected from such activity. Grayscale v. SEC, Brief of Petitioner , 10/11/22, p. 32 (link above) Grayscale's argument above has received meaningful support from neutral legal pundits. However, in prior filings the SEC has not directly, or at least in any length, addressed this ""discrimination"" idea. The Commission's first reply brief to the Court is now due December 9th. And it will be necessary for Trust investors to closely examine and weigh any new and more direct language from the SEC on this key and likely determinative topic. grayscale.com But in any case and no matter the outcome of the lawsuit at this level, for longer-term holders there are a couple of theoretical future scenarios that could drive a reversal in the discount, such as redemptions. And overtime there is natural tendency for a financial product to trade at the price of its underlying holdings. So the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is offering an interesting time arbitrage opportunity at its current 43% discount to holdings value. Grayscale: The Genesis Connection Digital Currency Group is a crypto sector venture capital company and the parent of both Grayscale and Genesis. Genesis is one of the largest OTC trading desks in the space and sizeable institutional lender; in 2021 the company handed over $170 billion in trade volume and had $130 billion in loan originations. On November 16th the lending arm of Genesis suspended redemptions and new loan originations. DCG CEO Barry Silbert explained the action in a letter to shareholders. The letter is via CNBC and can be found included here . ...market turmoil sparked unprecedented withdrawal requests. This is an issue of liquidity and duration mismatch in the Genesis loan book. Letter to DCG Shareholders, Barry Silbert, November 2022 (link above) In the days following the collapse of FTX there was a general move in the sector characterized by investors taking their crypto off trading platforms and removing them from yield programs; put differently, the FTX collapse led to this cycle's ""not your keys, not your crypto"" moment. Of note, Genesis is the lending partner of the Gemini exchange's Earn program. So retail investors whose digital assets were engaged in the Earn program at Gemini are not able to redeem their funds. So how is Grayscale implicated in all this? Though nuanced, Genesis is now a meaningful creditor of DCG. ....DCG has borrowed money from Genesis Global Capital in the same vein as hundreds of crypto investment firms. These loans were always structured on an arm’s length basis and priced at prevailing market interest rates. DCG currently has a liability to Genesis Global Capital of ~$575 million, which is due in May 2023. ... You may also recall there is a $1.1B promissory note that is due in June 2032. As we shared in our previous shareholder letter in August 2022, DCG stepped in and assumed certain liabilities from Genesis related to the Three Arrows Capital default. Letter to DCG Shareholders, Barry Silbert, November 2022 (link above) Note Three Arrows filed for bankruptcy in July as a result of the crypto sector sell-off spurred by the collapse of LUNA ( LUNC-USD ) in May. So while DCG technically owes Genesis, the parent assumed the troubled Three Arrows assets from the subsidiary and is now on the creditors' committee of the Three Arrows liquidation proceedings. DCG and its subsidiaries are themselves reportedly holding about a billion dollars of the Bitcoin Trust. So there is fear in the market that shares could be liquidated in order to accelerate repayments to Genesis and allow them to meet short-term obligations. The size of these sales would be substantial enough to both move the Bitcoin price and extend the Trust's discount. But I think it is unlikely DCG will be forced to sell their Trust holdings at a discount. DCG is a large, robust and longstanding member of the space. In addition to Genesis and Grayscale, other subsidiaries include the Foundry, which runs one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools, as well as CoinDesk, a top media company in the crypto sector. DCG is also invested in over 200 companies and funds, a breakdown can be found here . Interestingly, Gemini updated their Earn customers and explained how the situation may playout . Liquidity issues can be solved in a variety of ways including raising capital, raising debt, and/or restructuring existing debt. Raising capital could, for example, involve Genesis selling equity in exchange for cash. Restructuring debt could, for example, involve DCG agreeing to pay down its loans to Genesis sooner. All of these possibilities can take time. Gemini Earn Updates , gemini.com, 12/6/22 Fears of large sales by DCG of their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holdings may prove overblown as Genesis and DCG have other means of raising liquidity. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Rating The Trust's discount to NAV has grown since the SEC's July disaproval order for its conversion to an ETF. Contagion from the FTX collapse has further accelerated this divergence. But Grayscale's current lawsuit against the SEC is a first bite at the reversal apple. And fears sparked out of the FTX drama may prove overblow . First, Grayscale's digital assets are safe and secure with Coinbase Custody, despite not providing a public, Merkle tree-style proof. Second, Genesis and DCG may successfully raise capital or debt rather than sell their holdings in the Trust at a discount for short-term liquidity. I am moving my rating for the Trust from hold to buy based of the now 43% discount to NAV. This rating applies for those with a long-horizon allocation to Bitcoin and who choose not to self-custody.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4563283-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-rating-upgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5308421.jpeg

42411298,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMlt0,1670524220,Did Sam Bankman-Fried Finally Admit the Obvious?,"Despite the focus on FTX following its catastrophic collapse, it’s remarkable how little we know about how the crypto exchange and its in-house trading firm Alameda Research actually operated. New CEO John Jay Ray III has called Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire the “greatest failure of corporate controls” he’s seen.  Wednesday, Coffeezilla, a YouTuber with a rising star who has made a career of shining a light on sketchy projects in and out of crypto, pressed Bankman-Fried for information related to how different customer accounts were treated at the exchange. It turns out, there wasn’t much differentiation – at the very least during the final days the exchange was in business, Bankman-Fried admitted.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  ""At the time, we wanted to treat customers equally,” SBF said during a Twitter Spaces event. “That effectively meant that there was, you know, if you want to put it this way, like fungibility created” between the exchange’s spot and derivatives business lines. For Coffeezilla, this looks like a smoking gun that fraud was committed.  See also: FTX's Collapse Was a Crime, Not an Accident | Opinion  At the very least, this is a contradiction of what Bankman-Fried had said just minutes before when first asked about the exchange’s terms of service (ToS). “I do think we're treating them differently,” Bankman-Fried said, referring to customer assets used for “margin versus staking versus spot versus futures collateral.” All of those services come with different levels of risk, different promises made to customers and different responsibilities for the exchange.  According to FTX’s ToS, everyday users just looking to buy or store their cryptocurrencies on the centralized exchange could trust they were doing just that, buying and storing cryptographically unique digital assets. But now, thanks to skillful questioning by Coffeezilla, we know there were instead “omnibus” wallets and that spot and derivatives traders were essentially assuming the same level of risk.  We can also assume this was a longstanding practice at FTX. Bankman-Fried noted that during the “run on the exchange” (pardon the language), when people were attempting to get their assets off before withdrawals were shut down, FTX allowed “generalized withdrawals” from these omnibus wallets. But he also deflected, saying what, you wanted us to code up an entirely new process during a liquidity crisis?  Before now, Bankman-Fried had been asked multiple times about the exchange’s ToS and often managed to derail the conversation. He would often point to other sections of the document that stated clients using margin (taking out debt from FTX) could have their funds used by the exchange.  Or he would bring up a vestigial wire process in place before FTX had banking relationships. Apparently, according to SBF, customers had sent money to Alameda to fund accounts on FTX and somewhere along the lines this capital ended up in a rarely seen subaccount. This also had the benefit of inflating Alameda’s books, another dark corner of the empire.  Questions remain. We still don’t know when or how Alameda lost money, and how much of that could have been client funds. According to recent reporting, Alameda had an unclosable leveraged account on FTX. Almost by definition, if it was in the red and in debt and there was a wallet that commingled funds, Alameda was also partially funded by some FTX customers without their knowledge or consent.  There would be a “chargeable fraud case” if spot assets weren’t backed 1:1 as promised, or were used as collateral for loans or other purposes, Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, told CNBC. Bankman-Fried has said previously that “dollars” on the exchange and hedge fund were “generally fungible,” being used to reportedly fund personal loans to emloyees and make venture deals. Now, too, did he admit client funds were ""effectively"" interchange – at least in the final hours.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried's Self-Incrimination Tour | Opinion  SBF has said repeatedly throughout his media tour there were a series of small decisions along the lines that added up to a catastrophic failure. Indeed, it doesn’t look like there was just one moment where he and his inner circle went bad, or one moment that permanently kneecapped the trading operation.  Instead, Bankman-Fried appears to have been deceptive from the beginning (even choosing the name “Alameda Research” to throw off banks unwilling to work with crypto trading firms). FTX was an improperly organized firm at its founding. Customer assets were always precariously placed.

42413470,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9L2W,1670522400,US Watchdog Says Banks Shying Away From Stumbling Crypto Industry,"U.S. banks have been cooling in their crypto interest since this year’s twin failing of Terra (and its currency, LUNA) and FTX, said Michael Hsu, the acting chief of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  “Overall, I can say – and this is going to be obvious – is that there was more interest before Terra/LUNA and FTX than since Terra/LUNA and FTX,” said Hsu, whose banking agency released its ""Semiannual Risk Perspective"" report Thursday, in which cryptocurrency risks were given heightened prominence.  The report included a new section on digital assets as a “special topic in emerging risk,” and it pummeled the industry, saying its risk management practices “lack maturity.”  “Most crypto market participants appear unprepared for the stresses and surprises that have taken place this year, resulting in substantial losses for millions of consumers,” noted the report, which is issued twice a year to flag risks to banking in the U.S.  According to OCC guidance, national banks overseen by the agency – representing the vast bulk of significant U.S. lenders – aren’t allowed to dive into new crypto business without getting an OK from the agency that they’re doing it in a safe way. So far, most crypto activity at banks has centered on holding digital assets for customers, though some Wall Street firms have experimented with stablecoins and other uses for blockchain technology.  This year’s events – culminating recently with the implosion of one of the global crypto giants, FTX – “have revealed that the crypto industry risk management practices are weak, that stablecoins may not be stable, and that contagion risk within the crypto industry is high,” said Hsu, who has been steadily critical of the sector. Combining all of that, he said, “explains some of the banks’ postures towards crypto.”  U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tina Smith (DFL-Minn.) sent letters to banking regulators this week, asking Hsu, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Acting Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chair Martin Gruenberg for answers about banks’ involvement in crypto.  “While the banking system has so far been relatively unscathed by the latest crypto crash, FTX’s collapse shows that crypto may be more integrated into the banking system than regulators are aware,” the lawmakers argued in the letters.  In particular, the lawmakers asked Hsu how Alameda Research, a company founded by FTX creator Sam Bankman-Fried, could have invested in Moonstone Bank, a financial institution based in Washington state.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/08/us-watchdog-says-banks-shying-away-from-stumbling-crypto-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/adfca288914d8a36780fbb9a229f2486e5cfce90-3085x2314.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There’s been a record withdrawal of BTC from centralized exchanges to cold wallets. Thus, liquidity in the market has dried up, with the top 5 crypto exchanges facilitating $4B/day in volumes at month-end, down from $8B at the start of the month. Notably, DEX share of crypto volumes rose materially in the month. Still, even DeFi is struggling to match orders efficiently. Though, the fact that Ethereum did not make a new low in price in the face of the most negative news of the year (i.e., FTX) is somewhat bullish. November marked an incredibly tumultuous month for digital assets. Despite this, Ethereum did not make a new low in price, offering a possible glimmer of some positivity. It’s hard to believe that November was only the fourth-worst month of the year for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), measured by price return, but such is the sorry state of digital assets price action year-to-date. All major U.S. crypto lenders - Blockfi, Genesis, Voyager and Celsius ( CEL-USD ) - have now suspended withdrawals and are either in bankruptcy or negotiating privately with creditors. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners with Texas exposure, including Compute North, Genesis, Iris Energy ( IREN ), Argo Blockchain ( ARBK , ARBKF ), Applied Digital ( APLD ), and Core Scientific ( CORZ ), have all either defaulted on loans or have signaled risks as a ""going concern."" Publicly traded miners continue to sell more than 100% of the Bitcoin they mine, as they have since June, based on public filings. In Canada, Hydro-Quebec and the province of Manitoba moved closer towards enforcing Bitcoin mining moratoriums; NY governor Kathy Hochul also signed a two-year halt on fossil-fuel based proof of work mining. We also observe a record withdrawal of BTC from centralized exchanges to cold wallets. Thus, liquidity in the market has dried up, with the top 5 crypto exchanges facilitating $4B/day in volumes at month-end, down from $8B at the start of the month. Notably, DEX share of crypto volumes rose materially in the month. Still, even DeFi is struggling to match orders efficiently, as flagship lender Aave ( AAVE-USD ) faced a market manipulation attack that left the protocol with a small amount of bad debt and led to the halting of lending for 17 different Ethereum-based tokens on Aave. For November, the Nasdaq Composite rose 5%, Bitcoin -17%, Ethereum -18%, and the MVIS CryptoCompare, Smart Contract Leaders Index, -27%. On a hopeful note, the fact that Ethereum did not make a new low in price in the face of the most negative news of the year (i.e., FTX ( FTT-USD )) strikes us as somewhat bullish. Additionally, FTX’s leaked balance sheet pre-bankruptcy revealed that $2B of the “hole” was BTC-USD and ETH-USD purportedly owned by clients but loaned to Alameda and ultimately frittered away. Debtors will need to raise BTC-USD and ETH-USD to satisfy creditors before they consider selling these assets for cash. Crypto obituary writers this week, including the FT and the ECB, will be wrong for the simple reason that FTX’s bankruptcy may take a decade to resolve.

Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Smart Contract Platforms Ethereum outperformed other layer 1 smart contract platforms in November, led by strong user adoption of layer 2 protocols such as Abitrum, Optimism ( OP-USD ), and Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) on the Ethereum network. Arbitrum specifically captured 625k active users in November, up 100% in the last three months. Daily active users of those three L2s have grown by 69% over the last three months, compared to -5% for Cardano ( ADA-USD ), -6% for Ethereum, -22% for Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), and -48% for Solana ( SOL-USD ). Ethereum continues to monetize L2 activity successfully with its new post-merge economics, generating $87M in fee revenue this month amidst declining ETH supply. However, ETH’s share of smart contract platform network fees has been falling in recent months, from nearly 90% in mid-year to 75%, as the L2s pick up some share. Still, as of this month, Ethereum became the first profitable open-source blockchain, with gas fees paid to the Ethereum network outpacing costs (block reward issuance). We consider this a remarkable accomplishment for an open-source blockchain which will hopefully provide valuation support, should it continue.

Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Meanwhile, Solana has struggled with user growth following the collapse of FTX, with the native SOL token losing 58% in November and the number of developers touching Solana code declining by 44%, according to VanEck analysis of Santiment data. Still, Solana developer activity , measured by commits, pull requests, comments, and other actions, rose 30% in November. Developer participation almost certainly follows a Pareto principle common to many networks, so it’s possible that Solana just lost the tail. Thus, given that FTX/Alameda owned just 8% of fully diluted Solana, and considering Solana NFT volumes have been quite strong in recent months, we consider the sell-off to be an overreaction. On the other hand, we also note that Avalanche launched a Rust-based SDK (software development kit), opening a new door for Solana developers looking for a new home. DeFi DeFi volumes soared in November, reaching $100B, a 100% increase from October. On the other hand, total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has fallen 25%, with some chains faring much worse depending on proximity to the FTX debacle. Solana was hit the hardest by the fallout, with TVL on the chain decreasing 70% to $282 million. The Solana DeFi ecosystem was heavily intertwined with FTX, since the exchange had facilitated many of the funding rounds for Solana flagship DeFi projects such as Serum, which saw its TVL evaporate from over $100 million to under $1 million throughout the month. Additionally, FTX was supposed to be holding the assets backing Sollet tokens, which are tokenized versions of assets from foreign chains such as soBTC. When it became clear from leaked reports that FTX held no BTC, the Sollet assets de-pegged and are now worth a small fraction of the assets they were supposed to be pegged to. November TVL Top 10 Blockchains (Source VanEck, DefiLlama as of 11/30/2022) Past performance is indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. The drop in token price and liquidity has created an environment where large token holders can “liquidation hunt” in DeFi by deploying large amounts of capital in an attempt to liquidate on-chain lending positions. Avraham Eisenberg (Avi) is one of the key players in this arena who became infamous after he single-handedly exposed and profited from vulnerabilities in Solana-based derivatives platform, Mango Markets. Most recently, Avi launched a strategy on the Aave lending protocol to liquidate the founder of Curve ( CRV-USD ), who had a $48 million position that would be liquidated if the price of CRV-USD fell below $0.26. Over a week, Avi built up a $100 million position on Aave by lending an initial $40 million USDC-USD and using a popular DeFi method of leveraging known as looping, in which he borrowed CRV-USD, swapped it for USDC-USD, and deposited the USDC-USD to his original lending position, rinse and repeat. Combined with the tumultuous crypto market, the constant sell pressure from Avi drove the price of CRV-USD from $0.60 to $0.40. Since Avi was borrowing so much CRV-USD, the lending rate to deposit CRV-USD on Aave rose to over 300%. This created the opportunity for a relatively easy trade to keen market participants whereby they could lend CRV-USD on Aave and short CRV-USD on a perpetual futures exchange like KuCoin or Binance, effectively arbitraging the rates until the mayhem subsided. Once other actors in the market caught on to what was happening, they stepped in and bought the cheap CRV-USD and short-squeezed Avi’s position, sending the price of CRV-USD to almost $0.75 and liquidating Avi’s USDC-USD collateral. Due to the slippage incurred by the liquidation, Aave was left with $1.6 million of bad debt in their Curve lending market, which is easily manageable considering their $200 million safety module but highlights the risk that large liquidations in less liquid markets pose for the protocol. Hence, Aave governance has overwhelmingly voted to temporarily freeze 17 volatile Ethereum-based markets on the platform, including Curve ((CRV-USD)), Maker ( MKR-USD ), and yearn.finance ( YFI-USD ). Avi’s trades on Mango Markets and now Aave has sparked debate in the DeFi community as to whether these actions are considered an exploit of the protocol, or rather “highly profitable trading strategies,” the term Avi prefers when describing his methods in DeFi. Going forward, it wouldn’t surprise us if we see further stress tests on lending protocols as the cost to engage in “highly profitable trading strategies” on DeFi projects trends down with the market. Despite this high-profile hiccup, most ETH-based borrow/lend protocols and automated market makers (AMMs) continue to function normally. Overall, the DEX share of total crypto trading rose from 11% to 16% in November. Aave protocol, which dominates ETH-based lending protocols with nearly 90% market share, just saw daily active users hit an all-time high (of 11k per day), even with total loans down 80% from the peak to $1.6B. Metaverse Blockchain gaming activity fell by 9% in November based on the 25 games we track weekly. Despite the lackluster user activity in the month, blockchain games are still on pace to close $9B in VC funding this year, up from $4B in 2021, though Q3 game funding fell sharply from Q2. As an example, Game7, a BitDAO-backed gaming accelerator, announced $100 million in grants for open-source Web3 startups in November. Among metaverse platforms, Decentraland ( MANA-USD ) hosted their Metaverse Music Festival this month and saw a brief uptick in users on the platform to 14k. Still, we think the number of daily active users fails to justify the $MANA token’s $700 million market cap. On the Otherside of metaverse news, Ape DAO has finalized the release of staking for the APE-USD token. Starting December 7th, investors will be able to stake their APE-USD tokens on the platform created by Horizon Labs. By staking APE-USD and a BAYC/MAYC/BAKC, NFT holders will be able to earn bonus staking yields around 340-480% APY according to early estimates. The APE-USD token has since rallied 60% from its all-time low of $2.60 to its trading price today, around $4.18. Unless there are any major announcements for the Otherside , the token may face increased selling pressure in December and Q1 2023 from investors selling off staking rewards. Note that Ape staking will not be available to users in the United States, Canada, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Cuba, Russia, Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk.

Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear. Cryptocurrencies are not covered by either FDIC or SIPC insurance. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. Investors should conduct extensive research into the legitimacy of each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before investing. The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain or other underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been initiated. Investors must have the financial ability, sophistication and willingness to bear the risks of an investment and a potential total loss of their entire investment in cryptocurrency. An investment in cryptocurrency is not suitable or desirable for all investors. Cryptocurrency has limited operating history or performance.

5305942,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511706,1670520356,Bitcoin Price Prediction: What Elliott Wave Theory Suggests Is Next For BTC,"Any Bitcoin price prediction is just a guess without a basis to make the forecast. The stock-to-flow model that was once the most cited reason for expectations of higher prices has failed, leaving technical analysis, on-chain signals, and statistics as the best chance of finding future price targets. Elliott Wave Theory is a technical analysis forecasting methodology discovered in the 1930s, which is based on identifying extremes in investor psychology combined with distinctive price behavior. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being so susceptible to the ebb and flow of investor sentiment, here is what Elliott Wave Theory suggests about what is to come for Bitcoin price. A Brief History Of BTC Price Action The Bitcoin price index chart begins in late 2010, with the first-ever cryptocurrency trading at only pennies on the dollar. By the end of 2011, the price per BTC grew by more than 60,000%. Before the year came to a close, it has lost 94% of its value. From the low of approximately $2, another bullish impulse added yet another 60,000% ROI by the 2013 peak. Yet another steep corrective phase followed, cutting the cryptocurrency down by 86%. What followed was arguably the most talked about bull run since the dot com bubble, when in 2017 Bitcoin reached nearly $20,000 per coin. By now, we can see that extreme price swings and pivots in investors sentiment lead to boom and bust cycles across crypto. Bitcoin once again found a bottom at $3,000 in 2018, which will be the basis of the remainder of the analysis. The first wave ever and the history of Bitcoin price | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com An Introduction To Elliott Wave Theory First discovered by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s, Elliott Wave Theory is a basis for explaining how markets grow over time. The motive wave in EWT is an example of markets moving three steps forward, and two steps back. These steps alternate back and forth between growth and corrective phases. Motive waves consist of five waves in total – with odd numbered waves moving in the direction of the primary trend, and even numbered waves moving against it. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $1,000: Looking Back At Nine Years Of Bull Run Although corrective phases do result in a drastic decline in value, incremental growth always remains in the primary trend direction. Waves, both impulsive and corrective both appear in varying degrees and timescales. For example, a five-wave impulse on the daily timeframe could only be a tiny portion of a multi-century Grand Supercycle. Figuring out where Bitcoin is along in its various wave cycles and degrees can help to predict future price action. Bitcoin price prediction scenarios based on possible wave counts | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Reviewing The Current Market Cycle, According To EWT Each wave in an impulse has unique characteristics which can help an analysis decipher where an asset is in an overall motive wave. Following the 2018 bear market bottom, crypto had a clean slate to move up from. In 2019, Bitcoin rallied to $13,800, showing the market there was still life in the speculative asset. Nearly the entire rally retraced, which is a common characteristic of a wave 2 correction. Corrections tend to alternate between sharp and flat-style corrections. Sharp corrections are represented by zig-zags. Wave 2 behaved like a zig-zag and there is no denying that the March 2020 Black Thursday collapse was a sharp correction. Wave 3 in Elliott Wave is typically the longest and strongest wave, marked by much wider participation than wave 1. The crowd begins piling at this point. Bitcoin gained national media attention as it reached new all-times during this wave. From there, things get more confusing. Elliott Wave practitioners are divided among if BTCUSD completed its wave 4 and wave 5 phases already, or if wave 4 is still in progress and wave 5 is yet to come. Using these two scenarios, some targets can be considered. Things could get extremely bearish for Bitcoin if the cycle has ended | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The Bearish And Bullish Scenarios And Targets In the bearish scenario, a truncated wave 5 ended the Bitcoin bull run and sent the crypto market into its first true bear phase, with wave 5 of V finished and done, ending the primary cycle (pictured above). Completed bull markets often retrace back into wave 3/4 territory when the motive wave is completed. Bearish price targets put the negative Bitcoin price prediction from anywhere between $9,000 to as low as $2,000 in a complete collapse of the market. A larger catastrophe in the stock market and housing could ultimately do the trick by pulling whatever capital that’s left out of crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fundamental Expert Breaks Down Why The Bottom Is In The bullish scenario is much more positive, and better fits with what Elliott Wave Theory calls “the right look” and proper counting. In the bullish scenario, Bitcoin is in the final stages of an expanded flat correction, and once the sentiment and price extremes are finished, the top cryptocurrency will be fast off to setting another bullish price extreme and sentiment switch, much faster than anyone is prepared for. BTC appears to be in the final stages of an expanded flat wave 4 correction | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Using EWT To Make A Bitcoin Price Prediction The magic behind Elliott Wave Theory and why it influences growth in financial markets is due to its relationships with Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci numbers are based on the Fibonacci sequence, which is related to the golden ratio. The Fibonacci sequence reads 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. In Elliott Wave Theory, there are 21 corrective patterns ranging from simple to complex. A motive wave is 5 waves up, while corrective waves are 3 waves down, creating a total of 8 when added them up. A full realized impulse wave with all sub-waves is 21 waves up, while corrective phases are up to 13 waves down. Every Fibonacci number from the sequence is included in some capacity. Corrections also stop at Fibonacci retracement levels, and impulses reach Fibonacci extensions as price targets. Wave 5 is usually equal to wave 1 or wave 3 in terms of magnitude. If wave 5 is extended, and it often is in crypto, wave 5’s target could fall somewhere between 1.618 of wave 3, or 1.618 of the sum of wave 1 and wave 3. Bitcoin price reached the 3.618 extension from the bear market bottom, making it possible that the top cryptocurrency overshoots once again. On the lowest end, a 1.618 price target would put the peak of BTC for this cycle somewhere close to $96,000 per coin, while another 3.618 extension could take the top cryptocurrency all the way to $194,000 per BTC. This makes the Bitcoin price prediction using EWT anywhere between $100K to $200K before the cycle is over.

As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $16,800. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap display similar price action, with very few recording profits on these timeframes. Bitcoin Whales Jump Ship, What This Means For BTC Bitcoin has been moving in tandem with legacy financial markets since the end of 2021. The cryptocurrency is responding as a risk-on asset to the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy. The financial institution is hiking interest rates to slow down inflation. As NewsBTC reported, the sentiment in the legacy financial market was bullish and robust, and it supported a 12% BTC rally. The sentiment in this sector was strong enough to drive the BTC price upwards in a hostile environment. The second largest crypto exchange in the world, FTX, collapsed. This event triggered a new capitulation event in the crypto market, pushing BTC to fresh lows. However, equities trending to the upside reverted the losses on the nascent asset class. The bullish momentum is fading as the FTX debacle impacted crypto investors’ confidence in the nascent asset class. Analyst Ali Martinez shared recent data about Bitcoin whales. These investors are selling into the current BTC price action. Martinez said: Bitcoin around 33 whales holding 1,000 to 100,000 $BTC have left the network, and these whales sold or redistributed around 20,000 $BTC in the last 96 hours. The selling increased due to strong economic growth in the United States. The Fed has more room to continue with its tightening policy if the economy is resilient. Additional data from analytics firm Jarvis Labs indicates that $16,550 and $19,150 are critical. As uncertainty endures, leverage players take positions to benefit from a potential breakout. These positions add liquidity below and above the Bitcoin price. The chart below shows that these levels hold the most extensive liquidity pools.

Chris Akhavan, the first person to serve in this role at the marketplace, was previously chief business officer at blockchain gaming company Forte. He told CoinDesk that he will work to build out Magic Eden’s efforts to tap into the gaming industry, supporting game developers building with Magic Eden’s infrastructure.  Last month, Magic Eden introduced support for Polygon, a layer 2 network that is attracting a number of Web3 game developers. The effort to attract Polygon communities included a launchpad and marketplace on the platform to support developers in incorporating NFTs into their games.  “I’m super bullish on finding ways to connect into the massive universe of existing Web2 (or traditional) games and offering them smooth on-ramps to gradually introduce Web3 asset ownership into their existing game economies,” said Akhavan.  Prior to joining Magic Eden, Akhavan served as chief revenue officer of mobile game company Glu Mobile, which was acquired by gaming giant Electronic Arts for $2.4 billion. He will also continue to advise the $500 million Web3 gaming fund and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) Game7.  Beyond onboarding executives to spearhead Web3 gaming strategies, the inflow of capital into blockchain-based game companies has been on the rise in 2022, despite crypto winter.

GBTC is a way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle. GBTC was trading at a discount rate of 47.3%, according to data from crypto index provider TradeBlock.  “The fact that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is now trading at nearly 50% discount is just awful for holders of GBTC. It really highlights the vast differences in structure quality between different investment vehicles,” Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a note to CoinDesk.  Bearish sentiment surrounding the trust deepened over the last few weeks as fears surfaced that crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), could file for bankruptcy. DCG is also CoinDesk's parent company.  Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Genesis Global Trading announced on Nov. 16 that it would halt customer withdrawals from its lending unit, Genesis Global Capital. Amid speculation about a possible filing, Genesis said in a note to clients on Wednesday that a resolution of the lending unit’s withdrawal freeze is likely to be a matter of “weeks” rather than days.  One line of speculation on Twitter was that a cascade of liquidity issues at DCG subsidiaries might ultimately lead to the liquidation of GBTC, which could lead to a massive amount of dumping of bitcoin on the open market.  There were even some complaints that Grayscale hadn'r transparently proven its GBTC fund reserves.  GBTC shares haven't traded at a premium to bitcoin since March 2021. Prior to that date, the trust benefited from strong institutional demand and traded at a double-digit premium to its net asset value.

42413474,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9L4O,1670518126,Some Central Banks Reportedly Looking to Issue a CBDC Within 10 Years,"Crypto is in the depths of a winter recently spurred by bankruptcy filings from some of the most prominent companies, including exchange FTX and crypto lender Celsius Network but these market conditions have only convinced countries to develop central bank digital currencies (CBDC), and no later than within 10 years, according to a Thursday report by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF).  A CBDC is a digital currency issued by a central bank. Two-thirds of the central banks OMFIF surveyed said they would issue a CBDC within 10 years and none said they would issue one later than that, according to OMFIF's annual report, ""Future of Payments"".  OMFIF is an independent think tank that focuses on global policy and investment issues involving central banking, economic policy and public investment, according to its website.  According to the report, generally 35% of central banks were more inclined to issue a CBDC despite recent events in crypto, while none were less inclined to issue one, the survey of 18 central banks found.  Central banks have been ramping up their efforts to look into CBDCs. The Atlantic Council said that 105 countries are exploring a CBDC, representing 95% of the global gross domestic product, up from 35 countries in May 2020. The Bahamas, Nigeria, Eastern Caribbean and Jamaica have already issued a CBDC, the report said, while China is further along than most other nations in its CBDC trials.  “Overall, if central banks decide to issue a CBDC, they expect deployment to come sooner rather than later,"" the report said.  The main reasons that central banks gave in the report for wanting to issue a CBDC were that they wanted to preserve the central banks role and boost financial inclusion. However, many central banks have suggested that the crash of FTX only showed the need for a CBDC as a safe alternative solution. Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe echoed those very words recently and suggested the U.K. may need to issue a CBDC.  Also, Fabio Panetta, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said on Monday that a digital euro could be a more ""risk free and dependable"" digital settlement asset than crypto.  Read more: ECB Official Says Energy-Intensive Crypto Should Be Banned  However, CBDCs are not without their risks and challenges. They could expose economies to ""greater systematic financial risk brought on by volatility and sudden foreign exchange fluctuations,"" the report said. Plus, central banks will have to workout how they can use a CBDC to ensure inclusion if not everyone has access to digital technology, the report said.

Sabirov was arrested in the United Arab Emirates. Russia’s general prosecutor’s office has already requested his extradition to face criminal charges for fraud, according to the report. He had been on the wanted list since Nov. 12, and was apprehended Nov. 30. Earlier in the month, co-founder Zygmunt Zygmuntovich was also arrested in the UAE, and Russia is pursuing his extradition as well, according to RIA Novosti.  Finiko was popular in Russia in 2020-2021, marketing itself as a crypto investment fund. The company, which had been conducting public events and openly advertising itself, operated as a multilevel marketing scheme, offering rewards for bringing in new users and targeting mostly women from 30 to 50 years old, according to the Russian investigative outlet The Bell. It could have gotten away with as much as $95 million of investors’ money, The Bell said.  In summer 2021, Finiko froze bitcoin withdrawals on its website, allowing users to withdraw only the fund's native token, FNK, which immediately plunged in price by 97%. According to Crystal Blockchain, at the time of the crash Finiko’s crypto wallets contained 1.8 million USDC, 111.3 million USDT and 888 ETH, as well as 110 million FNK tokens.  Sabirov's arrest leaves just one of Finiko's known leaders at large, Marat Sabirov, who is not related to Edvard.

42413467,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9Kym,1670516464,Crypto Hedge Fund BKCoin Fired Co-Founder Kang Over Misappropriated Investor Funds,"Crypto hedge fund BKCoin fired co-founder Kevin Kang in October for allegedly misappropriating $12 million in assets from three multi-strategy funds, according to filings with U.S. Circuit Court in Florida. The documents, in the 11th circuit court covering Miami-Dade County, date back to Oct. 28 but have largely gone unnoticed.  Miami-based BKCoin was founded in 2018 by Carlos Betancourt and Kang, and claimed $150 million in assets, according to a Business Insider profile in June. The firm oversees at least five funds – including three multi-strategy funds – and multiple separately managed accounts. The multi-strategy funds at the heart of the court case have six U.S. and foreign businesses as its investors, which have collectively invested over $18 million they now hope to recover, according to the court documents.  Founder battle  On Oct. 28, the firm’s core legal entity, BKCoin Management LLC, filed a complaint with the circuit court that alleged Kang had improperly diverted and/or commingled $12 million in cash and other assets out of the multi-strategy funds. BKCoin had terminated Kang’s employment on Oct. 14 but wasn’t sure if he still had access to the accounts.  BKCoin filed an emergency petition for a receiver, a court-appointed neutral party who is given custody of disputed assets. BKCoin claimed it lacked the financial or staff resources to manage the funds itself. Michael I. Goldberg, a lawyer from the firm Ackerman LLP, was quickly appointed as a temporary receiver tasked with overseeing and winding up the funds.  Goldberg’s preliminary look at the assets showed that capital deposited in the multi-strategy funds on behalf of investors was immediately transferred into the accounts of three affiliated legal entities and combined with their assets. Those entities – BKCoin Management LLC, BKCoin Capital LP and BK Offshore Fund Ltd – were all at some point under Kang’s control. The court expanded Goldberg’s purview to cover those entities and later confirmed his power to transfer any crypto assets to a depository account and/or to liquidate (or convert cryptocurrency into U.S. dollars), if needed to preserve value.  Goldberg has to submit a report to the court on or before Jan. 4 that outlines the steps taken, the amounts of all assets and liabilities of the funds and affiliated entities and whether he thinks the funds could continue to operate in a legal and profitable fashion. An initial case management conference will be held on Jan. 27.  BKCoin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Joseph DePaolo, SBNY's CEO, said Wednesday that the lender would limit its digital currency deposit exposure to less than 15% of total deposits from 23.5%, according to the note. SBNY's Signet, a regulated blockchain-based digital payments platform launched in January 2019, was said to have been viewed as a primary alternative to the Silvergate Exchange Network for crypto-related firms looking to transfer fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar or euro, to other platforms.

The decision follows the strategy’s strong performance this year, the firm said. In June, the strategy returned about 560% while the overall fund added 4%. Ether (ETH) fell 44% and bitcoin (BTC) dropped 37% in the same period.  “Many current and prospective investors in our multi-strategy fund were interested in learning about our tail risk strategy and if we could provide them with access to the strategy through a standalone vehicle,” said Christoper Kvamme, founder and CEO of Presidio Trading.  A tail risk is the chance of an investment loss due to the occurrence of a rare event. Tail risk investment strategies look to reduce overall portfolio risk by outperforming during an unexpected downturn, but do so at the cost of lower returns in a bull market.  “It's not just other funds and investors who can benefit from protection against nonlinear drops in cryptocurrency markets. I think this new fund will be valuable to the entire crypto ecosystem; exchanges, payment processors, project endowments, and really anyone with significant exposure to crypto,” Kvamme said.  The new fund will make some slight changes to the existing tail risk strategy. While the strategy can post positive returns when markets decline, its current design returns losses when digital assets are performing well. The strategy will be tweaked to provide broader protection, most likely by covering a cryptocurrency index, the firm said.  The Dallas, Texas-based firm said it is planning to open the fund to accredited investors in the first quarter of 2023, with a limited capacity of $10 million to start.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/08/hedge-fund-presidio-trading-to-spin-out-crypto-market-tail-risk-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cc79a3fd77f12a1090a2af51d5faba7b21f7e13-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413471,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9L1a,1670513990,Ethereum Developers Target March 2023 for Release of Staked Ether,"Ethereum developers determined on Thursday that the network’s next hard fork, called “Shanghai,” will have a target release time frame of March 2023. This upgrade will include code known as EIP 4895 that will allow Beacon Chain staked ether (ETH) withdrawals.  Developers also agreed to address the implementation of the ""EVM Object Format"" (EOF) in Shanghai, which is a collection of EIPs that essentially upgrade the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the environment where Ethereum is able to execute smart contracts. Those Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are EIP 3540, EIP 3670, EIP 4200, EIP 4570, EIP 5450.  If EOF seems too complicated to implement by the next All Core Developers call planned for Jan. 5, developers agreed they will push back EOF to the fall, so they don’t delay staked ETH withdrawals.  Developers also agreed to a second hard fork sometime in the fall of 2023 that would address another significant scaling upgrade – proto-danksharding, also known as EIP 4844. EIP 4844 would make Ethereum more scalable through sharding, a method that splits up the network into “shards” as a way to increase its capacity and bring down gas fees.  The two forks will give developers enough time to focus on each issue and alleviate stress for those who have their ETH (and any accrued rewards) locked in the Beacon Chain staking smart contract.  Read more: Anxious Ethereum Stakers Question When They’ll Be Able to Access Funds  What happens next?  Now that the full scope of what will be included in Shanghai is mostly settled, Ethereum developers will go ahead and work on testing the code.

In November, Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit said that the token would be delisted from their exchanges, prompting $287 million in market cap to evaporate as the token plunged from to 46 cents from $1.55.  The exchanges, which form the Digital Asset eXchange Association, said that wemix was being delisted because of inaccuracies in circulating supply figures, the report said.  Wemade filed for an injunction against the exchanges, stating that their decisions was based on vague reasoning and damaged investors.  The court, however, dismissed the request on Wednesday.  South Korea has emerged as a hub for metaverse technology this year, with the government announcing that it will invest $200 million across the industry.

42393930,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brcRjt,1670512455,The 4 Most Influential Moments in Consensus History,"Since 2015, Consensus has brought together the crypto community to reflect on the state of the industry and align on the year ahead. In an industry that is largely carried out online, the annual Consensus gathering has come to serve as a barometer for the industry year after year.  From the early days of bitcoin, when the price was in the triple digits, to the tail end of the most recent bull market and everything in between, Consensus has served as a place for calibration, collaboration and resolution amidst some of crypto and Web3’s biggest moments.  As we prepare for the next Consensus gathering, taking place in Austin, Texas, on April 26-28, 2023, let’s take a look at some of the most influential moments in Consensus history.  1. Consensus 2015: The very first Consensus  The year was 2015. The price of bitcoin was around $220, down more than $500 from its high in 2014. CoinDesk, the nascent crypto media company in its first year of operation, chose to host its first-ever gathering for the crypto and blockchain community in New York City as a way to stay afloat amid what some have considered to be the first crypto winter.  The inaugural Consensus welcomed 500 guests, 12 sponsors and a handful of speakers including a young crypto-anarchist by the name of Vitalik Buterin, Cornell professor-turned-Avalanche CEO and co-founder Emin Gün Sirer (who is slated to speak at Consensus 2023) and a handful of law enforcement agents who later became executives at some of the most well-known companies in the industry.  2. Lambos outside of Consensus 2018  Consensus has been there for all of crypto’s biggest moments – including the awkward ones. If you ask anyone who was at Consensus 2018 to tell you their most memorable Consensus moments, they will most likely mention the Lamborghinis parked outside of the event location.  Back in 2018, Lambos were a symbol of bullishness in the crypto community. The phrase “When Lambo?” was jokingly used to refer to when holders would become rich enough to purchase a Lamborghini. BitMEX took this joke to the next level when it rented three Lamborghinis and had them rev their engines just outside the Consensus doors.  While CoinDesk wasn’t involved with coordinating this stunt, it did take place outside of our event and is a reflection of the industry as a whole at that time. The 2018 gathering took place just a few months after the peak of the 2017 bull market, which made crypto’s earliest investors very rich and attracted many new entrants into the ecosystem who hoped to experience those same gains. It was a time of flashiness, hype and desperation to stave off the inevitable bear market that ended up taking place from 2018 until 2020.  3. The bitcoin halving happening mid-panel during Consensus 2020  When COVID-19 brought life to a screeching halt in March 2020, the CoinDesk team made the quick decision to take Consensus online and make it free of charge with Consensus: Distributed, which took place from May 11-13, 2020. More than 22,000 viewers from around the world tuned into Consensus programming, including live coverage of one of the most highly anticipated events in Bitcoin history: the halving.  On May 11, the first day of Consensus: Distributed, miners produced the 630,000th block in the Bitcoin blockchain, triggering the programmed halving event that took the number of BTC entering circulation every 10 minutes from 12.5 to 6.25.  Many attribute bitcoin’s meteoric success in the second half of 2020 to the halving event. Based on the economic principles of supply and demand, if the supply of bitcoin entering the market shrinks by half and demand stays the same, the price is sure to increase. And that it did – bitcoin skyrocketed from $7,225 on May 11 to $28,000 by the end of the year. Consensus viewers got a front row seat to the very start of bitcoin's biggest bull market yet.  4. Consensus 2022: The biggest year yet  Like the crypto industry, Consensus has grown a lot since 2015 – from the number of attendees, sponsors and speakers to the breadth of topics covered.  Consensus 2022 was a testament to this growth. It was our first in-person event since 2019. More than 20,000 members of the crypto community from over 100 countries took to the streets of downtown Austin, Texas, to immerse themselves in all things crypto, blockchain, Web3 and the metaverse.  Consensus 2022 was more than just a crypto gathering – it was a full-on festival at the tail end of the most important bull market in crypto history, which lasted from 2020 to 2022. The days were filled with sessions featuring more than 600 speakers and the expo hall had hundreds of exhibitors. In the evenings, there were parties, exclusive viewings and live music performances.  Looking ahead to Consensus 2023  Since the very beginning, the purpose of Consensus has been bringing the many important but disparate voices in crypto and blockchain together face to face to forge the future of the industry.This year that purpose is more important than ever.  In the months since our last Consensus gathering, the industry has experienced some serious blows, with the collapse of major companies within the crypto ecosystem. As the aftermath of these events continues to unfold, we find ourselves at one of the most critical moments in crypto history.  It is up to the community to come together to take stock of all that has happened this year, talk through the most difficult challenges and figure out what is needed to make this industry stronger and safer for all.  Since 2015, Consensus has been the setting for the most important conversation in crypto, blockchain, Web3 and the metaverse. We want you to be a part of that conversation.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Joey Prebys,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/08/consensus-history,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ab3bfacef3b2f637f995f1ba7b3ee939736c2f8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Specifically, the prosecutors are assessing whether Bankman-Fried, commonly referred to as SBF, controlled the prices of the interlinked tokens to benefit his short-lived empire, which was comprised of FTX and his trading firm Alameda Research, The New York Times reported, citing two people with knowledge on the situation. It's unclear if the prosecutors have determined any wrongdoing by SBF, the newspaper noted, adding that the probe is in its early stages. FTX did not immediately respond to Seeking Alpha's request for comment. The span of the high-profile FTX downfall was less than two weeks. To put it bluntly, traders rushed for the exit en masse after discovering the exchange's multi-billion dollar balance sheet shortfall last month, triggering a liquidity crisis that forced FTX and its over 130 affiliates to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. SBF and his empire have come under a raft of investigations globally as there's still many missing pieces to the puzzle. The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office first launched a probe into the FTX collapse in mid-November. At around the same time, authorities in the Bahamas, where FTX is headquartered, opened a criminal investigation to determine whether ""criminal misconduct occurred."" Earlier this week, (Dec. 6) SBF was said to hire Mark Cohen as his defense attorney .",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3915299-sam-bankman-fried-comes-under-crypto-price-manipulation-probe-report?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5301412.jpeg

What is noticeable are massive movements by whales over the past few hours. The cryptocurrency market is on shaky ground given the macroeconomic headwinds and the still not fully digested shock from the FTX collapse. However, XRP investors don’t seem to care at the moment. On the other hand, data suggests that possibly whales have played their part in this development. XRP Whales Surface As the popular cryptocurrency tracker Whale Alert reports, a total amount of 160.6 million XRP was transferred over the past 24 hours. One transaction in particular is causing quite a stir. According to WhaleAlert, Ripple transferred 50 million XRP from one of its wallets to an unknown wallet. The transaction is currently the subject of a heated debate, with some believing that Ripple may sell some of the XRP they hold. 🚨 50,000,000 #XRP (19,289,010 USD) transferred from Ripple to unknown wallethttps://t.co/72jMidOgOL — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 7, 2022 An analysis using Bithomp shows that the cryptocurrency was moved to another wallet of the company (RL18-VN), which is normally used to move or sell the token outside the company.

The Bitstamp whale is linked to the U.S. exchange Bitrex, from where the transfer was made. Remarkably, these whale transactions follow an even much larger series of transactions totaling 4.1 billion XRP yesterday, Wednesday. According to WhaleAlert and Bithomp, these tokens were transferred from Bittrex to Uphold, divided into 10 transactions with a maximum size of 500 million units. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 500,000,000 #XRP (188,355,483 USD) transferred from #Bittrex to unknown wallethttps://t.co/IkmoFxoP3Y — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 7, 2022 The reason behind the transfer is unclear, though it does not look like the transaction was made by an individual.

42411299,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMm9X,1670507100,2022 – Crypto Markets:  A Year in Review,"It’s no secret that 2022 has been a difficult year for global markets.  The U.S. stock market has fallen over 15% in value, bond markets have fallen over 20% and crypto markets have fallen over 50% from their peak in 2021.  Early in 2022, central banks around the world began to raise interest rates in order to slow inflation and decrease the rate of economic expansion. The tightening of monetary and fiscal policies has dramatically decreased investors’ appetite for risk and speculative investment strategies. Many investors have opted to sell or exit speculative asset classes altogether. This macroeconomic pressure has affected traditional asset classes and has put tremendous pressure on emerging asset classes including cryptocurrency.  The economic situation leading into 2022 allowed crypto to shine. Record low interest rates, an expanding money supply and a strong economy all set the stage for record growth, both in price and adoption, in the crypto economy.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Evidence of crypto interest  Investor interest in crypto was evident as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) both reached all-time highs, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols grew to record size, the crypto market cap topped $3 trillion, the non-fungible token (NFT) market grew exponentially and venture capital firms invested in many crypto businesses.  Centralized finance (CeFi) exchanges saw incredible growth as their services offered attractive yields to investors who were not able to find appealing yields in the traditional financial markets. New crypto projects garnered incredible attention and growth, including the Terra ecosystem, headlined by the algorithmic stable coin UST and sister cryptocurrency LUNA.  Investor appetite for risk and speculative asset investments was driven by economic policy that many people believed would continue for years to come. Traders, institutional investors and speculators entered leveraged positions, borrowing money at low rates, which added to the frenzy witnessed in the crypto markets.  Watch: DeFi vs CeFi: The Search for Yield  Crypto investors retreat  As central banks reversed course, began to decrease market liquidity and raise interest rates, these speculative asset classes started to slow. Because of the increase in interest rates, investors saw opportunities to hold lower-risk investments and earn an attractive yield. As the prices of risk assets began to decrease, the crypto market began to sell off. By the end of the second quarter of 2022, the crypto market cap had fallen over $1 trillion. This severe sell-off was accelerated as leveraged positions began to unwind.  New and exciting projects like Terra, began to implode as traders exited the crypto markets. The UST stablecoin de-pegged from the U.S. dollar. Investors lost billions of dollars in the UST blow-up, and the overall market went under even more pressure.  CeFi intuitions were overleveraged, having lent significant funds to hedge funds such as Three Arrows Capital, which lost a tremendous amount of capital in the sell-off that followed the Terra failure. Three Arrows Capital, along with many other leveraged hedge funds, defaulted on loans owed to many CeFi companies and these CeFi companies were forced to file for bankruptcy protection. User funds held on CeFi platforms were frozen and retail investors were not able to remove their funds. Companies such as Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, which promised attractive yields to users, failed and users lost their funds.  Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  Fake out  By the end of the summer, crypto markets were showing signs of stabilizing. The leverage in the ecosystem had apparently been purged from the markets and investor confidence began to return to crypto. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) rose to a summer high level of $1,092 on Sept. 12. Confidence was returning to the markets, driven by FTX, a large exchange and custodian, which had stepped in to rescue large CeFi lender BlockFi from bankruptcy. The seemingly strong FTX, led by founder Sam Bankman-Fried, continued to invest in crypto companies, bailed out many distressed startups and was seen as the strongest company in crypto.  Confidence in crypto markets continued into the late fall of 2022, until shocking revelations around FTX and sister company Alameda Research came to light in a November CoinDesk article. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao immediately and publicly expressed concerns around FTX's solvency and ability to sustain its self-issued token, FTT. Traders began to withdraw funds from FTX. The FTT price fell from roughly $26 to $1 in just a few days and FTX paused customer withdrawals.  The previously healthy company was discovered to be insolvent, having commingled customer deposits and funds. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in late November. The previous bailout of BlockFi was reversed and BlockFi was back into bankruptcy court. Crypto markets crashed. The CoinDesk Market Index plummeted to a low of $795 as investors continued their exodus from crypto markets.  Read more: The Epic Collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX Exchange: A Crypto Markets Timeline  Opportunity for recovery  It is important to note that none of the failures we’ve seen this year have been caused by a failure of the underlying blockchain technology. In fact, technical development has continued in the space, and this year has been a monumental time in the history of many blockchains. Ethereum underwent a successful upgrade in 2022, transitioning from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain. The tokenomics of Ethereum have also changed significantly, which many people believe will benefit the future of the Ethereum ecosystem.  The failures and bankruptcies seen in 2022 have led many people to call for further regulation in crypto. Fraud, theft, along with irresponsible lending and leveraged trading have created a difficult environment for investors, which many believe would not have been possible with proper government oversight and regulation.  As we move into 2023, investors should be aware that the current macro environment, lack of regulation and confidence in crypto, and unclear regulatory frameworks will continue to put pressure on crypto. While these issues are significant and will not be easy to overcome, blockchain innovation and progress is continuing to grow and the use cases for the technology are continuing to be adopted. It is important for all investors to review their crypto portfolios, their investment thesis behind crypto allocations, and set a plan for proper crypto investment moving forward.",NEUTRAL,ETH | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | LUNA | MARKET,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/08/2022-crypto-markets-a-year-in-review,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3db2a9166498c3e0ccc844e9cf0d63eb9a610b20-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If he doesn’t voluntarily testify, the committee will subpoena him, according to a letter from its leaders on Wednesday. “FTX’s collapse has caused real financial harm to consumers, and effects have spilled over into other parts of the crypto industry. The American people need answers about Sam Bankman-Fried’s misconduct at FTX,"" the lawmakers said in a statement.  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said the SEC is fine going after crypto with its current authority. Gensler said he isn’t waiting for new powers from Congress to enforce securities laws against crypto companies, though he added that it would be good to have more money and additional reach beyond U.S. borders. Gensler declined to talk specifically about the failed crypto exchange FTX in an interview on Yahoo Finance.  The Bank of Spain has plans to start a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. On Monday, it asked financial institutions and tech providers to submit proposals for the initiative by Jan. 31. The program seeks to simulate the use of a CBDC in wholesale transactions, the bank said in an official statement. A wholesale CBDC would be used in the transfers of funds between banks and financial institutions, as opposed to a retail CBDC, which would be used by the public for everyday purchases.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin whales have been reducing their holdings, blockchain data shows, and a reversal of that trend might need to happen before a big price rally can begin.  The chart shows bitcoin's UTXO value bands – the distribution of all unspent transaction outputs. The indicator shows behaviors of whales (large investors, pink area) or retail investors separated by the number of coins they hold, along with price actions.  Whales, represented by the UTXO value band of 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC, have decreased their holdings by 367,000 BTC since June.  ""We will need to see whales increasing their holdings for a price rally to be sustainable.

As of this writing, all time horizon indicators for Solana’s native token SOL are red. Since succumbing to market contagion, Solana has continued to bleed Using bearish metrics and technical indicators, we may anticipate a more negative outlook. The token and ecosystem of SOL are not looking good according to other indicators. As per LunarCrush’s data, both social media mentions and engagements are declining. Messari adds that the asset’s unappealing volatility and low returns make it less attractive to investors and traders. What will happen to SOL now that its price has dropped below $14? Will it pull out of the dark or sink much lower? Related Reading: Up Or Down? What To Expect From Solana (SOL) In The Homestretch Of 2022 Solana Price Trajectory: Below Its Target The coin has been trading around $13.5314, well below the bullish aim of $14 and $15. Recent weeks have seen SOL bulls aiming for this level. It all starts on November 15 when bulls attempt to reach $15 but fail. After these attempts, the price fell below $14, where it has remained ever since. Due to bearish technical indicators, it is unlikely that SOL will surpass the $14 or $15 barrier level. On a timescale of four hours, the token’s RSI values are neutral and declining. The bearishness of SOL is further corroborated by its MFI, which is likewise declining. Although the token’s Bollinger band is rather wide, the moving average of is acting as resistance at $13.8150. In spite of this, a positive price pullback may still be warranted, as the prior price movements were in sync with the bullish XABCD harmonic pattern. If momentum permits, the price pullback objective will be $14 with a probable aim of $15. With negative technicals, however, bulls can rely on the $13.3081 support to help maintain sideways momentum and as a potential rally launching point. SOL Bears Are Everywhere Although the support has been resilient against the bears’ previous assaults, a breach of the $13.3081 support might send the price below $13.0951. Overall, SOL will not rebound in the near future. There is a greater probability of a negative breakout in SOL, so investors and traders should tread carefully.

As analyst Miles Deutscher explained, citing data from Dune Analytics, layer-2 scaling solutions saw monumental growth in 2022. “I expect this trend to continue in 2023 and beyond,” Deutscher commented. Blockchain analytics firm Nansen also released data today showing the growth of layer-2 solutions. Specifically, Nansen referred to Abritrum. “Arbitrum season is in full swing,” wrote a researcher at Nansen. According to their data, transactions on L2s are increasing significantly, while transactions on Ethereum are decreasing. A clear divergence can be seen. Regarding Arbitrum, the Nansen researcher writes that the number of daily active addresses averaged 50,000 to 70,000 in November and December. A few months ago, from July to September, the average was 15,000 to 20,000. With the recent Nitro upgrade, Arbitrum has once again massively lowered its average gas price for a transaction. While the average fee was $0.35 before Nitro, it has dropped to $0.08 afterwards. This represents a reduction of almost 75%. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Nears Breakdown Support, Can Bulls Save The Day? However, although Arbitrum’s network usage is skyrocketing, there is no token yet. So far, there is also a lack of an official announcement regarding an Arbitrum token. Rumors have it that Arbitrum will launch its token by the first quarter of 2023 at the latest. The ticker is supposed to be either ARBI or ARB. The Leading Ethereum L2 Solution As NewsBTC reported yesterday, Polygon (MATIC) currently holds the leading position when it comes to successful Ethereum L2 tokens. The project has entered partnerships with major brands such as Starbucks, Mercedes, Meta, Reddit, eBay, Disney, and Adobe, among others. Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, revealed yesterday that the zkEVM mainnet “is coming soon”. With the implementation, Polygon will reach a massive milestone. Once the zkEVM mainnet comes online, there could be an explosion of dApps on Polygon. Zero-knowledge cryptography will enable privacy and minimize data volumes to make transactions for smart contracts even more efficient.

A public test network is scheduled to go live in 2023. It will serve as the core of BitDAO and use BIT as a token. Optimism also has a token. The L2 Ethereum scaling solution was first introduced in June 2019, and the public mainnet was launched in December 2021.

In the initial 11 months of the year, BTC declined by about 65%. Then, when it appeared that BTC gained stability at the $20K price mark, the FTX contagion broke out. The adverse event has brought the leading coin, Bitcoin, down by around 75% from its peak price of $68,789. BTC currently trades at $16,823. Notwithstanding, Bitcoin is still more promising than the rest of the altcoins. Therefore, several experts still believe prospective crypto investors can opt for BTC now, as it projects a positive future. Related Reading: Bullish Sentiment Spikes As Axie Infinity Price Propels 9%, What’s Next For AXS? As for the Ethereum token, its price change in the past 24 hours is -1.94%, with a trading price just above the $1,200 mark. Ethereum is also believed to be profitable in the long run, given its transition to 2.0 and potential to revolutionize the web. Bitcoin And Ethereum As Profitable Investment Options Meanwhile, a recognized stockbroker, Jordan Belfort, has expressed his thoughts concerning the profitability of Bitcoin and Ethereum. In his comment, he stated that both digital tokens are the safest to venture into. He admonishes crypto investors to get into the ecosystem with little capital. This is because of the unpredictable risks and volatility of these digital tokens. He further shared some lights on the recent FTX incident. He cited that investors couldn’t identify the scam of the exchange. But this is not a yardstick to disregard investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The stock broker also announced that his BTC holdings are still intact, with more purchases already made. His actions are backed by the belief that BTC will bring a huge ROI in a decade or less. ‘Wolf Of Wall Street’ On Crypto Adoption Belfort, also known as the “Wolf Of Wall Street,” shared information on his past dealings. At the time, most of its dealings were connected to the fading “Great Fools Theory.” This theory proposes high prices due to the overpriced securities sold to so-called greater fools. Such transactions occur regardless of the securities’ value and continue until the market is devoid of greater fools. The name The Wolf of Wall Street was inspired by the popular 2013 movie – The Wolf of Wall Street. It’s a movie written by Terence Winter and directed by Martin Scorsese. Its storyline centered on Jordan Belfort of 2007, who displayed great passion as a stockbroker in NYC (New York City), United States. Related Reading: Bullish News For Polygon! zkEVM Mainnet Is Coming Soon, Says Co-Founder Getting into 2021, the stock broker observed the rapid development of Bitcoin and eventually opted in. During the period, Belfort had hoped that the price of BTC would surge to $100K before 2021 wrapped up. His reason was based on the fixed max supply of tokens, which has remained at 21 million coins. Although the expectation was never met, his hopes are still high, which is evident in how he speaks highly of the coin. According to him, investors should not expect Bitcoin to yield sudden profits. Instead, it’s better to venture into the coin with a long-term mindset to make the most out of it.

But the European Union (EU) body says it’s still working on how to enforce the measures on wallet providers or exchanges based outside the bloc.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the proposed new tax rules, known as the eighth Directive on Administrative Cooperation, or DAC8, seeks to halt billions of euros in evasion by taxpayers stashing crypto abroad.  “Anonymity means that many crypto-asset users making significant profits fall under the radar of national tax authorities. This is not acceptable,” Paolo Gentiloni, EU commissioner for tax, said in a statement.  When asked how the EU will enforce the measures on companies outside the bloc, Gentiloni told reporters, “We will work on that. What counts for us is that EU residents are targeted by these measures,” even if they use crypto providers from elsewhere, he said.  Gentiloni’s measures would further the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), which allows foreign companies to gain EU clients using a procedure called reverse solicitation.  The tax plan requires any company with EU clients to register and report within the bloc, but may face logistical challenges in a sector where companies are largely online and sometimes claim not to have headquarters at all.  Read more: EU Crypto, NFT Providers Must Report Tax Details Under Leaked EU Plan  The widely touted plans, which will also apply to some providers of non-fungible tokens (NFT), have drawn immediate reactions from industry observers.  In a statement, the European Crypto Initiative said of the plan that it was “concerned that it would apply to a far wider range of obliged entities and individuals” than MiCA, which the lobby group said meant “diluting MiCA's initial concept and potentially weakening its effect.”  Others have been more calm over the plans, noting that the 38 developed countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have already developed norms to stop tax being evaded in overseas bank accounts, which they now want to spread to crypto.  “Exchange of information across borders already happens in the tax world and authorities are keen to expand the scope of these data sharing arrangements to crypto asset transactions,” Danny Talwar, head of tax at Koinly, told CoinDesk in a statement.  Dea Markova, managing director at Forefront Advisers, told CoinDesk that the plan “stands to touch global players who may have otherwise avoided the need to get licensed.”  “An ‘EU crypto tax’ is not on the cards,” Markova said, with any tax law needing unanimous agreement of 27 finance ministers. However, he added that, politically speaking, “it will be difficult to argue that the proposal should be any less expansive in scope or granularity than it is.”  The commission believes its new plans will generate as much as 2.4 billion euros ($2.5 billion) for national coffers by making crypto tax evasion harder. Any loophole for foreign providers could mean tax goes missing, with registered EU companies disadvantaged.

The territory's Legislative Council voted to add virtual asset service providers (VASP) to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Ordinance as of June 1, 2023, according to a Dec. 5 amendment to the law.  The fallout from the collapse of FTX, which was once based in Hong Kong before departing for Bahamas in September 2021, casts doubt over what crypto-friendly ambitions Hong Kong may now have. Prior to the exchange's failure early November, the territory showed signs of relaxing its tough regulations and becoming a more crypto-friendly environment. The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau said at the end of October that it was open to allowing retail customers to trade crypto or approving a virtual assets exchange-traded fund (ETF).

42413473,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9L5K,1670503215,Ether Breaks Trendline From Previous Bear Cycle Lows,"The bear market in ether (ETH) is forecast to intensify because the cryptocurrency has dipped below pivotal support.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell 17% last month, breaching an ascending trendline connecting June and October lows.  The trendline was expected to put a floor under ether, considering its extended version corresponds with major market bottoms registered in March 2020 and December 2016, according to the log-scaled weekly chart provided by TradingView.  Therefore, the downside break of the trendline is keeping Decentral Park Capital's portfolio manager Lewis Harland awake at night.  ""No one is talking about this – ether has flipped a multi-bear cycle trendline support into resistance,"" Lewis Harland, a portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, told CoinDesk, adding the breakdown ""looks horrible.""  A trendline is a straight line connecting two or more price points, usually swing highs or lows, to illustrate the direction of the market trend. An ascending trendline indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side. Therefore, a breakdown of the ascending trendline is considered an early warning of an impending bearish trend change.  Traders often extend the ascending trendline into the past to see if it corresponds with major turning points. If it does, as in ETH's case, the trendline and its eventual violation are considered important.  A logarithmic scale chart plots values between two points according to the percent change rather than the absolute change and is suitable for data with vast value disparity. For instance, ether has gone from being valued in two digits in March 2020 to four digits at press time. Chart analysts use log-scaled charts to analyze long-term trends.  The trendline is now acting as resistance, capping the upside in ether.  ""ETH is now using multi-cycle support as resistance. It has never occurred in ether's history and likely speaks to this new market regime,"" Harland noted.  Ether might run into stronger selling pressure should the situation persist.  At this point, one might wonder about an ideal time to turn bullish on cryptocurrency. Per crypto options trading firm QCP Capital, ether needs to clear a line of resistance from its peak price of $4,868 registered in November last year to turn bullish.  At press time, the trendline resistance was located at around $1,400, while ether changed hands at $1,240.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/08/ether-breaks-trendline-from-previous-bear-cycle-lows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9431f07d8bff08387315fc524a0dd86b7cf0cfe-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian seems likely to win a lawsuit against her and other celebrities over their endorsement of cryptocurrency platform EthereumMax (EMAX) on Tuesday after a judge tentatively dismissed the case due to insufficient allegations  The plaintiffs alleged in January they suffered damages after following celebrity endorsements by the likes of Kardashian, along with retired boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and National Basketball Association Hall of Famer Paul Pierce.  “The court acknowledges that this action raises legitimate concerns over celebrities’ ability to readily persuade millions of undiscerning followers to buy snake oil with unprecedented ease and reach,” Judge Michael Fitzgerald of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, said in a document of the proceeding.  Nevertheless, the judge decided to dismiss the motion, as expected, because the complainant was not able to supply sufficient facts.  “While the law certainly places limits on those advertisers, it also expects investors to act reasonably before basing their bets on the zeitgeist of the moment,” Fitzgerald said in the document.  Kardashian has had to pay $1.26 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for not disclosing the $250,000 payment she received for promoting EthereumMax.

ApeX Pro is a permissionless, non-custodial, decentralized exchange (DEX) offering perpetual contracts using StarkWare's scalability engine, StarkEx. It’s being brought onto the Bybit platform via its Web3 wallet, which is a hybrid wallet – similar to MetaMask – that doesn’t store client personal details.  Centralized exchanges (CEX) have recently come under increased scrutiny after the once-trusted FTX turned out to have been a potential fraud that caused thousands of users to lose billions of dollars.  But the FTX meltdown isn’t the reason for Bybit’s integration of ApeX Pro, which had been “well under way before the saga,” Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou told CoinDesk.  “It’s part of our mission to become a trusted gateway to Web3 and this integration is an essential step on that path,” he said.  Earlier this week, Bybit announced it would cut another 30% of its workforce as it tries to refocus its operations amid “a deepening bear market.”  Because ApeX Pro and Bybit are separate entities, Bybit will not be involved in the operations of ApeX Pro and both teams are separate. “ApeX Pro is a self-sustaining decentralized platform and does not require additional resources from Bybit,” Zhou said.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/08/centralized-crypto-exchange-bybit-integrates-decentralized-exchange-apex-pro-onto-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3691791c9aad4aae0b30c44e21c2c0346213b2c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Let’s take a quick glance at some recent developments: Recent statistics suggest that an increase in dApp development activity can be attributed to changes made available to developers Metrics and technicals continue to act as a brake on price #LUNC #LUNCCcommunity $LUNC #flutter The new alpha package for TerraDart is now ready! Use this package to communicate with LUNC Blockchain for Flutter or Dart Environments. https://t.co/SCkWqkBQde — TheArchitect123 | CC & CCI (@AlphaGenius1237) December 5, 2022 The tweet implies that the TerraDart alpha package will make it possible for dApps to interact with the LUNC blockchain from within a Flutter or Dart environment. The software development kit would help make developing dApps on-chain to be more streamlined. Data from Santiment shows that because of this recent change, LUNA’s on-chain development activity has increased dramatically. Metrics and technological details, however, hint to a bleak future for the ecosystem. Related Reading: Hedera (HBAR) Continues To Consolidate Near Its Lowest Level This 2022 LUNA Falls Due To Bearish Technicals The current price of one coin is $1.5807. Pearson’s R for the regression channel is 0.6221, which indicates strong bearishness despite the price being at a green candle. This portends a probable decline in price. Nonetheless, a positive crossover in the RSI indicates some optimism. The data are also on the rise, confirming the creation of a price downturn. The MACD indicator is also approaching a bullish crossing, confirming a modest upswing. Nonetheless, a retreat would not be sufficient for a complete recovery. The EMA ribbon remains bearish, functioning as a dynamic resistance. The $1.5457 support is underpinning the recent retreat, therefore investors and traders should keep an eye on it. In the coming days, the Bollinger band is also in the process of developing a crunch zone, which would be another obstacle to a complete recovery. Terra: On Developments & Price Action According to TradingView’s technical analysis of the cryptocurrency, investors should sell since a decline is inevitable. This is further supported by a significant drop in LUNA’s MFI value, which indicates that the present upward price trend will be subject to a quick reversal. Certainly, the new developments have an effect on the price of LUNA. Sadly, this is insufficient to halt the pessimism around the asset. Messari has a Sharpe ratio of -4.34, indicating that LUNA’s returns compared to its risk are close to zero or negative. Currently, a short position after a bearish breakout at $1.5457 would be profitable for investors and traders in this extremely unfavorable market situation. Related Reading: Up Or Down?

42413465,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9Kvy,1670487265,Crypto Options Exchange Deribit Registered Record Trading Volume in November,"Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by volume and open interest, has been busier than ever.  The number of ether (ETH) options contracts traded rose 10% in November relative to October, reaching a record high of 8.9 million. Trading volume in bitcoin (BTC) options rose 17% to 778,000 contracts, nearing the record rally registered in January 2021, according to data sourced from Deribit.  In nominal terms, the total options turnover rose 5% to $25.5 billion, with the exchange accounting for over 90% of the global trading volume. On Deribit, one ether and one bitcoin option contract represent 1 ETH and 1 BTC, respectively.  Volumes rose as Sam Bankman-Fried's exchange FTX, formerly the third-largest crypto spot and futures platform worldwide by volume, filed for bankruptcy protection, raising fears of widespread contagion.  ""Market volatility and overall fear and unrest have resulting in trading opportunities (up 20% in overall volumes or + USD 8 billion) but perhaps more importantly clients were able to hedge existing portfolios,"" Deribit said in its monthly newsletter.  ""Deribit has seen new record volumes in our options settlement as 778,000 BTC and 8.9 million ETH options contracts were traded in November,"" Deribit added.  Options are derivative contracts that offer the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and is akin to purchasing insurance against price rallies. The put option is a bearish bet offering the purchaser the right to sell.  Therefore, the demand for options is closely tied to the degree of uncertainty in the market. The higher the uncertainty, the greater the demand and activity in options.  That's what happened last month as traders snapped up protective puts in bitcoin, ether and Solana's SOL token in the wake of the negative news flow related to FTT.  ""Options are great tools for risk management. They enable the ability to focus on more nuanced outcomes,"" Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, tweeted, referring to the increase in activity on Deribit.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/08/crypto-options-exchange-deribit-registers-record-ether-trading-volume-in-november,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed24204a8fd4c89c259442c444970f501fadf7b3-1114x580.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release, the project will be ""an innovative audio-visual IRL-meets-metaverse supergroup"" that uses the duo's CryptoPunks in its visual imagery. The group claims to be the first DJ set associated with CryptoPunks, which released intellectual property rights (IP) to holders in August after being acquired by Yuga Labs.  Blau owns CryptoPunk #6708, which has white hair and wears sunglasses, while Aoki owns six of the 8-bit characters, including CryptoPunk #6748, which wears a purple cap and an eye mask.  “PUNX is a forward-thinking, conceptual musical art project with a nod to the music we love and the music that shaped who we are today,"" Aoki said in a statement. ""Though we’ve been friends for 10 years, it was our shared passion for Web3 that inspired this collab.""  The group tweeted that sonically, PUNX ""will be different from either of our current sounds,"" opting for a glitchier, choppier techno sound.  3LAU tweeted that the project is ""not an NFT"" but said that the project may find ways to integrate blockchain technology in the future.

The fund has just been sued by Fir Tree Capital Management. GBTC is inferior to Bitcoin, just as the gold-backed Dollar was inferior to Gold. Thesis Summary Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has been under scrutiny following the FTX ( FTT-USD ) demise and has, in fact, been sued by a hedge fund that is alleging that GBTC is not acting in the best interest of its investors. Ultimately, I don’t see GBTC in danger of going out of business, but it’s essential for readers to know that GBTC is an inferior product to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). GBTC: A Quick Overview Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has been making headlines in recent weeks, as the demise of FTX has shone the spotlight on all forms of crypto companies and investment vehicles. But before we get into what’s going on now, let’s quickly dive into how GBTC originated and works. GBTC was created in 2013 as an investment vehicle for accredited private investors. Sometime later, it received FINRA approval, making its shares eligible for public trade. GBTC is part of the large conglomerate Digital Currency Group. GBTC buys Bitcoin using its investors' funds and then stores them in “cold storage” through Coinbase, Inc. (COIN). Each share represents a given amount of Bitcoin, but this does not mean shares can be redeemed into Bitcoin. This is, in part, why Grayscale, currently trades at a discount to Bitcoin and why the fund has been working so hard to gain approval to become an ETF. GBTC discount to NAV (Ycharts) GBTC currently trades at a 43% discount to Bitcoin due to uncertainty over its holdings, safety and the fact that investors have been selling. More importantly, though, the fact that GBTC is not an ETF means it can’t arbitrage this discount in the open market. This steep discount represents a possible opportunity for those who want to gain exposure to Bitcoin, but investors must understand that GBTC is not Bitcoin. GBTC is Facing Trust Issues GBTC may be a way to gain exposure to the movements in the Bitcoin price, but it is a far cry from owning Bitcoin. The fund does not offer redemption in Bitcoin or fiat, and its interests are not necessarily aligned with those of its users. Ultimately, GBTC is a part of Digital Currency Group, which makes money from the 2% fees levied on GBTC investors. The issues above are at the heart of a recent lawsuit by Fir Tree Capital Management. Fir Tree filed a lawsuit against Grayscale on 6 December at the Delaware Court of Chancery in a bid to force Grayscale to lower its fees, begin stock redemptions and hand over documents relating to its relationship with the Digital Currency Group. Source: Hedgeweek.com Fir Tree argues, quite rightly in my opinion, that there is no legitimate reason for GBTC not to allow redemptions or even let investors convert their holdings to fiat. GBTC also charges a 2% fee on its holdings' value, not its fund's value, which can also be seen as unfair. If GBTC did indeed take these measures, then the discount to NAV would be reduced, and might even disappear. However, reducing fees or allowing redemptions is clearly not in the interest of the fund managers. GBTC is Not Bitcoin Grayscale offers a very convenient way to own Bitcoin, which is why investors put up with the fees. Furthermore, there are not many alternatives out there. However, it’s important to understand that GBTC is not Bitcoin, and that it in fact stands against the principles of Bitcoin, and one of the main reasons why Bitcoin is considered by many as a superior form of money. Anything that isn’t money itself is but a proxy, which in moments of distress will be a lot less valuable than the money itself. This has been the case since the day of gold, and it is the case today. This idea is better understood using concepts from the book Layered Money by Nik Bhatia. In the book, Bhatia describes money as a pyramid, with the top of the purest forms of money (gold) taking the top of the pyramid and then subsequent layers being added below of less “real” money. Under the gold standard, Central banks held gold, and then banks issued notes that were redeemable in gold. However, these notes were not gold itself, in fact, they only promised to deliver gold. The US made good on this promise for centuries but eventually reneged on its gold obligations. The gold-backed US dollar, a promise to give gold, was only as good as the word of its issuer. Further down the ladder, debt issued by banks is a form of money too, but it is much less valuable, especially when there is a crisis of confidence. In this scenario, people seek security in the higher forms of money i.e. gold, and in the case of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin. The same comparison can be drawn between GBTC and Bitcoin. Bitcoin sits atop the pyramid as “digital gold”, and GBTC is but an intermediary further down the pyramid that is issuing Bitcoin promises, which are a lower form of money. The demise of FTX has highlighted these issues. What would happen to GBTC if its parent company faced liquidity issues? Or what could happen if Coinbase, which allegedly holds GBTC’s Bitcoin, ran into problems? One of the main draws of Bitcoin is that it allows anyone unrestrained access to the highest form of money, Bitcoin itself. Final Thoughts GBTC is a lower form of Bitcoin, but that doesn’t mean it is in danger, in my opinion. I have no reason to believe that funds are being mismanaged at GBTC or Coinbase, and these are two large public-facing institutions that would face repercussions if something were to happen. I hold a small position in GBTC myself, and ultimately, I believe we will see GBTC close down its discount and even trade at a premium as it once did before. Still, this doesn’t change the fact that GBTC is an inferior way of owning Bitcoin.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4563076-gbtc-is-to-bitcoin-as-dollar-was-to-gold?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5282970.jpeg

Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), respectively the chair and ranking member of the committee, wrote a public letter to Bankman-Fried, who resigned from the exchange the same day it filed for bankruptcy protection last month. The committee is holding a hearing on Wednesday, Dec. 14, a day after the House Financial Services Committee holds its own hearing on the exchange.  “FTX’s collapse has caused real financial harm to consumers, and effects have spilled over into other parts of the crypto industry. The American people need answers about Sam Bankman-Fried’s misconduct at FTX,"" the lawmakers said in a prepared statement. ""The Committee has requested that he testify at our upcoming hearing on FTX’s collapse, and will consider further action if he does not comply.”  Normally, witnesses appear voluntarily, the lawmakers said in the letter. If Bankman-Fried does not confirm his participation by Thursday, ""I am prepared, along with Ranking Member Pat Toomey, to issue a subpoena to compel your testimony,"" the letter signed by Brown said.  House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters has also invited Bankman-Fried to testify, saying in a tweet Wednesday that she may also seek to subpoena him if he does not appear voluntarily.  Bankman-Fried has gone on a press tour since the bankruptcy, speaking to numerous reporters. He has not provided any concrete answers about how FTX appeared to send billions in customer funds to Alameda Research, another company he founded and was a majority owner of, saying he was unsure how it happened and implying that others were responsible for the fund movements.  He now faces a number of investigations, including an investigation by federal prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, who are investigating whether Bankman-Fried may have tried to manipulate the price of TerraUSD and Luna, which collapsed in their own dramatic fashion earlier this year, according to the New York Times.

Bitcoin 1w-1m Realized Cap UTXO Age Bands Have Sharply Gone Up As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the percentage of the BTC realized cap that was last moved between 1 week to 1 month ago has displayed rapid uptrend for the first time in this bear. The “realized cap” is a Bitcoin capitalization model that values each coin in the circulating supply using the price at which it was last moved. The metric then calculates the “true valuation” of BTC by summing up all these values of the individual coins. This is different from the normal market cap, where every coin in circulation has the same one value; the current Bitcoin price. The “realized cap – UTXO age bands” is an indicator that tells us the distribution of the realized cap of each age band in the market. These age bands specify ranges between which UTXOs (or more simply, coins) falling into said age band were last moved. Related Reading: Glassnode: Bitcoin Holders Realized 14x More Losses Than Profits Recently The relevant age band here is the 1w-1m group, which includes all UTXOs that were last moved within 1 week to 1 month ago. Here is a chart that shows how the percentage of the realized cap contributed by this age band has changed over the years: Looks like the value of the metric has sharply gone up in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the realized cap of the 1w-1m Bitcoin UTXO age band has observed some rapid uptrend recently. The older end of this range, that is, one month ago, is around when the crash due to the FTX collapse took place. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Cohorts Now Have Close Cost-Basis, What Does It Say About Market? The indicator’s value rising thus suggests that investors have done some fresh accumulation at the lows following this crash. This is the first time in this Bitcoin bear market that such rapid new accumulation has taken place. From the chart, it’s apparent that such rises have historically coincided with cyclical lows in the price. Another interesting thing to note is that between these spikes in the metric during the previous two cycles, there were 1358 days. The current rise has come 1444 days after the last one, which is a similar length as the gap before. If there really is a pattern here, then the Bitcoin bottom may be very close, if not already in.
