42378996,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkLb,1480089840,R3 Funding: JPMorgan Among 7 Banks That Could Be Out of Deal,"Update 30th November: This article has been updated with comment from R3CEV officials.      As many as seven of the original 42 members of the R3CEV banking consortium have yet to express interest in funding the startup's ongoing $150m funding round, leaked documents reveal.  Released on PasteBin (now recovered here) this morning (and confirmed by sources close to the deal), the text details a list of the banks that have expressed interest in participating in the funding, how much each could invest and the names of seven banks that are alleged to have opted-out.  The list of banks includes names that have confirmed they are no longer participating in the consortium, including Banco Santander and Goldman Sachs, as well as those that were previously rumored to have withdrawn (such as Morgan Stanley and National Bank Australia) but that have yet to publicly respond.  New banks that have reportedly yet to submit a bid as part of the funding including JP Morgan, Macquarie Group and US Bancorp, though it is unclear if they are out of the consortium officially or if they have yet to confirm interest.  Representatives of Macquarie and US Bancorp did not respond to inquires for more information at press time.  Officials at R3CEV claim JP Morgan remains active in negotiations. JP Morgan declined to comment on the matter.  A person close to the bank, however, said that the firm still intends to be a member of R3 and that it has ""no intention of dropping its membership"" but that it won't likely participate in the round.  Another source close to the deal suggested that some of the banks listed may yet submit bids as part of the funding round. Non-binding declarations of interest were due on Friday, with the list of participating banks disseminated on Tuesday.  As previously reported, the majority of banks (now confirmed to be 35) have indicated interest in funding R3, which aims to open-source its distributed ledger platform Corda later this month.  The original 42 members of R3 now have the first opportunity to fund the startup, though R3 has said it could be opened to more member-banks and outside investors.  At $150m, the round still could end up being the largest in history for any blockchain firm. As detailed in the document, as much as $56.5m has so far been pledged.  Representatives of R3 could not be reached at press time.

42379015,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkgz,1480087843,Argentina's Central Bank is Warming Up to Blockchain,"With its currency volatility, one might expect Argentina's central bank to be hesitant in exploring blockchain technology.  But that wasn't the case at a hackathon held last week that united students, professionals, economists and bitcoin and blockchain enthusiasts. Held on Friday and Saturday, the two-day event saw $ARS150,000 ($9,677) awarded to the three most innovative projects, including one blockchain startup.  Blockchain notarization platform Signatura won second place at the event, receiving a check from the central bank for $ARS50,000 ($3,226).  In interview, Franco Amati, member and founder of Signatura, recalled how his company used the competition to propose a product called 'Financial Passport' that demos how consumers can use blockchain to share data, while keeping it encrypted.  Using the product, the consumer could revoke a bank's access key to the passport, and the flow is digitally signed using the bitcoin blockchain, assuring its date, authorship and integrity.  Amati told CoinDesk:  ""When a bank needs it, for a loan for example, it requests the information using the platform, and the consumer is notified to grant or reject the request to access its details.""  In this sense, Amati said, the project highlights how blockchain could be used to help financial institutions reduce paperwork and speed up processes.  And there are signs that the Central Bank of Argentina may be interested in concepts like these.  Potential partnerships  Signatura said it's even open to working with the central bank.  When asked about what blockchain technology can offer to the central banks, Amati said he believes ""transparency, open-government and settlement"", and there are signs those at the institution agree.  On the first day of the hackathon, central bank vice president, Lucas Llach (known in the local bitcoin community for his antagonist view on cryptocurrencies), talked about how blockchain could be a source of innovation in the financial industry.  Amati said he was excited ""to see a positive reception and outlook for these ideas"", but he believes that this technology is still new to those in government.  For example, one of the hackathon judges asked how the blockchain could be trusted and that, he said, is ""not an easy thing to explain without enough time"".  Small steps  Progress is in some ways limited by the early nature of the tech.  Only two of the roughly 40 hackathon projects were blockchain related, and both were proposed by members of bitcoin organizations or startups.  ""Bitcoin and blockchain are still related not only on a technical level, but also in their users and entrepreneurs. And this kind of events helps showing them to people outside of that circle,"" Amati said.  Cross-collaboration has started to happen elsewhere.  For example, during the Latin American Bitcoin Conference in Buenos Aires, Tiziano M Di Biase, managing director of economic research at the central bank, invited the bitcoin-friendly audience to participate in the hackathon.  When asked by the moderator if the Central Bank is investigating the use of the blockchain, he said that its focus now is to work on improving new payment methods.  But he added:  ""The blockchain is an extremely interesting technology and many central banks are closely analyzing it today.""
