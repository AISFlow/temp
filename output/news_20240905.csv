33235039,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640148,1725579039,KAMA Memecoin Soars 10% Following Putin’s Endorsement Of Kamala Harris,"A Kamala Harris-inspired memecoin recently jumped over 10% after the US Vice President received public endorsement from Vladimir Putin. The Russian president expressed his support for the Democratic candidate on Thursday, fueling a surge in the PolitiFi token’s activity. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Leads Memecoins Recovery With 12% Jump, Is $2.2 The Next Stop? Putin Endorses Kamala Harris’ Campaign As the US elections get closer, the presidential candidates continue to receive support from various industry figures, politicians, and world leaders. Republican candidate Donald Trump has been endorsed by many figures in the sector and pro-crypto former candidates like Vivek Ramaswamy and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Meanwhile, the Democratic nominee and US VP, Kamala Harris, has also received support from some industry executives and advocates despite her unclear stance on the sector. Most recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin joined the voices advocating for Harris’ presidential campaign for the upcoming elections. During the plenary session at the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF), Putin shared his support for the US VP following Biden’s rally dropout. The Russian president had previously endorsed Joe Biden’s reelection, stating he was his “favorite” candidate. As reported by news outlet Sputnik, Putin suggested that the Russian government would follow Biden’s “recommendation” and support the Democratic candidate: I once said that if we can name a favorite candidate, it would be Joe Biden, but now he’s not participating in the election campaign. He recommended supporting [Kamala] Harris. So, that is what we are going to do… Additionally, the Russian president expressed a fascination for the US VP’s laugh, which has also captivated the internet’s attention and inspired a series of memes using recordings of her voice. “Her laugh is so fascinating. It means that everything is good,” stated the Russian leader. KAMA Memecoin Jumps 16% On Wednesday night, Kamala Horris (KAMA), a Kamala Harris-themed memecoin, registered a jump of over 15% amid the market fluctuation. The surge was seemingly fueled by reports claiming the VP’s campaign was accepting crypto donations through Coinbase. Yesterday, Fortune reported that Coinbase’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Alesia Haas, stated that the Democratic candidate was using the platform to accept donations in digital assets. Following the speculation, it was later revealed that Harris’ campaign wasn’t directly accepting crypto. As a Coinbase representative clarified, the CFO comments seemingly referred to the Future Forward Political Action Committee (PAC), a Democratic Party-aligned super PAC, dedicated to supporting the party’s nominee. The KAMA memecoin momentarily became the largest gainer among the top tokens in the PolitiFi sector, but quickly retraced 11%. However, in the early hours of Thursday, KAMA surged another 10%, retesting the $0.009 zone again. Related Reading: AAVE Whale Goes On $6.78 Million Buying Spree As Price Recovers 16% The token’s recent price action represents a 12% and 57% increase in the weekly and biweekly timeframes.

33233511,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639996,1725575413,Ethereum (ETH) Triangle Formation Hints At A Double Bottom: Breakout and New ATH?,"Ethereum is trading near its yearly low of $2,400 after an 18% drop from local highs. ETH has notably underperformed compared to Bitcoin and other altcoins like Solana this cycle, leading to investor concerns. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Struggles To Break Past $2,600: What’s Driving ETH Down? One of the key reasons for this underperformance is the lack of enthusiasm surrounding Ethereum ETFs. Metrics from these funds show low interest from traditional investors, adding to the bearish sentiment around ETH. As the crypto market is gripped by fear and uncertainty, Ethereum traders are searching for clues on whether a potential recovery is on the horizon. Top analysts and investors have started sharing their views on ETH’s next move, with many suggesting that a bounce could occur if certain technical levels hold. If this bounce materializes, it may relieve Ethereum, but until then, the market remains cautious. Ethereum Price Action Suggests A Bounce Ethereum is currently trading at a critical level that could propel the next big move if it holds support. Top analyst and investor Mags has shared an analysis on X, revealing that ETH has been consolidating within a massive triangle formation since 2021. According to Mags, Ethereum is now approaching the lower boundary of this formation, which is a crucial support level that could define its next significant move. Mags anticipates a potential double-bottom pattern forming near this upward-sloping trendline, indicating that a bullish reversal may be on the horizon. Related Reading: Is Chainlink (LINK) Sliding To $9? On-Chain Metrics Expose Weak Network Activity Recently, the price tested a key demand zone at $2,307, showing initial signs of recovery. This level is essential for Ethereum’s price action, as a hold above it could signal strength and create the foundation for a move higher. The analysis suggests that the next target for ETH could be new all-time highs if it breaks out of the triangle pattern, defying the bearish expectations of many traders still waiting for lower prices. This potential bullish scenario could unfold if Ethereum’s price holds the lower boundary of the triangle and gains upward momentum. A breakout would send ETH toward higher levels, outperforming current market sentiment and surprising investors. ETH Holding Above $2,300 Ethereum (ETH) currently trades at $2,396 following intense volatility and market uncertainty. The price is in a consolidation phase, which could still be susceptible to a surprising retrace if demand weakens further. Currently, ETH is trading below the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $2,596, aligning with the crucial $2,600 level. This level is vital for ETH to retake if it aims to push higher in the short term. A sustained trading position below these levels signals weakness and the potential for further declines. For bulls, reclaiming the $2,600 mark is essential to shift the price structure and initiate a new uptrend. Success in pushing this level could set the stage for targeting the local high of $2,820. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Plunge Could Be Over: This Key Pattern Signals A Rally Back To $4,000 However, if ETH fails to close above $2,600, the next significant support is anticipated around $2,116. The price action in the coming days will be critical in determining ETH’s next move, with traders watching closely for signals of either a breakout or a deeper retrace.

33231253,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640063,1725570048,"Litecoin Looks Poised To Explode As Grayscale Buys 10,000 LTC","Litecoin (LTC) is set to enjoy a significant price increase due to massive buying pressure from institutional investors like Grayscale. A recent analysis by crypto analyst 28 Crypto also showed that Litecoin is poised to enjoy significant price gains. Grayscale Adds 10,000 LTC To Its Portfolio In an X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto commentator Bamboo shared data from the crypto data analysis platform Coinglass, showing that Grayscale had recently added 10,000 LTC to their portfolio. Further data from Coinglass showed that the asset manager now holds 1.86 million LTC ($122 million). In line with this development, Bamboo urged the crypto community to start paying attention to Litecoin “before max pain kicks in and [the] price shoots up” and prices them all out. The crypto analyst added that Litecoin would likely usher in a rally for the crypto market as it has done in the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Behavior Reminiscent Of 2019 As BTC Remains Below $60,000 It is worth mentioning that Grayscale’s Litecoin holdings are the underlying assets for its Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTCN), which offers institutional investors exposure to the crypto asset. As such, the increase in Grasycale’s Litecoin holdings indicates there is an increased demand for the crypto among institutional investors. This is undoubtedly bullish for Litecoin, considering the impact the increased demand for the crypto among institutional investors can have on its price. Moreover, the existence of closed-end funds like LTCN, which offers institutional investors, could eventually pave the way for the launch of a Spot Litecoin ETF, ultimately causing more liquidity to flow into the Litecoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that other Litecoin whales besides Grayscale are accumulating the crypto. There has been a notable surge in the number of LTC coins held by these whales. Furthermore, investors who hold between 0.1% and 1% of Litecoin’s circulating supply have also increased their holdings in the last thirty days. Litecoin Price Is Set To Witness A Breakout Crypto analyst, 28 Crypto, revealed in an X post that Litecoin is breaking out against Bitcoin on the daily time frame. The crypto analyst noted how bullish this is for Litecoin, considering that it has experienced a “very long” downtrend against Bitcoin. In response to a follower, the crypto analyst also mentioned that a breakout on the weekly time frame is also coming and asserted that Litecoin will rise higher than they can imagine. Interestingly, 28 Crypto has earlier stated that Litecoin will outperform all major cap coins including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says The Bitcoin ‘Summer Chop’ Is Nearing Its End, Here’s Why Crypto analyst Joao Devesa provided insights into how high Litecoin will rise if it achieves a successful breakout, stating that it will rise to $100. The last time Litecoin reached that price level was in April earlier this year when it hit $103.

42390432,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1iZf,1725565147,A Crypto Project's Weird Marketing 'Hack' Riffed on Infamous 1987 Chicago TV Hijacking,"Who woulda thunk a mostly forgotten 1980s TV character could help a crypto hackathon attract developers?  That seems to be the gambit of NEAR Protocol, which this week staged a very weird takeover of its social media channels by a purportedly unknown ""hacker."" The fake breach started with mocking tweets and crescendoed with a masked villain disrupting founder Illia Polosukhin to rip on the crypto ""pipe dream"" and telling viewers ""there's nothing waiting for you in Thailand"" (where NEAR's holding its hackathon in November).  Reverse psychology aside, the marketing stunt makes callbacks to a decades-old character of early digital culture: Max Headroom. He's the purportedly AI-generated television host of a series of 1980's TV movie and subsequent shows that aired in the U.S. and the U.K., and also the chief marketer of New Coke (a famous flop).  What really makes Max memorable today, and notable for the purposes of NEAR's rather cringey gambit, is the broadcast that wasn't supposed to be: the Max Headroom incident. In 1987, an unknown signal pirate hijacked a ""Dr. Who"" broadcast in Chicago and went on a 90-second nonsensical ramble, all while wearing a Max Headroom mask.  A good deal matches up between the Max Headroom incident (an unsolved crime that sparked a decades-long federal investigation) and NEAR's video takeover. Both star a masked, suited, sunglass'd, voice-altered man making fun of his viewers.  Of course, the content of the two characters' criticisms differ. Chicago's signal pirate dropped blasts of gibberish during his unsanctioned broadcast, occasionally calling out people as ""nerds."" He ended his broadcast by getting his bare bottom slapped with a fly swatter.  While the Max Headroom incident was a genuine hijacking of the airwaves, the NEAR takeover is a marketing stunt admitted to by the company's own spokespeople. An inauthentic hack.  CoinDesk learned a bit of this NEAR-Max's lore: his name is ""HiJack"" and he's ""the antithesis of Web3 values - a sleazy, corporate, desk-jockey who is satisfied with the current state of the world (because he and his cronies are on top).""  ""His aim is to sow dissent and doubt (literally FUD) because Web3, and particularly the intersection of AI x Web3 in which the user (us) comes first, is a tangible alternative to the current way the world, digital and otherwise, works"" a representative told CoinDesk.  Compared to Max, HiJack displayed a serious agenda. For nearly a minute he drop-kicked crypto fan boys including those following NEAR, telling them to ""get a real job"" and to give up on this ""web3 trash.""  ""You're gonna trust Solana or Ethereum over household names like Apple and Amazon,"" he asked. ""Gimme a break, dude!""  But HiJack has a point. People really don't trust any crypto network over Apple and Amazon. Not yet, anyway. The number of people who actually live on crypto – entirely separate from the traditional financial and technological system – is vanishingly small.  Is it too early for crypto to make fun of its own struggles for relevance? NEAR seems to at least think it can help drive attendance at the Thailand hackathon, called REDACTED. A representative declined to comment for this story.  At the very least, the fake hack caught people's attention. Emily Lai, an executive at crypto marketing agency Hype, tweeted the gambit increased NEAR's mindshare to its highest levels in three months. But the sentiment was resoundingly negative, she wrote, expressing doubt it would actually help REDACTED. NEAR's price was down around 2% over the past 24 hours as of press time.  Commenters on NEAR's social channels were less diplomatic. Some praised the creative edge. But others chastised the gimmick for its potential to damage NEAR's reputation while delivering little brand upside. Messari pushed a real warning to its markets-intelligence software users warning them that NEAR had actually suffered a hack.  ""There is nothing waiting for you in Thailand,"" wrote one commenter.",NEUTRAL,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | NEAR,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/09/05/a-crypto-projects-weird-marketing-hack-riffed-on-infamous-1987-chicago-tv-hijacking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2bd9880b9da644786edb474d471df584b67bc2b4-2038x1132.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The list of selected projects includes global companies such as Visa, which will work alongside the Brazilian brokerage XP and digital bank Nubank to optimize the foreign exchange market. Spanish banking giant Santander, for its part, was selected to work on a project involving automobile operations and another focused on lending and decarbonization.  The second part of the pilot will include other important local financial entities such as Bradesco, Itaú Unibanco, and the local stock exchange B3.

33228930,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639992,1725564621,"Dogecoin Falls Below Trendline Resistance, Eyes On $0.09149 Breach","Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself in a challenging position as bearish forces continue to dominate the market. Currently trading below a key descending trendline, DOGE faces mounting pressure that could push the price toward the critical $0.09149 support level. With the bearish trendline acting as a formidable resistance, any failure to hold this support could signal further downside movement. This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Dogecoin’s current negative outlook, highlighting its position under the trendline resistance and the potential implications of a breach below the $0.09149 support level. By examining key technical indicators and market sentiment, the article seeks to offer insights into whether DOGE will continue its downward trajectory or find a reversal. With a market capitalization exceeding $14 billion and a trading volume surpassing $471 million, Dogecoin was trading at approximately $0.9683, reflecting a 1% increase at the time of writing. In the past 24 hours, its market cap has risen by 1.01%, while trading volume has declined by 3.71%. Price Action Analysis: Assessing The Downward Pressure On Dogecoin On the 4-hour chart, Dogecoin, trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), is exhibiting consistent bearish momentum. The cryptocurrency is currently consolidating just above the $0.09149 mark. Related Reading: Major Dogecoin Indicator Flashes Bullish, Is It Time To Buy? This consolidation near a critical support level suggests that despite brief attempts to recover, selling pressure remains dominant. If DOGE fails to maintain its position above $0.09149, it could trigger an extended decline, potentially pushing the price lower as bears continue to exert control. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned at 45%, failing to rise above the 50% mark. This failure to gain traction above the midpoint reflects persistent pessimistic momentum, suggesting that downward pressure may continue, as the RSI’s position below 50% reinforces the likelihood of further bearish activity in the market. On the daily chart, Dogecoin is still demonstrating notable bearish movement below the 100-day SMA and the trendline. The cryptocurrency is currently approaching the support level at $0.09149, indicating ongoing downward pressure and the potential for more declines if this support fails to hold. Finally, the RSI signal line on the 1-day chart has fallen to 41%, slipping below the 50% threshold, reflecting a shift in momentum that could lead to additional downward movement in DOGE’s price. Potential Scenarios: What Could Happen If DOGE Breaks $0.09149? If Dogecoin breaches the $0.09149 support level, several scenarios could unfold. A successful break below this key support might intensify the downbeat trend, potentially driving DOGE toward the $0.07456 support range. Should this level be breached, the price could further decrease to test the $0.0559 support mark, and possibly explore even lower support zones. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price (DOGE) Struggles: Can It Overcome the Slump? Conversely, if Dogecoin holds above $0.09149 and reverses its decline, it could indicate a bullish turnaround, which might set the stage for a rally toward the trendline resistance. A successful break above this trendline could trigger a significant uptrend, possibly pushing DOGE toward $0.1293 and beyond.

According to CoinGecko, APT’s current performance is lackluster with the token falling 15% since last week. Related Reading: Investors Lose Sight Of MATIC As It Drops 16% Ahead Of Network Upgrade Meanwhile, Korea Blockchain Week has generated quite a lot of buzz for Aptos. During this event, several on-chain developments have been revealed. Although positive developments on-chain are a great sign of long-term growth for the platform, investors and traders are still struggling to overcome the market’s fear, uncertainty and doubt. Aptos Continues Drive Down Towards $5.74 As of writing, APT bulls have been aiming to wrestle control of the token’s momentum in the short term. However, the bears are pressing their advantage, targeting $5.74 in the short-term timeframe after flipping the $6.12 support to resistance. The market’s continuous downward trajectory is the primary reason for APT’s underperformance. Driven by FUD from the broader financial market that bled to the crypto market, APT might face continued losses in the coming weeks. APT’s relative strength index (RSI) suggests that the token’s downward trajectory will continue well below the $5.74 support level. If this occurs, it might lead to a bigger sell-off localized on APT’s market. This thesis has a larger possibility to occur as CoinGlass notes that short positions outnumber long positions in the past 24 hours further strengthening the token’s bearish trajectory. Investors and traders should monitor the coming release of macro indicators due today. As the markets continue to price in a broader downturn, positive macros will provide the needed boost for both the traditional markets and the crypto market in the long term. Korea Blockchain Week Reveals New Developments On Aptos The Aptos Experience in Korea Blockchain Week continues to garner the attention of the community. Arculus, a digital security platform, has partnered with Aptos for the platform’s Aptos card. This has made tap-to-pay on Aptos possible, improving the utility of the token and the platform itself.

Donald Trump reiterated his promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world if re-elected president during public remarks Thursday,though digital assets only received brief mention in his wide-ranging speech about his economic agenda.  “Instead of attacking industries of the future, we will embrace them, including making America the world capital for crypto and Bitcoin,” Trump told the audience at an Economic Club of New York gathering.  Trump may have a direct role in the industry, himself,as the ""chief crypto advocate"" for a forthcoming crypto project tied to his family, World Liberty Finance.  Read more: Inside the Trump Crypto Project Linked to a $2M DeFi Hack and a Former Pick-Up Artist  During his hour-long speech, Trump laid out his plans to overhaul the U.S. economy if granted a second term, including slashing regulations and promoting increased domestic energy production.  “I will launch a historic campaign to liberate our economy from crippling regulation,” Trump said. “I’m pledging today that in my second term, we will eliminate a minimum of tenfold regulations for every one new regulation.”  Trump added that, if elected, he will immediately issue a national emergency declaration to increase domestic energy production, citing the need for increased electricity to continue growing the artificial intelligence sector and keep the U.S. tech industry competitive with China.  “With these sweeping authorities, we will blast through every bureaucratic hurdle to issue rapid approvals for new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new electric plants and reactors of all types. Prices will fall immediately in anticipation of this tremendous supply that we can create rather quickly, and we will be the leader instead of the laggard,” Trump said.  Trump also said he will take Elon Musk up on his suggestion to create a government efficiency commission tasked with auditing the federal government’s spending and ferreting out waste – as well as his offer to lead it, joking that the owner of X (formerly Twitter) and CEO of Tesla was ""not busy.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/05/trump-promises-to-embrace-industries-of-the-future-including-crypto-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06aefd39543411a6f8443c8d7bc2b10fc87d6dd7-5673x3191.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390429,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1ijv,1725558469,We Need DePIN to Get to Net-Zero Emissions,"Energy equals life. It warms, cools, and lights our homes. It moves the trucks that bring our groceries. It fuels the chips that drive the AI revolution. Energy can be considered a human right, and unless we transition to a zero-emissions economy — energy will kill us.  The foundation of a zero-emissions economy lies in renewable energy sources and it requires a shift in how we consume energy. Unlike fossil fuel-based energy, they do not produce energy on demand, but whenever the sun shines and the wind blows. Therefore, to achieve the net-zero goal ASAP, we must find a way to actively integrate end consumers into the energy market.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  Previous attempts to do this have largely failed. Large municipal utilities paid flat rates to households that were willing to participate in demand response programs where you were essentially expected to shut off your energy-consuming devices when prompted by a centralized signal, often an SMS. But these methods are too imprecise and costly to scale. They struggle because they are implemented within a system that is not designed for the unique demands of renewable energy—a system built over more than a century to accommodate fossil fuels. The fossil system is characterized by deep verticality and bilateral contracts between some hundred players along supply chains that encircle the entire planet. But what we need is a system that is horizontally structured around locally-produced energy, multilaterally shared between billions producers and active consumers.  The power of the community  History proves that it can be done. At the dawn of the electricity era, power grids were strictly a city thing, as rural areas lacked the infrastructure to go connected and weren’t profitable enough for electricity providers due to their sparse population. Therefore, many communities around the world build the required infrastructure themselves, organizing in decentralized cooperatives. Citizens were incentivised to join because they directly reaped the benefits of this new infrastructure.  As our use of fossil fuels accelerated, we began consuming these resources at a rate far exceeding their natural formation, burning in a single year what took millions of years to accumulate in the Earth's crust. This caused the energy industry to become increasingly complex, and consumers increasingly detached from the origin and impact of their energy use.  In the future, stabilizing the energy system will rely less on physical and more on virtual infrastructure, i.e. the real-time exchange of information among all market participants. And once again, the infrastructure to realize this is not in place.  As we stand on the threshold of a climate disaster, it’s time to flex the power of the community once again. There’s no point in looking up to Big Energy or ever-bickering governments — in this story, the everyman is the hero. And the good news is, this time we have the technology that marries the power-to-the-people approach with the borderless scale Big Energy can only dream of.  DePIN to the rescue  The solution is called DePIN, or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks. DePINs are “decentralized applications that use tokens to incentivise communities to build physical infrastructure networks (think mobility, electric vehicle charging, telecoms etc.) from the ground up.”  They are uniquely suited to address the complexities of the modern energy landscape.  Unlike traditional systems, DePINs are not constrained by the limitations of centralized control. They operate on a blockchain-based framework that incentivizes participation through cryptographic tokens, ensuring that every contributor, whether a homeowner with solar panels or a small business with battery storage, can participate in the energy market and be rewarded for their contributions.  This decentralized approach facilitates a more resilient and flexible energy system, where supply and demand can be balanced in real-time. The crucial components here are connected devices — smart fridges, smart ACs, smart anything you have at home (no, your pets don’t count) — and the anonymised data of all network participants. When the grid is struggling, individual households can automatically amp up or down their use of electricity, thus helping make the overall grid more resilient, and get token rewards through trustless smart contracts.  DePINs can also enable peer-to-peer energy trading, where excess energy generated by one participant can be sold directly to another, bypassing traditional utility companies. This not only reduces output waste but also democratizes energy access, allowing individuals to take control of their energy usage and contribute to the overall stability of the grid.  The success of the Helium Network in building a decentralized wireless network and the Silencio Network in environmental monitoring demonstrates the potential of DePINs beyond the energy sector. These networks have rapidly scaled by incentivizing users to contribute to the network’s infrastructure, proving that a decentralized model can work on a large scale.  In the energy sector, similar principles can be applied to create a decentralized energy grid. Networks like Combinder.io serve as a prime example of an energy DePIN that connects consumers and producers in a seamless, tokenized ecosystem. By leveraging existing household equipment such as smart meters, solar panels, and battery storage, this network allows users to participate in demand response programs and peer-to-peer trading, unlocking new revenue streams and contributing to a more sustainable energy system.  The Stakes Are High  The implications of not embracing DePINs in the energy sector are severe. Without a decentralized approach, the energy transition will continue to face significant obstacles, from inefficient resource allocation to the inability to fully integrate renewable energy sources. This could lead to continued reliance on fossil fuels, further exacerbating the climate crisis.  The path to a sustainable, zero-emissions future is clear: we must transform our energy system to empower individuals and communities to take an active role and accelerate the energy transition.  In addition to the significant benefits for the health of our planet, this approach will also create enormous economic opportunities. A decentralized network that enables the efficient exchange of energy can unlock billions of dollars in value. It provides strong incentives for households and businesses to invest in renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies, ensuring that the financial rewards are equitably distributed across society.  Energy is the lifeblood of modern society, and how we manage it will determine our future. DePINs offer the most promising path forward, enabling us to meet our net-zero goals while creating a more equitable and resilient energy system for all. It's time to take the energy back into our own hands.

The Yen recently surged against the US dollar, suggesting that investors are still selling riskier assets like these cryptocurrencies to unwind their carry trade positions, which utilized the low-yielding Yen. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Behavior Reminiscent Of 2019 As BTC Remains Below $60,000 In an X (formerly Twitter) post, hedge fund manager James Lavish also suggested that the effects of the Yen carry trade was still in play. He noted that the Nikkei 225 had dropped by 3.7% while the USD/Yen trading pair was heading lower. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) Kazuo Ueda also recently made a hawkish statement that they will continue to hike rates if the economy and prices continue to perform as expected. This has also sparked fear among traders and prompted them to close their carry trade positions, thereby putting more selling pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin and Ethereum suffered major losses during the August 5 market crash, which was caused by the BOJ’s decision to hike interest rates for the second time since 2007. Bitcoin, on its part, dropped below $50,000, while Ethereum dropped to as low as $2,200. As such, with the effects of the Yen carry trade still in play and the BOJ hinting at more rate hikes, Bitcoin and Ethereum risk suffering further price declines. US Stock Market Crash Contributes To Bitcoin And Ethereum’s Fall Furthermore, Bitcoin and Ethereum’s correlation with the US stock market has also contributed to their price crash since the beginning of September. Specifically, on September 3, over $1.05 million was wiped out from the stock market, which also sparked fear in the crypto market and led to a wave of sell-offs for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Data from Farside investors showed that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed total net outflows of $287.8 million and $47.4 million, respectively. With such a bearish outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum, there is an urgent need for a spark that could provide bullish momentum for the crypto market. Crypto community members are hoping that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the next FOMC meeting set to be held between September 17 and 18, as that will provide some relief to the market and help inject more liquidity into Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading at around $57,160 and $2,400, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Meanwhile, the buzz around Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme-based cryptocurrency with immense potential, has been growing stronger. This shift has led to an influx of whales moving towards Mpeppe, which is now positioned for staggering gains. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Strength to Strength As Sui Network struggles to maintain its momentum, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a beacon of hope for investors seeking high returns. Mpeppe, a meme-based cryptocurrency, has completed 97% of its Stage 3 presale and is now in Stage 4. With over $1.84 million raised and a current price of $0.0021 USDT per MPEPE token, the coin is rapidly gaining traction. Mpeppe’s success can be attributed to its innovative approach, combining meme culture with real-world utility, particularly in the gaming and casino sectors. The promise of significant gains, potentially up to 1000x, has attracted not only retail investors but also crypto whales looking to capitalize on this new sensation. Sui Network’s Recent Developments and Challenges Sui Network has been gaining traction with its advanced transaction speed and growing Total Value Locked (TVL). The network’s impressive $600 million surge in TVL indicates increased confidence and engagement from the crypto community. The surge in TVL has had a positive impact on SUI’s price, with bullish indicators suggesting further potential for gains. Despite these promising developments, SUI holders have recently faced challenges. The SUI/USDT trading pair broke above its hourly downtrend channel, hinting at a potential shift in market momentum. However, the recent 2.6% loss has raised concerns among investors, leading them to explore alternative opportunities. Head to HeadSui: (SUI) vs. Mpeppe (MPEPE) The contrasting fortunes of Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlight the diverse strategies investors employ in the cryptocurrency market. While SUI has focused on technological advancements and increasing TVL, it has struggled to maintain its value in the face of market pressures. The recent price drop has left SUI holders searching for more stable and lucrative opportunities. On the other hand, Mpeppe’s community-driven approach and viral marketing have positioned it as a top contender in the meme coin space. With the completion of 97% of its Stage 3 presale and the anticipation of a 1000x gain, Mpeppe has attracted a significant influx of whales. This shift reflects a broader trend in the market, where investors are increasingly drawn to projects that offer quick returns and high potential for growth. Mpeppe and Sui Network Looking Ahead As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain momentum, the question remains whether it can sustain its rapid rise and deliver on its promise of 1000x gains. The upcoming launch on major exchanges is expected to further boost its visibility and attract even more investors. For Sui Network (SUI), the focus will likely shift to reinforcing its technological edge and rebuilding investor confidence. The network’s recent surge in TVL is a positive sign, but the challenge lies in translating this into sustained price growth and market stability. Sum Up The recent developments in the cryptocurrency market underscore the importance of adaptability and strategic investment. While Sui (SUI) has made significant strides in terms of technological advancements, it faces challenges in maintaining its market position. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured the imagination of investors with its potential for exponential gains. As the market continues to evolve, the fortunes of these two tokens will be closely watched by the crypto community, with Mpeppe currently leading the charge towards the next big opportunity.

This time, the self-made millionaire has set his sights on a new meme coin, one that’s been gaining rapid traction: Mpeppe (MPEPE). As the world of cryptocurrency continues to surprise and excite, this latest move has the crypto community buzzing with anticipation. The PepeCoin Success Story The story of how Pepe Coin skyrocketed to fame is nothing short of legendary. Launched as a meme coin with little initial expectation, Pepe Coin quickly gained a cult following. Thanks to its playful theme and the power of internet culture, Pepe Coin became a sensation, drawing in investors looking for the next big thing. One such investor was a Texas-based crypto enthusiast who, with a keen eye for potential, invested $5,000 in Pepe Coin at just the right moment. As Pepe Coin’s popularity soared, so did its value. Within months, the Texas investor’s $5,000 investment ballooned to an astonishing $400,000. The success story became a talking point in the crypto world, illustrating how meme coins, despite their playful nature, can yield serious returns if the timing is right. Enter Mpeppe: The Next Big Thing? Now, with the Texas millionaire having liquidated a portion of his Pepe Coin holdings, he’s reinvesting in a new meme coin that’s capturing the imagination of the crypto community: Mpeppe (MPEPE). Positioned as the spiritual successor to Pepe Coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) combines the viral appeal of its predecessor with new and exciting features that promise to take the meme coin concept to the next level. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique selling point is its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and its upcoming launch of a crypto casino. These features have not only differentiated Mpeppe (MPEPE) from other meme coins but have also attracted a wave of interest from investors eager to capitalize on its potential. Why Mpeppe?

33223636,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640125,1725552047,Bullish on Ethereum? Here’s Why This Layer-2 Meme Is Skyrocketing Past it’s Competitors,"The cryptocurrency landscape is dynamic and often unpredictable, with major players like Ethereum (ETH) frequently influencing market sentiment. Despite recent struggles, Ethereum remains a key pillar in the crypto world, and its ongoing developments continue to shape the future of digital assets. But while Ethereum’s trajectory is being closely monitored by investors, another digital asset is rapidly making waves—Mpeppe (MPEPE), a Layer-2 meme coin that’s soaring past its competitors and capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Layer-2 Meme Coin Stealing the Spotlight Amidst Ethereum’s struggles, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a Layer-2 meme coin, has been defying broader market trends. Built on Ethereum’s robust infrastructure, Mpeppe has capitalized on the meme coin craze while offering unique benefits that have helped it rise above its competitors. Mpeppe’s recent success can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, it leverages Ethereum’s scalability solutions, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. This Layer-2 integration has made Mpeppe not just another meme coin, but one with real utility in the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming sectors. Moreover, Mpeppe’s community-driven approach and viral marketing strategies have created a strong and loyal following, contributing to its meteoric rise. The coin’s presale has been a massive success, with Stage 4 currently in progress and raising over $1.84 million. Investors are eagerly snapping up Mpeppe tokens, with the price set at $0.0021 USDT per token. This enthusiasm is fueled by Mpeppe’s potential for massive returns, particularly as Ethereum’s infrastructure improvements could further enhance Mpeppe’s performance. Ethereum: Jumping Hurdles Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has faced significant hurdles in recent months. After the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs, many expected ETH to skyrocket. However, the reality has been somewhat disappointing, with the price dropping by around 30% since the ETFs were introduced. This downturn has left many investors questioning the immediate future of Ethereum, even as long-term prospects remain bullish. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas recently expressed optimism, suggesting that Ethereum’s bottom may have been reached, and the much-anticipated $3,000 mark could be closer than previously thought. With ETH currently hovering above a strong support line just north of $2,300, and with a noticeable reduction in ETH availability on crypto exchanges, the stage seems set for a potential recovery. As the market begins to stabilize, there’s growing speculation that Ethereum could regain its momentum, possibly even driving other Ethereum-based tokens to new heights. Why Mpeppe Is Outpacing all it’s Rivals While Ethereum (ETH) slowly regains its footing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making strides that set it apart from other meme coins. The key to Mpeppe’s success lies in its ability to tap into the excitement around Layer-2 solutions, providing users with a faster, more efficient experience. This advantage is particularly appealing as Ethereum continues to refine its scalability and transaction speed, making Mpeppe a standout in the crowded meme coin space. Moreover, Mpeppe’s success is not just built on hype. Its integration with Ethereum’s Layer-2 solutions has given it a technical edge, allowing it to offer real utility and value to its users. This has attracted not only retail investors but also larger players in the crypto space, who see Mpeppe as a viable investment with strong growth potential. Meme vs Utility: Mpeppe and Ethereum As Ethereum (ETH) works to overcome its current challenges and aims for the $3,000 mark, Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to thrive, showing that the meme coin phenomenon is far from over. The success of Mpeppe highlights the growing interest in Layer-2 solutions and the potential for meme coins to offer more than just entertainment value. Looking ahead, both Ethereum and Mpeppe are poised for significant developments. If Ethereum can stabilize and resume its upward trajectory, it could further boost the performance of Mpeppe and other Ethereum-based tokens. Meanwhile, Mpeppe’s unique position in the market and its strong community support suggest that it will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in the crypto world. In conclusion, while Ethereum remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is proving that there’s plenty of room for innovation and growth, particularly for those who can harness the power of Layer-2 technology and community-driven engagement. As the crypto market evolves, investors will undoubtedly keep a close eye on both of these exciting assets.

33223634,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640123,1725552039,Battle Of The PEPE: Mpeppe Gets Stamp Of Approval From PepeCoin Community After Casino Announcement,"The world of meme coins is never short on drama and competition, and recently, a new player has emerged to challenge the dominance of Pepecoin (PEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising star in the meme coin universe, has been making waves with its innovative approach and strong community support. After the recent announcement of its upcoming casino feature, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has gained significant traction, even earning the approval of the Pepecoin (PEPE) community. As these two meme coins vie for supremacy, the battle between Pepecoin (PEPE) and MPEPE is heating up. Pepecoin’s At A Resistance Level Pepecoin (PEPE) has been a well-known name in the meme coin market, enjoying strong support from large investors and a dedicated community. However, recent performance metrics indicate that Pepecoin (PEPE) is facing challenges. Despite a 5% increase in holdings by significant investors, the coin has struggled to break past key resistance levels, hovering around $0.00000785. This stagnation has led to concerns about whether Pepecoin (PEPE) can sustain its momentum or if its best days are behind it. Analysts believe that if Pepecoin (PEPE) can overcome the current resistance level of $0.00000836, it could see a substantial price increase of up to 68%. However, the risk remains that the price could fall back to around $0.00000700 if it fails to break through, which would further complicate its outlook. For now, Pepecoin (PEPE) remains in a precarious position, with its future heavily dependent on its ability to regain traction among retail traders. Mpeppe’s Casino Announcement: A Game Changer Amidst Pepecoin’s (PEPE) struggles, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been rapidly gaining attention, especially after its recent announcement to launch a crypto casino. This move has not only excited its existing community but has also caught the eye of the broader meme coin market, including supporters of Pepecoin (PEPE). The innovative casino feature is expected to provide Mpeppe (MPEPE) with a unique utility, setting it apart from other meme coins that rely solely on hype. The upcoming casino will allow Mpeppe (MPEPE) holders to use their tokens in a variety of games, creating a new avenue for engagement and potential earnings. This feature is seen as a major step forward in adding real-world utility to the meme coin, something that has often been lacking in the sector. The anticipation around this launch has led to a surge in Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s value, with analysts predicting that it could challenge Pepecoin (PEPE)’s market cap upon its official release. The Pepecoin Community’s Response What’s particularly interesting is the response from the Pepecoin (PEPE) community. Despite being competitors, many in the Pepecoin (PEPE) community have shown support for Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s new initiative. This cross-community approval is rare in the fiercely competitive world of meme coins, where rivalries often dominate the narrative. The endorsement from Pepecoin (PEPE)’s supporters has given Mpeppe (MPEPE) a significant credibility boost, further fueling its momentum. The Battle for Market Dominance As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to rise, the question on everyone’s mind is whether it can surpass Pepecoin (PEPE) in market cap and become the new leader in the meme coin space. With its casino feature poised to launch, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has a strong chance of attracting a broader audience and increasing its market share. However, Pepecoin (PEPE)’s established presence and loyal investor base should not be underestimated. The next few months will be crucial for both coins. Pepecoin (PEPE) needs to overcome its current hurdles and re-engage with retail traders to maintain its position. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) must capitalize on its recent momentum and deliver on the promises of its casino feature to continue its upward trajectory. Conclusion The battle between Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is shaping up to be one of the most exciting rivalries in the meme coin market. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) gaining the approval of the Pepecoin (PEPE) community and its casino feature set to launch, it has positioned itself as a serious contender for the top spot. Whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) can ultimately challenge and surpass Pepecoin (PEPE) remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the meme coin market is more dynamic and competitive than ever. As both coins navigate their respective paths, investors and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely to see which one emerges as the true leader.

33223582,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640128,1725552029,"Mpeppe Defi Casino Perks Appetite Of Aave (AAVE) Investors, Analyst Anticipate Turbocharge Tier-1 Listings","The cryptocurrency market never ceases to surprise, with significant shifts and trends emerging seemingly overnight. Recently, a massive sell-off of Aave (AAVE) tokens by a prominent whale caught the attention of the entire crypto community. This sudden move has sparked discussions and speculations about the future of Aave, especially as more investors turn their gaze towards the rising star, Mpeppe (MPEPE). As Mpeppe continues to gain momentum with its DeFi casino offerings, analysts are predicting a potential turbocharge in its value with anticipated Tier-1 exchange listings. Aave (AAVE) Whale Takes a $2.14M Loss In a surprising development, a significant early investor in Aave (AAVE), often referred to as a “whale,” liquidated their entire holdings of 17,447 AAVE tokens. This sale, valued at approximately $2.16 million, marked a substantial financial loss, as the whale’s average purchase price was around $246 per AAVE token, amounting to an initial investment of approximately $4.3 million. The result? A staggering $2.14 million loss. The decision by this AAVE whale to sell off their entire position has left the community speculating about the motivations behind such a drastic move. Given the substantial loss, the sell-off could be seen as a reaction to broader market sentiment or personal financial strategies. Whatever the reasons, this move has undoubtedly added pressure on AAVE’s market price, contributing to further declines. It has been reported that a fraction of the holdings was allocated in Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE) and DeFi Casino Appeal to The Masses As Aave (AAVE) faces challenges, mpeppe has been quietly building its momentum. The meme-based cryptocurrency, which recently completed 97% of its Stage 3 presale, is now in Stage 4, with over $1.84 million raised. What sets Mpeppe apart is its unique DeFi casino offering, which has captured the interest of both retail investors and whales alike. The DeFi casino model allows Mpeppe (MPEPE) to offer more than just speculative value; it provides real-world utility in the form of gaming and gambling platforms. This innovation has perked the appetite of Aave (AAVE) investors who are looking for new opportunities with higher potential returns. With the possibility of 1000x gains, Mpeppe is positioned as a top contender in the meme coin space. Market Sentiment and the Impact on Aave (AAVE) Pricing The broader market sentiment surrounding Aave (AAVE) and the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector may have influenced the whale’s decision. Aave has experienced considerable price volatility in recent months, reflecting the ups and downs of the wider crypto market. Concerns about regulatory crackdowns, shifts in investor interest, and overall market uncertainty may have prompted the whale to cut their losses and explore other opportunities such as Mpeppe. Despite this, Aave (AAVE) remains one of the most robust platforms in the DeFi space. Its features, such as flash loans, staking, and governance, continue to attract users and developers alike. The whale’s exit, while significant, does not necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the platform itself but may reflect the individual investor’s strategy in a volatile market. Analysts Anticipate Turbocharge Tier-1 Listings for Mpeppe (MPEPE) With Mpeppe (MPEPE) rapidly gaining traction, analysts are anticipating that its upcoming Tier-1 exchange listings could turbocharge its value. The combination of its DeFi casino model and strong community support makes it a formidable player in the cryptocurrency market. The recent influx of whales, including those previously invested in Aave (AAVE), is a testament to the growing confidence in Mpeppe’s potential. The potential for Mpeppe to achieve significant gains is drawing comparisons to other successful meme coins that have dominated the market in the past. However, Mpeppe’s focus on utility and real-world application sets it apart, providing a solid foundation for long-term growth. A Turning Point for Aave (AAVE) and a New Chapter for Mpeppe (MPEPE) The recent developments highlight the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Aave (AAVE) remains a strong platform within the DeFi space, its recent challenges have led investors to explore alternative opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE). With its innovative DeFi casino model and the potential for significant returns, Mpeppe is quickly becoming a favored choice among investors. As we look ahead, the anticipated Tier-1 exchange listings could mark a new chapter for Mpeppe, potentially turbocharging its value and solidifying its position as a leader in the meme coin space.

The FCA has been overseeing the crypto sector in the U.K. and registering firms under its anti-money laundering rules since 2020.  The U.K.'s financial regulator said a full 87% of crypto companies that applied for licensing under the country's money laundering rules failed to win approval in its most recent fiscal year.  Only four of the 35 applications received by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) managed to qualify in the 12 months ended March 31, it said in its annual report. Among those successfully registering were Binance's payments partner, BNXA, a PayPal U.K. unit and Komainu, a crypto custody joint venture of Nomura. The rest were either refused a license or rejected for lacking key components needed for assessment.  ""Over 87% of crypto registrations were rejected, withdrawn or refused,"" the FCA said. ""We help firms applying for authorisation by communicating our expectations and issuing guidance on good and poor practice. This is helping firms understand what is required – 44 crypto firms now have money laundering registration.""  The FCA has been overseeing the crypto sector and registering firms under its anti-money laundering rules since 2020. The regulator is waiting for legislation that will enable it to actually authorize companies to operate in the country. It may have to wait longer. The new Labour government elected in July paused crypto plans.  Since January 2020, the FCA has received 359 applications from crypto companies and only 44 companies are registered.  Some of the companies that didn’t end up receiving full FCA approval say the registration process was made difficult by long wait times, a lack of feedback and – as some described – unfair treatment by the regulator, CoinDesk reported last year. The lengthy waits have prompted some crypto companies to leave the country to seek registration elsewhere and serve U.K. customers from abroad.

42390433,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1izJ,1725550654,Bitcoin Flounders Ahead of Friday Jobs Report That Might Push Fed to Slash Rates by 50 Basis Points,"Tomorrow's August jobs report is likely to go a long way to determining the size of the upcoming Fed rate cut  Fed easing cycles are normally associated with good things for bitcoin, but not so much this time around  The U.S. government tomorrow will release its Nonfarm Payrolls Report for the month of August in what will be one of the final economic data points for the Federal Reserve to ponder prior to its rate-setting meeting later this month.  Economists are forecasting the U.S. to have added 160,000 jobs in August, up from July's soft 114,000 print. The unemployment rate is seen edging down to 4.2% from 4.3%. While a stronger-than-expected or even in line report is likely to result in the Fed just cutting its benchmark fed funds rate by 25 basis points, a soft number will surely have traders rushing to price in a 50 basis points move.  The balance of economic news this week – the ISM Manufacturing PMI, the Fed's Beige Book and the ADP August jobs report – so far has leaned soft, amping up the idea that the Fed might go for a bolder path of policy easing. According to CME FedWatch, there's a 44% chance of a 50 basis point rate cut vs a 34% one week ago.  Whither bitcoin?  There was a point in time not long ago when a speedy pace of monetary ease was thought to be a major positive catalyst for bitcoin {{BTC}} prices. The original crypto, after all, was invented during the global financial crisis more than 15 years ago alongside the Fed's rush to cut rates to 0% and pump hundreds of billions of freshly minted dollars into the economy.  Then the Fed's 2020 Covid-era push to again slash rates/pump money took bitcoin in the course of less than one year from a sleepy, fringy property into a $1 trillion asset class.  This coming easing cycle, though, is thus far generating zero enthusiasm for taking prices higher. Each signal over the past several weeks that rate cuts were coming has resulted in only a momentary break from bitcoin's downtrend. At the current $56,300, bitcoin is lower by 5% over the last month and off more than 23% from a record high above $73,500 touched six months ago.  Quinn Thompson, CIO of hedge fund Lekker Capital this morning was speaking about traditional markets, but it may as well have been bitcoin: ""Every single piece of economic data this week has been weak,"" he wrote. ""Conviction is rising in a 50 bps Fed cut in September. But you've been burned too badly for the past 6 months to press the buy button.""

42390439,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1jU5,1725550462,"Telegram Is Driving Crypto Adoption, Despite Bad News","Telegram’s long-standing ethos of openness and free speech, hence the paper plane as its logo, has landed the messaging platform and CEO Pavel Durov in legal trouble. Yet, it’s important to remember that the global digital freedom Telegram enables has now also boosted real crypto adoption.  Blink if you’ve missed it, but Web3 – the idea that users can have digital ownership powered by cryptography, blockchain and digital assets – is happening on Telegram, and in a major way. Web3 is now available on anyone’s smartphone. It’s a hugely positive development somewhat ignored by all the recent, mostly negative, news surrounding Telegram.  Crypto payments come alive  Telegram's use as an avenue for crypto adoption can be attributed to the rise of The Open Network (TON) blockchain. With over 950 million users, Telegram is one of the world’s most popular messaging apps and digital communities. TON's blockchain was brought back to life by its community after it had to contend with SEC enforcement back in 2020 - and it is now flourishing.  How is this happening? Telegram, a separate company from the protocol-level work being done by The Open Network Foundation, began to integrate TON’s blockchain into its app. The availability of Toncoin payments for in-app advertising and stablecoin integration first occurred back in April 2024.  The number of transactions on TON’s blockchain over the past six months. Source:TON Stat  Usage of TON’s blockchain, based on the number of transactions, has grown since these crypto-friendly features were added to Telegram. According to data aggregator TON Stat, since payments and stablecoins became available in April 2024, TON on-chain transactions have been above 3.5 million per day, on average.  Unpacking Web3  With Web3 technologies, cumbersome middlemen like banks have less of a constricting stranglehold on financial access, empowering anyone with a smartphone. This is what makes Web3 a powerful concept - it can enable many who might be financially underserved to have a seat at the table.  Telegram ""mini-apps"" – third-party software within the app itself - is a big driver of TON’s transaction activity. Users are interacting, competing and earning rewards for regular engagement in many mini-app games. This has been a significant driver of economic activity on TON. For example, a play-to-earn game called Lost Dogs contributed to the spike of over 13.5 million transactions (shown in the chart above) that occurred at the end of August.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - What Hamster Kombat Did: How Telegram Built a Web3 Gaming Juggernaut  This isn’t classic crypto airdrop hunters or mercenary capital participating. It’s mostly ordinary users accessing games because they want to – because they’re fun. Admittedly, games like Lost Dogs may not be revolutionary. But the engagement some of these are games experiencing, in the millions, is primary proof Web3 has arrived – and Telegram is a conduit.  TON is capable of higher throughput than most blockchains thanks to a unique design that uses “workchains” to process a high number of transactions. But during the Lost Dogs airdrop of its DOGS token, validators on TON using older hardware struggled to keep up, leading to two outages. This has provided insight into the load (and revamped validator rules for TON) required to onboard large quantities of consumers backed by a consensus blockchain system.  Mass adoption is not without its own set of problems for scaling crypto, and those who have been working in the industry for some time have long been aware of this. Technically scaling crypto to millions upon millions of users has largely been stymied for user growth – until Telegram and TON.  Telegram natives to crypto natives  Games like Lost Dogs, Hamster Kombat and the Elon Musk-themed X Empire within the Telegram ecosystem are onboarding millions to crypto. Many users don’t realize it or even care. Getting people’s attention via gaming isn’t revolutionary. But Telegram games are a source for mass adoption without having to onboard heavy crypto concepts at the start. Most of the world simply does not care a lick about brain-fuzzy intricacies like private keys, paying for gas and staking.  And that's fine, because mini-app users predominantly aren’t crypto natives - rather, they’re Telegram natives. These users talk to their friends on Telegram, stay updated with topics they like via groups and they play mini-app games on their phone. Then, the rewards stage ""airdrop"" arrives for these popular games and users are distributed what they have earned. DOGS, for example, now has a tail-wagging market capitalization of over $500 million according to CoinGecko.

The investigation was prompted by numerous consumer complaints regarding Robinhood’s practices, particularly its handling of cryptocurrency withdrawals and trading. Alleged Violations And Settlement Revealed According to the DOJ, Robinhood violated the California Commodities Law (CCL) by enabling customers to purchase cryptocurrencies without delivering these assets to them, effectively selling commodities contracts without adhering to legal requirements. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says The Bitcoin ‘Summer Chop’ Is Nearing Its End, Here’s Why During the specified period, customers could not withdraw their cryptocurrencies and were forced to sell their holdings back to Robinhood to exit the platform. California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated: This settlement should send a strong message: Whether you’re a brick-and-mortar store or a cryptocurrency company, you must adhere to California’s consumer and investor protection laws. The investigation alleged that Robinhood misled customers about its trading practices. The DOJ claims that the platform promoted itself as connecting users to multiple trading venues to ensure competitive pricing, but the DOJ found that this was not consistently accurate. Additionally, Robinhood claimed that it held all customer-owned cryptocurrencies, failing to disclose instances where third-party trading venues held these assets for extended periods. Robinhood Measures Post-Settlement As part of the settlement, Robinhood has agreed to several measures aimed at improving transparency and customer trust. Customers will now be permitted to withdraw their cryptocurrency assets to their own wallets. Additionally, Robinhood must ensure that its written communications accurately reflect its actual trading and order handling practices. The company will also provide clear information regarding its custody of cryptocurrencies.

However, recent developments and market sentiments have cast a shadow over its future. With the recent Chang Hard Fork, Cardano (ADA) aims to enhance its governance model, but some experts, including Adam Back, predict a further 90% drop in ADA’s price. As investors grapple with these predictions, many are turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new meme coin that is rapidly gaining traction. Cardano (ADA)’s Chang Hard Fork: A New Era of Governance Cardano (ADA), developed by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, is a decentralized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain designed to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications. The recent Chang Hard Fork is a significant milestone in Cardano (ADA)’s evolution, introducing on-chain governance that allows ADA holders to participate directly in network decisions. This upgrade is a crucial part of Cardano (ADA)’s final development phase, known as the “Voltaire” era. The Chang Hard Fork introduces CIP-1694, a governance framework that includes a constitution committee, delegated representatives (dReps), and Stake Pool Operators (SPOs). These entities will oversee and vote on network decisions, paving the way for Cardano (ADA) to become a fully decentralized, community-driven blockchain. The Challenges Facing Cardano (ADA) Despite these advancements, Cardano (ADA) is facing significant challenges. The ADA price has been on a downward trajectory, reflecting growing concerns among investors. The open interest in ADA has dropped by 63% since August, reaching a nine-month low of $227 million. This decline indicates that traders are closing their positions, a sign of waning confidence in ADA’s short-term prospects. Moreover, the demand for short positions on ADA has increased, further highlighting the bearish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency. The financing rate for ADA has turned negative, suggesting that more traders expect the price to fall rather than rise. As of now, ADA is trading around $0.33, with market indicators showing a lack of momentum that could push the price higher. Adam Back’s Grim Prediction for ADA Adding to the pessimism, renowned crypto expert Adam Back has predicted that ADA could see a further 90% drop in value. Such a decline would be catastrophic for Cardano (ADA), wiping out much of its market capitalization and leaving investors in a precarious position. While the Chang Hard Fork and the move towards decentralized governance are positive developments, they may not be enough to counteract the broader market forces and sentiment driving ADA’s price down. Why Investors Are Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) In light of these developments, many Cardano (ADA) investors are looking for alternative opportunities to safeguard their portfolios. One such opportunity that has caught the eye of the crypto community is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new meme coin that is quickly becoming a favorite among investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin; it’s a project with a robust ecosystem centered around decentralized gaming and NFTs. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) casino platform, in particular, has generated significant interest, offering players and investors alike the chance to earn rewards through its gaming model. This combination of entertainment and profit potential is attracting investors who are disillusioned with traditional cryptocurrencies like ADA. The Growing Appeal of Mpeppe The early success of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale has demonstrated strong market demand, with many analysts predicting that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could outperform established cryptocurrencies in the coming months. Unlike ADA, which is struggling to maintain its value, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh and exciting alternative that taps into the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming. For Cardano (ADA) investors, the shift to Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a strategic move to mitigate potential losses and capitalize on a project with high growth potential. With the ongoing uncertainty surrounding ADA’s price, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach and strong community support make it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their crypto holdings. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Investors While Cardano (ADA)’s future remains uncertain, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a leading player in the meme coin space, with the potential to deliver impressive gains for early adopters. As the crypto market continues to evolve, projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) could very well represent the next wave of innovation and opportunity for savvy investors.

33222110,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640103,1725548438,Solana (SOL): Top Analyst Predicts SOL Under $100 As Solana (SOL) Traders Enter Upcoming Casino Giant,"Solana (SOL), once hailed as a top contender in the blockchain space, is facing a tough year. The price of Solana (SOL) has been on a downward trajectory, with the latest reports indicating a potential fall below the critical $100 mark. As Solana (SOL) struggles to maintain its market position, many SOL traders are looking for new opportunities to recover their losses, and the emerging casino giant Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming their go-to alternative. Solana (SOL)’s Struggle: A Bearish Trend Solana (SOL) has been under immense pressure in recent months. The price of SOL has consistently dropped, with the latest decline pushing it below $130. This downward trend has been exacerbated by Bitcoin’s fall under $57K, which has triggered a broader sell-off in the altcoin market. Solana (SOL)’s price has now entered an eight-day bearish trend, with a minor 4.98% recovery earlier this week offering little relief. Technical indicators are not looking favorable for Solana (SOL) either. The 50-day EMA is trending downwards and is on the verge of crossing below the 200-day EMA, a bearish signal that could indicate further declines. The RSI also shows only a minor bullish divergence, suggesting that any recovery might be short-lived. Solana (SOL)’s total network fees have plummeted, dropping from $1.83 million in early August to just $578K. This decline in network activity reflects a weakening demand for SOL tokens and hints at potential trouble ahead for the blockchain. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Crypto Gem As Solana (SOL)’s prospects dim, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is shining brightly on the horizon. This new meme coin, with a unique twist towards the online gaming and casino industry, is rapidly gaining popularity among crypto traders. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a meme—it’s a powerful contender in the burgeoning blockchain-based gaming sector, offering investors a chance to ride the wave of a 100x potential return. The tokenomics of Mpeppe (MPEPE) are designed to ensure steady growth, with a limited supply and mechanisms to burn tokens regularly, thereby increasing scarcity and value. Additionally, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s staking options allow investors to earn passive income, making it an attractive alternative to SOL for those seeking both short-term gains and long-term stability. Why Solana (SOL) Traders Are Flocking to Mpeppe The sharp decline in Solana (SOL)’s price, coupled with its weakening network activity, has made many SOL holders wary of continued investment. With the risk of Solana (SOL) dropping below $100, these traders are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a safer and potentially more lucrative alternative. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its innovative approach to the meme coin market. Unlike traditional meme coins, which rely purely on hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) integrates real-world utility through its casino platform. This gives the token a solid foundation for growth, driven by actual demand rather than speculative trading. Furthermore, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s entry into the online gaming market, valued at over $500 billion annually, positions it for massive growth. As more users flock to its platform, the demand for Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens is expected to surge, driving up the price and providing substantial returns for early investors. The Future of Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe While Solana (SOL) is not out of the game yet, the current market conditions suggest that it will continue to face challenges in the near term. If SOL fails to hold above the $120 support level, a drop to $110 or even $100 seems likely. In a worst-case scenario, SOL could dip as low as $85-$80, representing a significant loss for investors who bought in during the bull market. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is just beginning its journey. With strong presale numbers and a clear growth strategy, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to become a major player in the crypto world. For SOL traders looking to hedge their bets, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling opportunity to diversify their portfolios and potentially recover from Solana (SOL)’s recent losses. In conclusion, while Solana (SOL)’s future remains uncertain, the rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides a beacon of hope for those seeking new investment opportunities. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach and strong market potential make it a standout choice for savvy investors.

After weeks of struggling to maintain its position above the $130 mark, Solana (SOL) finally succumbed to bearish pressures, dropping below this critical level. As SOL faces continued downward momentum, top analysts are turning their attention to the Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale, a new meme coin that’s making waves in the crypto community. Could Mpeppe be the answer for investors looking for the next big opportunity? Let’s dive into the details. Solana (SOL)’s Struggles: What’s Happening with SOL? Solana (SOL) has been one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in recent years, thanks to its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and robust ecosystem. However, 2024 has been a challenging year for SOL. After reaching a peak of over $200 earlier this year, Solana (SOL)’s price has been on a steady decline. The drop below $130 is the latest in a series of setbacks for the cryptocurrency, as it continues to face selling pressure from bears. Several factors have contributed to Solana (SOL)’s recent struggles. The overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market has played a significant role, with Bitcoin and other major altcoins also experiencing declines. Additionally, Solana (SOL) has faced technical challenges, including network outages and scalability issues, which have raised concerns among investors about the platform’s long-term viability. Top Analyst’s Take on Solana (SOL)’s Future One of the top crypto analysts, widely followed on social media platforms, recently shared his insights on Solana (SOL)’s price action. According to him, the break below $130 is a critical juncture for SOL. The analyst pointed out that Solana (SOL) has been unable to break out of its bearish trend despite multiple attempts, indicating that further declines could be on the horizon. The analyst also highlighted the importance of the $120 support level, which has acted as a stronghold for SOL in the past. If Solana (SOL) fails to hold this level, the next target could be the psychological $100 mark, which would represent a significant decline from its current price. However, the analyst also noted that a rebound could occur if Solana (SOL) manages to regain momentum and break back above $130, potentially setting the stage for a recovery in the latter part of the year. Mpeppe: A New Opportunity for Investors While Solana (SOL) continues to face challenges, another crypto project is gaining traction—Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a new meme coin that has captured the attention of the crypto community with its unique blend of humor, community engagement, and innovative features. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale is currently underway, and it’s already generating significant buzz among investors looking for the next big opportunity in the meme coin space. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from other meme coins is its focus on creating a sustainable ecosystem. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is building a platform that integrates gaming, NFTs, and community-driven events. This approach not only adds utility to the Mpeppe (MPEPE) token but also helps to foster a strong and engaged community. Why Analysts Are Bullish on Mpeppe Several crypto analysts have expressed optimism about Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential, especially given the challenges facing established coins like Solana (SOL). The ongoing presale has been met with strong demand, and the token’s value is expected to rise as it gains more exposure and secures listings on major exchanges. One key factor driving interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its innovative use of NFTs and gaming. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) platform will feature a series of NFT collections and games, providing users with multiple ways to earn and interact with the ecosystem. This adds a layer of utility that many meme coins lack, making Mpeppe (MPEPE) a more attractive option for investors looking for long-term growth. Moreover, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s community-driven approach is likely to attract a dedicated following, similar to what we’ve seen with other successful meme coins. By focusing on engagement and creating a fun, inclusive environment, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has the potential to build a loyal user base that could drive its value higher in the coming months. Conclusion: Is Mpeppe the Next Big Thing? As Solana (SOL) struggles to find its footing, investors are increasingly looking for alternative opportunities in the crypto market. Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling case, with its innovative features, strong community focus, and growing presale interest. While Solana (SOL) may still have room for recovery, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh opportunity for those looking to diversify their portfolios and tap into the potential of the meme coin market.

33222051,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640013,1725548419,100% Accurate Bitcoin Bottom Signal Hits: Time to Buy?,"Crypto analyst Astronomer, known by the handle @astronomer_zero on X, has put forth a potentially compelling bottom signal for Bitcoin, which hinges on the electricity costs incurred by miners to produce BTC. According to him, this particular metric has historically served as a reliable indicator for identifying optimal buying opportunities within Bitcoin’s price cycles. Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? The analysis titled “BTC Miners electricity cost, a 100% accurate bottom signal,” leverages data to illustrate a scenario where the cost of Bitcoin production dips below its market price, suggesting a pivotal moment for potential investors. Astronomer elaborated on his methodology and findings by referencing his previous predictions which successfully pinpointed market tops, notably a 30% drop from a $70,000 peak, which was guided by similarly data-driven signals. Related Reading: Is Another Bitcoin Crash Coming? Top Analyst Highlights Alarming Trend! Astronomer’s current focus on the cost of mining stems from its significant implications on Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. Despite the halving events designed to reduce the reward for mining Bitcoin, there remains a 0.84% annual inflation in its supply, equating to roughly $10 billion worth of Bitcoin entering the market each year. This is equivalent to the total holdings of significant corporate investors like MicroStrategy, indicating a substantial influx of Bitcoin from miners, who are inclined to sell gradually to sustain their operations. However, the current market conditions, as described by Astronomer, have reached a rare state where the market price of Bitcoin has fallen below the average weighted cost of electricity required to mine it. This situation typically constrains miners from selling their holdings at a profit, thus potentially reducing the sell pressure on the market. “Not only does that mean that the miners can’t sell their BTC for a profit. It also means that it is simply cheaper to just log into a CEX and buy 1 Bitcoin, instead of going through the pain of mining 1 Bitcoin. So not only does this make the miners (the people controlling BTC) not want to sell, it also makes them want to buy, because it is cheaper to just buy instead of mine them,” Astronomer suggests. Related Reading: $170 Million In Crypto Longs Bite The Dust As Bitcoin Plunges Under $57,000 This shift not only impacts the selling behavior of miners but also their buying strategies, contributing to a decrease in supply pressure and possibly triggering upward price movements. Astronomer supports his claim by pointing out that historically, when the cost of production fell below the market price, it has consistently led to substantial price recoveries. He detailed instances from the recent past, including notable dips in March 2023 when Bitcoin hit $19,500, November 2022 at $16,500, June 2022 at $18,000, May 2020 at $8,900, March 2020 at $4,700, and November 2018 when it bottomed out at $3,500. Each of these moments was followed by robust bull runs, underlining the potential reliability of this signal. “How many times? 17 out of 17 times, it meant that price was at levels that, according to history (with high statistical significance), you would want to buy, or would miss and regret it for a very long time,” the analyst adds. Currently, with the production cost of Bitcoin, according to Capriole Investment’s data, standing at $60,711 and the price lingering at $56,713, the conditions described by Astronomer are manifesting yet again. This juxtaposition poses a critical question to the market: Is now the time to buy? While Astronomer’s analysis is backed by historical data and detailed market observation, he remains cautiously optimistic about the outcomes, encapsulated in his closing remark, “Will this time be different? Maybe.” At press time, BTC traded at $56,804.

33222105,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640105,1725548414,"Solana (SOL) Experts Fear SOL Could Fall To $85; Here’s How To Turn $200 To $2,000 With Mpeppe","Solana (SOL), once a shining star in the cryptocurrency universe, is now grappling with significant resistance and potential bearish patterns that have experts and investors on edge. The consistent rejections from its bull market support band have raised concerns that Solana (SOL) might plummet further, possibly down to the $85 mark. For those looking to hedge their bets and explore other profitable opportunities, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an intriguing alternative that could potentially turn a modest $200 investment into a $2,000 windfall. Solana (SOL)’s Struggles: A Looming Bearish Trend Solana (SOL)’s journey throughout 2024 has been nothing short of tumultuous. Despite early optimism, SOL has repeatedly failed to break above its critical bull market support band, which is defined by the 20-week and 21-week exponential moving averages (EMAs). This resistance has proven formidable, with the price of Solana (SOL) stalling near $190 in July before being pushed back down to around $129. Market analyst Benjamin Cowen has highlighted the persistent rejections SOL faces at these resistance levels, warning that the cryptocurrency may be on the verge of a significant reversal. The rising wedge pattern on Solana (SOL)’s chart, often a precursor to price breakdowns, suggests that SOL could soon retest much lower levels. If this bearish scenario plays out, Solana (SOL) could find itself testing support at the $85 mark, a level not seen for quite some time. The Impact of Development Activity and Whale Movements Adding to Solana (SOL)’s woes is the noticeable decline in its development activity. After a spike in June that coincided with a brief price increase, development efforts have tapered off, mirroring SOL’s price decline. This reduction in development activity often signals waning investor confidence and can exacerbate downward price pressure. Moreover, the selling pressure from major Solana (SOL) whales has intensified throughout the year. One prominent whale, potentially an institutional investor, has offloaded a staggering 695,000 SOL since January, totaling $99.5 million. Despite still holding a significant amount of SOL, the continued liquidation by large holders suggests that the bearish trend may persist, further threatening Solana (SOL)’s price stability. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The 100x Meme Coin Opportunity While Solana (SOL)’s prospects seem increasingly uncertain, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the attention of savvy investors looking to capitalize on the next big thing in the crypto space. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin with a unique twist, is not just riding the wave of viral internet culture but is also positioned within the lucrative online gaming and casino sector. This strategic focus provides Mpeppe (MPEPE) with real-world utility, distinguishing it from many other meme coins that rely solely on community hype. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale has already generated significant interest, raising nearly $2 million.

For investors looking to diversify their portfolios and mitigate the risks associated with more established but currently struggling assets like Solana (SOL), Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling alternative. How to Turn $200 into $2,000 with Mpeppe Investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE) now, during its presale phase, could be a game-changer for those willing to take a calculated risk. With the potential for the coin to multiply in value as it gains traction, a $200 investment could realistically grow to $2,000 or more, especially as Mpeppe (MPEPE) secures listings on major exchanges and attracts a broader audience. The combination of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative market positioning, strong community backing, and the growing interest in meme coins makes it a standout contender for those looking to achieve significant returns.

Conclusion: Mpeppe as a Strategic Hedge Against Solana (SOL)’s Decline In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, the ability to adapt and recognize emerging opportunities is crucial.

While Ripple faces legal uncertainties, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising meme coin, is experiencing a surge in value, capturing the attention of investors. This article delves into the contrasting fortunes of Ripple (XRP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), examining the potential outcomes for both tokens. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Rallies Amid Ripple’s Legal Battles While Ripple (XRP) grapples with legal uncertainties, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been on an extraordinary upward trajectory. The meme coin has successfully raised $1.8 million in its presale, leading to a 100x spike in its value. Now trading at $0.0021, Mpeppe has become a beacon of potential in the meme coin sector, attracting both retail investors and crypto whales alike. The driving force behind Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) success is its integration with online gambling platforms, providing real-world utility beyond speculation. This strategic move has distinguished Mpeppe from other meme coins, making it a serious contender in the crypto market. The community-driven nature of Mpeppe has also played a significant role, creating a loyal following that actively promotes the coin across various platforms. Ripple (XRP) and SEC: A Complex Circumstance in the Cryptocurrency Sector The legal entanglement between Ripple (XRP) and the SEC has created significant tension within the cryptocurrency community. The SEC has accused Ripple of violating U.S. securities laws, resulting in a court ruling that imposed a $125 million judgment against the company. Ripple is now seeking to temporarily suspend this financial obligation as it prepares for further legal action, including a potential appeal. Legal experts suggest that the chances of a successful appeal have increased, especially with the proposed trust management of 111% of the judgment amount. Market Analysis and Price Development of Ripple (XRP) Despite the legal challenges, Ripple (XRP) has shown remarkable resilience. After news of the proposed agreement, the XRP price saw a 0.21% increase, bringing it to $0.5583. Additionally, trading volume surged by 36%, indicating sustained investor interest. However, analysts are cautious, predicting that Ripple (XRP) could fall to $0.47 if the legal uncertainties persist, especially if the appeal does not favor Ripple creating more scope for competitors Mpeppe (MPEPE) Legal Implications for Ripple (XRP) and the SEC The decision to place the $125 million on a trust account is a strategic move by Ripple (XRP) to safeguard its funds in case of a legal loss. This maneuver could potentially influence the broader regulatory landscape in the cryptocurrency sector. Should the SEC lose the appeal, the outcome could reshape the regulatory practices affecting the entire market. Ripple’s (XRP) long-term prospects hinge on the resolution of this legal battle, which could have far-reaching consequences for the company and the broader crypto ecosystem. The Impact on the Cryptocurrency Market The contrasting fortunes of Ripple (XRP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscore the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Ripple (XRP) faces challenges due to its ongoing legal battle, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is thriving, driven by strong community support and strategic market positioning. Investors are increasingly drawn to tokens that offer quick returns, and Mpeppe’s meteoric rise is a prime example of how meme coins can capture market attention. Summary As Ripple (XRP) continues to navigate its legal challenges, the focus will be on how the case progresses and whether it can regain investor confidence. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is expected to sustain its momentum, with analysts predicting further gains as the coin solidifies its position in the market. In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market remains highly dynamic, with both Ripple (XRP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) showcasing the diverse opportunities available to investors. While Ripple’s legal battle may impact its short-term prospects, Mpeppe’s rise highlights the potential for meme coins to deliver significant returns, making it a coin to watch in the coming months.

Then, DJ Windle from Windle Wealth explains how bitcoin and gold are both stores of value and the differences between each asset in Ask an Expert.  - Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  The Weakening Store of Value Argument for Gold and Bitcoin  Summary: The approval of the bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could represent a similar change in market to what central banks caused in gold markets post-2022 – a new factor that, at least temporarily, overwhelms traditional narratives, including the “store of value” concept.  The August market sell-off frustrated proponents of bitcoin’s store-of-value properties. After all, crypto was down badly while gold rallied during the week. To add insult to injury, bitcoin underperformed when markets bounced back.  However, despite the price appreciation, gold might also be losing some of its store-of-value properties. Price and narrative decoupled around 2022. Traditional investors continued following the decade-long pattern of selling gold as real yields and inflation expectations rose ahead of central bank tightening. The problem is that this time, gold went the other way.  Why has the gold price not responded to its store of value macro drivers? A change in market structure: Asian central banks dramatically increased their gold purchases around the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the seizing of its FX reserves. We might even say that these governments are following their own competing narrative.  Russian, Indian and Chinese policymakers couldn’t care less about gold as a “store of value” from the perspective of a Western investor. Fed policy, inflation expectations and libertarian principles will likely never influence the cycle of accumulation – and eventual use – of their gold reserves.  Over time, the approval of crypto ETFs in the U.S. could represent a similar disruption in market structure as the one seen in gold. It could shift the narratives around BTC (store of value) and ETH (crypto tech play) closer to a traditional investment asset. In other words, ETF investors may be following different narratives and demand functions (say, portfolio rebalancing or disposable income) to crypto native investors, the same way as Asian central banks buy gold for different reasons than traditional investors.  Indeed, the recent ETF and bitcoin price data seem to support this conclusion. ETFs continued to attract inflows despite the wild price fluctuations and shift in narratives around bitcoin over the last few months. Please note that this is a very short timeframe, so any extrapolation should be taken with a grain of salt. But so far, it seems directionally right. In fact, the impact of Grayscale outflows in BTC and ETH gives us a glimpse of how cycle-agnostic ETF flows can impact price.  Does this mean that gold and bitcoin are no longer stores of value assets? Not necessarily. Narratives can coexist, shift, weaken and take turns leading prices. However, the presence of new, large and different investor sets in both these markets is likely to dilute original narratives and change how prices react to macro events.  - Ilan Solot, senior global market strategist, Marex Solutions  Ask an Expert  Q. What is a store of value?  A. A store of value is an asset that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged in the future without significantly losing its purchasing power. Assets like gold, real estate, or stable currencies have traditionally served this purpose because they tend to retain value over time and during market downturns. This does not necessarily mean they cannot be volatile in the short term. The core idea is to provide security against inflation, currency devaluation and economic instability over time, allowing investors to preserve wealth across generations.  Q. How is bitcoin similar to gold?  A. Bitcoin and gold share several characteristics that make them appealing as stores of value. Both are finite in supply—gold by its natural scarcity and bitcoin by its capped supply of 21 million coins. Neither is controlled by any central government, which makes them attractive alternatives to traditional fiat currencies. Both bitcoin and gold, however, have different types of security risks that need to be addressed when investing in them. In times of economic uncertainty or inflation, investors often flock to these assets to preserve value, viewing them as a hedge against market volatility and loss of purchasing power.  Q. How is bitcoin different from gold?  A. Bitcoin brings new attributes to the table that gold lacks. As a digital asset, bitcoin can be transferred globally in minutes, unlike gold, which is cumbersome and costly to move. Bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology ensures transparency, allowing for verifiable ownership and transactions. Additionally, Bitcoin is programmable, meaning it can be integrated into digital applications like smart contracts and DeFi platforms, making it highly versatile in the modern financial ecosystem. These qualities make bitcoin an innovative option beyond traditional uses of gold.  - DJ Windle, founder and portfolio manager, Windle Wealth  Keep Reading  VC Funding for crypto startups grew to over $600 million in August, according to data from DefiLlama.

The approach came while the crypto payments firm was exploring a series B funding round.  The business is not formally up for sale and there are no ongoing negotiations, one source said.  BCB Group, a payments processor that links crypto firms to the banking system, has received a takeover approach from an investor, according to three people familiar with the matter.  The buyout interest was initiated by the potential acquirer while the London-based company was exploring a Series B funding round, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is private.  The business is not formally up for sale, and there are no negotiations taking place, one of the people said.  BCB declined to comment.  M&A activity in the U.K. crypto industry has been heating up in recent months. Elwood Technologies, the crypto-focused trade execution and risk management platform backed by billionaire hedge fund manager Alan Howard, divested its over-the-counter trading division to Standard Chartered-backed Zodia Markets in July.  BCB closed a $60 million Series A funding round in January 2022. The round was co-led by Foundation Capital with participation from BACKED VC, PayU (the e-payments business of Prosus), Digital Currency Group, Nexo, Wintermute, Menai Financial Group, Circle, Tokentus Investment, Cowa, Profluent Ventures and LAUNCHub Ventures.  Previous investors North Island Ventures, Blockchain.com Ventures, Rockaway Blockchain Fund, Pantera and L1 Digital also participated in the Series A round.  The payments firm was authorized by France's ACPR and AMF, the country's two primary financial regulators, to act as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) and Digital Assets Services Provider (DASP) in April. It said France will serve as its regulatory base in Europe.  BCB's former CEO, Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, left the company in November to pursue new opportunities and was replaced by Oliver Tonkin.

A repeat of the situation doesn't look likely as it won't come as such a big surprise. Bitcoin is consolidating near its all-time high, showing a bullish cup and handle pattern. A breakout should be setting up into the end of the year. Bitcoin continues to consolidate just under its all-time high after surviving the carry trade sell off. This article looks at why it may be setting up a break higher, and why the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) is one of the better ways to own Bitcoin. First: A Word on the Risks Most Bitcoin investors will be aware of the main risks associated with Bitcoin and with cryptocurrencies. These are volatile assets. However, the USDJPY carry trade was perhaps not something everyone considered until very recently. It's not that the carry trade has any specific links to Bitcoin; rather, it's the need for liquidity that particularly targeted Bitcoin and other crowded trades such as Nvidia ( NVDA ) and the ""Mag 7"" stocks. Much of the carry trade is funded by debt. Traders borrow Yen at a very low-interest rates and buy dollars and US Treasuries. When the BoJ hiked rates at the beginning of August, it just so happened US yields fell sharply at the same time on growth fears, which made the carry trade less attractive and more expensive. To make matters worse, USDJPY dropped significantly, so the Yen-denominated debt required more dollars to pay back. To cut a long story short, traders involved in the carry trade were in trouble and with USDJPY down over -3% on the morning of Monday, August 5th, they desperately needed liquidity. This started during the Asian session, and the Nikkei was particularly hit hard - at one stage it was down -13%. Bitcoin spot was also an easy source of liquidity, especially ahead of the US open, and it traded down -10% in the early morning. Both Bitcoin and the Nikkei made a large bounce later that session, as did most other assets, and the subsequent recovery in August suggests the moves early in the month were an overreaction. That said, the carry trade is back in focus this week as the BoJ Governor submitted a document warning the bank could continue to raise rates. With concerns about the US economy rising ahead of Friday's Jobs Report, USDJPY has fallen sharply again, and Bitcoin is drifting lower. I do think the initial panic and liquidity grab at the beginning of August was likely the worst this situation will get. It surprised many and isn't likely to repeat as markets will be better prepared. Furthermore, the BoJ are unlikely to willingly blow up markets with an aggressive hiking schedule. While risks to Bitcoin remain, I think they are worth taking given the bullish potential. Bullish Patterns Despite the negative drivers in the background, Bitcoin continues to consolidate near the all-time highs in what is considered a bullish pattern called a cup and handle. Cup and Handle Example (Investopedia) The pattern is clear on a daily Bitcoin chart and it suggests a break-out is setting up. BTC Cup and Handle (TradingView) There is some logic behind the formation of this pattern. As a market returns back to resistance at previous highs, there is often a pause, especially when the rally is stretched, as was the case with Bitcoin in early 2024. A consolidation phase then resets positioning and gathers energy for a break-out. Bitcoin's older relative, gold ( GLD ) often makes this pattern and the large-scale cup and handle on the weekly chart may well provide a guide to what could happen in Bitcoin. Gold v BTC (TradingView) Bitcoin technicals remain bullish and suggest a move to new all-time highs should unfold into the end of the year and 2025. Whether this is driven by a post-election risk-on rally or some other catalyst can only be speculated upon, but my tactic is to buy and hold for the bullish potential. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF I have already written about the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), and called it the gold standard in Bitcoin ETFs. I still think this is the case, but FBTC comes a close second for a number of reasons. Firstly, there's little difference in the expense ratio. While FBTC is listed at 0.25% and IBIT is listed at 0.12%, this is not entirely accurate. As per IBIT's fund page , ""If the fund exceeds $5.0 billion of the Trust's assets prior to the end of the 12-month period, the Sponsor's Fee charged on assets over $5.0 billion will be 0.25%."" IBIT now has $20B AUM, which means that 0.25% is charged on over 75% of its assets. This means the expense ratio is around 0.218%. In any case, the 0.25% fee will be introduced in full in January 2025. Secondly, other metrics are very similar and FBTC actually manages a very small outperformance. FBTC v INIT (Seeking Alpha) Thirdly, Fidelity has a different custodian than every other Bitcoin ETF, which are almost entirely with Coinbase. ETF custodians (Cointelegraph) I've looked closely at the Fidelity prospectus to see if there are any major differences between their custodian procedures and those of Coinbase. I don't see any, and both carry very small risks inherent when storing anything valuable. Consequently, there doesn't seem much reason for choosing one over the other, but there is a case to be made for choosing both and spreading the very small risk between the two. Conclusions Bitcoin survived the liquidity grab prompted by the early August carry trade unwind and has maintained a bullish pattern on the longer-term charts, which appears to be setting up a break to new all-time highs. While the risk has not completely dissipated, I do think the markets won't be surprised or panicked in a similar way again and Bitcoin should be less of a target. FBTC has caught my attention as an attractive alternative to IBIT, although I think the two can be held together and there is very little difference now IBIT's expense ratio is over 0.2%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BTG,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4719226-fbtc-bullish-despite-the-risks?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33220982.jpeg

Related Reading: Monero (XMR) Unfazed By Market Jitters, Climbs 13% – Details Made on X, this announcement signals a turning point for XRP particularly in light of Ripple’s most recent court triumph over the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Ranked 48th on CoinMarketCap, the exchange seeks to increase its offers and draw more customers to its platform. This listing comes when the cryptocurrency is receiving a mixed reaction in the market. Within the last 24 hours, XRP suffered a loss of 4.5% in price before recovering slightly by 1.2%. At the moment, the token changes hands at $0.55611.

Now, it is clear that the judge has decided not to fine Ripple $2 billion, as wanted by the SEC, but allowed them to settle it for $125 million instead. Many praised the development as a turning point not only for Ripple but also for the larger cryptocurrency community. The sense of jubilation also extended to Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive of Ripple, who said that the decision sent a very strong signal towards other crypto startups that their fights against regulatory authorities may come out positively. The impact of the ruling also extends far beyond Ripple. It’s indicative of a more crypto-friendly regulatory regime, which could very well spur further innovation and investment in the industry. All this during the continuing fallout of the legal mess, and XRP’s listing on CoinCheck could fuel investor confidence, along with more activity in the markets. XRP market cap currently at $31 billion. Chart: TradingView.com XRP: Market Reactions And Next Moves However, the market has still been cautiously optimistic about the listing on CoinCheck. In as much as the price movements have been upward in recent weeks, many analysts say the accessibility of the XRP asset means that the trading volume can only go upwards. Related Reading: RENDER Flashes Red With 18% Short-Term Loss – Details At a time when Japan is opening up to other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Shiba Inu, CoinCheck’s choice to list the XRP asset should be seen to mean the evolution of digital acceptance in the country. Another ongoing point of interest is the strategy of Ripple when it comes to the release of XRP from escrow. The company recently unlocked 1 billion XRP, valued at about $550 million; of those, 800 million tokens were locked back into escrow.

33218918,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640040,1725541246,Ethereum Price Prediction: Another 7 Day 5.44% Low For ETH As Whales Shift Towards This 100x Meme Bomb,"Ethereum (ETH), often hailed as the king of altcoins, has been experiencing a tumultuous period recently. Over the past seven days, Ethereum has dropped by 5.44%, causing concern among investors and enthusiasts. Despite being one of the most established and widely used cryptocurrencies, Ethereum’s recent performance has not been encouraging, leading many to wonder whether it can maintain its dominance in the rapidly evolving crypto space or will the thrown be passed on to new comer meme coin Mpeppe (MPEPE). A New Contender: Mpeppe (MPEPE) Hits The Market With Force As Ethereum continues to struggle, a new player has emerged on the scene: Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that has captured the attention of the crypto community, including large-scale investors, often referred to as “whales.” Mpeppe has quickly gained popularity due to its unique blend of internet culture, innovative features, and explosive growth potential. In contrast to Ethereum’s recent declines, Mpeppe has been on an upward trajectory, attracting investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. The coin has already raised a significant amount in its presale, nearing $2 million, which highlights the growing interest in this project. Unlike Ethereum, which is entrenched in the complexities of DeFi and smart contracts, Mpeppe offers a more straightforward and speculative investment, appealing to those looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin. Ethereum’s pursuit to Shift Market Sentiment Ethereum’s price decline comes at a time when the broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing volatility. The price of ETH has been oscillating, struggling to break free from a bearish trend that has seen it drop below crucial support levels. While Ethereum continues to play a critical role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and powers numerous applications and tokens, its price action has not reflected its utility. Analysts suggest that Ethereum’s recent performance could be attributed to several factors, including the saturation of its market and the rise of alternative blockchain solutions that offer faster and cheaper transactions. As Ethereum battles with scalability issues and high gas fees, competitors are quickly gaining ground, offering viable alternatives to developers and users. Why Whales Are Shifting to Mpeppe The migration of Ethereum whales to Mpeppe may seem surprising, but it underscores a broader trend in the crypto market: the search for outsized returns. While Ethereum remains a blue-chip asset in the crypto space, its large market cap means that it is unlikely to see the kind of exponential growth that newer, smaller projects like Mpeppe could potentially achieve. Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) appeal lies in its potential to deliver massive returns quickly. The meme coin market is notorious for its volatility, but it also offers opportunities for rapid gains that established coins like Ethereum cannot match. For whales who have already made substantial profits from Ethereum, Mpeppe represents a chance to multiply their gains in a shorter time frame, albeit with higher risk. Ethereum & Mpeppe: Crypto Landscape and Positioning Despite its recent struggles, Ethereum is unlikely to lose its position as a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. The network’s ongoing upgrades, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0, aim to address many of the issues that have plagued it, such as scalability and high transaction costs. However, these improvements will take time to materialize, and in the interim, Ethereum’s price may continue to face pressure. On the other hand, Mpeppe is riding a wave of momentum that could see it become one of the standout performers of 2024. As more investors flock to this meme coin, its price could skyrocket, delivering the kind of returns that are increasingly hard to find in the more established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The question for investors is whether they are willing to take on the risk that comes with investing in a meme coin in exchange for the potential rewards. Analytical Synopsis Ethereum’s recent 5.44% decline over the past seven days highlights the challenges the network faces in maintaining its market dominance. As whales shift their attention to high-growth opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE), the meme coin market continues to attract those looking for rapid gains. While Ethereum remains a foundational asset in the crypto space, Mpeppe’s rise signals that investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing, and right now, Mpeppe seems to be it.

33218915,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640046,1725541232,Top Meme Coins to Buy in September 2024: Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE),"As the cryptocurrency market faces its usual September downturn, savvy investors are on the lookout for opportunities amid the chaos. While major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant declines, meme coins have not been spared. Pepecoin (PEPE) has dipped alongside its peers, but for those looking for resilient and promising meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) emerges as a strong contender to buy during this volatile period. Pepe Coin (PEPE): Navigating the Storm Pepecoin, one of the most well-known meme coins, has seen its fair share of highs and lows. After a significant rally earlier this year, PEPE has now dipped to $0.0000071, down 7% in the latest market correction. This decline is in line with the broader market trend, where other top meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and FLOKI are also experiencing drops of 4% to 8%. Despite the recent downturn, PEPE remains a popular choice for meme coin enthusiasts. The coin’s strong community and its reputation as one of the original meme coins have helped it maintain a solid position in the market. Additionally, some top traders who have made significant profits from PEPE in the past are buying back in, suggesting confidence in a potential resurgence. The question for many now is whether PEPE can bounce back and deliver the gains investors are hoping for. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Casino Star Amidst the Decline While PEPE deals with the pressures of the current market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves as a meme coin that could capitalize on the current dip. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, Mpeppe is carving out a niche with a solid strategy and a growing community. Its presale success, nearing $2 million, is a testament to the strong interest and belief in its potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE) distinguishes itself by not only riding the meme coin wave but also integrating elements that appeal to both casual investors and more serious traders. With upcoming Tier-1 exchange listings predicted, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned to take advantage of a market rebound, potentially pushing it into the ranks of top meme coins alongside PEPE. Analysts suggest that Mpeppe could be the next big thing in the meme coin market, with the potential to deliver significant returns as the market stabilizes. Its innovative approach, combined with the anticipation of major exchange listings, makes it an attractive option for those looking to invest in meme coins with strong growth prospects. PandaWorld: A New Contender in the Meme Coin Arena In addition to PEPE and Mpeppe (MPEPE), another meme coin that has caught the attention of investors is PandaWorld (PADW). Unlike traditional meme coins, PandaWorld focuses on creating a sustainable ecosystem with passive income opportunities for its holders. This play-to-earn gaming platform allows users to earn revenue through staking PADW tokens, providing a unique value proposition in the meme coin space. PandaWorld’s presale has been well-received, raising over $115,000 in a short period, indicating strong investor interest. The project’s future developments, including an NFT marketplace and exclusive merchandise, add to its appeal, making it a contender to watch. Why Mpeppe Might Be the Best Bet This September While PEPE continues to be a strong player in the meme coin space, Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) momentum and strategic positioning could make it the standout meme coin of September 2024. With its presale nearing $2 million and the potential for Tier-1 exchange listings, Mpeppe is set to capture the attention of the crypto community. Investors looking for meme coins that can weather the current market storm and offer substantial upside should consider Mpeppe. Its combination of community support, strategic growth plans, and the anticipation of major listings makes it a compelling choice for those looking to capitalize on the current market dip. In conclusion, while Pepecoin remains a solid choice for those who believe in its potential comeback, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh opportunity with possibly higher rewards. As the market navigates the turbulence of September, keeping an eye on these meme coins could pay off significantly for investors ready to ride the next wave.

33218913,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640049,1725541219,Pepe Vs Mpeppe: Pepe Holders Welcome Mpeppe After Casino Announcement,"The world of meme coins is often filled with surprising twists and turns, and the recent developments surrounding Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are no exception. As the broader crypto market grapples with fear and uncertainty, a shift is occurring among investors who are looking for the next big opportunity in the meme coin space. With Pepe Coin struggling to maintain its momentum, many of its holders are turning their attention to Mpeppe, especially after the recent announcement of its casino gaming ecosystem. Pepe Coin’s Struggles Amid Market Uncertainty Pepe Coin has been a dominant player in the meme coin sector since its meteoric rise earlier this year. However, the last few weeks have been tough for PEPE, with the coin experiencing a significant drop in value. In the past ten days alone, the PEPE price has plummeted by 24%, leaving many investors worried about its future. This decline has been attributed to a broader market sentiment of fear, as reflected in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which has kept investors on edge. Despite a minor 6% rally in the last 24 hours, the overall sentiment around PEPE remains bearish. The coin has been stuck in a consolidation phase for over five weeks, trading between $0.00000977 and $0.00000702. This tight range has frustrated many investors, particularly as PEPE has repeatedly failed to break through key resistance levels. The decrease in active addresses on the PEPE network, now at a five-month low, further indicates a loss of interest among investors. Many are stepping back from transacting on the network, choosing instead to hold or even sell their PEPE tokens. This has led to a significant drop in network participation, casting a shadow over the future of PEPE. The Rise of Mpeppe: A New Contender in the Meme Coin Space As Pepe Coin faces these challenges, a new player is emerging in the meme coin arena: Mpeppe (MPEPE). What sets Mpeppe apart is its innovative approach to the meme coin concept, particularly with its recent announcement of a casino gaming ecosystem. This development has sparked significant interest among crypto investors, including former PEPE holders who are looking for the next big opportunity. Mpeppe’s casino gaming ecosystem is designed to integrate seamlessly with blockchain technology, offering users a unique and engaging experience. This move positions Mpeppe (MPEPE) not just as another meme coin, but as a utility token with real-world applications. The announcement has been well-received, with many investors seeing it as a catalyst that could propel Mpeppe to new heights. With the Mpeppe presale already raising significant funds, the coin is gaining momentum rapidly. Investors are attracted by the potential for high returns, especially as Mpeppe’s innovative features set it apart from other meme coins. The presale has seen strong participation, and as the launch date approaches, excitement continues to build. Pepe Holders Flock to Mpeppe The shift from Pepecoin (PEPE) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just about escaping the challenges faced by the former. It also represents a strategic move by investors who are eager to capitalize on the growth potential of Mpeppe. The casino gaming announcement has given Mpeppe a unique edge, drawing in investors who are looking for more than just speculative gains. The slogan “From Meme to Moon” has become a rallying cry among the Mpeppe community, symbolizing their belief in the coin’s potential to achieve significant growth. This sentiment is being echoed by former PEPE holders, who are now joining the Mpeppe presale in droves. The shift is indicative of a broader trend in the crypto market, where investors are increasingly seeking out coins with strong use cases and growth potential. The Future of Pepe and Mpeppe While Pepe Coin remains a significant player in the meme coin space, its recent struggles have opened the door for competitors like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to gain ground. The next few weeks will be crucial for both coins, as the market reacts to ongoing developments. For PEPE, breaking out of its current consolidation phase will be key to regaining investor confidence. Meanwhile, Mpeppe’s success will depend on its ability to deliver on the promises of its casino gaming ecosystem and continue attracting investor interest. In conclusion, the recent shifts in the meme coin market highlight the dynamic nature of this sector. As Pepe Coin holders explore new opportunities, Mpeppe is emerging as a strong contender, offering innovative features that appeal to a broad range of investors. Whether Mpeppe can sustain this momentum and truly challenge PEPE’s dominance remains to be seen, but for now, it’s clear that the coin is on an upward trajectory, fueled by excitement and strategic investment.

33218910,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640052,1725541213,"Internet Computer’s Impact On A.I Technology, ICP Price Predictions and Upcoming Releases","The Internet Computer (ICP) has been a trailblazer in the blockchain world, pushing the boundaries of decentralized technology to power next-generation applications, including artificial intelligence (AI). Developed by the DFINITY Foundation, ICP aims to create a decentralized internet that could revolutionize various industries, especially AI. As AI and blockchain technology evolve, ICP’s role in shaping their future becomes increasingly significant. Meanwhile, in a different sector of the crypto market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing attention as it carves out its own space, particularly in the gaming and meme coin arenas. ICP’s Influence on AI Technology ICP’s innovative approach to decentralization is its most significant contribution to AI technology. By offering a scalable, secure, and decentralized platform, ICP enables developers to build AI applications that are both powerful and resistant to censorship and centralized control. This is crucial in today’s world, where data privacy and security are more important than ever. Similarly, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is taking a decentralized approach to disrupt the meme coin market by integrating with blockchain-based gaming platforms, creating a synergy between entertainment and cryptocurrency that appeals to a broad audience. The decentralized nature of ICP allows AI applications to operate globally without relying on traditional cloud service providers. This opens new possibilities for AI developers, who can now leverage the full power of decentralized computing. ICP’s focus on scalability ensures that AI applications can handle large volumes of data and perform complex computations in real-time, making it a critical player in the AI revolution. On the other hand, Mpeppe is leveraging its blockchain infrastructure to enhance gaming experiences, ensuring that players benefit from fast, secure, and transparent transactions. Upcoming Releases and Developments The DFINITY Foundation is continually working to enhance the Internet Computer platform to better support AI applications. One of the most anticipated developments is the integration of advanced AI toolsets into the ICP ecosystem. These toolsets will provide developers with the resources they need to build and deploy sophisticated AI models on a decentralized network, further bridging the gap between AI and blockchain technology. At the same time, Mpeppe is preparing for its own series of releases aimed at expanding its footprint in the gaming and meme coin markets. These include new features that will allow Mpeppe (MPEPE) to integrate seamlessly with popular gaming platforms, thereby increasing its utility and appeal. Additionally, upcoming releases are expected to improve ICP’s consensus mechanism, making it more efficient and reducing latency. This will enhance the performance of AI applications running on the network, making ICP an even more attractive platform for developers. Similarly, Mpeppe is set to roll out enhancements that will streamline in-game transactions, offering users faster and more reliable ways to engage with the Mpeppe ecosystem, potentially driving its adoption even further. Another exciting development is the launch of ICP’s decentralized data marketplace. This marketplace will allow AI developers to access and share data securely and decentralized, fostering innovation and collaboration in the AI space. By democratizing access to data, ICP aims to level the playing field, allowing smaller developers and startups to compete with industry giants. Mpeppe is also looking to democratize access within its niche by enabling players and investors to participate in gaming economies through its token, which can be used for in-game purchases, staking, and more. ICP Price Predictions: What Lies Ahead? ICP’s price has experienced volatility since its launch, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. However, as the platform continues to evolve and integrate more AI-focused features, analysts believe that ICP’s value could see significant appreciation in the coming years. This upward momentum could be mirrored by Mpeppe, which, despite being a meme coin, has shown strong potential due to its unique position within the gaming industry and its growing community of supporters. As ICP becomes more integral to AI application development and deployment, demand for the token is expected to rise, potentially leading to a substantial increase in its price. Mpeppe (MPEPE) could follow a similar trajectory, particularly as it gains traction in the gaming world. With its presale already raising nearly $2 million, Mpeppe is positioning itself as a meme coin with real-world utility, something that could drive significant value appreciation. Some predictions suggest that ICP could see its price double or even triple over the next year, particularly if the broader crypto market experiences a bull run. The same could be said for Mpeppe, especially if it continues to expand its ecosystem and attract new users through its innovative features and strong community engagement. However, like all cryptocurrencies, both ICP and Mpeppe are subject to market volatility, and short-term fluctuations are expected. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Rising Star in the Meme Coin Universe While ICP is making strides in AI and blockchain, another cryptocurrency is capturing the attention of the market: Mpeppe (MPEPE). Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe is positioning itself as a serious contender with its unique blend of humor, community engagement, and real-world utility, particularly in the gaming and casino sectors. Mpeppe’s approach is akin to ICP’s in that it seeks to leverage blockchain technology to create a more immersive and decentralized user experience. Mpeppe’s presale has already raised nearly $2 million, highlighting the growing interest from investors. As ICP holders look to diversify their portfolios, Mpeppe’s potential for high returns becomes increasingly attractive. With its community-driven approach and promising prospects, Mpeppe is quickly becoming a hot topic in crypto circles, similar to how ICP has captured the attention of AI developers and blockchain enthusiasts. Conclusion The Internet Computer (ICP) continues to make significant contributions to the blockchain and AI sectors, with upcoming releases that promise to enhance its capabilities. As ICP evolves, its impact on AI technology is expected to grow, making it a key player in the future of decentralized applications. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the imagination of investors and meme coin enthusiasts, offering a unique opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the next big trend in the crypto market. Together, ICP and Mpeppe represent the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency world, where innovation and opportunity are always just around the corner. Whether through revolutionary AI applications or the latest meme coin sensation, the future of crypto continues to unfold with exciting possibilities. Both ICP and Mpeppe are set to play pivotal roles in their respective domains, showcasing the diversity and potential within the broader crypto ecosystem.

33218909,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640042,1725541200,Ethereum: Unravelling The Truth Behind Ethereum and Why Mpeppe Is the Fastest Growing Meme,"Ethereum (ETH) has long been a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, serving as the foundation for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and a host of other blockchain innovations. Recent developments have only strengthened its position. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has achieved a significant milestone in the crypto world, with its Ethereum ETF (ETHA) becoming the first of its kind to surpass $1 billion in net inflows. This accomplishment is a clear indicator of the growing institutional interest in Ethereum-based products. However, while Ethereum continues to dominate headlines, a new player in the crypto space is rapidly gaining momentum: Mpeppe (MPEPE). This meme coin has quickly become one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors alike. The Ethereum Success Story BlackRock’s ETHA ETF has not only achieved a $1 billion milestone but has also set the stage for further institutional adoption of Ethereum. This success is particularly significant as it reflects a broader trend of growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability. The fact that BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF outpaced other crypto ETFs in net inflows suggests that large-scale investors see Ethereum as a critical asset in their portfolios. The ETHA ETF’s success is part of a larger pattern of growing institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency market. With Ethereum’s market capitalization still second only to Bitcoin, it’s clear that ETH remains a crucial player in the blockchain ecosystem. BlackRock’s achievement further cements Ethereum’s role as a leading digital asset, especially as it continues to attract significant capital from around the globe. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Fastest Growing Meme Coin While Ethereum is making waves in the institutional investment world, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the imagination of the retail crypto community. As a meme coin, Mpeppe has benefited from the growing popularity of meme-based cryptocurrencies, a trend that has seen tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu skyrocket in value. However, Mpeppe is not just riding the coattails of these predecessors; it is carving out its own niche as one of the fastest-growing meme coins in the market. The rapid growth of Mpeppe can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its presale success has been nothing short of remarkable, raising nearly $2 million as it approaches the final stages of its offering. This level of interest indicates strong market confidence in the token’s potential for explosive gains. Secondly, Mpeppe has managed to build a vibrant and engaged community, a key ingredient for the success of any meme coin. The community’s enthusiasm is palpable, and it’s this grassroots support that often drives the value of such tokens. Comparing Ethereum and Mpeppe: Different Paths, Similar Potential Ethereum and Mpeppe (MPEPE) represent two very different aspects of the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum is the established powerhouse, with a strong foundation in decentralized technology and a growing presence in institutional portfolios. Mpeppe, on the other hand, is the up-and-coming challenger, driven by the speculative fervor that often accompanies meme coins. While Ethereum’s growth is likely to be steady and sustained, Mpeppe offers the potential for more rapid, albeit more volatile, gains. For investors, the decision between these two assets may come down to risk tolerance and investment strategy. Ethereum is the safer bet, backed by institutional interest and a well-established ecosystem. Mpeppe, however, presents an opportunity for those willing to take on more risk in exchange for the possibility of outsized returns. The Future of Ethereum and Mpeppe The future looks bright for both Ethereum and Mpeppe (MPEPE), albeit for different reasons. Ethereum’s continued adoption by institutional investors, as evidenced by the success of BlackRock’s ETHA ETF, suggests that it will remain a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. As more ETFs and financial products are developed around Ethereum, its influence is likely to grow even further. Mpeppe, meanwhile, is poised to capitalize on the ongoing interest in meme coins. Its rapid growth and strong community support suggest that it could be the next big thing in the meme coin space. For those who missed out on the early days of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, Mpeppe represents a new opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially explosive asset. In conclusion, while Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency, Mpeppe is emerging as a formidable contender in the meme coin market. Both assets offer unique opportunities for investors, depending on their risk appetite and investment goals. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, these two coins are likely to remain at the forefront of investor interest.

The majority of the tokens will go to stakers and node operators.  TVL on EigenLayer has waned to $11.3 billion in recent months.  Restaking protocol EigenLayer will distribute 86 million EIGEN tokens to users that have interacted with the platform as a part of ""season 2 stakedrop,"" it said in a blog post.  Stakers and node operators will receive 70 million tokens, while ecosystem partners and the EigenLayer community will receive 10 million and 6 million respectively, with distribution due to start on Sep. 17. The tokens equate to around 5% of EIGEN's total supply, which will be 1.67 billion tokens at launch.  EigenLayer initially announced its token in April after the protocol had received around $15.7 billion in deposits. Since then total value locked (TVL) has dropped to $11.3 billion, DefiLlama data shows.  EigenLayer is a protocol built atop Ethereum, it lets users stake ether {{ETH}}, which can be repurposed to secure additional networks or protocols in return for additional yield.  Several restaking protocols have experienced a reduction in TVL over the past month. Renzo's total has dropped by 22% to $1 billion and Karak's has fallen 14.6% to $688 million. This is partly due to dwindling asset prices as ether trades at $2,388 compared to July's high of $3,536, and also results from outflows following the conclusion of several airdrop campaigns.  Airdrop farming was a common strategy for crypto investors earlier this year.

42390438,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1jJp,1725538264,First Mover Americas: BTC Erases Gains From Wednesday's Brief Rally,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: $1,797.26 +0.88%  Bitcoin (BTC): $56,839.07 +0.34%  Ether (ETH): $2,395.07 −0.31%  S&P 500: 5,520.07 −0.16%  Gold: $2,516.37 +0.81%  Nikkei 225: 36,657.09 −1.05%  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell below $57,000, erasing gains from Wednesday's brief rally above $58,000. BTC was trading around $56,800 at the time of writing, around 0.3% higher than 24 hours ago. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, added about 1%, with SOL and DOGE leading the gains. Bitcoin peaked above $65,000 on Aug. 25 and has been falling ever since, with the downtrend characterized by brief, shallow bounces, a sign of a persistent ""sell-on-rise"" mentality. This likely stems from increasing U.S. recession risks, which lead to a reduction in exposure to risk assets.  Weak economic data from the U.S. this week has strengthened the possibility of rate cuts from the Fed, but that has yet to stem bitcoin's downward movement. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey on Wednesday showed the number of job openings at the end of July at 7.67 million, missing the market expectation of 8.1 million and weaker than the revised June figure of 7.9 million. BTC's weakness points to limited appetite for risk assets, according to Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at The FxPro. ""Bitcoin is down for the ninth day out of the last 11 as its attempt to consolidate above the 200-day average triggered an intensified sell-off,"" Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email.  Blockstream Mining is opening a third round of investment for its hashrate-backed tokenized note, which gives participants a slice of the bitcoin earned from the company's mining activities over the next four years. Blockstream has raised around $7 million from two earlier rounds of the BMN2 note. The third sale, which will last for three weeks, will be priced at $31,000 and give holders the bitcoin produced by 1 PH/s of hashrate. Hashrate-backed contracts are not new as crypto markets have become increasingly financialized. Blockstream has differentiated its note with a 48-month duration. Most rival offerings lock in the hashprice for a year.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the spread between yields on the U.S. 10-year and two-year Treasury notes.  The spread has normalized (de-inverted) from negative to zero for the first time in two years.  ""The return to a normal slope, rather than the inversion itself, seems to correlate with recessions,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said in Thursday's market update.

33217271,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639979,1725537603,Analysts Predict The Start Of Crypto’s First Ever Secular Bear Market,"A new narrative is emerging among seasoned crypto analysts who are now forecasting the advent of the industry’s first ever secular bear market. This prediction suggests a sweeping transformation could be imminent, characterized by a prolonged downturn lasting potentially for years, diverging from the relatively short-term cycles typically associated with the crypto market. Crypto’s First Ever Secular Bear Market The conversation around this shift was sparked by a query to CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto), a renowned crypto analyst with 417,000 followers on X, who was asked about the impact of celebrities and sports stars entering the crypto space with their own coin offerings. Responding to concerns that this trend might dilute the purity and utility of cryptocurrencies, @CredibleCrypto offered a decisive view on the future trajectory of the market. “Most of this stuff will get wiped out in the next bear market imo. Our first secular bear market in this space since inception. The .com bust of crypto – where 99% of the junk will be erased, never to return, while the FAANG of crypto will emerge on the other end and thrive for the next couple decades (.com boom of crypto),” @CredibleCrypto remarked. This analogy to the dot-com bubble posits that much like the burst that cleared out weaker internet stocks while establishing tech giants, the secular crypto bear market could similarly purge lesser, speculative projects and pave the way for stronger projects to dominate. Related Reading: Crypto Market Stuck In A Rut? Here’s Why 2024 Bitcoin Breakout May Be Delayed Adding to the discourse, @astronomer_zero, another crypto analyst, highlighted the typical market psychology that precedes such downturns. He remarked, “Yeah, the party is soon over. After we move into euphoria first once more, because markets almost never crash on fear. And for a big crash, big euphoria is required. ‘A bubble cannot pop if it doesn’t exist’. Just so we can have a slightly bigger taste of celebrity/main adoption bubble greed, pulling in more liquidity to fuel the drop. Secular bear market starts in 2026/27.” Remarkably, the S&P 500 is already moving towards a “blow off top” scenario. As noted by another analyst, the S&P 500 is already showing a steeper angle than in 2007 prior to the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Astronomer clarified: “That is true and this move is part of the final stages. But that is SPX. I talked about how SPX is not correlated to BTC and how BTC is evolving to an asset of safety faster than the general public’s expectations.” Calls for a US recession and a blow-off top for the global financial markets are getting increasingly louder on X. One of the most vocal proponents of this theory is Henrik Zeberg, head macroeconomist at Swissblock. He suggests that preemptive measures by the US Federal Reserve, aimed at staving off a recession through substantial liquidity injections, could drive major indices to new heights. Related Reading: Crypto Guru Arthur Hayes Is ‘Short-Term Bearish’: Here’s Why Specifically, Zeberg forecasted the S&P 500 reaching between 6,100 and 6,300, the Nasdaq climbing to between 24,000 and 25,000, the Dow Jones to about 45,000, and Bitcoin peaking between $115,000 and $120,000 before a recession sets in around December 2024. The concept of a secular bear market, while new to the crypto market, has historical precedents in traditional financial markets. Such periods are marked by a downward trend in asset prices over extended periods, often spanning multiple economic cycles. Unlike cyclical bear markets that are relatively short-lived and followed by quick recoveries, secular bear markets exhibit prolonged stagnation or decline, interrupted occasionally by partial recoveries that do not revert to previous highs. The most-widely known examples for secular bear markets are The Great Depression (1929-1942) and the Dot-com Bubble Burst (2000-2013). Following the burst of the dot-com bubble in 2000, the US stock markets, particularly technology-heavy indices like the NASDAQ, experienced a significant downturn. The NASDAQ did not regain its peak 2000 levels until 2015, marking a long period of recovery. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $57,188.

42390424,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1iKH,1725535686,Bitcoin Retraces Below $57K as 'Sell-on-Rise' Action Continues,"BTC's price bounces remain shallow and brief as concerns about the U.S. economy linger.  Crypto weakness may be a red flag for traditional risk assets, one analyst said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} dropped below $57,000 on Thursday, reversing Wednesday's gains as lingering concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy prompted investors to sell risk assets as they rebounded.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell over 2% to $56,700, having failed to secure a foothold above $58,000 on Wednesday. Prices peaked above $65,000 on Aug. 25 and have been falling ever since, with the downtrend characterized by brief, shallow bumps, a sign of a persistent ""sell-on-rise"" mentality.  Most other cryptocurrencies, including ether {{ETH}}, XRP, TON and others, also erased Wednesday's bounces, trading largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk data. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, was recently 0.9% higher.  The sell-on-rise bias likely stems from concern that U.S. recession risks are growing, a sentiment that favors reduced exposure to risk assets, according to Valentin Fournier, an analyst at digital assets advisory firm BRN.  ""Economic reports are increasingly suggesting the risk of a recession should not be discounted,"" Fournier said. ""The ISM manufacturing index has fallen 0.5% below expectations, and job openings are at 7.7 million compared to the anticipated 8.1 million.""  ""Given the current economic uncertainties and potential for decreased liquidity, we recommend reducing exposure [to BTC] and waiting for a better entry point before increasing investments,"" Fournier added.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics published the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Wednesday, showing the number of job openings on the last business day of July at 7.67 million, missing the market expectation of 8.1 million and weaker than the downwardly revised June figure of 7.9 million, according to data source FXstreet.  Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, a summary of commentary on economic conditions, was the most downbeat in ages, pointing to a ""slowing, slackening labor market,"" according to Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.  On Tuesday, the ISM manufacturing PMI signaled a continued contraction in the activity in August, reviving the growth scare that rocked risk assets, cryptocurrencies among them, early last month.  The weak data has emboldened bets for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, although it has failed to put a floor under BTC's price so far.  Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at The FxPro, said the weakness in bitcoin might be a red flag for traditional risk assets.  ""It is possible that the weakness in cryptocurrencies is a manifestation of a very limited risk appetite, and the rest of the markets may soon follow the lead of cryptocurrencies,"" Kuptsikevich said, noting BTC's inability to draw long-lasting strength from the recent weakness in the dollar index.  ""Bitcoin is down for the ninth day out of the last 11 as its attempt to consolidate above the 200-day average triggered an intensified sell-off. This pattern persists into Thursday morning as the price continues to test the lows of the last four months,"" Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/05/bitcoin-retraces-below-57k-as-sell-on-rise-action-continues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5d3ac2e5a091bf897b9483b4cdf9ed351daf73f-2099x687.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33215268,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640029,1725533119,Why Aave (AAVE) Sharks Have Migrated to A New Crypto Coin That Has Raised Almost $2M,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, the movement of “sharks”—large-scale investors—often signals significant market trends. Recently, Aave (AAVE) sharks have turned their attention to a new and promising meme coin Mpeppe, that has already raised nearly $2 million in its ongoing presale. This shift has sparked interest and speculation across the crypto community, as investors and analysts alike try to understand the underlying reasons behind this migration. Aave (AAVE): Decentralized Finance at The Core Aave (AAVE) has long been a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As a decentralized lending platform, Aave allows users to lend and borrow a wide range of cryptocurrencies without the need for a traditional financial intermediary. Aave’s innovative approach to liquidity provision, flash loans, and interest-bearing tokens has made it one of the most respected and utilized platforms in the DeFi space. With a market capitalization of several billion dollars, Aave has attracted significant attention from institutional investors and crypto sharks. These large investors typically seek out opportunities that offer both stability and potential for substantial returns, and Aave has delivered on both fronts. However, the recent migration of these investors to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new crypto coin brings massive attention to what this new project offers that even a heavyweight like Aave does not. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Fastest Growing Meme Presale in 2024 The new cryptocurrency capturing the interest of Aave (AAVE) sharks is none other than Mpeppe (MPEPE). This meme coin, which blends the viral nature of internet culture with innovative blockchain technology, has quickly become a hot topic in the crypto world. Mpeppe has managed to raise nearly $2 million during its presale, indicating strong investor confidence and community support. Mpeppe is not just another meme coin; it represents a new wave of crypto projects that combine humor and cultural relevance with serious financial potential. Its appeal lies in its ability to attract a diverse range of investors, from retail traders looking for the next big thing to institutional sharks who see the long-term value in its unique proposition. Why Aave (AAVE) Sharks Are Moving to Mpeppe (MPEPE) The migration of Aave (AAVE) sharks to Mpeppe (MPEPE) can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, Mpeppe offers a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity that contrasts with the relatively stable and mature DeFi sector that Aave represents. While Aave provides steady returns through lending and borrowing, Mpeppe promises exponential gains, a prospect that is particularly appealing to sharks looking to maximize their profits in a short time. Another factor is the community-driven nature of Mpeppe. Unlike Aave, which operates within the established framework of decentralized finance, Mpeppe is driven by a passionate and engaged community. This community-centric approach is not only fueling the coin’s presale success but also creating a buzz that is difficult to ignore. For Aave (AAVE) sharks, the strength of a coin’s community can be as important as its technological underpinnings, as it often drives demand and sustains long-term growth. Additionally, the timing of this migration is significant. The broader crypto market has been experiencing volatility, and while Aave remains a strong player, its sharks may be looking for diversification. Mpeppe offers a fresh opportunity to hedge against the risks associated with more established assets like Aave, especially as the market dynamics shift. The Future of Defi: Aave (AAVE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) As Aave (AAVE) sharks continue to migrate towards Mpeppe (MPEPE), it raises questions about the future trajectory of both projects. Aave remains a critical part of the DeFi ecosystem, with its platform likely to continue attracting users who value security, transparency, and consistent returns. However, the rise of Mpeppe suggests that even within the crypto space, innovation and novelty can quickly disrupt the status quo. For Mpeppe, the influx of Aave (AAVE) sharks could be a game-changer. These investors bring not only capital but also credibility and influence, which could further accelerate the coin’s growth and adoption. If Mpeppe continues on its current trajectory, it could become one of the standout success stories of 2024, offering returns that even seasoned Aave investors would envy. A Shift In The Crypto Market The migration of Aave (AAVE) sharks to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a fascinating development in the crypto world, highlighting the fluid nature of investor sentiment and the constant search for the next big opportunity. While Aave remains a giant in the DeFi space, the allure of potentially astronomical returns has led its sharks to explore new waters with Mpeppe (MPEPE). As both projects continue to evolve, it will be interesting to see how this shift influences the broader market and whether Mpeppe can live up to the high expectations set by its early success.

33215131,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640026,1725532830,Cryptocurrency Bleeding September 2024: Tron Holders Become Sceptical and Hedge Towards Mpeppe Due to 150% Profits,"As September 2024 unfolds, the cryptocurrency market continues to experience volatility, with Tron (TRX) holders increasingly skeptical about the near-term prospects of their investments. Amidst the uncertainty, many are hedging their bets by diversifying into newer, high-potential assets such as Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that has recently delivered impressive 150% profits in its presale stages. Let’s explore how Tron is performing, why its holders are turning towards Mpeppe, and what this means for the broader market. Tron (TRX): Navigating Through Market Turbulence Amid Skepticism Tron (TRX) has been one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies in 2024. The network has shown significant progress, especially with its recent 46% increase in gas revenue during August, driven largely by the success of the SunPump platform. This surge in revenue is a positive sign, indicating that Tron’s ecosystem is growing and attracting more users. Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, has continued to be a vocal advocate for the network, and TRX’s price performance has generally reflected this optimism, with a 96% increase since the start of the year. Despite these positive developments, the market has not been entirely kind to TRX. The token experienced a 6% decline over the past week, reflecting the broader market downturn and raising questions about the sustainability of its recent gains. The price of TRX currently hovers around $0.15, just shy of its 2021 local high of $0.18. Analysts are split on whether TRX can break through this resistance level in the short term, with some cautioning that a drop below the $0.14 level could destabilize the current bullish sentiment. With these mixed signals, many Tron (TRX) holders are becoming skeptical about the token’s ability to continue its upward trajectory, especially given the broader market’s volatility. This skepticism is leading to a growing trend of TRX investors looking to diversify their portfolios with other promising assets, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a popular choice. Mpeppe (MPEPE): 2024 Meme Coin Main Attraction While Tron (TRX) battles skepticism, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been gaining momentum as a new meme coin with substantial potential. In a market where speculative assets often deliver outsized returns, Mpeppe has managed to stand out, particularly during its presale stages. With 97% of its Stage 3 tokens sold, raising over $1.76 million, Mpeppe is on track to deliver significant profits for early investors. Mpeppe’s appeal lies in its strong community backing and the unique blend of humor and potential financial gain that meme coins typically offer. The current price of Mpeppe is 0.001777 USDT, and as it transitions to the next stage, the price is expected to rise to 0.0021 USDT, promising further gains for those who have invested early. For Tron (TRX) holders, Mpeppe represents an opportunity to hedge against the uncertainty surrounding their primary investment. The 150% profits reported by Mpeppe’s early investors have not gone unnoticed, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify and capitalize on the meme coin’s growing popularity. The Broader Market Context: Tron vs. Cardano and the Role of Bitcoin Tron (TRX) is not the only cryptocurrency facing a challenging market environment. Cardano (ADA), another major player in the crypto space, has also been under pressure. ADA has seen a 44% drop in prices since the beginning of the year, and a further 17% decline in the past month. Despite completing the “Chang” update, which introduces on-chain governance and adds utility to ADA, the token has struggled to regain its footing. The performance of both TRX and ADA is closely tied to the overall market dynamics, particularly the dominance of Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s influence on the market cannot be overstated, and its recent struggles have impacted altcoins across the board. With Bitcoin dominance on the rise, altcoins like Tron and Cardano often find themselves at a disadvantage, particularly in a bearish market. However, the growing revenues of the Tron network and the fundamental improvements in Cardano offer some hope for a recovery in the fourth quarter of 2024. If Bitcoin’s dominance recedes and altcoin season returns, both TRX and ADA could see significant price appreciation. Until then, investors are likely to remain cautious, with many choosing to explore other opportunities like Mpeppe to safeguard their portfolios. A Strategic Shift for Tron Holders As September 2024 progresses, Tron (TRX) holders are increasingly hedging their bets by diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that has shown impressive growth potential. While Tron continues to show promise, particularly with its increasing network revenue, the volatility of the broader market has led to skepticism among its investors. Mpeppe, with its strong community support and potential for high returns, offers a compelling alternative for those looking to navigate the uncertainties of the current crypto landscape. The coming months will be crucial for both Tron and Mpeppe, as the market watches to see whether TRX can overcome its current challenges and whether Mpeppe can sustain its early success. For now, the strategic shift towards Mpeppe highlights the adaptability of crypto investors and the ever-evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.

As the market endured a wave of turbulence, the AI-driven Render token faced a sharp decline, suffering a staggering 19.82% loss. Meanwhile, Mpeppe, a rising star in the meme coin world, continues to attract significant investment, with its presale nearing completion at a rapid pace. Let’s dive into the details of how these two distinct cryptocurrencies are faring in such a tumultuous environment. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin Defying the Odds While Render (RNDR) struggles, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is on the rise, defying the market’s overall bearish sentiment. Mpeppe’s presale has reached an impressive milestone, with 97.33% of its Stage 3 tokens sold, amounting to over $1.76 million raised. With only 41,360,604 tokens remaining, the coin’s current price of 0.001777 USDT is poised to increase to 0.0021 USDT in the next stage, further fueling investor interest. Mpeppe’s appeal lies in its blend of humor, community engagement, and potential for high returns—traits that have become synonymous with successful meme coins. As Render (RNDR) investors seek to mitigate their losses, many are turning to Mpeppe, hoping to capitalize on its momentum and potential for exponential growth. The presale success of Mpeppe is a testament to the enduring allure of meme coins, even in a market dominated by more “serious” projects like Render. The cryptocurrency market, known for its unpredictability, continues to offer opportunities for those willing to take risks, and Mpeppe is currently one of the most promising avenues. Render (RNDR): From AI Dreams to Market Reality Render (RNDR) has been a beacon of hope for AI enthusiasts and digital creators, offering a platform where artists and designers can leverage decentralized GPU power to create high-quality visuals. However, the recent market downturn has hit RNDR hard, leading to a 19.82% drop in its value. This decline is part of a broader trend affecting AI-backed tokens, which have been particularly volatile following Nvidia’s Q2 earnings report. Bitcoin’s recent dip below $59,000, after briefly surpassing $61,000, has set off a chain reaction throughout the crypto market. AI-driven tokens like Render (RNDR), Fetch.ai (FET), and Bittensor (TAO) have not been immune, each losing between 7% and 10% of their value. Render’s steep decline has been exacerbated by a 6.4% drop in Nvidia’s stock, reflecting the interconnectedness of the tech and crypto markets. This situation has prompted Render (RNDR) investors to reassess their strategies, with some opting to hedge their bets by diversifying into more speculative assets. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that has captivated the imagination of the crypto community. The Impact of Bitcoin’s Decline on the Crypto Ecosystem Bitcoin’s recent inability to maintain its rally above $61,000 has had a ripple effect across the entire crypto market, including both Render (RNDR) and Mpeppe. The leading cryptocurrency’s struggle to break through key resistance levels has caused widespread volatility, leading to significant price drops across various assets. Crypto analysts, like Skew, have highlighted the importance of Bitcoin leading the recovery charge. However, with BTC trading in a consolidation phase, the market remains in a state of uncertainty. Despite this, some major players have been accumulating Bitcoin, indicating a potential rally ahead. This sentiment has been echoed by other analysts who believe that a breakout could lead to substantial gains for BTC and, by extension, the broader market. For Render (RNDR), Bitcoin’s struggles have added to the challenges it faces, further diminishing investor confidence. Conversely, Mpeppe’s ability to attract investment during such a volatile period underscores the unique dynamics of the meme coin market, where community sentiment and speculative interest can outweigh broader market trends. Conclude: A Journey of Two Cryptos As Render (RNDR) navigates through its recent losses, the cryptocurrency landscape continues to shift, offering both challenges and opportunities. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its presale nearly complete, stands as a beacon for those seeking to diversify their crypto portfolios amidst uncertainty. The contrasting fortunes of Render and Mpeppe highlight the diverse nature of the crypto market, where innovation, sentiment, and speculation coexist, driving the fortunes of digital assets. As the market evolves, investors will need to remain vigilant, balancing the potential rewards of high-risk assets like Mpeppe against the more stable, yet currently challenged, projects like Render. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether Render can recover from its losses and whether Mpeppe can sustain its momentum as it moves closer to its official launch.

Since summer began in June, the price of Bitcoin has been very weak, with multiple flash crashes rocking the pioneer cryptocurrency at various points. So far, the Bitcoin price has gone from over $70,000 to below $50,000 at one point. However, this could all be coming to an end as a crypto analyst has pointed out similarities with the summer of 2023 that suggest a recovery is imminent. When The Summer Chop Might End Crypto analyst Crypto Jelle, comparing the number of days that previous summer chops have lasted, has come up with a likely timeline for when the Bitcoin price decline could come to an end. Mainly, he takes into account the performance of Bitcoin in the summer of 2023 and how many days it lasted before it officially came to an end. Related Reading: XRP Price To $8: Analyst Says Repeat Of 2017 Could Drive Rally According to the post, the summer chop of 2023 actually lasted a total of 219 days, or approximately seven months. Given that trends like these tend to mirror each other, there is a chance that the current summer chop could last around the same time as that of 2023 did. The analyst points out that the current summer chop has been going on for 190 days, or approximately six months. Going by the duration of summer 2023, it means there is still around one month left to go before the bearish phase is finally over. This suggests that the month of September will continue to be choppy for the Bitcoin price. However, the good news is that it is likely the last month of downtrend before another rally begins. “If this chop-season lasts as long as the previous one, it will end around the start of October,” the crypto analyst stated. Day 190 of chop-season today. The previous summer chop lasted for 219 days, after which price more than doubled in the months that followed.

By the middle of the week, the Bitcoin price had completed the drawdown, prompting the analyst to move to the next phase of the prediction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Behavior Reminiscent Of 2019 As BTC Remains Below $60,000 According to him, the drawdown below $57,000 could mean that the BTC price is now ready for a recovery. He explained that “Didn’t get that move up first unfortunately but we have now hit my downside target so hopefully this just means we are now ready for that relief rally sooner rather than later.” The price crash also saw a massive wipe of open interest (OI) from the market, but the crypto analyst believes that this could be good, although buyers are yet to arrive. “Nice wipe on OI here but no immediate signs of buyers stepping in just yet,” Credible Crypto said. “Let’s see how things develop.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-summer-chop-end/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

33214742,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640018,1725531893,"XRP Releases $1,000,000,000 Tokens, How Will This Impact New Crypto Coin Mpeppe?","Ripple (XRP) recently unlocked another massive tranche of 1 billion XRP tokens from its escrow accounts, a routine but significant move that has once again stirred discussions in the crypto community. As XRP’s price dipped slightly following the release, the event raises questions about the broader impact on the cryptocurrency market, particularly on emerging coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Here’s a closer look at how Ripple’s latest move might influence Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) trajectory. How Is Mpeppe Positioned in a Volatile Market? Mpeppe (MPEPE), despite being a newcomer, has already shown its potential to capture market share in the highly competitive memecoin space. Its presale success and the growing community of supporters suggest that Mpeppe could be more than just a flash in the pan. However, its future success will likely depend on how well it can navigate the broader market dynamics, including the actions of major players like Ripple. The release of 1 billion XRP tokens adds a layer of complexity to the market, making it crucial for Mpeppe’s community and potential investors to stay informed and adaptable. If Ripple’s strategy leads to increased volatility in the market, Mpeppe could either suffer from the ensuing uncertainty or benefit as investors seek alternative assets. Ripple’s Strategic Management of XRP Supply Ripple’s monthly release of XRP tokens from escrow accounts is part of a well-established strategy that dates back to 2017. At that time, Ripple locked away 55 billion XRP in escrow accounts to control the circulating supply and mitigate market volatility. The idea behind this strategy was to create predictability in the market, ensuring that XRP’s supply would be managed carefully in accordance with market demand and Ripple’s operational needs. David Schwartz, Ripple’s CTO, has repeatedly emphasized that the tokens released monthly are not necessarily injected into the market immediately. Instead, Ripple retains the ability to manage the actual number of tokens that enter circulation, which can be lower than the unlocked amount. This level of control allows Ripple to respond dynamically to market conditions, ideally preventing any abrupt price changes due to oversupply. However, despite this calculated approach, Ripple’s latest release coincided with a 5.2% drop in XRP’s price, bringing it down to approximately $0.557. This decline has reignited debates within the crypto community about the effectiveness of Ripple’s escrow strategy, with some experts questioning whether this method is still the best option for the XRP network. The Ripple Effect on the Market The ripple effects (no pun intended) of these token releases extend beyond XRP alone. The broader cryptocurrency market, including emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE), could be impacted by the fluctuations in XRP’s supply and price. Investors and market observers are keenly aware of Ripple’s significant influence on the overall crypto landscape, and any substantial movements in XRP can cause ripples across other cryptocurrencies. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rapidly rising memecoin, is one such token that could feel the impact of Ripple’s actions. As a new player in the memecoin space, Mpeppe has garnered considerable attention for its explosive presale and strong community backing. However, the dynamics of the broader market, particularly with established giants like Ripple making significant moves, could influence Mpeppe’s trajectory. Ripple’s Strategic Crossroads: A Reassessment of Escrow Effectiveness David Schwartz himself has expressed doubts about the long-term efficacy of the escrow strategy. While it was designed to stabilize the XRP market by controlling supply, Schwartz has hinted that the time may have come to reassess its effectiveness. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has even suggested more radical options, such as the possibility of destroying the remaining XRP tokens in escrow. This move, if it were to happen, could create a scarcity effect, potentially driving up the value of XRP. Such a decision would not only have a profound impact on XRP but also on the broader market, including new entrants like Mpeppe. The scarcity effect could draw investor attention back to XRP, potentially diverting funds away from smaller, emerging tokens like Mpeppe. On the other hand, if Ripple’s actions are perceived as an attempt to artificially inflate XRP’s value, it could lead to a loss of investor confidence, pushing them towards alternative investments like Mpeppe. Synopsis: The Road Ahead for Mpeppe and Ripple As Ripple continues to manage its vast supply of XRP tokens, the broader market, including emerging tokens like Mpeppe, will need to adjust to these developments. While Ripple’s strategy has been designed to create predictability, the recent price drop in XRP suggests that the market’s reaction is far from certain. For Mpeppe (MPEPE), the key to success will be its ability to carve out a niche in this ever-evolving landscape. As Ripple grapples with its long-term strategy, Mpeppe could either find itself overshadowed by XRP or emerge as a resilient contender in the memecoin arena. Investors will need to closely monitor these developments to make informed decisions in the coming months.

Recently, the Floki Inu (FLOKI) community has faced a series of challenges that have shaken confidence in this once-prominent meme token. However, as Floki Inu (FLOKI) stumbles, a new contender is rising to the occasion: Mpeppe (MPEPE), which is rapidly becoming the fastest-growing meme coin of 2024. Floki’s (FLOKI) Recent Struggles Floki Inu (FLOKI) has been a significant player in the meme coin market, often mentioned alongside other major tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Despite its earlier success, Floki Inu (FLOKI) has recently hit a rough patch. On August 29, 2024, Floki Inu (FLOKI) experienced a significant snapshot crash that caused its value to plummet by 25%. This drop was a heavy blow to the Floki Inu (FLOKI) community, which has prided itself on holding long-term in anticipation of future utility and growth. Despite the efforts of whales and other major holders to stabilize the price, Floki Inu (FLOKI) has struggled to recover. Currently trading around $0.00012, Floki Inu (FLOKI) remains well below its peak, leading many investors to reconsider their positions. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Meme Coin on the Block Amidst Floki Inu (FLOKI)’s downturn, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has risen as a beacon of hope for those looking to recapture the explosive gains often seen in the early days of meme coins. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique appeal lies in its innovative staking mechanisms and a strong, community-driven approach that has quickly garnered a dedicated following. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its potential for rapid growth. The coin has already shown signs of a meteoric rise, with its presale stages selling out at an unprecedented pace. Investors are drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) not just for its meme value but also for its structured approach to growth, offering a well-planned pathway to significant returns. The Shift from Floki Inu (FLOKI) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) The transition of investors from Floki Inu (FLOKI) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a clear indicator of the shifting tides within the meme coin market. While Floki Inu (FLOKI) has been attempting to solidify its position through utility and partnerships, the allure of quick, substantial profits has led many to reconsider their holdings. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s aggressive marketing and community engagement strategies have played a crucial role in attracting these investors. The coin’s presale has seen massive participation, with whales and retail investors alike flocking to get in on what could be the next big meme coin success story. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Could Be the Next Big Thing As FLOKI Inu (FLOKI) continues to face challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum as the next potential 100X opportunity. Its early success, coupled with strong community support, suggests that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could follow in the footsteps of earlier meme coin giants. Investors who are diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE) are doing so with the expectation that this new coin could deliver the kind of returns that Floki Inu (FLOKI) once promised. The market’s enthusiasm for Mpeppe (MPEPE) is growing, and many believe it could become one of the fastest-growing meme coins of 2024. Conclusion The meme coin market is ever-evolving, with fortunes being made and lost in the blink of an eye. As Floki Inu (FLOKI) struggles to maintain its position, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming the go-to choice for investors looking to capitalize on the next big opportunity. With its promising start and growing community, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to become a dominant force in the meme coin space, potentially outpacing Floki Inu (FLOKI) and other established tokens in the race for explosive growth.

42390436,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1j9Z,1725530400,Blockstream Mining Raises Fresh Round of Note That Offers Exposure to Bitcoin Hashrate,"Blockstream started a third round of sales for its tokenized note, BMN2  The round will be priced at $31,000 and give investors a share of the bitcoin produced by the mining company.  The hashrate-backed note allows investors to lock in the hashprice for up to four years, Blockstream said.  Blockstream Mining said it is opening a third round of investment for its hashrate-backed tokenized note, which gives participants a slice of the bitcoin {{BTC}} earned from the company's mining activities over the next four years.  Two earlier rounds of the BMN2 note raised a total of around $7 million. The third will be priced at $31,000 and give holders the bitcoin produced by 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of hashrate. The sale will last for three weeks, a company spokesperson said in an interview. Blockstream is targeting $10 million in investment for the latest round.  ""Blockstream is able to offer mining for under 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), which is far below the industry average,” the spokesperson said. “Anyone investing in BMN2 will benefit from access to the most cost-effective mining around.”  The company, co-founded by legendary bitcoin developer Adam Back, is working with Stokr for the sale of the note.  Crypto markets are becoming increasingly financialized, and hashrate-backed contracts are not new. What’s unique about Blockstream’s note is its duration. Most contracts lock in the hashprice for up to 12 months, James Macedonio, Blockstream's SVP global head of mining sales and business development, said. BMN2, an EU-compliant security token, gives exposure to the bitcoin hashrate over a 48-month period.  Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. Hashprice is a mining metric that calculates revenue on a per terahash basis, and is computed using network difficulty, the bitcoin price, the block subsidy and transaction fees.  The advantage of buying Blockstream’s BMN2 note instead of buying hashrate futures from bitcoin mining companies is that investors are not exposed to counterparty risk or possible miner failures, and the price is locked in for four years, Macedonio said. Furthermore, the market hashprice adjusts quarterly, and is dependent on mining efficiency, and passes through risks such as energy price and counterparty risk, he added.  ""With the bitcoin mining market currently experiencing historically low hashprice levels, BMN2 allows investors to strategically enter the market at an opportune time,"" the company said in a July release announcing the note.  In a report last month, Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) noted that the hashprice is about 30% below levels seen in September 2022 and about 40% below the level before April's reward halving.  Investors in the note’s predecessor, BMN1, were mainly international family offices and funds in Europe, Macedonio said. While BMN2 is starting to see interest from U.S. institutions, the product is not being offered there yet, he said. Macedonio said many BMN1 investors rolled over their investment into BMN2.  BMN1 was highly successful. It “mined over 1,242 BTC and delivered returns of up to 103% over its three-year term,” Stokr said on its website. It is the ""highest payout in real world asset (RWA) security token history,"" according to Arnab Naskar, co-founder and co-CEO of Stokr.  BMN2's first two investor rounds started on July 18 and ended Aug. 12. Anchor investors who committed over $500,000 in investment were given a discount and invested in series 1. Investors who rolled over their investment from Blockstream’s BMN1 note and new backers invested in series 2.  Money raised from the sale of the note is used to manage physical infrastructure and energy costs because Blockstream is responsible for producing the hashrate that backs the note. The company has mining facilities in Georgia, Montreal and Texas.  The tokenised note will trade on crypto exchange Bitfinex.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/05/blockstream-mining-starts-third-investment-round-for-hashrate-backed-tokenized-note,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1bdcebb1d44752a3cf516316a50e307c904632b-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390431,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1ip3,1725528476,"Ether CME Futures Volume Shrinks as ETH ETFs Disappoint, Crypto Market Ducks Risk","Ether futures volumes on CME slipped in August as bitcoin volumes rose.  Globally, there has been a shift from alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin.  Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the ether {{ETH}} price debuted in the U.S. late July, opening doors for investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency while bypassing the hassle of storing it.  Since then, activity in ether derivatives listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has cooled, according to CCData, a digital assets data provider based in London.  Trading volume in ether futures declined 28.7% to $14.8 billion in August, the lowest since December 2023. Volume in ether options fell 37% to $567 million.  ""This decline in trading volumes for ETH instruments suggests lower-than-expected institutional interest in the asset, particularly following the launch of spot ETH ETFs,"" CCData noted. ""The reduced inflows into spot ETH ETFs in August further support this trend. Additionally, seasonality effects in August may have also contributed to the decreased trading activity, with this trend likely to continue into September.""  Before the advent of spot ETFs, futures and futures-based ETFs were the only regulated avenues available for traditional stateside institutions. The spot products are generally perceived as superior to futures-based ETFs as the latter are vulnerable to ""contango bleed."" That said, demand for spot ETFs has not been impressive either.  Data tracked by Farside Investors show ether ETFs have registered a net outflow of over $500 million since their debut. Bitcoin ETFs, in contrast, saw a net inflow of over $300 million in the first six weeks.  ""The launch timing of U.S. spot Ether ETFs on 23 July turned out to be less than ideal, coinciding with a tech stock sell-off. Ether’s high beta (~2.7) implies high losses in periods of risk aversion, and Ether prices had now seen a 30% drawdown since launch,"" DBS Treasuries said in a market insights post on Wednesday.  Ether's price fell over 22% to $2,512 in August, its biggest monthly percentage slide since June 2022, amid volatility in traditional markets and crypto market leader bitcoin.  Shift toward bitcoin  Globally, there has been a shift toward market leader bitcoin, a sign crypto investors are becoming risk averse in the wake of the stalled bull run.  In August, volume in CME's bitcoin futures rose 3.74% to $104 billion, according to CCData. Still, the volume of BTC options traded fell 13.4% to $2.42 billion.  Data tracked by Wintermute show bitcoin futures now account for 48% of the total notional open interest in the crypto futures market, while alternative cryptocurrencies, including ether, account for the rest. In March, when optimism was at its peak, bitcoin represented just 31% of the global open interest.  ""This shift toward higher market cap assets like bitcoin signals a more conservative market sentiment, with traders displaying less appetite for risk and speculative positions in smaller, more volatile cryptocurrencies,"" Jake Ostrovskis, an over-the-counter trader at Wintermute, said in a market note shared with CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/05/ether-cme-futures-volume-shrinks-as-eth-etfs-disappoint-crypto-market-ducks-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/519cf415cd3500061f3505487374c191faaa946f-1412x720.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After reaching a peak of over $4,000 in March, Ethereum has been consistently declining, failing to break out of this bearish trend. So far, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has seen its price drop by over 5.9% in the past two weeks, and it continues to hover around the $2,400 mark. Currently trading at $2,434, Ethereum has fallen 2.4% in the last week and 0.4% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Headed For Trouble? Analyst Warns Of Surging Exchange Reserves Is A Rebound To $4,000 Around The Corner? Despite this downturn, market analysts remain optimistic about a potential turnaround. According to a recent post by ‘The Moon’ on X, Ethereum might be primed to rally back to $4,000—if certain technical conditions are met. Particularly, The Moon highlighted Ethereum’s current 1D Falling Wedge formation, a common chart pattern in technical analysis often indicating a potential reversal. The analyst stated, “Once a breakout occurs, there’s a strong possibility Ethereum could rise back to $4K.” For context, a falling wedge in technical analysis is a pattern where the price of an asset is in a downtrend but within a narrowing range. This pattern usually suggests that downward momentum is weakening, and once the price breaks above the wedge, a reversal could occur. This is what The Moon predicts for Ethereum—a potential breakout could lead to a surge back to previous highs. Ethereum Experiencing Rise In Bullish Sentiments Meanwhile, other analysts in the crypto community have shared similar bullish sentiments about Ethereum’s future performance. Renowned crypto analyst Crypto Jack has pointed out that Ethereum’s price is nearing a key long-term support level. Jack said a bounce from $2,200 could signal a strong reversal and potentially lead to a bullish trend. This long-term support level could be crucial for Ethereum as it tries to regain momentum after weeks of sluggish performance. The price of $ETH is approaching long term support. A bounce from $2.2k for #Ethereum could be extremely bullish. pic.twitter.com/pepeDZm5FA — CryptoJack (@cryptojack) September 4, 2024 Adding to the bullish outlook is crypto analyst Mags, who recently noted on X that Ethereum is currently trading inside a massive triangle pattern. Related Reading: Is Ethereum’s Price Under Pressure? Here Is What Futures Data Signals According to Mags, this formation, combined with the possibility of a double bottom near the upward-sloping trendline, could signal that Ethereum is poised for a significant upward move. A double bottom occurs when an asset forms two low points at roughly the same price level, indicating strong support and the potential for a bullish reversal.

Currently trading at $4.62, Toncoin is below a critical support level that analysts believe is essential for a price recovery. Toncoin Faces Critical Support Challenge In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted the urgency for Toncoin to reclaim the $4.70 mark soon. Failure to do so could trigger a significant correction of up to 45%, potentially dropping the token to around $2.60. Martinez noted that the token’s three-day chart is forming a head and shoulders pattern, which indicates that if Toncoin cannot consolidate above the $4.70 level, it may invalidate the bullish outlook and lead to a steep decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Points To $55,000 As Potential Bottom – US Liquidity The Key The backdrop to this turmoil includes the recent arrest of Pavel Durov in France at the end of August. Reports indicate that Durov was taken into custody for initial questioning related to serious allegations against Telegram, including claims that the platform facilitated criminal activities such as fraud, drug trafficking, and the dissemination of child pornography. Additionally, the app has faced criticism for its perceived lack of content moderation and alleged connections to extremist groups. Durov’s arrest has sparked a wave of backlash from Russian politicians, some of whom suggest that the detention may be politically motivated. Tatyana Moskalkova, Russia’s top human rights official, claimed that French authorities aimed to undermine Telegram, a platform known for its emphasis on privacy and free speech. Potential Ban Looms For Telegram The legal troubles for Telegram extend beyond France, as the Indian government has initiated an investigation into the messaging app. Concerns have arisen regarding its use for criminal activities, including extortion and gambling. Allegations suggest that Telegram’s peer-to-peer communication features have been exploited by “bad actors” to facilitate illicit actions. Complicating matters, Telegram lacks a physical office in India, which hampers the government’s ability to regulate and investigate the platform effectively. Related Reading: Analyst Says Litecoin Will Outperform Bitcoin And Large Cap Cryptos With 11,000% Breakout Depending on the investigation’s findings, Telegram could face significant repercussions, including a potential ban in India. This ongoing scrutiny of the platform and its leadership poses additional challenges for Toncoin, as market sentiment continues to be influenced by developments surrounding Telegram and its CEO. It remains to be seen whether positive outcomes on these legal matters could provide the much-needed catalyst for TON to rally in the coming days, as the market continues to show a lack of demand and buying pressure led by the largest cryptocurrencies on the market.

Bitcoin Has Declined More Than 3% In The Last 24 Hours Bitcoin has continued its recent bearish momentum in the past day as its price has observed a further plunge, coming down to the $56,600 level. The chart below shows what the asset’s latest performance has looked like. During this plunge, Bitcoin briefly went down to the $55,600 level for the first time since the first-third of August. Despite the coin’s rebound, its price has been down more than 3% over the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Beware: MVRV Has Given Bear Market Signal The rest of the crypto market has also not been spared, with the altcoins seeing similar or worse returns than the original digital asset. Given this latest market volatility, it would be expected that the derivatives side would have seen a shakeup. Crypto Derivatives Market Has Just Witnessed High Liquidations According to data from CoinGlass, the crypto derivatives market has registered a high amount of liquidations in the last 24 hours. A contract is said to be “liquidated” when its exchange has to forcibly shut it down due to it amassing losses of a certain degree (the exact percentage of which may differ between platforms). Below is a table that breaks down the latest liquidation data for the sector. As is visible, the crypto derivatives market has seen $200 million in liquidations during the past day. Almost $170 million of the flush involved the long side, representing 85% of the total. The liquidations being so lopsided towards these investors betting on a bullish outcome is naturally because the sector as a whole has plunged in this window. Bitcoin has topped the charts regarding the individual share of the liquidations, with $55 million in contracts related to the coin taking a beating. Ethereum (ETH), the second largest crypto by market cap, hasn’t been far, though, as it has seen over $50 million in liquidations. Solana (SOL) has seen the most liquidations at under $13 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Drop To $40,600 If This Happens, Crypto Analyst Says The Bitcoin Open Interest, a measure of the number of positions related to the currently open asset, has seen a cooldown alongside this mass liquidation event, suggesting new speculators haven’t jumped in just yet.

The cryptocurrency showed strength throughout the retraces, displaying green numbers in most timeframes after recovering. Its performance gathered the attention of crypto analysts, who consider the token could become a top narrative at the end of the year. As a result, crypto whales have turned their eyes to the token, accumulating millions of dollars worth of AAVE in the past month. Related Reading: FET Price Targets $3.4 After Breakout, Here Are The Key Levels To Watch Whales Continue Buying Spree AAVE became one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies since August, rising nearly 63.5% in the last 30 days. This performance sparked renewed interest in the token, driving whales to accumulate it throughout the past two weeks. Since August 20, the crypto lending protocol’s token caught the attention of several whales. As reported by on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain, large investors have purchased around 170,382 tokens, worth $22.27 million, in the last two weeks. One whale took advantage of the price drops and accumulated over 120,000 AAVE since August 21. This whale used 4,000 stETH to buy 77,270 AAVE tokens two weeks ago. The purchase was valued at $10.4 million, with an average token price of $135. On Wednesday morning, the same investor bought another 50,604 tokens, worth around $6.78 million. After the buying spree, the whale holds 125,605 AAVE, worth $16.9 million, purchased at an average price of $134.6. AAVE Recovers $130 Support Zone AAVE’s price dropped over 12% to $116 as Bitcoin dropped below the $57,000 mark on Tuesday night. However, the token quickly regained over 16% of its price to trade above the $135 range. The price recovery appears to be fueled by whale activity and recent reports of a Trump link, as noted by some analysts. On Wednesday, reports suggested that Donald Trump’s crypto project, “World Liberty Financial,” will be a DeFi lending platform based on Aave and Ethereum. Following the news, Altcoin Sherpa highlighted the token’s “nice move,” adding that it “undoubtedly” is one of the strongest cryptocurrencies in the market. Nonetheless, the analysts suggested that AAVE might continue to chop around the current price range in the short term. According to Nebraskangooner, the token has one of the “best-looking monthly charts” but will continue to depend on the broader market’s performance. To the analyst, AAVE’s price will likely go down if the market drops. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Leads Memecoins Recovery With 12% Jump, Is $2.2 The Next Stop? However, he also considers it is worth keeping an eye on as it could be one of the best-performing assets “if the market finds a good support level.” Crypto trader CrediBull also suggested that the token could target the $150 mark if Bitcoin and Ethereum bounce from the current levels. As of this writing, AAVE is trading at $130, a 1.2% drop in the last 24 hours.

33207993,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639865,1725516050,Crypto Market Stuck In A Rut? Here’s Why 2024 Bitcoin Breakout May Be Delayed,"The crypto market has been struggling with prolonged sideways movement in recent months. Since March 2024, the market has failed to make a successful breakout above previous peaks, leaving investors frustrated. According to a recent report by CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan, this continuous pattern of stagnation leads many to wonder when the market might see a significant rebound. While there are some short-term factors that may provide relief, the overall sentiment in the crypto space remains cautious. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $68,000 In September: Could This Be The Turning Point? Is The Crypto Market Stuck? One key observation made by Crypto Dan is the emergence of a “Dead Cross” on the short-term and long-term SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) moving averages. This is a bearish signal in technical analysis, indicating that selling pressure is likely to outweigh buying pressure. It suggests that traders may be locking in profits rather than betting on further gains. The persistence of this trend as highlighted by Dan raises questions about whether a meaningful recovery is on the horizon, or if the market is headed for a longer period of consolidation. Looking ahead, one potential catalyst Dan pointed out for the market movement is the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting on September 18, where a base rate cut is anticipated. Historically, rate cuts have tended to inject positive sentiment into financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. A reduction in interest rates could result in an influx of liquidity into riskier assets like Bitcoin and altcoins, as investors seek higher returns. This could trigger a short-term rally, offering some relief from the stagnation observed in recent months. However, Dan warns that while a short-term rebound might occur, it may not lead to a sustained bullish trend unless there is a significant shift in market conditions. When Will A Breakout Finally Happen? The fundamental outlook for the crypto space remains mixed, with macroeconomic factors such as inflation and recession concerns still weighing heavily on investor sentiment. If these factors do not improve, Dan noted that it is likely that frustrating, low-volatility movements could persist well into 2024. In his words: Due to the expected US base rate cut on September 18, a short-term rebound due to positive market sentiment can be expected, but if the market atmosphere is not significantly reversed, it is highly likely that frustrating movements will continue in 2024. Although actively monitoring the crypto market at this current state may feel discouraging. However, Crypto Dan emphasizes that “patience” will be key for long-term investors.

The price is now trading below $520 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $500 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could gain bearish momentum if it settles below the $500 support zone. BNB Price Dips Again After struggling to test the $540 resistance, BNB price started a fresh decline like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price declined below the $532 and $520 support levels. There was also a move below $510. Finally, the price found support at $495. A low was formed at $496 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with support at $500 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The pair is now trading below $525 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $518 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $538 swing high to the $496 low. The next resistance sits near the $522 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $538 swing high to the $496 low. A clear move above the $522 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $535. A close above the $535 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $540 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $550 level in the near term. More Downsides? If BNB fails to clear the $522 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $500 level. The next major support is near the $496 level. The main support sits at $488. If there is a downside break below the $488 support, the price could drop toward the $465 support.

33206307,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639815,1725512404,Ethereum Slides But Flips Bitcoin In This Key Metric: Time To Load Up?,"Ethereum is down nearly 35% from July highs and roughly 40% from 2024 peaks. While there is hope among holders that the coin will expand, breaking local resistance, the short-term trend favors sellers. From the daily chart, not only is ETH struggling to gain momentum and push above $2,800, but sellers have been relentless, diffusing any attempt higher. As the coin is capped below $2,500 at press time and actively aligning with the selling pressure of late August, Santiment analysts have picked out an interesting development. Ethereum Register More Users Than Bitcoin In a post on X, the sentiment analysis platform notes that though prices are down at spot rates, the network is interestingly resilient, especially looking at user growth metrics. Related Reading: Analyst Says Litecoin Will Outperform Bitcoin And Large Cap Cryptos With 11,000% Breakout In the last three months, the number of unique Ethereum addresses has been growing steadily, outpacing those of Bitcoin. However, it still lags the number of USDT addresses over the same period. To put in the number, as of September 3, Santiment analysts noted that Bitcoin had 54.18 million unique wallets, down 0.1% in three months. At the same period, Ethereum boasted of more than 126.96 million addresses, up 3.3%. The rise in the number of new users in Ethereum signals confidence in the network and even possible rising adoption despite challenging market conditions. Meanwhile, USDT, the fiat-pegged stablecoin, had 5.99 million addresses, up 4% in three months. Of the three, the rapid growth of USDT addresses in the last three months could signal overall apprehensiveness among traders. As crypto prices contract, holders choose to convert their holdings to USDT, explaining the increase. Another interpretation of this development is that more new users are keen to explore crypto. By holding USDT via custodial wallets or through exchanges like Binance, they will readily splash on Bitcoin or any other top altcoin whenever the time is ready. Bitcoin And Ethereum Whale Activity Declining Even so, while there is growth in the number of users, whale activity, Santiment analysts observe, has been declining. Of note, the number of whale transactions has been down since Q1 2024 after prices peaked. Surging prices, coupled with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially in the United States, revived interest, explaining expansion in whale activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Beware: MVRV Has Given Bear Market Signal Considering the general contraction of prices, Santiment analysts predict whale activity to drop. This outlook will only change once there is volatility spurred by Ethereum or Bitcoin prices ripping above key liquidation levels in the short to medium term.

The price might struggle to clear the range resistance at $0.5720 and $0.5800. XRP price started a decent increase from the $0.5330 zone. The price is now trading below $0.5650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5520 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could decline again if it fails to stay above $0.5520 and $0.5500. XRP Price Faces Hurdles XRP price extended losses below $0.540 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price tested the $0.5330 zone and recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $0.5420 and $0.5440 resistance levels. The price was able to clear the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5720 swing high to the $0.5333 low. There was a move above the $0.5550 level. However, the bears seem to be active near the $0.5625 and $0.5640 levels. The price is now trading below $0.5650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5520 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5625 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5720 swing high to the $0.5333 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.5650 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5720. A clear move above the $0.5720 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5850 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.5880 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.600 resistance or even $0.6060 in the near term. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5625 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5525 level and the trend line. The next major support is $0.5500. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5550 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.540 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.5320. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

According to CoinGecko, Monero gained nearly 13% since last week, putting the coin under the spotlight as one of the strongest gainers within the bear market. Related Reading: RENDER Flashes Red With 18% Short-Term Loss – Details Monero’s simplicity lends itself to its focus on privacy and reliability, providing great value for both investors and users of the platform. This led to Monero’s semi-autonomous price movement which might continue despite the market’s bearish nature. Monero Utilization Jumps On CoinCards CoinCards, a gift card vendor, recently released some statistics about cryptocurrency use on its platform. According to the platform, Monero has the monopoly beating Bitcoin in utilization. This huge utilization is due to Monero’s simplicity and utility, garnering the attention of analysts on X. Although the market is overwhelmingly bearish, analysts show bullishness with predictions about XMR’s future performance. “While everything else looks like pre-death, the privacy coin is making higher lows and higher highs. Complete decoupling from the market,” said Crypto Van Der Linde, a cryptanalyst on the X platform. Although Binance and Kraken have delisted XMR for their customers, the token still has a large user base that is mostly concerned with their privacy. With more individuals considering privacy to be a core issue, we might see cryptocurrency users using XMR despite its downsides of slow transaction times. Rally Turns Sluggish As of writing, Monero is well between the $170-$174 trading range giving the bulls a great position for more upside potential. However, the market’s bearishness has bled through to XMR’s market, slowing down gains in the long term. XMR’s less-than-significant correlation with Bitcoin makes the coin more attractive to investors scouring the market for profit-generating cryptocurrencies within the bearish market. The relative strength index (RSI) shows that although the coin has bullish momentum, XMR bulls are nearing exhaustion in the short term. Related Reading: SUI Crashes 23% As September Unleashes Market Panic—Is A Comeback Possible? The coin’s trading range is pretty weak as the bears are gathering momentum to cancel out short-term gains. Long-term, however, it seems that XMR bulls will rest and gather momentum before another attempt to regain lost ground. As it currently stands, XMR eyes a breakthrough on $190 in the short term, providing a support level for the bulls to prepare for a strong upward movement. After this movement, investors and traders can target $200 in the long term. However, if XMR succumbs to the bearish momentum within the market, the coin might retrace back to $164 with more possible losses in the short term.

33201399,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=639756,1725501631,"Bitcoin Could Drop To $40,600 If This Happens, Crypto Analyst Says","An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could witness a drop to the $40,600 level based on a pattern forming in its 2-month price chart. Bitcoin Has Seen A TD Sequential Sell Signal On Its 2-Month Price In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that has formed in the 2-month price of Bitcoin. The TD Sequential is an indicator in technical analysis (TA) that’s generally used for spotting positions of probable reversal in any asset’s price. This indicator involves two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of these setups, candles of the same color (that is, whether red or green) are counted up to nine. After these nine candles are in, the asset could be assumed to have reached a point of turnaround. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Beware: MVRV Has Given Bear Market Signal Naturally, if the candles that led to the setup’s completion were green, then the TD Sequential would give a sell signal. Similarly, red candles could suggest a bottom may be here. Once the setup is done with, the second phase of the indicator, the countdown, begins. The countdown works much like the setup, with the main difference being that candles here are counted up to thirteen, instead of nine. Following these thirteen candles, the asset may be considered to have reached another potential top or bottom. Bitcoin has completed a TD Sequential phase of the former type recently. Here is the 2-month price chart of the cryptocurrency shared by the analyst, which shows this signal: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin 2-month price has recently finished a TD Sequential setup with nine green candles, implying that the cryptocurrency may have encountered some kind of top. Since the signal has appeared, BTC has been on the way down, with its price currently under the $57,000 level. Thus, it’s possible that this pattern’s bearish effect may already be taking hold. As for how deep this drawdown can take Bitcoin, Martinez has pointed out the support level at $51,000. This level corresponds to the 0.236 Fibonacci Retracement level from the recent BTC top. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP See Declining Whale Activity: What It Means Fibonacci Retracement levels are based on the Fibonacci series, where dividing each number (beyond 5) in the series by the next numbers produces ratios that are consistent throughout the series. It’s possible that Bitcoin may find support at the next such important ratio, but the analyst notes that if the $51,000 support gets breached, the cryptocurrency could end up going all the way down to $40,600, which corresponds to the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement level. In the scenario that BTC does end up revisiting this level, its price would have gone through a drawdown of more than 28% from the current level. It now remains to be seen how the asset’s trajectory plays out from here. BTC Price Bitcoin has furthered its latest decline during the past day as its price has now slipped to $56,600.

Though Robinhood Crypto LLC abandoned that policy in 2022, on Wednesday its past practices earned a $3.9 million slap on the wrist from the state of California.  The California Department of Justice settled its investigation into what Robinhood's chief lawyer called ""historical practices"" in the popular trading app's crypto business from 2018 through 2022  The state's investigation notably treated the various cryptocurrencies that people can buy and sell through Robinhood as commodities. By allowing customers to buy cryptos but failing to let them take personal custody of the assets, the company violated California commodities law, according to a press release from California's Department of Justice.  Under the settlement Robinhood must continue to allow its customers to withdraw their cryptocurrencies from the app, as well as update disclosures regarding its custody practices.  Robinhood Crypto had previously disclosed it received a number of subpoenas from the California Attorney General regarding its trading platform, its business and operations and its coin listings – in addition to its disclosures and custody of customer assets. A spokesperson at Robinhood said to CoinDesk: ""there is no ongoing investigation and this resolves the CA AG inquiry.""  ""We are pleased to put this matter behind us,"" said Lucas Moskowitz, Robinhood Markets' general counsel in an emailed statement.

US Senator Cynthia Lummis is at the forefront of this movement, advocating for the Bitcoin Act, which aims to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States. A Bold Solution For Fiscal Crisis In a recent interview with Bankless, Lummis articulated her vision for the Bitcoin Act, highlighting its potential to address the nation’s staggering $35 trillion debt, which she argues has no viable solutions under current fiscal policies. Lummis believes that creating a Bitcoin reserve is the only rational approach to managing this debt crisis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Points To $55,000 As Potential Bottom – US Liquidity The Key The proposed mechanism for the Bitcoin reserve involves the US government repurposing gold certificates, which are currently valued at their historical rates from 1917, to their present market value of approximately $2,400. The senator plans to use the differential to purchase BTC over a five-year period, with a target of acquiring over one million BTC—roughly 5% of the total supply—storing them securely in cold storage for twenty years. Lummis asserts that this strategy could effectively cut in half the national debt by 2045. Lummis emphasized that this approach further allows the government to invest in Bitcoin without impacting the US balance sheet or accruing additional debt. She views Bitcoin as a solution she has sought throughout her career, arguing that its characteristics as a non-government-issued asset make it a more reliable backing for fiat currencies compared to traditional stocks or other fiat currencies. Global ‘Arms Race’ For Bitcoin? Addressing concerns about the devaluation of the US dollar, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when unprecedented amounts of US dollars were printed, Lummis highlighted BTC’s scarcity as a key differentiator. She described it as a true diversifier that does not suffer from the same inflationary pressures as fiat currencies. In a thought-provoking statement, Lummis suggested that the future may see an “arms race” not for weapon dominance, but for Bitcoin as a secure store of value. She noted that countries like the US, China, and Russia are increasingly competing to establish themselves as leaders in crypto. Following her remarks at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference, there has been a notable increase in constituent letters urging support for the Bitcoin Act. The legislation has now been referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for further consideration. Related Reading: Is Chainlink (LINK) Sliding To $9? On-Chain Metrics Expose Weak Network Activity This push for a Bitcoin reserve aligns with Trump’s vision to position the United States as the “crypto capital of the planet.” The former president has stressed the importance of maintaining robust Bitcoin and cryptocurrency reserves, warning that neglecting this opportunity could allow nations like China to gain an upper hand in the global financial landscape. Trump has reiterated Bitcoin’s potential as a modern currency, citing endorsements from individuals within his circle and urging the government to recognize its benefits.

As part of his bullish prediction, the crypto analyst also revealed what could lead to XRP rising to $18. XRP Price To Rise To $8 If Repeat Of 2017 Bull Run Occurs Dark Defender predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP would rise to $8 if a repeat of the 2017 bull run were to occur. Back then, XRP recorded a price rally of 61,000% in 280 days to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.84. Related Reading: Major Dogecoin Indicator Flashes Bullish, Is It Time To Buy? The crypto analyst seemed confident about this 2017 price surge happening again, stating that the XRP community is having a “deja vu of 2017 by standing weeks in front of the XRP bull run.” Dark Defender added that if a similar run is in place, $18.22, the Fibonacci level of 361.80%, is expected to be the upper target level of XRP’s Wave 3 impulsive move. From the accompanying chart, this projected move to $8 and possibly $18 is expected to occur sometime between October and early 2025. The crypto analyst also provided an analysis of XRP’s current price action and highlighted critical support levels XRP needs to hold above if it is to rise to this unprecedented height. Firstly, he noted that the crypto has been consolidating between $0.3917 and $0.6649. Meanwhile, in the weekly time frame, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) dips have formed a parallel with price dips. At the same time, the weekly RSI Golden Cross is said to be in place. Dark Defender again highlighted the importance of the $0.6649 price level. He claimed that this level, above the weekly Ichimoku clouds, is a “crucial marker” that must be in place before XRP makes its parabolic run. The analyst also noted that $0.5286 and $0.4623 are critical support levels, which XRP holders should keep an eye on. XRP Could Rally By 5,000% And Rise To $27 Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has also offered a more bullish price prediction for XRP, suggesting that the crypto could enjoy a 5,000% price gain and rise to $27. As a more conservative price prediction, he remarked that XRP could enjoy a 2,400% price gain and climb to $17. He made these predictions based on the Bullish Hammer Candle Stick formations, which he noted have historically produced massive price gains for XRP. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $40,000, But There’s Good News This isn’t the first time Egrag has predicted that XRP could rise to as high as $27 in this bull run.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.55, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
