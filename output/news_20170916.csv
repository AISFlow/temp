42400431,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYeK,1505573164,Institutional Cryptoeconomics: A New Model for a New Century,"Chris Berg, Sinclair Davidson and Jason Potts are with the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub in Melbourne, Australia.  In this opinion piece, the authors discuss why blockchain may be more disruptive than the so-called 'general purpose technologies' that transformed society in recent centuries.      While cryptoeconomics is already a vibrant research field, the study of the blockchain must not be left solely to computer scientists and game theorists.  The rollout of blockchain technology raises complex questions in economics, public policy, law, sociology and political economy. What we call ""institutional cryptoeconomics"" starts from a simple premise – the blockchain is not just a new general purpose technology, it is a new institutional technology.  This may sound like a pedantic distinction, but the difference between these two conceptions is  profound. General purpose technologies allow us to do what we already do better, faster and cheaper. Economists understand general purpose technologies (like steam power or the semi-conductor) as great engines of economic growth.  There is no doubt that the blockchain is a general purpose technology, but it is much more.  Rather, the blockchain is a new mechanism to coordinate economic activity and to facilitate cooperation between individuals. It opens up new opportunities for exchange, for collaboration and for building communities that were previously closed off due to high information costs and transactions costs.  Old thinking  As a new institutional technology, we expect that blockchains will disrupt and transform both economic activity and social organization. Institutional cryptoeconomics is a new analytic framework to study that evolutionary process.  In the very first instance, we believe that the transaction costs approach of Oliver Williamson – who won the Nobel in economics in 2009 – is the ideal theoretical framework to understand the blockchain. Williamson was primarily interested in understanding the 'make' or 'buy' decisions that firms have to resolve.  Is it better the buy inputs on the open market or produce them in-house?  That choice defined the limits of the firm, which in turn determined the incentive structures that decision makers faced.  A key determinant of the limits of the firm is ""opportunism"" or ""self-interest seeking with guile"" as Williamson described human behavior.  The combination of opportunism and asset specificity (which refers to how easily an investment can be resold or repurposed for another use) meant that complex economic behavior had to take place in large corporations. This in turn implied the need for substantial financial capital investment.  Thus, we saw the dominance of shareholder capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries.  New paradigm  The blockchain breaks this relationship between size, opportunism and asset specificity.  By substantially eliminating opportunism (that is, being a 'trustless' technology), the blockchain allows specific assets to be deployed in small businesses supported not by large amounts of financial capital but by large amounts of human capital. It allows market incentives to deeper penetrate into firm structures resolving problems of team production.  For many industries, the blockchain will radically redefine the boundaries of the firm, allowing individuals to trade their talents and skills in an environment devoid of big business.  The eclipse of the large public firm has been predicted before, of course, but this time we believe those predictions will eventuate for many, if not most, industries.  The decline of shareholder capitalism will have ricochet effects across the economy and society itself. It will put new pressures on employment, inequality, political power and the regulatory state. And it opens up vast new opportunities. The Williamson framework can also help us understand how the blockchain changes – and enhances – the provision of insurance, the provision of public goods, and the provision and protection of identity.  It is often said that we are at the start of a ""blockchain revolution."" Institutional cryptoeconomics offers an exciting way to understand what features of the ancien régime we’re about to lose, and what might take its place.

42400433,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYgI,1505568613,"Bitcoin in the Browser: Google, Apple and More Adopting Crypto-Ready API","Developers at some of the top tech companies have created a browser API that could soon make it easier to buy goods and services online with cryptocurrency.  The work, started by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with the help of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple and Mozilla, is a tangible step forward for a currency-agnostic web payment standard first conceived in 2013. Equally, as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gain more momentum, the launch signifies the growing recognition of cryptocurrency as a payments technology.  Announced on Thursday, the API is currently being implemented in browsers including Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Edge, Apple’s Webkit, Mozilla’s Firefox, the Samsung Internet Browser and Facebook's in-app browser. When activated, the Payment Request API will allow new payment information for bitcoin, ether and other more traditional online payment methods to be stored directly in the browser.  Consumers will then be able to choose from a drop-down menu of available payment methods supported, a kind of expansion on the auto-fill feature already widely enabled at checkout.  With that potential new functionality, Ian Jacobs, head of the W3C's payments activity, said now is a good time for developers to start writing code for payment methods they'd like to see available.  In an exclusive interview, Jacobs told CoinDesk:  ""This is a great opportunity for people to start writing blockchain-based payment method descriptions and to try to test the API. That's sort of the period that we're in, the test and interoperability development phase.""  A stable state  The API, and the W3C's call for the ""broad implementation"" of it, is based on what the group sees as a way to offer consumers more payment options and merchants a more secure online checkout.  As part of that growth, the WebKit browser engine that powers Safari and Apple’s app store earlier this month moved the status of its work from ""under consideration"" to ""in development,"" though other more advanced stages still lie ahead.  ""The specification has matured enough within the W3C process that we’ve moved from draft state to stable state,"" said Jacobs, who added:  ""And that means, now we know what the API is going to do, and we are building test suites and working on browser interoperability so the implementations are secure and they behave the same way.""  The W3C's standardization efforts are notoriously slow moving, with work advancing from community groups to working groups, all of which can take years. This is one of the reasons cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have been hesitant to join the group's ranks, even though the Tim Berners-Lee created consortium has a largely positive reputation.  Not so fast  But, the process ahead isn't as easy as it sounds.  Jacobs compared the next steps to matchmaking, where merchants will need to integrate the API and pick which payment methods they want to accept. At this stage, customers will need to download the browser extension and signal what payment methods they use.  In other words, merchants need to build websites that acknowledge the new payment methods, while users need to have wallets that ""speak the protocol that we're writing,"" Jacobs said. ""That’s how the ecosystem pieces together the merchant-side and the user-side.""  The W3C is already working with third-party apps to integrate both distributed ledger solutions and non-credit card forms of payment into the API in a way that can be interpreted by merchants and consumers.  ""So, for example, you might identify a particular bitcoin payment method with a URL, and then people can distribute payment apps that declare their support for that payment method,"" Jacobs said.  The W3C has gotten more and more interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology over the years, hosting it's first ever blockchain workshop in June last year. While participants were left with much interest in standardizing their work in an effort to democratize the technology's use, no formal work was at that time decided upon.  The next face-to-face meeting of the Web Payment Working Group behind the browser-based API is scheduled for November 6 and 7, with a demo expected to take place on October 23 to show how Airbnb, Google and Mastercard are using the API.  Jacobs, optimistic about the recent step forward, concluded:  ""You will begin to see early adopters of the API using it and you will see an increase in browser support over time that I’m hoping by the middle of next year it’s widely deployed.""
