42418445,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGcn,1712617688,Crypto Trader Eisenberg's $110M Fraud Trial to Put DeFi Under Microscope,"NEW YORK – Crypto trader Avi Eisenberg's criminal fraud and manipulation trial will open Tuesday after a federal judge seated a 15-person jury that includes a seller of rare books, an elementary school music director and at least two finance professionals.  Expected to run for two weeks, the trial will determine whether Eisenberg broke the law when in October 2022 he deployed a self-described ""highly profitable trading strategy"" that crippled Mango Markets, the once popular venue for betting on cryptocurrencies on the Solana blockchain.  The trial represents an evolution in the government's attempts to police alleged crimes in decentralized finance (DeFi), a sector of the crypto trading space governed by the notion that ""code is law."" Mango Markets is not tightly controlled like its counterparts in centralized finance, like Coinbase. Instead, trades, borrowings and loans execute on smart contracts.  Eisenberg is accused of illegally gaming Mango Markets' futures contracts by manipulating the price of the MNGO token and then borrowing effectively all of Mango's deposits against his position. He walked away with $110 million in cryptocurrencies other people had deposited on the platform, later returning a portion of that in exchange for a promise that Mango's backers would not seek his prosecution.  That promise was not kept.  Negotiation or extortion?  In court on Monday, prosecutors and defense teased upcoming testimony from Mango's founder, Dafydd Durairaj. He spoke with a ransomware negotiator for assistance in the wake of Eisenberg's trade, prosecutors said. This fact, they argued, could help the jury understand that Durairaj did not view the negotiations as an ""arm's-length"" deal between two parties, but rather a hostage situation that could implode at any time.  Judge Arun Subramanian sided partially with Eisenberg's defense team and told the government not to bring up the ransomware negotiator, lest it prejudice the jury. But he said if the defense opened the door by arguing the negotiations were ""arm's length,"" the prosecutors could walk through it.  The parties sparred over the word ""manipulation,"" its potential use by witnesses and its presence in online terms-of-service documents. They also clashed over the phrasing of what traders on Mango Markets were ""obliged"" to do when operating on the site. Was that word a legal concept, or rather a reference to the outcomes of executing a transaction on a smart contract?  Arguments over jargonistic minutiae foreshadow the complexities ahead in a trial that will test the government's recent strategy of presenting knotty crypto misdeeds as simple cases of fraud. The feds took that tactic in last year's prosecution of Sam Bankman-Fried as well as in the recent civil fraud case against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon.  But Eisenberg's case delves perhaps even deeper into the philosophical and practical questions about trading tokens on permissionless blockchains. His is the first federal criminal trial to involve a DeFi trader accused of breaking U.S. law in a sector that once viewed itself as beyond its reach.  Inside the courtroom  The prospective jurors sounded none too pleased to spend Eclipse Day on the 15th floor of a federal courtroom. One remarked she was supposed to be watching the generational event at a science museum, not a jury box. At one point the judge said he would turn off the lights during the event's pinnacle, which he did not.  More than a few came ready with eclipse glasses. They did get to use them, if only for a few minutes, while the judge and lawyers sidebarred over peremptory strikes. Prospective jurors, reporters and even the U.S. Marshal took turns peering out the tall windows at the partially covered sun.

25426420,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602110,1712617217,"Altcoins Hotlist: Expert Identifies Top 6 Coins To Track Amid Bitcoin’s Rise To $72,000","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its upward trajectory, regaining its bullish momentum after brief range-bound price action and inching closer to its all-time high (ATH) of $73,700, crypto analyst Miles Deutscher shared insights on several altcoins to watch for potential gains this week. Altcoins With Strong Potential First, Deutscher observes a robust recovery in Bitcoin following its recent dip below the $65,000 level on April 3rd. The analyst notes that Bitcoin’s structure appears positive, with $73,8000 being the critical level to watch as it represents the previous ATH and the cryptocurrency’s last resistance before further gains. According to Deutscher’s analysis, BTC’s ability to break through this level could signal further upward momentum for the market leader. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) In Buy Zone That Earlier Led To 112% & 87% Surges Despite recent network congestion issues, Deutscher remains optimistic about Solana’s long-term prospects, as it is the first of several altcoins on the analyst’s radar this week, promising further gains on top of its already 23% uptrend over the past month. The analyst highlights that sentiment around Solana has deteriorated slightly but emphasizes that these issues are unlikely to significantly impact the medium to long term. Next on the list, Deutscher identifies BTC’s equivalent to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ordinals, as a strong performer within the BRC-20/BTC narrative ecosystem. With the Bitcoin halving scheduled for the last half of April just days away, Deutscher remains bullish on the ORDI token ahead of the event. While the narrative surrounding the halving remains relatively quiet, Deutscher continues to suggest that Ordinals stands out as a leader in the space. Orion And Altlayer Deutscher has expressed interest in Altlayer, an altcoin closely associated with the EigenLayer protocol, due to recent rumors surrounding the upcoming EigenLayer airdrop. According to the analyst, Altlayer’s proximity to the airdrop and its involvement in the restaking narrative contributes to its appeal. Given these anticipated developments, Deutscher sees a potential boost for the token as the market prepares for the airdrop. The token is up 14% in the last month alone and over 4% in the previous 24 hours. Similarly, Deutscher highlights ORN as the first restaking rollup on EigenLayer and emphasizes the limited opportunities to get exposure to EigenLayer before its official launch. This factor, combined with Orion’s rebranding to LUMIA, has attracted positive market sentiment, the analyst said, noting that recent weeks have demonstrated the market’s positive response to token rebrands, further increasing Orion’s potential. Dogecoin’s ‘Doge Day’ Next on the altcoin watchlist, Deutscher notes the upcoming “Doge Day” on April 20, which has historically seen increased interest and speculation surrounding the dog-themed meme coin. According to the analyst, the possibility of Elon Musk tweeting about the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has fueled expectations for potential price moves. Deutscher suggests monitoring DOGE for strength and considering it as a viable short-term trading opportunity. Related Reading: XRP Price Drops After Massive Whale Dump, Casting Doubt On $1 Target In April Finally, Deutscher points to previous instances where early altcoins airdrop participants experienced initial selling pressure, followed by potential rebounds. Wormhole’s native token, W, is facing a similar scenario as the token has fallen over 30% since trading began on April 3. Deutscher advises watching how the token reacts around the significant support level of $1. Once the initial selling pressure potentially subsides, Deutscher notes that a positive reaction can be expected, but whether the $1 support holds will be key to determining the cryptocurrency’s next moves.

This move saw the transfer of over 230,000 GMX tokens to Wintermute Trading, seemingly making a profit of $3.2 million. Related Reading: XRP Price Drops After Massive Whale Dump, Casting Doubt On $1 Target In April Altcoin Dropped By Its Largest Personal Holder Blockchain research platform Lookonchain revealed that Arthur Hayes seemingly sold his GMX holdings yesterday. Hayes was the largest holder of GMX, the native token of decentralized perpetual exchange GMX. Throughout 2022, the BitMEX founder spent a total of 3,383 ETH, worth $5.17 million, to buy 200,581 GMX tokens. In 2023, Hayes spent another 60 ETH to buy 2,328 GMX, around $105,000. From July to December 2023, Hayes withdrew 215,428 GMX tokens from centralized exchanges (CEX). By the end of 2023, he had bought 218,337 GMX for $6.5 million from CEX and decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap. As of April 7, 2024, Hayes had GMX holdings worth $9.7 million, per Lookonchain data. The post revealed that Hayes had unstaked all 237,672 tokens and transferred them to an address linked to crypto algorithmic trading firm Wintermute Trading. The transaction sparked rumors of a possible token sale by the former CEO of BitMEX. According to the report, the average cost of buying through Haye’s accumulation phase is around $29.74. After selling, Hayes’s profits would total over $3.2 million. GMX investors reacted to the news, suggesting that “nothing changed” and the altcoin was “in that buy zone again.” Did Arthur Hayes Accept Capitulation? Crypto analyst and trader JJcycles suggested that the transaction looked like “Hayes capitulation.” Later, the trader speculated why the GMX price didn’t “tank hard” after one of its largest personal holders sold his tokens. To the analyst, the incident looked “like the price of ETH during the FTX debacle.” Based on his perception, the trader decided to buy more GMX tokens. One of the largest holders of GMX send his bags to a market maker. Speculation goes that he is selling which is the most logical conclusion to make. My question, why is price not tanking hard? Feels a bit like the price of ETH during the FTX debacle.I'm buying more.$GMX pic.twitter.com/jZi91vIghT — JJcycles (@JJcycles) April 8, 2024 In a later post, the analyst clarified what he meant with his previous statement. According to him, GMX’s capitulation looks like ETH’s capitulation in 2023. As reported by NewsBTC, the number of Ethereum traders selling at a loss increased around August 2023. ETH’s price bounced back from the capitulation and has continued an upward trajectory ever since. Per the analyst charts, GMX appears to be showing an ascending triangle pattern at writing time, like the one made by ETH during its capitulation. To the trader, this suggests GMX could begin an upward trajectory like ETH. GMX Price Reaction The GMX token displays red numbers in most timeframes, as it’s currently 55.5% lower than its all-time high (ATH) of $91.07. The token registers a 7.9%, 28.9%, and 48.9% price drop on the weekly, monthly, and yearly timeframes. After the news of Hayes’ transaction broke, the price went from hovering between the $40.8-$40.7 price range to $37.1, plunging 9% in just an hour. Nonetheless, the altcoin quickly started to recover from the initial dip. At the time of writing, GMX is trading at $40.47, a 1% drop from 24 hours ago. Notably, the token’s market activity skyrocketed 467.6% in the last day, with a daily trading volume of $54.77 million. Related Reading: Sleeping Giant Awakens!

25422596,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602004,1712610038,"Expert Maps Out Timeline For The XRP Price To Cross $1,000","Crypto Expert BarriC has raised eyebrows with his recent analysis of the XRP price, in which he stated that the crypto token could rise to $1,000. As part of his analysis, he also elaborated on why this price level is attainable and not an “arbitrary number” he has pulled out for fun. When Will The XRP Price Rise To $1,000? BarriC suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the XRP price will rise to $1,000 in the next five to ten years. He explained that this would happen due to the new money flowing into the crypto space during that period. Specifically, he alluded to the “400 trillion dollars of personal wealth” and also institutional money yet to come into crypto, which could help drive up XRP’s price. Related Reading: $115-Million Bitcoin Whale Wakes Up From 10-Year Slumber – What’s Next? To drive home his point, he drew his followers’ attention to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs and how they have so far contributed to Bitcoin’s bullish momentum and price surge. As such, he believes that XRP could also benefit from such institutional demand once institutions begin to show interest in other crypto ETFs like a potential XRP Spot ETF. BarriC boldly claimed that to say that XRP will not hit $1,000 “is to say that the entire crypto market as a whole will never grow or evolve or that new money will not come in.” He also suggested that the only way the XRP price wouldn’t hit $1,000 was if Ripple somehow failed in everything they had set out to do. However, he believes all that is unlikely and that the crypto space and Ripple will continue to grow the same way they have since 2016, even though he admitted that people “aren’t ready to fathom price action like a $1,000 $XRP.” He added that this is the same way no one in 2016 could have fathomed Bitcoin at $74,000, but it eventually happened. XRP To $2,500 Is Also A Possibility Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto once raised the possibility of the XRP price hitting $2,500 by 2029 while sharing his encounter with a top banker. Egrag mentioned that the banker told him XRP would hit this price level, and he agreed. Like BarriC, Egrag claimed that the banker spoke about how ETH hitting $2,500 seemed impossible then, but it happened. Related Reading: ADA Price Ready To Soar As Cardano Network Hits New 88.6 Million Transaction Milestone However, XRP YouTuber Moon Lambo will have reservations about these price predictions. He once suggested that there isn’t enough money in the world to drive XRP’s price to four or five digits. He also noted that any new money that flows into crypto won’t only go into the XRP ecosystem. As such, one can’t base such an ambitious price prediction solely on money that has yet to come into crypto. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.60, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Dwindling Exchange Supply Raises Price Jitters,"The world of memecoins continues to be a rollercoaster ride, and Pepe (PEPE) is no exception. Recent on-chain data reveals a surge in tokens moving out of exchanges, potentially signaling a bullish sentiment among investors. However, conflicting indicators cast a shadow of doubt on the sustainability of this upward trend. Related Reading: Solana Primed For Takeoff? Expert Analysis Points To Buying Opportunity Pepe Soars Out Of Exchanges, Suggesting Investor Confidence A significant development for PEPE is the movement of a large number of tokens away from exchanges. According to Santiment, a blockchain analytics platform, the supply of PEPE outside exchanges reached a staggering 243 trillion on April 7th. This sharp rise compared to March 12th indicates a potential decrease in selling pressure. Source: Santiment Price Recovery, Rising Volume Hint At Potential Upswing Further bolstering the bullish case for PEPE is the recent price increase. Over the last 24 hours, the memecoin has experienced a nearly 10% surge, suggesting a potential recovery from a recent slump. In addition to the observed price fluctuations and projected price range for Pepe, it’s worth noting the significant increase in trading volume surrounding the cryptocurrency. This surge in trading activity not only reflects a heightened level of engagement within the Pepe community but also suggests growing interest from external investors and traders. Bitcoin is now trading at $71.879. Chart: TradingView The uptick in trading volume serves as a key indicator of market sentiment and could potentially serve as a catalyst for further price gains. Historically, increased trading activity has been associated with periods of price appreciation, as it signals a greater level of market participation and liquidity. In turn, this heightened liquidity can attract new buyers to the market, further bolstering demand and potentially driving prices higher. Investor Sentiment Tells A Different Narrative However, not all signs point towards a clear path to success for PEPE. While the token movements suggest some bullishness, a crucial metric paints a contrasting picture. The Weighted Sentiment, which reflects investor sentiment towards PEPE, has recently declined. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dips, But Don’t Panic: ETFs See Three Days Of Bullish Inflow This could indicate a weakening of investor confidence and potentially foreshadow a decrease in demand for the memecoin. If this metric continues to fall, it could invalidate the current bullish bias surrounding PEPE, making a significant price hike less likely. Quick Technical Overview On a brighter note, PEPE shows strong bullish momentum with a 74/26 split favoring positive sentiment. This aligns with the recent price increase and suggests continued investor optimism. However, it’s crucial to monitor social media chatter and news articles for any potential shifts in sentiment that could impact price movement. While the current outlook is positive, remaining vigilant is key in this volatile market. Source: Changelly PEPE Price Prediction Meanwhile, amidst the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, Pepe’s price fluctuations have captured the attention of crypto experts, prompting projections for its trajectory in April 2024. Analyses indicate an anticipated average PEPE rate of $0.0000140 during this period, reflecting both the potential for growth and the inherent uncertainty within the market. While these projections offer insights into the expected average price, it’s essential to acknowledge the range of possibilities. Experts suggest that Pepe’s minimum and maximum prices in April 2024 could vary significantly, with estimates ranging from 0.00000745 to 0.00000745.

Taking to X, the analyst observed that BTC has closed two consecutive months above the upper Bollinger Band on the monthly chart. A Rare Bollinger Band Signal Prints: BTC To $140,000? The analyst said that historically, when Bitcoin closes two consecutive months above the upper Bollinger Band on the monthly chart, prices tend to double within three months. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin will surge to over $140,000 by July 2024, just three months after the Bitcoin halving event. Related Reading: Forget Bitcoin! Altcoins Set For Explosive Growth With Potential 1,000x Returns — Analyst Bitcoin is trading below $73,800, the all-time high registered in March 2024. However, after weeks of lower lows, the sharp recovery earlier on April 8 suggests buyers could be flowing back. At press time, the coin is changing hands above $71,800, convincingly breaking above the liquidation level of around $72,000. Despite the bullish breakout, whether the uptrend continues remains to be seen. Of note is that BTC prices tend to collapse before the Halving, which is set to take place in the coming weeks, dumping to as low as 20%. BTC fell after peaking at $73,800, dropping to around the $60,000 level before snapping back higher to current levels. A refreshing close above $74,000 might form the basis of even more gains in the days ahead, perhaps towards $100,000 in the weeks ahead. Another analyst suggests that Bitcoin could rally to $140,000 within four weeks, especially if it follows a similar price pattern to December 2020. After breaking above the $20,000 high of 2017, Bitcoin continued to rally, peaking at around $70,000 for a nearly 3X surge. Currently, buyers are eyeing the $74,000 mark and the all-time high. If this level is surpassed, as it was in late 2020, the possibility of Bitcoin at least doubling to $140,000 becomes more likely. Will Halving, Macroeconomic Factors, And Spot ETFs Drive Prices? The current bullish sentiment might continue. Possible drivers include interest in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). So far, billions have been channeled to these products, lifting demand and thus prices. The upcoming Halving event could further buoy demand, lifting prices even higher in the coming months. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Makes Bold Prediction For Crypto Market – $5 Trillion In 2024 Beyond Bitcoin-driven fundamentals, analysts are also looking at market events, especially in the United States.

If the Fed reduces interest rates, reversing their hawkish outlook, BTC could lead other safe havens in an uptrend.

42418444,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGZh,1712602415,Stablecoin Growth Is More Important Cue for Crypto Bull Market Than Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Analyst,"The supply of leading stablecoins USDT and USDC grew by $10 billion in the past 30 days, twice the inflows to bitcoin ETFs during the same time, 10x Research noted.  Stablecoins are tokens pegged predominantly to the U.S. dollar, and are widely used as a bridge between traditional currencies to digital assets and liquidity for trading.  Stablecoins might be a better signal for crypto demand than bitcoin ETF inflows, 10x Research noted.  Crypto market watchers this year have been fixated on demand for spot bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds to gauge the direction for digital asset prices.  Watching the stablecoin supply, however, could be a more useful indicator for crypto demand, and its rapid expansion suggests prices will go higher, 10x Research said in a Monday report.  ""We suggest paying less attention to the bitcoin ETF flows,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in the report. ""Stablecoin issuers are the new sheriff in town, driving this market higher.""  Stablecoins – digital assets with a fixed price, predominantly pegged to one U.S. dollar – are a key piece of infrastructure bridging traditional (fiat) currencies with the digital asset world and providing liquidity for trading. Changes in their supply provides an important clue about the health of the crypto market, as market participants create (mint) stablecoins by depositing fiat money, the 10x report said.  The supply of Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC – the two largest stablecoins – expanded by nearly $10 billion combined over the past 30 days, 10x Research pointed out. Meanwhile, the supply of MakerDAO's DAI and Hong Kong-based First Digital's FDUSD, the third and fourth largest stablecoins, also expanded by 5%-10% in this period, CoinGecko data shows.  USDT alone grew by $2.4 billion in a week, one of the highest 7-day readings during this bull market, the report noted.  ""Fiat money is being moved into crypto at an accelerated pace,"" Thielen said.  Read more: Stablecoin Expansion Continues as Bitcoin Rally Appears to Stall  Meanwhile, U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs attracted $5 billion of net inflows over the past 30 days, the report added.  ""The minting from stablecoins is twice as large and might be long-only exposure, contrary to the ETFs,"" Thielen said.  This is because ETF inflows might have been skewed by savvy market participants harvesting a yield from elevated futures funding rates with a so-called ""carry trade.""  Funding rates – payments to traders based on the price difference between futures contracts and spot markets – have been near record-highs, meaning that futures traders betting on higher prices (longs) pay to those holding short positions benefitting from price declines. This offers an arbitrage opportunity known as a carry trade, with savvy investors buying spot BTC or shares of one of the spot-based ETFs and selling equal size of BTC futures to maintain a neutral position and safely pocketing the price difference as a yield.  Notably, hedge funds held record amounts of BTC futures short positions on the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which could be partly because of the high demand for the carry trade, 10x noted in another report last week.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/08/stablecoin-growth-is-more-important-cue-for-crypto-bull-market-than-bitcoin-etf-inflows-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11a23c12349809e1d8be2143b2c6c30b37504b57-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418453,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGhx,1712601997,"Crypto Does Not Have an Illicit Finance Problem, Bad Actors Do","Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo’s April 9 testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee is set to provide a veritable state of the union address on illicit finance, and crypto will undoubtedly feature prominently at the hearing. This is especially true, as headlines of Russia’s use of “crypto” to evade sanctions or traffic arms are making the rounds.  Notwithstanding crypto’s checkered scorecard over the last few years, which saw record losses, market manipulation, fraud and clear examples of highly traceable illicit finance (albeit comparatively small), the media’s use of the word “crypto” as a catchall is disingenuous. Most often, it is named single products, blockchains and platforms such as Tornado Cash or Terra-Luna that create a nexus of bad activity. The digital assets industry, like banking, is not monolithic.  Dante Disparte is the Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Global Policy for Circle, a leading financial technology firm and the regulated issuer of USDC.  Still, unlike banking, “crypto” writ large bears a disproportionately heavy reputational burden, despite the fact that most illicit activity accrues to named individual entities, products or other services. A recent TRM Labs report titled The Illicit Crypto Economy underscores as much. Thus, the continual use of a catchall term “crypto,” is like blaming all banks for the misdeeds of a single bank. Imagine if every bank in the world had to atone for the sins of a single bank such as Danske Banke, which, in 2022, pleaded guilty to $212 billion of Russia-linked money laundering?  While Senators weigh the merits of Adeyemo’s important testimony, they should also weigh the consequences of more than five years of U.S. policy inaction in regulating the very wayward corners of the crypto industry that pose the greatest threats to consumers, markets and, indeed, national security. U.S. policymakers and regulators, from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell (and Deputy Secretary Adeyemo), have all made calls for Congressional action. They focus particularly on dollar-denominated stablecoins, the crypto world’s digital thrift, much of which borrow the trust of the dollar, without being accountable to U.S. financial crime compliance laws.  This critical regulatory gap can be addressed with the urgent passage of the Clarity for Payment Stablecoin Act, which has been under intense development for the past two years and has passed the House Financial Services Committee. Rather than viewing this important bill as a body of law that would legitimize the wayward actors and misdeeds of some products and services in crypto, even skeptical Senators and members of Congress should view this bill as one that asserts U.S. leadership over digital dollars everywhere, irrespective of their form factor.  Critically, the law would create a floor for all issuers to comply with U.S. anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing and sanctions obligations. These norms should be applied to U.S. issuers of payment stablecoins, as well as their international counterparts, many of which are being licensed to issue dollar-denominated stablecoins from jurisdictions like the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong and Singapore.  Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, follows all of these norms today under our obligations as a U.S. regulated money transmission company and as a money services business registered with the U.S. Treasury's Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). There is an effective deterrence in regulated stablecoins and their corresponding value chains limiting their use in illicit activity. Abiding by laws, working with peer regulated financial institutions, and holding the line on financial integrity makes a big difference. That is why, according to third-party reports, USDC is used for lawful purposes at rates of 99.95%. Because no financial system is risk-free, good crypto companies, banks and non-banks together with law enforcement, would be well-served in adopting a model of collective defense when it comes to combating illicit finance.  The crypto industry ensures broad conformity at the operating and technological levels with the Travel Rule (which sets international information-sharing standards to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing). It is also part of the TRUST Network, which Coinbase and at least 58 other crypto companies have adopted. Slow-moving policymakers would do well in looking at the example set by the world’s leading financial crime compliance bodies, which were among the very first to establish globally harmonized rules for crypto under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendation 16, imposing the Travel Rule on international crypto transactions.  With over $150 billion in circulation, stablecoins are too important to ignore. By coupling the trust of the U.S. dollar with the superpowers of the internet, they are poised to fundamentally modernize our global financial system, making it faster and fairer. As Deputy Secretary Adeyemo will undoubtedly assert, there is an array of complex threats arrayed against the U.S. economy and our leadership in the world. The passage of clear laws for novel crypto markets, as with banking before it, can preserve this leadership.",NEUTRAL,USDC,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,Dante Disparte,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/08/crypto-does-not-have-an-illicit-finance-problem-bad-actors-do,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12aadf777b36dc32a0cd75e657cfee15fdcd5e22-1893x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Evaluate Layer-2 blockchains through a lens of developer experience, user experience, & technical capability. Show assumptions behind our $1 trillion market cap base case valuation for Ethereum Layer-2s by 2030. We evaluate Ethereum Layer-2s across 5 key areas and detail our $1T base case valuation prediction for ETH L2s by 2030. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Layer-2 Blockchains Overview Ethereum's (ETH-USD) dominance in smart contracts faces a critical hurdle: scalability. While the network offers unparalleled security and decentralization, transaction fees and processing times soar when usage intensifies. To overcome this, Layer 2 solutions have emerged, and advancements like the recent fork EIP-4844 promise to unlock even greater scalability for these Ethereum offshoots. Here we analyze an array of Layer 2 solutions from the perspective of transaction pricing, developer experience, user experience, trust assumption, and ecosystem size. Layer-2 (L2) blockchains are connected networks that operate on top of a primary blockchain, like Ethereum, to increase its capacity for processing transactions. By handling transactions off the main blockchain and then settling them back on it, L2 solutions help to scale the blockchain's capabilities without compromising its security or decentralization. Ethereum’s current capabilities are well-known to be inadequate for hosting all of the globe’s financial transactions. To be more precise, the world’s financial system will need to process more than Ethereum’s long-term limit of around 19.2 USDC or 6.8 Uniswap trades per second. However, this is a limitation by design because Ethereum’s stewards believe that censorship resistance is best achieved by making it inexpensive for anyone to run Ethereum nodes. The result is that Ethereum limits its chain’s capabilities to cut down on networking requirements, data storage needs, and computer hardware demands of its nodes. This practically limits how many bytes of data Ethereum can process over a given period of time. As transactions on a blockchain are nothing more than pieces of data that the blockchain agrees are correct, the capabilities of a blockchain can be measured simply by how much useful data it can handle. Source: VanEck Research as of 3/15/2024. To address these constraints, Ethereum's developers initially proposed a “sharding” solution, which involved splitting the blockchain into 64 smaller, interconnected sub-blockchains called “shards.” Each of these shards would process transactions within each’s own containerized child blockchains and then submit proofs of the activity to be reconciled by Ethereum’s parent blockchain. While this approach appeared promising, and some of its components debuted on Polkadot starting in 2020, Ethereum developers eventually discarded the sharding plan called Ethereum 2.0. This is because they believed it was technically infeasible and incapable of scaling to Ethereum’s vision of becoming a blockchain for billions of users. Instead, Ethereum's roadmap shifted towards leveraging Layer-2 (L2) blockchains. These L2 networks handle most transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain, only settling the highest-value transactions directly on it. This approach reduces the load on the main blockchain, allowing it to process more transactions efficiently. In this dynamic, Ethereum accrues value because the costs of these settlements must be paid in ETH; this strategy also reinforces the value of ETH as the true “oil” powering the entire ecosystem of connected chains. At its core, Ethereum's primary challenge is its limited capacity to process, store, and compute data in the form of financial transactions. This bottleneck in data throughput is being addressed by offloading much of the data processing and computation to Layer-2 blockchains. As a result, Ethereum's development is now concentrated on enhancing its ability to integrate compressed transaction data from these L2 blockchains. But how exactly do these connected blockchains function, and what are their business models?

Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Layer-2s Role in Scaling Ethereum's Network Layer-2 (L2) blockchains enhance Ethereum's capabilities by aggregating multiple transactions into condensed bundles, known as ""roll-ups.” These “bundles” of transactions are posted by L2s to Ethereum at various intervals that are spaced apart to balance transaction demand, security, and cost. As such, Ethereum is becoming a “blockchain of blockchains.” Each L2 generally consists of its own series of smart contracts on Ethereum that keep track of L2 transaction history, facilitate data transfer between the L2 and Ethereum, run fault proof or zk verifier contract (more on this below), and function as an asset escrow between Ethereum and the L2. Very powerful computers called “sequencers” ingest and order all the transactions that occur on the L2 blockchains. This is more capable and cheaper than Ethereum because L2s run one very powerful server computer that simply intakes transactions and orders them. This dynamic allows L2s to process greater data throughput than Ethereum. By contrast, Ethereum transaction processing involves 100s of thousands of globally distributed validator nodes sending, interpreting, and agreeing upon transaction data. This takes a lot more time due to the Ethereum consensus process and involves duplicating the work of one computer on each of the 100s of thousands of Ethereum nodes. Logically, a single computer like a sequencer processing transaction is much cheaper and faster than a system of globally dispersed, less capable computers that need to collectively use gigabits of internet bandwidth to message and hundreds of thousands of CPUs to process blockchain transactions. Types of Layer-2s: Optimistic Roll-Ups ((ORUS)) and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups ((ZKUS)) There are two main types of L2s connected to Ethereum: optimistic roll-ups ((ORUS)) and zero-knowledge roll-ups ((ZKUS)) . Both settle their ledger balances, or ""state,"" on Ethereum by sending a compressed version called a ""Merkle Root."" ORUs also post a condensed batch of transaction data to allow for verification and traceability of ledger changes over time. Settlement in Layer-2 blockchains ((L2S)) can be compared to updating a baseball game's scoreboard inning by inning, with the transaction data serving as the detailed play-by-play. For optimistic roll-ups (ORUs), they operate on the principle of optimism, meaning they are presumed to be accurate unless proven otherwise. If an entity, such as a high-frequency trading firm or a mathematically adept researcher, identifies an incorrect or faulty Merkle root, they can submit a fraud attestation, known as a fault-proof, to Ethereum. Entities monitoring ORUs for fraud have a seven-day window, referred to as a ""challenge period,"" to detect any fraudulent activity following a state update. Once this period concludes, the transactions within the ORU are deemed final. If a fault-proof successfully demonstrates fraud, the smart contract overseeing the ORU's state will revert all transactions to the state before the fraud commenced. The challenge period extends for seven days, after which each batch of transactions is irrevocably finalized. At the time of writing, of the forty-six L2s we track through l2beat , only four chains have fraud proofs live. Two of those four are under the umbrella of Arbitrum, which boasts the highest total value locked (TVL) of any L2 at $4.31B and only allows fraud proofs from a whitelisted group of entities. The most popular ORUs are Arbitrum, Blast, Optimism, Manta, Metis, Mantle, and Base. Total Value Locked (TVL) vs. Annualized Revenues Optimistic Roll-Ups ((ORUS)) Source: Defillama, TokenTerminal as of 3/12/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. A zero-knowledge roll-up (ZKU) operates similarly to an ORU, with one key difference. While ORUs submit both transaction data Merkle roots and state Merkle roots to Ethereum, ZKUs only send a zero-knowledge proof of the transaction data. This is because ZKUs do not operate under the assumption that the submitted state roots are correct. Instead, once the proof is submitted to Ethereum, a smart contract verifies the authenticity of the ZKU's transaction bundle. As a result, ZKUs do not have fault proofs because proofs are generated with each state update. Unlike ORUs, ZKU transaction data is considered final once the proof is accepted on Ethereum, ensuring immediate finality and eliminating the need for a challenge period. The most important ZKUs are currently Starkware, zkSync, zkScroll, Linea and *c zkEVM The base economics of ZKUs and ORUs are very similar to those of L1 blockchains. Both types of roll-ups make money when users create activity on their chains and pay fees in ETH to Ethereum. Currently, all L2s price their transactions in ETH because that is the token needed to settle transaction data to Ethereum. Layer-2s Revenue Models Regardless of the process, it is important to understand that transaction ordering has value and that blockchains can make money by selling the rights to transaction ordering. This diagram illustrates how three different transaction sequencing models can create different revenue streams. Source: VanEck Research as of 3/25/2024. Explanation: Assume that TX2 is a high value transaction, buying $1M of a token on an L2. In FIFO, everyone pays the sequencer the same amount. In Priority Ordering, TX2 pays the sequencer to be first. In Auctioning Specific Slots, TX3 and TX4 pay extra to be ahead of and behind TX2. Layer-2s Transaction Sequencing: Priority, FIFO, and Auctioning L2s charge users a fee for transaction inclusion in each block. This is composed of a base fee and a priority fee. Some L2s charge priority fees, like Optimism . Priority fees give users the ability to be first in line at the top of the block of transactions. In the last 6 months, the top 10 L2s on Ethereum made $232M in revenues from user transactions alone. This ability to “cut the line” by paying priority fees benefits users engaging in time-sensitive activities, such as arbitrage trading. Arbitrum adopts a first-in-first-out (FIFO) sequencing approach to transactions as they arrive. In certain cases, users may prefer their transactions to follow specific others on the block. A common strategy, known as ""back-running,"" involves positioning a transaction right after a significant trade to exploit price discrepancies across decentralized exchanges ((DEXS)) for arbitrage opportunities. More malicious transaction ordering techniques, such as ""sandwich attacks,"" involve strategically placing buy orders immediately before a user's planned trade and sell orders immediately after. This manipulation drives up the price of the desired token just before the user's transaction executes, forcing them to purchase at a disadvantageous, inflated price. On Ethereum, ordering is monetized by a software addition added to Ethereum’s validator software. This software, called Flashbots, allows for validators to auction off the right to order transactions (and insert their own) to outside entities. This auction generates ""maximal extractable value"" (MEV), adding to the validators' and stakers' yields. While L2s have the potential to monetize MEV by auctioning off block ordering rights, no L2 has officially done so yet. However, trading firms may already be positioning their servers close to L2 servers, akin to practices in equity and commodities exchanges. Looking forward, many L2s plan to decentralize their sequencer set, which may involve staking tokens - possibly ETH from an Eigenlayer DA or from each roll-up’s native token. The sequencer decentralization could unlock new revenue streams from MEV. To contextualize, Ethereum's MEV take rate on DEX volume averages around 4 basis points (bps), while other blockchains like Polygon and Solana have rates of 0.4bps and 3.5bps, respectively. These rates likely understate the full scope of MEV due to the challenges in tracking and the incentives to conceal profits. By estimating MEV take rates against DEX volumes, if Arbitrum's MEV was captured at a rate of 3.0bps, it would amount to $58.9 million - a significant 57% of Arbitrum's fee-only revenue.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Layer-2s On-Chain Cost Structures Layer-2s (L2) primarily incur costs through Ethereum gas fees as they regularly post transaction data, settlements, and proofs to Ethereum. But zero-knowledge roll-ups ((ZKUS)) and optimistic roll-ups ((ORUS)) differ in their cost structures. While both update their states on the L1, ORUs have to pay onerous on-chain data costs while ZKUs must expend money proof generations and verification. Regardless, the consequence of the dependence on Ethereum is that the L2s input cost is subject to the volatility of Ethereum blockspace. For the most part, this cost difference is passed on to the user. However, the margins that L2s earn are quite volatile as a result. Prior to EIP-4844, L2s posted both settlement data and proofs to Ethereum as single transactions in the “message field” of each transaction structure called “call data.” This was a “hack” to utilize one component of Ethereum’s standard transaction format for the purpose of holding compressed L2 data. Though this is novel, it is very expensive. For example, for the month of February, Optimism paid $5.7M, Arbitrum paid $7.2M, and Scroll paid $6.7M for posting call data to Ethereum. Source: VanEck Research, Celestia as of 3/14/2024. The cost components for ZKUs are inherently higher compared to ORUs because ZKUs submit both zero-knowledge proofs and call data to Ethereum. While ORUs may also involve proof costs, these are generally outsourced to third parties who challenge the state if needed, and therefore they do not heavily influence ORUs' base costs. The verification of ZKUs’ zero-knowledge proofs on Ethereum can be extremely costly. Despite Ethereum's optimization efforts, such as native op codes to streamline zk-proof verification, the expenses remain significant—for example, Scroll's ZKU incurred $1.1 million in proofing fees in just the first 13 days of March. As a result of these high proving costs, the average profit margin for ORUs over the last six months stands at 26.7%, contrasting with 21% for ZKUs. Logically, a roll-up could send more transactions in fewer batches to decrease variable batch posting expenses. Infrequent batch posting, however, could also come as a result of less transaction throughput happening on the L2s. Regardless, L2 batch post frequency to Ethereum is a profitability lever an L2 can pull, but one that comes at the expense of user experience. In practice, L2s decide batch posting as a calculus of how many transactions they can fit into a block, Ethereum L1 gas prices, and each L2 incoming flow of transactions. L2 Batches Per Day vs. Ethereum Settlement Costs Source: Dune @niftytable, Etherscan as of 3/14/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Technically, L2s can post more expansive understandings of what occurs on L2s besides the simple “scoreboard” settlements. Price competition amongst L2s to serve users the cheapest transactions cause L2s to often choose the most economical data to post. Often, this means just posting “state differences” for ZKUs, and for ORUs, it means posting highly compressed transaction data. Curiously, though ZKUs do not technically have to post full transaction data, some still do so. While Starknet and zkSync only post “state differences,” Linea, Polygon, and Scroll post full transaction data. This is done because it may be challenging for things like explorers and wallets to track blockchains without the transaction data. Another possibility is that posting full transaction data allows more transparency so that anyone can run a node to track a ZKU. ZKUs may also be open to opening up a prover to anyone in the future, and posting full transaction data to Ethereum allows ZKUs to “decentralize” their blockchains at the point of the “provers.” A cost reduction that many L2s currently make is to improve the efficiency of their compression. For example, on February 13th, Linea deployed a new compression scheme that increased compression on the chain by a factor of 10x, moving from around 500 bytes per transaction to the mid-50s. Other L2s, both ORUs and ZKUs, had an average transaction size on Ethereum of 300 bytes for 2024. While compressing transactions may save on data costs to the L2, it reduces its potential due to the time it takes to compress transactions.

EIP-4844’s Answer to L2 Data Costs: Blob Space On March 13, 2024, Ethereum passed the Dencun upgrade, which had a handful of important changes, the most significant of which was the creation of what is called “Blob Space.” Prior to this upgrade, the main challenge for Layer-2s was the prohibitive cost associated with posting transaction data to Ethereum. Recognizing this, Ethereum’s solution was the strategic creation of a specialized data layer, colloquially known as Blob Space, designed exclusively for L2 data postings. This newly established layer offers a targeted transaction environment tailored to receiving data from L2 networks. Blob Space's innovative aspect is its transient data handling—data blobs posted here are retained for only four weeks before deletion, significantly reducing Ethereum's data overhead. Consequently, L2s have the option to bypass the main Ethereum layer and directly post to Blob Space. The Blob Space layer of Ethereum has its own gas prices that abide by the same rule set as Ethereum’s regular execution layer. The result is that transactions from L2s to publish data no longer have to compete with regular Ethereum transactions for blockspace. The dedicated transaction layer is also designed to price the cost of data much cheaper than posting to Ethereum as call data. At the time of writing, the Data Blobs have reduced gas usage charges to L2s by (-96%). L2 Data Publishing Costs to Ethereum (ETH) Source: Dune @niftytable, Artemis XYZ as of 3/19/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Layer-2s Off-Chain Cost Structures The first part of the off-chain cost expense for Layer-2s ((L2S)) are the sequencers they use for ordering transactions. This is basically just a high-end server that sits in a data center. For most L2s, the foundation or business entity behind that L2 pays for the cost of the sequencer. In the grand scheme of things, the costs of running the sequencers themselves are minor at around $1000 to $2000 in equipment and perhaps another $3000 to 5000 in manpower per month. This cost is consistent for both Optimistic Roll-Ups (ORU S ) and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups (ZKUs). A lesser discussed but significant cost element for ZKUs involves the operation of provers. Unlike sequencers that produce the state root, the provers are responsible for creating the zk-proof that undergoes verification on the Ethereum network. This computational process usually takes place on cloud computing platforms like AWS. According to the decentralized zk prover project Gevulot , the costs of the proof will run between “10-20% of the cost of verification on Ethereum.” Additionally, these costs scale with the amount of transactions that are being generated by each L2s. ZKUs are faced with a balancing act between costs and user experience, with the option to reduce the frequency of proofs posted to Ethereum as a potential cost-saving measure. Through a process known as recursion, ZKU provers can consolidate several proofs into a single submission, which, while increasing off-chain computational demands, can optimize the economics by mitigating the costly proof verifications conducted on Ethereum. At the time of writing, all ZKUs run their own provers and directly pay for the costs of proof generation. Over time, however, many intend to decentralize proof generation. Evaluating Layer-2s Across 5 Key Areas In our analysis of key Layer-2s, we use five principal variables to measure potential success or failure: Transaction pricing – the cost to users of transacting Developer experience – the ease of building products and applications User experience – the simplicity of depositing, withdrawing, and transacting Trust Assumptions - liveness and safety assumptions Ecosystem size – how many interesting things there are to do 1. Layer-2s Transaction Pricing The root of transaction pricing differentiation comes from a combination of data compression, data posting efficiency, L2 scale, proving costs (for ZKUs), and, most interestingly, the margin each L2 takes. L2s could also time their postings to Ethereum based upon gas prices, but in practice, we have not found empirical evidence to support this possibility. This is likely due to the general difficulties of predicting future Ethereum gas prices. The main difference in pricing economics between ZKUs and ORUs is that ZKUs have higher fixed costs than ORUs. This is because ZKUs must pay for proof generation off Ethereum and proof verification on Ethereum. Proof generation/verification is a large, static cost that does not increase significantly as more transactions are covered by each proof. By contrast, ORUs must post full transaction data to Ethereum. Though ORUs employ different compression mechanisms to cut down on data costs, posting to Ethereum is very expensive. Because more transactions on an ORU means more data is to be committed to Ethereum, the costs of posts to Ethereum are increased. However, with the EIP-4844, the costs of posting data to Ethereum have been reduced significantly and these savings have resulted in cheaper transaction pricing for ORUs. Likewise, ORUs also have the option of placing transaction data on even cheaper data availability blockchains like Celestia, EigenDA, and Avail. Currently, Manta Pacific and Aevo post transaction data to Celestia. In 2024, the cheapest chains by average transaction cost were Mantle ($0.17), zkSync ($0.21), and Starknet ($0.25). Each chain was able to edge out its competition on pricing using different techniques. Mantle, an ORU, is able to keep transactions cheap because it accepts lower than the average margin (19.9%), uses its own data availability (Mantle DA) for full transaction batch posting, and updates its state root updates to Ethereum, the second least frequently at every 20.7 minutes. zkSync, a ZKU, was able to price transactions inexpensively due to the high volume of transactions (94.9M), the highest of any L2, that made its proving system highly economical. Meanwhile, the ZKU chain Starknet settled to Ethereum the least often of any of the top 10 L2s, once every 57.8 minutes, while also posting only state differences in place of full transaction data. These two-cost savings resulted in the least amount of data per transaction being settled to Ethereum. Curiously, we estimate that Starknet lost -$0.09 per transaction through March 13, 2024.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 2. Layer-2s Developer Experience Developer experience is another important point of competitive differentiation for Layer-2s. The root understanding of making the developer experience easiest was to implement EVM compatibility. This means that smart contract code, tooling, and developer libraries could be ported over directly from Ethereum to be used on the L2. This is believed to give each L2 an advantage because of Ethereum’s large network of developers. Currently, the vast majority of L2s are EVM-compatible. However, ZKUs often have subtle differences that developers must adhere to due to the limitations of zero-knowledge proofs. Some developers have also argued that adherence to EVM compatibility is a disadvantage because EVM places significant limitations on blockchain capabilities while boxing out developers who are more familiar with other computer languages. For example, Starknet smart contracts are written in a language called Cairo, which is more efficient for the zero-knowledge scaling of Starknet. Of course, this comes at the tradeoff where anyone deploying to Starknet must learn the complexities of Cairo. Movement Labs is another L2 developer who is allowing smart contracts to be written using the Move language which appeals to developers who know want to learn Move. And for those who are more familiar with the programming language of Solana called Rust, Eclipse is building a Layer-2 blockchain that runs in a Solana Virtual Machine. This is even expanding to other languages like Web Assembly, as Fluent has created a general-purpose L2 which supports WASM. 3. Layer-2s User Experience User experience is another plank by which Layer-2s compete with each other. The most basic component of this is onboarding assets and removing assets from an L2. For the most part, onboarding is not significantly differentiated between L2s, with the exception that some Centralized Exchanges ((CEXS)) allow for native assets to be moved to each L2. For example, Kraken allows users to withdraw USDC to Arbitrum and Optimism, whereas Coinbase ( COIN ) allows USDC to be ported to Optimism and Base. Finality —the point at which transactions on an L2 become irreversible—marks a significant divergence in the user experience between Optimistic Roll-Ups ((ORUS)) and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups (ZKUs). For ORUs, finality occurs after the fraud challenge period ends, while for ZKUs, finality occurs once a state root and its proof have been posted to Ethereum. One consequence of finality differences is withdrawals off of an L2. For an ORU, 7 days must pass before a user can move his or her funds back to Ethereum. For a ZKU, this same process can take as little as an hour, and this depends on how frequently the ZKU posts settlements and proofs, as well as each chain’s safety system. While zkSync posts proofs every 6 minutes and state updates every hour, users must have a 24-hour wait period before assets can be bridged to Ethereum due to zkSync’s safety modules. Current Throughput and Latency Source: VanEck Research as of 3/19/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. When users interact with L2s, familiar tools and interfaces are paramount. The adoption of familiar wallets and blockchain explorers from Ethereum to L2s greatly enhances user comfort. This seamlessness is pivotal, as most L2s employ analogous experiences to Ethereum, ensuring a minimal learning curve for those moving across platforms. In the realm of quantifiable user experience metrics, latency and throughput stand out. Latency refers to the time it takes for a transaction to be acknowledged by the network after submission, while throughput measures the network's capacity to handle transactions per second. The slowest block time, or Round-Trip Time (RTT)— the duration for a user's transaction to reach the sequencer and for the confirmation to be received back—typically defines an L2's latency. Arbitrum, for instance, boasts the potential for extremely low latency at 0.25 seconds, though actual latency may vary based on geographical factors and the user's proximity to the sequencer, which is speculated to be located in a Silicon Valley data center. zkSync is noted for having the highest theoretical throughput, capable of processing up to 434 swap transactions per second. However, both latency and throughput are adjustable parameters within L2 networks. The current bottlenecks for ZKUs are the speed at which their provers can handle incoming transactions, while ORUs are constrained by the efficiency of their transaction data compression and the rate at which Ethereum can absorb this data. At present, L2s voluntarily limit their throughput in alignment with Ethereum's capacity. If an L2 were to use Ethereum’s block space fully—considering Ethereum's current data cap of about 937.5kb per block plus an additional 375kb from three data blobs—this could theoretically expand to approximately 1.3 MB per block, or 110kb per second. For a specific L2 like zkSync, which averages 62 bytes per transaction, fully exploiting Ethereum block space could potentially surge to 1764 transactions per second. In contrast, an ORU like Arbitrum, with an average of 255 bytes per transaction, could reach a processing rate of 429 transactions per second under the same conditions. Further increases in throughput could be achieved by integrating a Data Availability blockchain such as Celestia. However, this approach raises concerns about compromising user safety, as alternative blockchains may not offer the same level of security assurances as Ethereum. The choice to expand throughput in this manner is a delicate one, requiring a balance between improved performance and the inherent safety that Ethereum's robustness provides. 4. Layer-2s Trust Assumptions Source: VanEck Research, l2beat as of 3/19/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There are substantial differences in the assurance of safety and liveness that L2s offer users. Safety refers to the blockchain’s properties to ensure that only an account owner can access his/her assets, while liveness refers to the safeguards in place to make sure assets can be utilized. As L2s rest upon a single sequencer who both orders a block and “proposes” it to the L1 (Ethereum) for settlement, the sequencer failure is the chief concern for L2 users. This is because each L2 currently operates a single sequencer, and if it fails, that L2 cannot process transactions. While assets cannot be stolen in the event of an outage, they also cannot be accessed by users until that outage is resolved. At the same time, if a malicious entity is able to take over a sequencer, it is possible they could mint fraudulent transactions to take the assets off an L2. The current point of weakness of all L2s is they each operate only one sequencer and that sequencer is usually centrally operated by the foundation behind the L2. L2 builders realize the issues posed by sequencer failure or takeover, and some implement novel safety valves. These differ depending on the L2 and its safety. To complicate matters, some of these safety measures open up the possibility for other attack areas. Some of the guard rails created to protect users include allowing users, under certain conditions, to remove assets, submit transactions for the L2 blockchain by using the L1 host, or even propose L2 blocks. Mostly, these conditions occur when there is a clear failure somewhere in the L2 system. Some L2s are developing frameworks where anyone can be a sequencer as well as allowing for multiple sequencers who each take a turn sequencing. This would be accompanied by people running the sequencers to put up an economic bond (most likely each L2 native token) to create penalties for cheaters. Companies like Espresso , Astria , and Fairblock are examples of projects that are building software for decentralized sequencers. Currently, the L2 Metis is furthest along in pioneering decentralized sequencers on its L2. Metis’s community has recently passed a governance vote that creates the framework for decentralizing its sequencer and allowing for multiple sequencers to exist. The next point of trust assumption variation, one we discuss above, is referred to as “data availability.” While ZKUs provide proof that state updates are correct, ORUs provide evidence to allow anyone to prove that a state update is incorrect. In both cases, however, it is important to understand where the data comes from to generate proofs for either ZKUs or ORUs. Ideally, this data would be readily “available” on the L1 (Ethereum) so that anyone could verify the underlying data that generates proof. Blockchains such as Immutable X and Metis, keep full transaction data on other locations. Though ZKUs do not need to post full transaction data, chains like Linea and Polygon zkEVM do, while Starknet and zkSync simply post state differences. Additionally, L2s post the data to Ethereum, while others post it to dedicated data availability blockchains like Celestia. Posting data on other chains arguably makes an L2 less safe than Ethereum because it introduces new trust assumptions. Another interesting dynamic for ORUs is that, as it stands, almost none of them allow for fraud-proof. This means that anyone using them is subject to censorship (transactions not going through) by the sequencer. The exception to this is Arbitrum, which allows fraud proofs. But even in Arbitrum’s case, only white-listed entities can submit fraud proofs. ZKUs, on the other hand, rely upon the prover (a different entity from the sequencer) posting proof. In the event that the ZKUs prover fails, some chains allow users to submit their own proofs (just do zero-knowledge math!) for transactions to be included on the L2. Regardless, Layer-2s have many issues with respect to their trust assumptions. However, they currently have hundreds of thousands of daily active users, so it would seem until there is a major issue, no one will care. To simplify our views on the set of safeguards L2s have in place, we rank them from most risky to least risky and find Arbitrum to be the current, although still inadequate, gold standard. 5. Layer-2s Ecosystem Size Bridged TVL of L2s Source: Dune @21co as of 3/19/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The most important competitive factor of L2s is the ecosystem that each L2 has created. Blockchain is a marketplace of services and digital commodities. The more useful things to do on a blockchain, the more value it will accrue through user transactions, demand for its native token, and network effect. Unfortunately, the metrics that measure blockchain activity do not always properly translate into the value of that blockchain’s ecosystem. Applying Goodhart’s law contends that once a metric becomes important in crypto, there is a higher chance that the metrics become manipulated. This rule becomes even more ironclad when we consider airdrop farmers (see our third paragraph from our January Monthly for an explanation) who are generating meaningless activity to receive a free airdrop of token value. Generally, what matters are users who are willing to bring value to a blockchain to engage in meaningful activity to generate fees. In that respect, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Blast have shown they have ecosystems that matter to users as those users have bridged $16.3B, $7.85B, and $2.43B to each respectfully. For the most part, Layer-2s have generated user interest and activity through airdrops of their native tokens. Optimism, for example, has given away nearly 25% of its current floating supply to users in the form of airdrops for activity. Arbitrum has given away over $1.84B in tokens (ARB-USD) to individuals who have used Arbitrum. Blast has leveraged this concept even further to attract bridged value on the premise that there may be an airdrop of tokens from Blast itself, as well as teams who are building on Blast. Conceptually, Layer-2s compete by giving away, for free, tokens whose value grows as each L2 network grows. Fully Diluted Value ((FDV))/Revenue and Market Capitalization ((MC))/Revenue Source: Artemis XYZ as of 3/21/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. By measure of the trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue to fully diluted valuation ((FDV)) multiples, each L2’s multiple exceeds Ethereum’s by a fair margin. However, this dynamic changes if we alter the multiple to being based upon floating token supply rather than fully diluted value. This is an odd disconnect that relates to the release schedule of L2 coins – most L2 projects have only released a fraction of their supply. Realistically, we see L2s trading more on speculation of long-term value accrual rather than current revenue dynamics. We attribute this dynamic to the potential for substantially more future revenues to occur on L2s than on Ethereum. We expect L2 revenues to exceed Ethereum’s because Ethereum cannot match the transaction throughput or user experience of L2s. We also increasingly see a state where the general-purpose roll-ups market is consolidated by a few major players. This is due to the network effect of both on chain application composability and shared value. It is also attributed to roll-up frameworks, like the OP Stack or Arbitrum Orbit, becoming dominant and the OP/ARB token accruing value from other L2 or even Layer-3s (blockchains that submit state to the L2s). It is also clear that most roll-ups will eventually move towards the zero-knowledge framework (ZKU) due to its many advantages. Long-term, we still believe that Ethereum blockspace will be expensive, and one result may be that many L2s consolidate proofs to a unified proving layer that “recursively” combines all proofs of its layer constituents. This may be particularly true in the case of application and sector-specific roll-ups. An example of what a concept may look like is Polygon’s Aggregation . Conceptionally, something like an “Agg Layer” may also vastly improve user experience because it would be more economical to post proofs and state roots often enough to allow for bridging across L2s and Ethereum in seconds rather than hours. Accordingly, we see cutthroat competition amongst L2s where the network effect is the only moat. As a result, we are generally bearish on the long-term value prospects for the majority of L2 tokens. The top 7 tokens for L2 collectively already have $40B of FDV, and there are many strong projects that intend to launch over the medium term. This means there is potentially $100B more in FDV in L2 tokens coming to market over the next 12-18 months. It seems a bridge too far for the crypto market to absorb even limited amounts of that supply without massive discounts. Additionally, while there are reasons to believe that some L2 tokens will become valuable, the pathways to value accrual are harder to project than they are for other crypto sectors. This is particularly the case since L2 tokens are not even the base money in their own ecosystems. Beyond the dominance of a few roll-ups among general-purpose L2s, we forecast a future of thousands of use case-specific roll-ups. These L2 will be segmented by sector, application, or function. Businesses will likely build roll-ups explicitly as their own revenue and/or cost centers like building an asset management Layer-2 chain. Other types of chains may be specifically geared towards hosting a whole sector, such as a roll-up that hosts a social media network, as well as applications that want to build products and services for that social media network. Ethereum Layer-2s Valuation Prediction by 2030 We find our 2030 valuation for the L2 space by applying an FCF terminal multiple to our expectations of future cash flows. We estimate the revenues that feed these cash flows by: Transactions Revenues (inclusion of transactions on a blockchain) Estimating the revenue TAM of end markets that could utilize public blockchains Calculating the amount of TAM that will actually use public blockchains Forecasting the Ethereum ecosystem’s market share public blockchains Applying take rates on end market revenues that utilize Ethereum’s ecosystem for settlement and transactions Splitting the transaction value between Ethereum and L2s MEV (ordering of transactions on blockchain) Estimating the value of assets including currency, securities, and digital assets that will be secured by Ethereum’s ecosystem Project DEX volume on Ethereum’s ecosystem by applying an asset turnover estimate to our forecasts for the hosted asset value of the Ethereum ecosystem Multiplying DEX volumes by an MEV take rate to arrive at total MEV value Splitting the value between Ethereum and its L2s Source: VanEck Research as of 3/21/2024.

25416270,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602005,1712597440,Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price To Rise 5000% To $0.001 – Here’s When,"Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja recently outlined his price targets for several crypto tokens after the fast-approaching Bitcoin Halving. Although he included price targets for Bitcoin and Ethereum, his ambitious price target for Shiba Inu (SHIB) was what caught the attention of the crypto community. Shiba Inu To Hit $0.001 After The Halving Pantoja predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Shiba Inu could rise to $0.001 after the Bitcoin Halving occurs later this month. As expected, this price prediction has raised eyebrows, considering SHIB’s current price level. Moreover, a rise to $0.001 represents a 5,000% gain for the meme coin, which already looked to have used up its bullish momentum in the 2021 bull run when it recorded a price increase of 46,000,000%. Related Reading: ADA Price Ready To Soar As Cardano Network Hits New 88.6 Million Transaction Milestone Interestingly, Pantoja’s prediction isn’t the most bullish price prediction made for Shiba Inu so far. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez previously predicted that the meme coin could rise to as high as $0.011, although he didn’t state when exactly this would happen. Some other crypto analysts have also given their thoughts on SHIB’s future trajectory, although not as bullish as Pantoja and Martinez’s predictions. Pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader Xanrox predicted that SHIB could see a 300% gain before year-end. Additionally, he suggested that the meme coin could see a new all-time high of $0.00008854. Crypto analyst Javon Marks also predicted that Shiba Inu could rise to as high as $0.0001553 at some point in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa, for his part, cautioned crypto investors against expecting similar returns to the one SHIB recorded in the last bull run. He stated that those investing in the meme coin are unlikely to see as much as a 20 times return on their investment. XRP To Rise To $10 Pantoja also predicted that XRP could rise to between $3 and $10 after the Halving. This is another eye-catching price prediction considering XRP’s current price level and how much the crypto token has continued to lag despite the impressive gains recorded in the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Breakout Of The Year? Crypto Analyst Predicts Where NEAR Is Headed Next However, Pantoja isn’t the only crypto analyst who believes that XRP could rise to $10. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently mentioned that XRP rising to $10 is possible since Ethereum rising to $10,000 is feasible. Nick, the founder of Web3Alert, also shares similar sentiments. He previously predicted that XRP could rise to $10 based on predictions that Bitcoin and Ethereum will rise to $150,000 and $10,000, respectively. This might also have been why Pantoja predicted that XRP could attain this price level; he also predicted that Bitcoin could rise to between $150,000 and $250,000 while Ethereum could rise to between $10,000 and $20,000.

25413488,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601985,1712592010,Polygon (MATIC) In Buy Zone That Earlier Led To 112% & 87% Surges,"On-chain data shows Polygon (MATIC) is currently inside the same buy zone that earlier led to rallies of around 112% and 87% for the asset. Polygon 30-Day MVRV Ratio Is Significantly Negative Currently As pointed out by analyst Ali in a post on X, MATIC is showing a historically bullish pattern in its 30-day MVRV ratio. The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Polygon market cap and realized cap. The realized cap is a capitalization model that calculates the total valuation of the cryptocurrency by assuming that the “real” value of any coin in circulation isn’t the current MATIC spot price, but rather the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whale Takes $52.3 Million In DOGE Off Binance, Sign Of Buying? Considering that the last movement of any coin was the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would serve as its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap essentially sums up the cost basis of every coin in circulation. Put another way, the realized cap is a measure of the total amount of capital the investors have put into the asset. Since the MVRV ratio compares the value the holders are carrying right now (that is, the market cap) against this initial investment, its value can tell us about the profit-loss status of the market as a whole. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day version of the Polygon MVRV ratio, which tells us about the profit-loss balance specifically for the investors who bought within the past month: The value of the metric seems to have been quite low in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X In the graph, the 30-day MVRV ratio has been displayed in terms of a percentage, with the 0% mark aligning with the scenario where the market cap and realized cap are equal. It’s visible that the indicator has registered some steep drawdown for Polygon recently and has dipped deep inside the negative territory. This would imply that the investors who bought within the last 30 days have entered into notable losses. The latest levels of the metric have been low enough to qualify for a zone that has provided profitable buying opportunities in the past. “Historically, the last two entries into this zone saw MATIC surge by 112% and 87%,” notes the analyst. Related Reading: Polygon Observes Buy Signal: Analyst Suggests MATIC Rebound To This Level A possible explanation behind this pattern could be the fact that as these 30-day investors enter into losses, the selling pressure in the market goes down as there aren’t many profit-takers left. This naturally facilitates for bottoms to take place. It now remains to be seen whether this past pattern would repeat for Polygon this time as well, and if it does, whether any resulting surge would be of a similar scale or not. MATIC Price Polygon has registered a 3% surge in the past day, with its price now floating above $0.93. Given the timing, it’s possible the MVRV ratio buy signal may already be in effect.

42418442,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGYf,1712591690,Crypto Market Cap to Double to $5 Trillion by Year-End: Ripple CEO,"The value of the cryptocurrency market could almost double to $5 trillion by the end of the year, propelled by the January approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. and the mining-reward halving due later this month, according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.  “I’m very optimistic. I think the macro trends, the big picture things like the ETFs, they’re driving, for the first time, real institutional money,” Garlinghouse said in an interview with CNBC. “You’re seeing that drives demand, and at the same time demand is increasing, supply is decreasing,” said Garlinghouse.  The rate at which new bitcoin {{BTC}} are produced will be reduced after the reward halving, scheduled for April 20. That event, which takes place roughly every four years, has historically preceded a bull market for the largest cryptocurrency by market value. It lowers the number of bitcoin that miners are awarded for approving blocks to be added to the blockchain by 50%. This month's cut will take the payment to 3.125 BTC per block.  The crypto market is currently valued at around $2.68 trillion. Bitcoin has gained 63% since the start of the year and recently reached record highs above $73,000. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, has rallied 49% in the same period.  Despite multiple regulatory crackdowns in the U.S., Garlinghouse said he remains positive on the future of crypto regulation in the country. Last June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, alleging they listed and traded unregistered securities in the form of various cryptocurrencies.  “One of the things actually I’ll say on the macro tailwinds for the industry: I think we will get more clarity in the United States,” he said. “The U.S. is still the largest economy in the world, and it’s unfortunately been one of the more hostile crypto markets. And I think that’s going to start to change, also.”  The SEC also filed a lawsuit against Ripple, a blockchain-based digital payment network, alleging it sold the {{XRP}} token illegally. Ripple denies the claims.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/08/crypto-market-cap-to-double-to-5-trillion-by-year-end-ripple-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5b2103ff13eeb20c01f76d916725182a2a56a41-2935x1651.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418460,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGqD,1712588768,6 Ways the Halving Will Impact Bitcoin Mining,"Bitcoin’s hashrate will not drop by that much  Contrary to popular belief, this halving will likely not cause a major decrease in the network's hashrate. After Bitcoin’s first three halvings, the hashrate plummeted by 25%, 11%, and 25%, and it appears many analysts and miners are expecting (or hoping for?) a similar hashrate reduction this time.  I concur with Pennyether's prediction that the forthcoming Bitcoin halving is expected to result in a modest decrease in the hashrate, ranging from 5 to 10%. This prediction is also not far from that of Hashrate Index, which sits at 3-7%.  Jaran Mellerud is CEO of Hashlabs Mining. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's ""Future of Bitcoin"" package, published to coincide with the Halving in April 2024.  This cautious forecast stems from the present high profitability of Bitcoin mining, driven by its high price, and the observation that approximately 70% of Bitcoin's hashrate was introduced since January 2022, operating under mining economics that at times were less favorable than those now anticipated post-halving.  Additionally, the hashrate is expected to quickly bounce back from this slight dip. In the past three halvings, the network recovered its pre-halving hashrate levels within an average of 57 days. This trend highlights an important perspective: halvings should not be viewed as events that lower the hashrate, but rather as brief pauses in the hashrate's relentless upward trajectory.  The hashrate's robustness is further enhanced by the continuous efforts of miners to update their equipment with the newest and most efficient models. This strategy is anticipated not just to offset any short-term reductions in hashrate, but is also likely to lead to a significant uptick in hashrate in the forthcoming months.  In essence, the upcoming Bitcoin halving is likely to be a brief hiccup in the network's hashrate trajectory, rather than a significant setback.  High-cost miners will be forced to upgrade fleets  Data from CoinMetrics highlights that most of the industry currently operates with relatively inefficient machines like the Antminer S19J Pro. These miners require an operating cost of $0.05/kWh or lower to maintain healthy gross profit margins post-halving.  However, with the average hosting rate in the United States sitting just below $0.08/kWh, as indicated by Hashrate Index, many U.S.-based miners could face cash flow challenges after the halving and thus be forced to undertake massive fleet upgrades.  Bitmain's launch of its new machines, including the S21, T21, and S21 Pro — each boasting efficiencies below 20 J/TH — arrives just in time for the halving. This development is prompting many U.S.-based hosting providers to push their customers to switch from S19J Pro to S21 models. Given the high hosting fees in the U.S., this push can be seen as a necessity rather than a choice.  Referring to the chart above, it's evident that the S19J Pro models are unlikely to generate positive cash flow when hosted at $0.08 per kWh, considering their direct bitcoin production cost stands at $75,000. Thus, miners facing higher operational expenses must transition to more efficient hardware, such as the Antminer S21 or similar models, to maintain profitability.  While upgrading to the latest machines allows operations to continue even in high-cost environments, it's hardly a viable long-term strategy. The necessity to constantly update hardware, often before the previous investments are recouped, underscores the unsustainability of such an approach.  My underlying message is clear: if you need to use the latest-generation hardware to stay cash flow positive, your operating costs are too high.  Miners will find creative ways to increase profits  Bitcoin mining is one of the most free and competitive markets globally, a market that Adam Smith himself would admire. This inherent competitiveness fuels a relentless pursuit of innovation, especially during challenging periods such as the halving events. In response to the pressures exerted by the halving, miners are adopting some of the most inventive strategies to maximize the utility of their existing resources.  One such strategy is underclocking, a process in which the machines’ electricity consumption is reduced to increase the energy efficiency and reduce costs. This process, which can be facilitated by third-party firmware like LuxOS, significantly improves machine efficiency — a critical adaptation in an environment where margins are thin. The movement towards underclocking is likely to gain momentum.  Moreover, the quest for increased profitability extends beyond operational tweaks to include novel revenue-generating approaches. A compelling example comes from Hashlabs in Finland, where we are undertaking a project taking advantage of several revenue streams to boost mining profitability.  In Finland, we have diversified our income streams to include selling waste heat from our miners to a district heating system, earning fees for contributing to the stabilization of the electric grid, and strategically selling electricity back to the market during periods of high spot prices. These ancillary revenue channels are significantly bolstering the profitability of our mining operation.  The upcoming halving is set to act as a catalyst, driving miners worldwide to emulate Hashlabs by exploring and implementing creative strategies to augment their profits.  Some miners will diversify away from mining  The fierce competitiveness that defines the current state of the mining industry is prompting many, especially public miners, to explore new horizons. Increasingly, there's a move towards AI computing, with companies like Iren and Hive Digital Technologies leading the charge.  The trend towards diversification is expected to pick up momentum over the challenging coming months. Yet, the dynamics of the mining industry are cyclic. Predictions for a bull market in 2025 portend a reversal of this diversification trend. As the value of bitcoin potentially climbs, miners may set aside their diversification strategies in favor of maximizing returns from mining, diving back into the fray with renewed vigor on extracting value from every hash.  This shift between diversification and focused mining reflects the broader ebbs and flows of the market. Miners' strategies evolve with the market, balancing between seizing immediate opportunities in new industries and preparing for the next upsurge in bitcoin mining profitability.  Bitcoin mining will become more geographically decentralized  Currently, the United States commands a substantial portion of the global hashrate, accounting for 40%, while China and Russia are also key players, contributing 15% and 20%, respectively. However, the industry is gradually shifting towards a more globally dispersed model, driven by the perpetual quest for cost efficiencies, especially cheaper electricity.  As miners brace for the upcoming halving, many are exploring emerging mining markets across Africa, Latin America, and Asia where electricity is exceptionally cheap. For instance, Bitfarms is making strides in Argentina and Paraguay; Bitdeer is expanding its capacity in Bhutan; Marathon is entering the United Arab Emirates and Paraguay; and Hashlabs is offering hosting solutions in Ethiopia.  The impending halving event acts as a catalyst for hashrate migration, compelling miners to venture beyond developed nations to secure more economical electricity sources. This move towards a more geographically decentralized mining network is poised to have a profound positive impact on Bitcoin. By distributing the hashrate more evenly across the globe, Bitcoin mining will not only become less susceptible to regional regulatory risks and power cost fluctuations but also align more closely with the decentralized ethos that underpins Bitcoin itself.  Little impact on the bitcoin price  The forthcoming Bitcoin halving is eagerly awaited as a potential trigger for the next bull market. Yet, considering the current annualized issuance rate sits at an already meager level of 1.6%, and with nearly 94% of all Bitcoin already in circulation, the anticipated supply shock from this halving is likely to have a minimal impact on the bitcoin price.  The impact of the negative supply shocks in earlier halvings was profound, especially during the first halving when the annualized issuance plummeted from 25% to 12.5%, and the second when it dropped from 8.4% to 4.2%. However, in this upcoming halving, the decrease from 1.6% to 0.8% represents a much less significant shift compared to the dramatic changes observed in previous cycles.  Don't misunderstand my position; I still foresee a bull market in the wake of this halving. However, the growing demand, and not the meager supply decline, will be the main factor fueling the price surge.  I like Dylan LeClair’s analogy of the halving as a ""global advertisement,"" suggesting that its principal effect on bitcoin's price is not so much the immediate result of decreased supply but rather the increased media attention and investor enthusiasm it generates. This heightened awareness could stimulate demand, turning the halving into a self-fulfilling prophecy of bullish market sentiment.  This perspective also aligns with insights from Daniel Polotsky questioning the continuing relevance of bitcoin's four-year cycle. While fluctuations in demand will persist, the impact of supply changes is becoming increasingly negligible.  At this point, the issuance rate of Bitcoin has become so low that its supply has a minimal effect on its price, which is now primarily influenced by demand. While the narrative surrounding the halving continues to be a strong driver and is expected to propel bitcoin into a new bull market, this influence is likely to diminish in the future. As a result, it's probable that bitcoin will eventually decouple from the four-year halving cycle.  Bring the halving on!  I have great memories from the halving in 2020. The atmosphere within the Bitcoin community was electric with anticipation as we approached the moment when the block subsidy would be cut in half. This pivotal event sparked an incredible wave of bullishness throughout the summer of 2020, setting the stage for the monumental bull market of 2021. Although I remain skeptical that the modest reduction in supply due to this halving will significantly alter bitcoin's price equilibrium, the prospect of it igniting increased demand and investor enthusiasm is something I eagerly await.  From the vantage point of a miner, the halving presents more than just a potential market rally; it's an opportunity to introspect and innovate within our operations. It prompts us to explore new methodologies to reduce costs and enhance efficiency, ensuring our survival and success in this highly competitive field. The halving isn't just a test of resilience but a catalyst for evolution within the mining community.  As we look forward to the next halving, it is essential to remember the core ethos of Bitcoin. Bitcoin wasn't created for the miners; its heart beats for the hodlers. Miners play a crucial role, no doubt, servicing the Bitcoin network and ensuring its robustness. Yet, the true spirit of Bitcoin lies in its ability to empower holders, providing a decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems. The anticipation and excitement for the halving resonate not just among miners but throughout the entire community of Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors.  So, as we edge closer to this pivotal event, let's embrace the halving with open arms and a spirit of innovation. It's a reminder of the dynamic landscape of Bitcoin, a testament to its resilience, and a beacon of the exciting developments yet to come. To all hodlers and miners alike, let's gear up for the halving.

25411619,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602006,1712588441,"Skybridge CEO Says Bitcoin Can Reach Half Of Gold Market, How Much Will BTC Be?","The future price and valuation of Bitcoin is a hot topic of debate, with varying predictions from different camps. One sentiment is maintained by most, though, and that is the fact that the cryptocurrency is going to trade at a much higher valuation than it is currently. Skybridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci shares this sentiment, predicting that the Bitcoin market cap will eventually reach half of the gold market cap. Batting For Bitcoin To Capture 50% Of Gold Market Cap Anthony Scaramucci has long been a proponent of Bitcoin and has been very vocal about his support for the coin. Once again, the Skybridge Capital CEO has come forward to reiterate his stance on Bitcoin, giving a prediction for where he expects the price to go in the future. Related Reading: Breakout Of The Year? Crypto Analyst Predicts Where NEAR Is Headed Next Scaramucci told CNBC in an interview that he expects the price of Bitcoin to eventually touch $170,000. Not only that, he said that he expects that the Bitcoin market cap will someday reach 50% of the gold valuation. The CEO explains that Bitcoin has seen a positive upside as there has been more regulatory clarity surrounding the digital asset, as well as the approval of various Spot Bitcoin ETFs. And it is the success of these Spot Bitcoin ETFs that is driving Scaramucci’s belief that Bitcoin will reach half of gold’s valuation. He explains that it took the Gold ETF a year to reach $10 billion in inflows. However, in the case of Bitcoin, it has done it in three months, meaning it took 25% of the time it took gold to achieve this. Then with the halving on the way, Scaramucci explains that supply is going to get even lower. The CEO further explains that he expects Bitcoin to become a store of value, something that will push it up as a competitor for gold. In this case, its continuous growth will see it eventually around half of gold’s market cap. Where Will BTC Trade At This Valuation? The current gold market cap lies at approximately $15.7 trillion market cap and half of this would put the Bitcoin market cap at a high $7.85 trillion. The current BTC market cap is at $1.4 trillion, with a price of $72,000 per coin. This means that a market cap of $7.85 trillion would see the cryptocurrency trade much higher. Related Reading: Dogecoin Finds A Bottom: How The 7-Year Cycle Can Send Price To $40 With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s market cap of $7.85 trillion would put the price per BTC at a whopping $378,000. Such an increase would represent a 500% increase from the current price levels. And then, with Bitcoin controlling around half of the total crypto market cap and assuming altcoins continue to grow alongside it, this could easily see the entire crypto market reach a $14 trillion market cap, strengthening the competition with gold. However, Scaramucci does not give a timeline for when he expects this to happen and he cautions investors to not expect it soon. “It’s not going to happen overnight, and there will be a lot of volatility,” the Skybridge Capital CEO warned.

The ascent, marked by a more than 4.5% increase within a mere five-hour window from below $69,500 to an intra-day high of $72,579, can be attributed to a confluence of factors that have stirred the crypto market. #1 Strong Bitcoin Spot Demand The rally appears to be fueled by robust demand in the Bitcoin spot market, hinting at the potential sustainability of the move. Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) noted the healthy market dynamics, stating on X, “Funding rates still looking solid. Healthy reset, price slowly grinding up. That’s what we want and how we want to keep it. If longs start aping again while spot bid stops, then that will end up in another flush at some point. For now, all good.” Related Reading: 12 Days Until Bitcoin Halving: Why $100,000 Isn’t Much Further Away In tandem with the rising spot prices, data from Coinglass reveals that $40.7 million in BTC shorts were liquidated today, further propelling the price upwards. #2 BTC Halving The imminence of the next Bitcoin halving, slated to occur roughly 12 days from now on April 20, has also probably played a pivotal role. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced a pre-halving price retraction followed by a significant rally leading into the event. The halving will reduce the Bitcoin reward from approximately 900 coins per day to 450 coins. Skybridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci shared his insights with CNBC recently, highlighting the unpriced nature of the upcoming halving and its potential to further drive Bitcoin’s price. “They’re now saying that the halving is priced in. I don’t believe that. I think Bitcoin has a lot more to go here,” he stated. At current prices, roughly $65 million in Bitcoin ETF inflows per day are needed to buy up the daily mined supply. In 2.5 weeks, that’s only $32.5 million. #3 BTC Follows Gold The correlation between Bitcoin and gold, both considered safe-haven assets, is another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price movement. Gold’s strong opening this week, reaching a new all-time high of $2.253, has been mirrored by Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Gold enthusiast Peter Schiff and crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe have both remarked on the positive correlation between the two assets, suggesting a shared momentum amid economic uncertainties. Gold bug Peter Schiff commented via X: “It’s been a volatile Sunday night for gold. After an early $27 sell off, it rallied over $45, hitting a new record high above $2,348. This is an early stage of a major repricing of gold to reflect much higher future inflation. It’s a warning that monetary policy is too loose.” Related Reading: $115-Million Bitcoin Whale Wakes Up From 10-Year Slumber – What’s Next? Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe remarked: “There we go. Gold opening up with a big new upwards candle and Bitcoin is back to $71,000. Given the strength on commodities and the current price action of Bitcoin, I suspect we’ll see a test of the all-time high coming up.” #4 Strong Weekly Close The significance of Bitcoin’s weekly candle close was highlighted by CRG, a renowned analyst, who pointed to it as a contributor to the rally. The ability of Bitcoin’s price to close sustainably above its 2021 high for the second consecutive week signals a strong bullish sentiment in the market.

42418448,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGdp,1712583827,Detained Binance Exec Pleads Not Guilty to Money Laundering Charges in Nigeria: Reports,"Binance's head of financial crime compliance Tigran Gambaryan reportedly pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges in a Nigerian high court on Monday before he was remanded pending trial.  Despite Binance saying Gambaryan had no decision-making power at the company, presiding judge for the case reportedly ruled he can be considered a representative of the company under Nigerian law.  Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan, who was detained by Nigerian authorities in February alongside a colleague, pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges at a high court on Monday, local outlets reported.  Gambaryan was remanded until trial, according to reports, while bail can be requested until April 18.  The head of Binance's financial crime compliance was detained in the country along with another executive at the company, Nadeem Anjarwalla, back in February amid accusations by Nigeria's government that Binance had helped process illegal funds worth billions of dollars and that it had manipulated the exchange rate for the Nigerian naira.  In March, Anjarwalla escaped custody and, since then, the two executives have filed suit against the Nigerian government accusing it of violating human rights.  Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has accused Binance, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla of tax evasion, while the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has accused the same parties of laundering money.  Despite Binance's statement last week urging Gambaryan should not be held responsible for the company because he doesn't have any desicion-making power, a Nigerian judge allowed the suit to continue, reports said.  Justice Emeka Nwite reportedly argued that Gambaryan and Anjarwalla had in the past engaged with officials in the country regarding the crypto exchange's operations, and therefore could pass as representatives of the firm.  Gambaryan reportedly pleaded not guilty to five counts including one alleging that he, Anjarwalla and Binance used the crypto exchange to ""unlawfully negotiate foreign exchange rates in Nigeria and you thereby committed an offense contrary to and punishable under section 29(1) (C) of the Foreign Exchange (Monitoring And Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.""

The “Airdrops by June 30?” market on Polymarket has garnered $400,000 worth of bets so far. While that might sound small, it's a substantial figure for the crypto prediction platform, excluding its U.S. presidential election market (which has attracted more than $105 million, dwarfing past records for the entire sector).  In the running are 23 different networks, platforms and layer 2s, each one active for at least two months with meaningful user activity.  Four of those – Solana NFT marketplace Tensor, real estate exchange platform Parcl, derivatives platform Drift, and restaking platform Swell – have already confirmed an airdrop, netting gains of as much as 80% to speculators who were laying bets since February.  Eyes are now on hyped platforms such as layer 2s Blast and Base, restaking tool Eigenlayer, multichain network LayerZero and social finance application Friend.Tech.  Nearly $100,000 has been bet on whether LayerZero will drop a token by the end of April. ""Yes"" shares are trading at two cents, meaning the market thinks there is only a 2% chance it will happen. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction turns out to be correct.  Read more; Crypto Speculators Betting on ‘No Airdrop’ for Arbitrum Lose 95%  LayerZero, which connects 50 blockchains using its network, has previously confirmed airdrop plans sometime in the first half of 2024, but there have been few details since.  Blast and Friend.Tech have amassed just over $30,000 in wagers–likely on expectations of their points programs, which reward an on-screen numerical value to users based on platform activity, with loose promises they'll eventually be rewarded with tokens.  Eigenlayer has captured the biggest mindshare, however. Over $56,000 is betting on whether the platform will release a token before June 30 on the general airdrop market, with a 66% probability. A separate market that ends on April 30 has attracted even more money—$63,000—but with just a 17% chance of an airdrop.  Don’t want to bet on when? Bet on how much: A significantly smaller market is betting on the expected valuation of Eigenlayer after its token is released, with scenarios ranging from no token launch to a $40 billion market cap.  Layer 2s are secondary networks or infrastructure built atop a main blockchain, such as Ethereum, to help with scalability and speed. Restaking is one of the hottest crypto sectors birthed in the bear market; it is essentially a way to put one’s ether holdings to work in various protocols in addition to the main Ethereum blockchains.  Value locked on platforms such as EigenLayer has grown to over $13 billion in just nine months, data shows, mainly buoyed by a slightly higher interest on deposits than conventional ETH staking (over 5%, compared to 3.3% on Lido) plus the allure of a future token drop.  Flashback to 2021: ‘Wen Token?’ Polymarket’s New Airdrop Futures Market Has Answers  It's easy to see why airdrops are a popular topic for prediction markets. They represent free money, after all. And if investors have an inkling of which protocols are likely to do airdrops for participants in a certain timeframe, and which ones aren't, it can inform their decisions about where to put money to work.  Was last month the hottest March ever?  While the sun hasn’t managed to fry eggs on the sidewalks (yet), there’s a prediction market that’s betting on last month being the hottest March in recorded history.  A $212,000 bet will resolve on May 1 if the data for the Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index for March 2024 shows an increase of 1.37°C or greater when it is released. Speculators have placed odds of a 72% chance as of Monday, modeling data using land and sea surface areas.  Kalshi's big score  Wall Street powerhouse Susquehanna International Group is launching a trading desk focused on ""events contracts,” hoping to attract Wall Street investors interested in betting on things other than traditional financial assets.  The firm will use the U.S.-regulated platform Kalshi to place and settle bets, as per Bloomberg. Most of the bets on Kalshi are aimed at retail traders and have limits of $25,000, but the firm recently got the green light to allow bigger investors to bet up to $7 million.

Baanx’s “Crypto Life” card is also used by crypto storage firm Ledger.  Getting deeper into Web3, Mastercard was recently reported to be working with the Ethereum wallet Metamask.  Decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch Network has created a Web3 debit card in partnership with crypto card developer Baanx and powered by payments giant Mastercard, the companies said on Monday.  The 1inch Card will allow users to use their crypto for online and in-person purchases and make cash withdrawals at supported ATMs through seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion, according to a press release. Baanx’s “Crypto Life” card is also used by crypto storage firm Ledger.  Large payment networks like Mastercard and Visa have lately been exploring where Web3 applications and wallets will crossover with payments. Mastercard was recently reported to be working with Metamask, the popular Ethereum-based wallet, for instance.  “We already have a lot of people who are using one 1inch for swaps, limit orders and also as a developer portal,” said 1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz in an interview. “But we wanted to also onboard the man on the street who is holding crypto. So we decided to go with the 1inch card because it offers us an additional entry point for new people. Those who are more familiar with the traditional world and using a debit card and paying with crypto assets.”  The mission for Baanx, which works with Ledger, Tezos and others, is to marry the traditional and the crypto world in a way that empowers users, explained the firm’s chief commercial officer, Simon Jones.  “We are offering crypto without compromise. In other words, users can make their own decisions about how they want to spend, lend, trade or whatever they want to do with their digital assets. But also make these acceptable and spendable in over 160 million locations worldwide,” Jones said in an interview.  The 1inch Card will come in the form of a physical card, as well as a virtual card, providing users with all benefits of a standard debit card.  “Leveraging Mastercard’s leading technology and standards, the 1inch Card is connecting Web2 and Web3 worlds in an innovative way,” said Christian Rau, Senior Vice President, Crypto and Fintech Enablement at Mastercard in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,1INCH | ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/08/defi-firm-1inch-introduces-web3-debit-card-in-partnership-with-mastercard-and-baanx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f86042323a5c703a22a85752f0f70ee4be9bbc96-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Price Targetted At Unprecedented Heights This Cycle Over the past month, the price of Bitcoin has been consolidating and hasn’t been able to sustain its rise beyond its new peak of $73,000. However, things could soon be changing, as Michael Van De Poppe expects the coin to surge immensely in the short term. His forecast coincides with anticipation around the upcoming Bitcoin Halving expected to take place in less than 12 days, fueling optimism within the crypto community. Related Reading: 12 Days Until Bitcoin Halving: Why $100,000 Isn’t Much Further Away According to the expert, the largest cryptocurrency asset by market cap is still experiencing significant resistance. Nonetheless, if Bitcoin manages to break out of this zone, the coin could witness a progression towards new all-time highs in the coming months. Given that BTC achieved the $70,000 price level ahead of the halving event, Poppe believes that it is likely to surge to unprecedented levels, particularly topping out at $300,000 in this bull run. The post read: Bitcoin still facing crucial resistance. If this breaks, then we will be seeing a continuation towards new all-time highs. Bitcoin at $70,000 pre-halving. Likely $300,000 this cycle. Poppe underscored that the price of Bitcoin returned to $70,000 level over the weekend. As a result, he has pointed out bullish indicators that are presently occurring in the crypto landscape. The analyst also noted that the strength of the cryptocurrency markets has now exceeded our perceptions, and dips in altcoins represent opportunities for good entries. In addition, BTC’s price action demonstrates the potential to reach a new all-time high pre-halving, and the shift in favor of altcoins is on the horizon. Altcoin Season Set To Kick Off In Weeks Poppe is super bullish toward an ‘altcoin season’. However, it is important to note that altcoins’ value has frequently coincided with shifts in Bitcoin’s supremacy. But even though Bitcoin’s dominance is still at its peak prior to the halving, Poppe thinks these coins still have a lot of momentum. Related Reading: Forget Bitcoin! Altcoins Set For Explosive Growth With Potential 1,000x Returns — Analyst He advocates that a new altcoin season will undoubtedly begin in the upcoming weeks. “We always have one, we have seen Meme coins, Solana (SOL) ecosystem, and AI,” he stated. The expert’s statement suggests that the Solana ecosystem, AI projects, and meme coins in recent months have led the altcoin market. Thus, Michael Van De Poppe has contended that in the impending alt season, crypto initiatives that prioritize the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA), the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, and the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) are likely to be next, paving the way for alts this cycle. At the time of writing, the altcoin’s overall market excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum was valued at $753.47 billion. This indicates a 2% increase in the market cap in the past 24 hours.

In his newly-created role of Global Head of Capacity Building, Lee will liaise with regulators, law enforcement, tax agencies and financial institutions, advising them on ways to build their capacity to fight crypto crime using Chainalysis’ data and tools.  Lee retired from the IRS in March, after three years as IRS-CI chief and 29 years total of of service at the agency. Under his leadership, IRS-CI shut down Hydra, a darknet marketplace, and seized crypto from Hamas. Lee was also at the helm of the takedown of Welcome to Video, a darknet marketplace for child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) that accepted crypto payments. In the wake of the shut down, 23 children were rescued and 337 child abusers were arrested.  Chainalysis also played a role in each of those three cases.  “Crypto is the future of finance, which also means it's the future of crime,” Lee wrote in a Monday blog post on Chainalysis’ website. He added that each of the cases were “reflective of the fact that cryptocurrency is, at least in part, being used for a wide range of nefarious activities.”  “But by equipping law enforcement agencies with the best-in-class tools and data to fight this activity, we can ensure that the crypto ecosystem remains as safe as possible, so that people around the world can realize its many benefits without fear of being targeted by criminals,” Lee said.

42418473,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGiz,1712580852,JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's Annual Letter: Interest Rates Could Go Far Higher Than Many Expect (Full Text),"Dear Fellow Shareholders,  Across the globe, 2023 was yet another year of significant challenges, from the terrible ongoing war and violence in the Middle East and Ukraine to mounting terrorist activity and growing geopolitical tensions, importantly with China. Almost all nations felt the effects last year of global economic uncertainty, including higher energy and food prices, inflation rates and volatile markets. While all these events and associated instability have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, clients and countries where we do business, their consequences on the world at large — with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people, escalating tragedy in the Middle East and the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important.  As these events unfold, America’s global leadership role is being challenged outside by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount. We should remember that America, “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,” still remains a shining beacon of hope to citizens around the world. JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure.  In spite of the unsettling landscape, including last year’s regional bank turmoil, the U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and the markets currently expect a soft landing. It is important to note that the economy is being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus. There is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to a greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure and battling rising healthcare costs. This may lead to stickier inflation and higher rates than markets expect. Furthermore, there are downside risks to watch. Quantitative tightening is draining more than $900 billion in liquidity from the system annually — and we have never truly experienced the full effect of quantitative tightening on this scale. Plus the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious.  2023 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with our firm generating record revenue for the sixth consecutive year, as well as setting numerous records in each of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2023 of $162.4 billion1 and net income of $49.6 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 21%, reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also increased our quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share to $1.05 per share in the third quarter of 2023 — and again to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 — while continuing to reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and technology while exercising strict risk disciplines.  Throughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy and guiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients — as we always are — in both good times and bad times. The result was continued growth broadly across the firm. We will highlight a few examples from 2023: Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) extended its #1 leadership positions and grew share year-over-year in retail deposits, credit card sales and credit card outstandings (adding close to 3.6 million net new customers to the franchise); the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) maintained its #1 rank in both Investment Banking and Markets and gained more than 100 basis points of Investment Banking market share; Commercial Banking (CB) added over 5,000 new relationships (excluding First Republic Bank), roughly doubling the prior year’s achievement; and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) saw record client asset net inflows of $490 billion, over 20% higher than its prior record.  In 2023, we continued to play a forceful and essential role in advancing economic growth. In total, we extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.3 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world. On a daily basis, we move nearly $10 trillion in over 120 currencies and more than 160 countries, as well as safeguard over $32 trillion in assets. By purchasing First Republic Bank, we brought much-needed stability to the U.S. banking system while allowing us to give a new, secure home to over half a million First Republic customers.  As always, we hold fast to our commitment to corporate responsibility, including helping to create a stronger, more inclusive economy — from supporting work skills training programs around the world to financing affordable housing and small businesses to making investments in cities like Detroit that show how business and government leaders can work together to solve problems.  We have achieved our decades-long consistency by adhering to our key principles and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles below), which allow us to drive good organic growth and promote proper management of our capital (including dividends and stock buybacks). The charts below show our performance results and illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. Please peruse them and the CEO letters in this Annual Report, all of which provide specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future.  STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING (AND ONE NEW ONE)  Looking back on the past two+ decades — starting from my time as Chairman and CEO of Bank One in 2000 — there is one common theme: our unwavering dedication to help clients, communities and countries throughout the world. It is clear that our financial discipline, constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people have enabled us to achieve this consistency and commitment. In addition, across the firm, we uphold certain steadfast tenets that are worth repeating.  First, our work has very real human impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds and directly by single investors, in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. More than 100 million people in the United States own stocks; many, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Frequently, these shareholders are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, healthcare workers, retirees, or those saving for a home, education or retirement. Often, our employees also bank these shareholders, as well as their families and their companies. Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to all of our shareholders.  Second, shareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant company, which means doing a good job of taking care of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned over the past few years, there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its employees and its communities while still strengthening shareholder value.  Third, while we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in the long run we consider our stock price a measure of our progress over time. This progress is a function of continual investments in our people, systems and products, in good and bad times, to build our capabilities. These important investments will also drive our company’s future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades. Measured by stock performance, our progress is exceptional. For example, whether looking back 10 years or even farther to 2004, when the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took place, we have outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & Poor’s Financials Index.  Fourth, we are united behind basic principles and strategies (you can see the principles for How We Do Business on our website and our Purpose statement in my letter from last year) that have helped build this company and made it thrive. These allow us to maintain a fortress balance sheet, constantly invest and nurture talent, fully satisfy regulators, continually improve risk, governance and controls, and serve customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwide. This philosophy is embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firm.  Fifth, we strive to build enduring businesses, which rely on and benefit from one another, but we are not a conglomerate. This structure helps generate our superior returns. Nonetheless, despite our best efforts, the walls that protect this company are not particularly high — and we face extraordinary competition. I have written about this reality extensively in the past and cover it again in this letter. We recognize our strengths and vulnerabilities, and we play our hand as best we can.  Sixth, and this is the new one, we must be a source of strength, particularly in tough times, for our clients and the countries in which we operate. We must take seriously our role as one of the guardians of the world’s financial systems.  Seventh, we operate with a very important silent partner — the U.S. government — noting as my friend Warren Buffett points out that his company’s success is predicated upon the extraordinary conditions our country creates. He is right to say to his shareholders that when they see the American flag, they all should say thank you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company, and we always want to give back and pay our fair share. We do pay our fair share — and we want it to be spent well and have the greatest impact. To give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 years, we paid more than $46 billion in federal, state and local taxes in the United States and over $22 billion in taxes outside of the United States. Additionally, we paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over $10 billion so that it has the resources to cover failure in the American banking sector. Our partner — the federal government — also imposes significant regulations upon us, and it is imperative that we meet all legal and regulatory requirements imposed on our company.  Eighth and finally, we know the foundation of our success rests with our people. They are the front line, both individually and as teams, serving our customers and communities, building the technology, making the strategic decisions, managing the risks, determining our investments and driving innovation. However you view the world — its complexity, risks and opportunities — a company’s prosperity requires a great team of people with guts, brains, integrity, enormous capabilities and high standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success.  I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. Throughout these challenging past few years, we have never stopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities. As you know, we are champions of banking’s essential role in a community — its potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals, and for being a source of strength in difficult times. I often remind our employees that the work we do matters and has impact. United by our principles and purpose, we help people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up individuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions of the world. What we have accomplished in the 20 years since the Bank One and JPMorgan Chase merger is evidence of the importance of our values.  CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BANK ONE/JPMORGAN CHASE MERGER  J.P. Morgan Chase  By 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase already represented the consolidation of four of the 10 largest U.S. banks from 1990: The Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical Banking Corp. and, most recently, J.P. Morgan & Company. And some of their predecessor companies stretched back into the 1800s, one even into the late 1700s.  Bank One  Bank One had been even busier on the acquisition front, especially across the United States. By 1998, then Banc One had more than 1,300 branches in 12 states when it announced a merger with First Chicago NBD, a Chicago-based bank created just three years earlier by the merger of First Chicago and Detroit-based NBD. Now headquartered in Chicago, the new Bank One became the largest bank in the Midwest, second largest among credit card companies and fourth largest in the United States. But the merger didn’t go as planned, with Bank One issuing three different earnings warnings. In March 2000, Bank One reached outside its executive ranks, and my tenure began as Chairman and CEO, working to overhaul the company and help bring it back to profitability and growth.  The story begins ... A merger 20 years ago helped transform two giant banks  Fast forward to 2003, and another wave of consolidation was well underway in U.S. banking. Most of the nation’s larger banks were trying to position themselves to be an “endgame winner.” In the biggest deal, Bank of America agreed to buy FleetBoston Financial Corp. for more than $40 billion. Those two banks — already amalgamations of several predecessor companies — touted the breadth of their combined retail branch network.  But they were hardly alone. In 2003, some 215 deals were announced among U.S. commercial banks and bank holding companies for a total value of $66 billion, according to Thomson Financial, which tracks merger data.  In July 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One merged — as part of a 225-year journey — to form this exceptional company of ours: JPMorgan Chase. At its merger in 2004, the combined bank was the fourth largest bank in the world by market capitalization. But with patient groundwork over the years — fixing systems and upgrading technology, managing the notable acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual (WaMu) and continuing to reinvest, including in our talent — we have made our company an endgame winner.  In earlier years, banks worried about their survival. While the past two decades have brought some virtually unprecedented challenges, including the great financial crisis and a pandemic followed by a global shutdown, they did not stop us from accomplishing extraordinary things. Our bank has now emerged as the #1 bank by market capitalization.  Each of our businesses is among the best in the world, with increased market share, strong financial results and an unwavering focus on serving our clients, communities and shareholders with distinction and dedication. The strengths that are embedded in JPMorgan Chase — the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our long-standing client relationships, our technology and product capabilities, our presence in more than 100 countries and our unquestionable fortress balance sheet — would be hard to replicate. Crucially, the strength of our company has allowed us to always be there for clients, governments and communities — in good times and in bad times — and this strength has enabled us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future.  You can see from the following charts what gains and improvements we have achieved along the way.  Within this letter, I discuss the following:  I.

First and foremost may well be the impact of artificial intelligence (AI).  While we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business — or how it will affect society at large — we are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others.  THE CRITICAL IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  Since the firm first started using AI over a decade ago, and its first mention in my 2017 letter to shareholders, we have grown our AI organization materially. It now includes more than 2,000 AI/machine learning (ML) experts and data scientists. We continue to attract some of the best and brightest in this space and have an exceptional firmwide AI/ML and Research department with deep expertise.  We have been actively using predictive AI and ML for years — and now have over 400 use cases in production in areas such as marketing, fraud and risk — and they are increasingly driving real business value across our businesses and functions. We're also exploring the potential that generative AI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, most notably in software engineering, customer service and operations, as well as in general employee productivity. In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows. We will continue to experiment with these AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in a safe, responsible way.  While we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are taking care of our employees if they are affected by this trend.  Finally, as a global leader across businesses and regions, we have large amounts of extraordinarily rich data that, together with AI, can fuel better insights and help us improve how we manage risk and serve our customers. In addition to making sure our data is high quality and easily accessible, we need to complete the migration of our analytical data estate to the public cloud. These new data platforms offer high-performance compute power, which will unlock our ability to use our data in ways that are hard to contemplate today.  Recognizing the importance of AI to our business, we created a new position called Chief Data & Analytics Officer that sits on our Operating Committee.  Elevating this new role to the Operating Committee level — reporting directly to Daniel Pinto and me — reflects how critical this function will be going forward and how seriously we expect AI to influence our business. This will embed data and analytics into our decision making at every level of the company. The primary focus is not just on the technical aspects of AI but also on how all management can — and should — use it. Each of our lines of business has corresponding data and analytics roles so we can share best practices, develop reusable solutions that solve multiple business problems, and continuously learn and improve as the future of AI unfolds.  Clearly, AI comes with many risks, which need to be rigorously managed.  We have a robust, well-established risk and control framework that helps us proactively stay in front of AI-related risks, particularly as the regulatory landscape evolves. And we will, of course, continue to work hard with our regulators, clients and subject matter experts to make sure we maintain the highest ethical standards and are transparent in how AI helps us make decisions; e.g., to counter bias among other things.  You may already be aware that there are bad actors using AI to try to infiltrate companies’ systems to steal money and intellectual property or simply to cause disruption and damage. For our part, we incorporate AI into our toolset to counter these threats and proactively detect and mitigate their efforts.  OUR JOURNEY TO THE CLOUD  Getting our technology to the cloud — whether the public cloud or the private cloud — is essential to fully maximize all of our capabilities, including the power of our data. The cloud offers many benefits: 1) it accelerates the speed of delivery of new services; 2) it simultaneously reduces the cost of compute power and enables, when needed, an extraordinary amount of compute capability — called burst computing; 3) it provides that compute capability across all of our data; and 4) it allows us to be able to constantly and quickly adopt new technologies because updated cloud services are continually being added — more so in the public cloud, where we benefit from the innovation that all cloud providers create, than in the private cloud, where innovation is only our own.  Of course, we are learning a lot along the way. For example, we know we should carefully pick which applications and which data go to the public cloud versus the private cloud because of the expense, security and capabilities required. In addition, it is critical that we eventually use multiple clouds to avoid lock-in. And we intend to maintain our own expertise so that we’re never reliant on the expertise of others even if that requires additional money.  We invested approximately $2 billion to build four new, modern, private cloud-based, highly reliable and efficient data centers in the United States (we have 32 data centers globally). To date, about 50% of our applications run a large part of their processing in the public or private cloud. Approximately 70% of our data is now running in the public or private cloud. By the end of 2024, we aim to have 70% of applications and 75% of data moved to the public or private cloud. The new data centers are around 30% more efficient than our existing legacy data centers. Going to the public cloud can provide 30% additional efficiency if done correctly (efficiency improves when your data and applications have been modified, or “refactored,” to enable new cloud services). We have been constantly updating most of our global data centers, and by the end of this year, we can start closing some that are larger, older and less efficient.  ACQUIRING FIRST REPUBLIC BANK AND ITS CUSTOMERS  The purchase of First Republic Bank was not something that we would have done just for ourselves. But the regulators relied on us to step forward (we worked hand in hand with the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the U.S. Treasury), and the purchase of First Republic helped stabilize and strengthen the U.S. financial system in a time of crisis.  The acquisition of a major company entails a lot of complexity. People tend to focus on the financial and economic outcomes, which is a reasonable thing to do. And in the case of First Republic, the numbers look rather good. We recorded an accounting gain of $3 billion on the purchase, and we told the world we expected to add more than $500 million to earnings annually, which we now believe will be closer to $2 billion. However, these results mask some of the true costs. First, approximately one-third of the incremental earning was simply deploying excess capital and liquidity, which doesn’t require purchasing a $300 billion bank — we simply could have bought $300 billion of assets. Second, as soon as the deal was announced, approximately 7,600 of our employees went from working on tasks that would benefit the future of JPMorgan Chase to working on the merger integration. Overall, the integration involves effectively combining more than 165 systems (e.g., statement, deposit, accounting and human resources) and consolidating policies, risk reporting, and other various rules and procedures. We hope to have most of the integration done by the middle of 2024.  Fortunately, we were very familiar and comfortable with all of the assets we were acquiring from First Republic. What we didn’t take on was First Republic’s excessive interest rate exposure — one of the reasons it failed — which we effectively hedged within days of the acquisition.  Our people did a great job of respectfully managing this transition, knowing that circumstances were particularly tough for our new colleagues, whom we tried to welcome with open arms. We did everything we could to redeploy individuals whose jobs were lost because of the merger (we directly hired over 5,000 people). Our approach has always been to go into an acquisition knowing we can learn things from other teams, and in this case, we did: First Republic had done an outstanding job serving high-net-worth clients and venture capitalists, and we are developing what is effectively a new business for us following First Republic’s servicing model. We will serve these high-net-worth clients through a single point of contact, supported by a concierge service model, across our distribution channels — including more than 20 new JPMorgan Chase branded branches.  NAVIGATING IN A COMPLEX AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WORLD  In the policy section, we talk about how we may be entering one of the most treacherous geopolitical eras since World War II. And I have written in the past about high levels of debt, fiscal stimulus, ongoing deficit spending and the unknown effects of quantitative tightening (which I am more worried about than most) so I won’t repeat those views here. However, the impacts of these geopolitical and economic forces are large and somewhat unprecedented; they may not be fully understood until they have completely played out over multiple years. In any case, JPMorgan Chase must be prepared for the various potential impacts and outcomes on our company and our people.  We remain wary of economic prognosticating.  While all companies essentially budget on a base case forecast, we are very careful not to run our business that way. Instead, we look at a range of potential outcomes for which we need to be prepared. Geopolitical and economic forces have an unpredictable timetable — they may unfold over months, or years, and are nearly impossible to put into a one-year forecast. They also have an unpredictable interplay: For example, the geopolitical situation may end up having virtually no effect on the world’s economy or it could potentially be its determinative factor.  We have ongoing concerns about persistent inflationary pressures and consider a wide range of outcomes to manage interest rate exposure and other business risks.  Many key economic indicators today continue to be good and possibly improving, including inflation. But when looking ahead to tomorrow, conditions that will affect the future should be considered. For example, there seems to be a large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue. All of the following factors appear to be inflationary: ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization of the world, restructuring of global trade, capital needs of the new green economy, and possibly higher energy costs in the future (even though there currently is an oversupply of gas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack of needed investment in the energy infrastructure. In the past, fiscal deficits did not seem to be closely related to inflation. In the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a general understanding that inflation was driven by “guns and butter”; i.e., fiscal deficits and the increase to the money supply, both partially driven by the Vietnam War, led to increased inflation, which went over 10%. The deficits today are even larger and occurring in boom times — not as the result of a recession — and they have been supported by quantitative easing, which was never done before the great financial crisis. Quantitative easing is a form of increasing the money supply (though it has many offsets). I remain more concerned about quantitative easing than most, and its reversal, which has never been done before at this scale.  Equity values, by most measures, are at the high end of the valuation range, and credit spreads are extremely tight. These markets seem to be pricing in at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing — modest growth along with declining inflation and interest rates. I believe the odds are a lot lower than that. In the meantime, there seems to be an enormous focus, too much so, on monthly inflation data and modest changes to interest rates. But the die may be cast — interest rates looking out a year or two may be predetermined by all of the factors I mentioned above. Small changes in interest rates today may have less impact on inflation in the future than many people believe.  Therefore, we are prepared for a very broad range of interest rates, from 2% to 8% or even more, with equally wide-ranging economic outcomes — from strong economic growth with moderate inflation (in this case, higher interest rates would result from higher demand for capital) to a recession with inflation; i.e., stagflation. Economically, the worst-case scenario would be stagflation, which would not only come with higher interest rates but also with higher credit losses, lower business volumes and more difficult markets. Under these many different scenarios, our company would continue to perform at least okay. Importantly, being prepared means we can continue to help our clients no matter what the future portends.  The mini banking crisis of 2023 is over, but beware of higher rates and recession — not just for banks but for the whole economy.  When we purchased First Republic in May 2023 following the failure of two other regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, we thought that the current banking crisis was over. Only these three banks were offsides in having the toxic combination of extreme interest rate exposure, large unrealized losses in the held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio and highly concentrated deposits. Most of the other regional banks did not have these problems. However, we stipulated that the crisis was over provided that interest rates didn’t go up dramatically and we didn’t experience a serious recession. If long-end rates go up over 6% and this increase is accompanied by a recession, there will be plenty of stress — not just in the banking system but with leveraged companies and others. Remember, a simple 2 percentage point increase in rates essentially reduced the value of most financial assets by 20%, and certain real estate assets, specifically office real estate, may be worth even less due to the effects of recession and higher vacancies. Also remember that credit spreads tend to widen, sometimes dramatically, in a recession.  Finally, we should also consider that rates have been extremely low for a long time — it’s hard to know how many investors and companies are truly prepared for a higher rate environment.  We seek to be engaged globally and carefully manage complex countries and geopolitical issues.  JPMorgan Chase does business in more than 100 countries, and we have people on the ground in over 60 countries. In almost all those locations, we do research on their economy, their markets and their companies; we bank their government institutions and their companies; and we bank multinational corporations, including the U.S. multinational corporations within their borders. This is a critical role — not only in helping those countries grow and improve but also in expanding the global economy.  Many of these countries are quite complex with different laws, customs and regulations. We are occasionally asked why we bank certain companies and even certain countries, particularly when countries have some laws and customs that are counter to many of the values held in the United States. Here’s why:  The U.S. government sets foreign policy. And when it does, we salute. Wherever we do business, we follow the law of the United States, as it applies in that country (in addition to the laws of the country itself), in all respects. Think of trade rules, sanctions, anti-money laundering and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among others. By and large, these things help improve those countries. In most cases, the U.S. government does not want us to leave because it agrees, generally, that the engagement of American business enhances our relationships with other countries and helps those countries themselves.  Engagement makes the world a better place. We all should want the world to continue to improve. Isolation and lack of engagement do not accomplish that goal. While we believe that it makes sense for the United States to push for constant improvement around the world — from advocating for human rights to fighting corruption — this is rarely accomplished through coercion, and, in fact, is enhanced by engagement.  We need to be prepared for emerging challenges and position ourselves to understand them. We created a new role — Head of Asia Pacific Policy and Strategic Competitiveness — to focus specifically on key policy issues critical to the firm’s (and, in fact, the country’s) competitiveness, such as trade restrictions, supply chains and infrastructure. We also created a new strategic security forum to focus on emerging and evolving risks, including trade wars, pandemics, cybersecurity and actual wars, to name just a few.  OUR EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS, INCLUDING DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION  JPMorgan Chase makes an extraordinary effort as part of our “normal” day-to-day outreach to engage with individual clients, small and midsized businesses, large and multinational firms, government officials, regulators and the press in cities all around the world. This dialogue is part of the normal course of business but it is also part of building trust and putting down roots in a community.  We believe that companies, and banks in particular, must earn the trust of the communities and countries in which they operate. We believe — and we are unashamed about this — that it is our obligation to help lift up the communities and countries in which we do business. We believe that doing so enhances business and the general economic well-being of those communities and countries and also enhances long-term shareholder value. JPMorgan Chase thrives when communities thrive.  This approach is integral to what we do, in great scale, around the world — and it works. We are quite clear that whether our efforts are inspired by the goodness of our hearts (as philanthropy or venture-type investing) or good business, we try to measure the actual outcomes.  It’s also interesting to point out that many of our efforts were spawned from our work around Advancing Black Pathways, Military and Veterans Affairs, and our work in Detroit. While we’ve banked Detroit for more than 90 years, our $200 million investment in its economic recovery over the last decade demonstrated that investing in communities is a smart business strategy. We are one of the largest banks in Detroit, from consumer banking to investment banking, and it’s quite clear that not only did our efforts help Detroit, but they also helped us gain market share. The extent of Detroit’s remarkable recovery was recently highlighted when Moody’s upgraded the city’s credit rating to investment grade — an extraordinary achievement just over 10 years after the city filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.  For JPMorgan Chase, Detroit was an incubator for developing models that help us hone how we deploy our business resources, philanthropic capital, skilled volunteerism, and low-cost loans and equity investments, as well as how we identify top talent to drive successful business and societal improvements. I hope that, as shareholders, you are proud of our focus on promoting opportunity for all, both within and outside our organization, which includes economic opportunity. Some of our initiatives are listed below.  Business Resource Groups. To deepen our culture of inclusion in the workplace, we have 10 Business Resource Groups (BRG) across the company to connect more than 160,000 participating employees around common interests, as well as to foster networking and camaraderie. Groups welcome anyone — allies and those with shared affinities alike. For example, some of our largest BRGs are Access Ability (employees with disabilities and caregivers), Adelante (Hispanic and Latino employees), BOLD (Black employees), NextGen (early career professionals), PRIDE (LGBTQ+ employees) and Women on the Move.  Women on the Move. At JPMorgan Chase, they sure are! Women represent 28% of our firm’s senior leadership globally. In fact, our major lines of business — CCB, AWM and CIB, which would be among Fortune 1000 companies on their own — are all run by women (one with a co-head who is male). More than 10 years ago, a handful of senior women at the company, on their own, started this global, firmwide, internally focused organization called Women on the Move. It was so successful that we expanded the initiative beyond the company; it now empowers clients and consumers, as well as women employees and their allies, to build their careers, grow their businesses and improve their financial health. The Women on the Move BRG has more than 70,000 employees globally.  Advancing Black Pathways. This comprehensive program, which just reached the five-year mark, focuses on strengthening the economic foundation of Black communities because we know that opportunity is not always created equally. The program does so by, among other accomplishments, helping to diversify our talent pipeline, providing opportunities for Black individuals to enter the workforce and gain valuable experience, and investing in the financial success of Black Americans through a focus on financial health, homeownership and entrepreneurship. An important part of the program’s work is achieved through our investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). We now partner with 18 schools across the United States to boost recruitment connections, expand career pathways for Black students and other students, and support their long-term development and financial health. As a measure of the program’s success, in four years we have made nearly 400 hires into summer and full-time analyst and associate roles at the firm.  Military and Veterans Affairs. This firmwide effort sponsors recruitment, mentorship and development programs to support the military members and veterans working at JPMorgan Chase. Back in 2011, we joined with 10 other companies to launch the Veteran Jobs Mission (VJM), whose membership has since grown to more than 300 companies representing various industries across the United States and has hired over 900,000 veterans and military spouses. In 2023, VJM announced the creation of its Advisory Board, which is composed of 14 corporate leaders, to provide strategic direction and oversight of VJM as it continues to expand its commitment to support economic opportunities for veterans and military spouses, including its goal to hire 2 million veterans and 200,000 military spouses by 2030. JPMorgan Chase alone has hired in excess of 18,000 veterans since 2011 and currently employs more than 3,100 military spouses.  Creating opportunity for people with disabilities. The firm’s Office of Disability Inclusion continues to lead strategy and initiatives aimed at advancing economic opportunity for people with disabilities. In 2023, we joined lawmakers and business leaders in Washington, D.C., to show support for passage of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Savings Penalty Elimination Act. Modernizing the SSI program, by updating asset limits for the first time in nearly 40 years, would allow millions of people with disabilities who receive SSI benefits the opportunity to build their savings without putting their essential benefits at risk. We also provided business coaching to more than 370 entrepreneurs with disabilities.  Virtual call centers. When we sought to expand our customer service specialists program across the United States, we turned to Detroit, launching our first virtual call center in 2022. Investments in Detroit’s workforce development infrastructure helped us hire 90 virtual customer service specialists for a program that has outperformed many of our traditional call centers around the world. Following this success, we expanded our hiring efforts and this virtual program to Baltimore to create new jobs that jump-start careers. And now we’re evaluating the possibility of expanding even further.  Entrepreneurs of Color Fund. A critical challenge we have seen in so many communities is that traditional lending standards render too many entrepreneurs — particularly entrepreneurs of color and those serving these communities — ineligible for credit. In response, we helped launch the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (EOCF) in Detroit, a lending program designed to help aspiring small business owners gain access to critical resources needed for growth that are often not equitably available — capital, technical assistance and mentorship, among others. These challenges aren’t unique to Detroit so we worked with community development financial institutions to replicate the EOCF program in 10 markets across the United States in 2023, deploying more than 2,900 loans and $176 million in capital to underserved entrepreneurs across the country.  Senior business consultants. To help entrepreneurs and small businesses make the transition from community lending to accessing capital from traditional financial institutions, we created a new job — senior business consultant — to provide support. Senior business consultants in branches that focus on underserved communities offer coaching and help business owners with everything from navigating access to credit to managing cash flow to generating effective marketing. Since 2020, these consultants have mentored more than 5,500 business owners, helping them improve their operations, grow revenue and network with others in the local business community.  AdvancingCities The organizing principles that define the business and community investments we make and how we best achieve an overall impact in local economies were heavily influenced by our experience in Detroit. Seeing Detroit’s comeback begin to take shape several years ago, we created AdvancingCities to replicate this model for large-scale investments to other cities around the world. From San Francisco to Paris to Greater Washington, D.C., we’ve applied what we learned in Detroit to communities where conditions are opportune for success and require deeper investments — where community, civic and business leaders have come together to solve problems and get results.  JPMorgan Chase Service Corps. Ten years ago, we launched the JPMorgan Chase Service Corps to strengthen the capacity-building of nonprofit partners. We brought employees from around the world to Detroit to assist with its recovery — from creating a scoring model for a nonprofit to helping prioritize neighborhoods for development funding to devising an implementation plan for an integrated talent management system. Since that time, the Service Corps has expanded, with more than 1,500 JPMorgan Chase employees contributing 100,000 hours to support over 300 nonprofits globally.  Community Centers/Branches and Community Managers. A local bank branch, especially in a low-income neighborhood, can be successful only when it fits the community’s needs. That is why over the last several years we have shifted our approach to how we offer access to financial health education, as well as low-cost products and services to help build wealth. Since 2019, we have opened 16 Community Center branches, often in areas with larger Black, Hispanic or Latino populations, and have plans to open three more by the end of 2024. These branches have more space to host grassroots community events, small business mentoring sessions and financial health seminars, which have been well-attended — to date, over 400,000 people have taken advantage of the financial education seminars. In each of these Community Center branches, we hired a Community Manager (who acts as a local ambassador) to build relationships with community leaders, nonprofits and small businesses. The Community Manager concept and practice have become so successful that we have also placed these managers in many of our traditional branches in underserved communities. We now have 149 Community Managers throughout our branch network.  Work skills development. Detroit showed us how talent in communities is often overlooked. We saw this in the early days of our investment when we visited our partners at Focus: HOPE, a training program designed to help Detroiters develop skills for high-demand jobs. Quickly, it became clear that the training and education system in Detroit was disconnected from employers and their talent needs. By investing in programs like Focus: HOPE, we have been able to help bridge local skills gaps by training people for in-demand jobs in communities like Dallas, Miami and Washington, D.C. Between 2019 and 2023, we supported more than 2 million people through our extensive learning and career programming around the world.  Increasing our rural investment. We are proud to be the only bank with branches in all 48 contiguous states, which include many rural communities. Nearly 17 million consumers living in rural areas hold over $100 billion in deposits with us and $175 billion in loans. We are also a leading wholesale lender in these communities, helping to fuel local economies through relationships with local companies, governments, hospitals and universities. Since 2019, we have made material progress in extending our footprint to reach more rural Americans, including expanding our branch network into 13 new states with large rural populations. Now we are raising the bar. With our new strategy, we have a goal to have a branch available to serve 50% of a state’s population within an acceptable driving distance, including in heavily rural states such as Alabama and Iowa. This focus is part of our recently announced plan to build an additional 500 branches and hire 3,500 employees over the next three years. Through this expansion, we will partner across lines of business and our Corporate Responsibility organization to help advance inclusive economic growth and bring the full force of the firm to America’s heartland.  We’ve nearly completed our five-year, $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment — it will now become a permanent part of our business.  What began in 2020 as a five-year, $30 billion commitment is now transforming into a consistent business practice for our lines of business in support of Black, Hispanic, Latino and other underserved communities. By the end of 2023, we reported over $30 billion in progress toward our original goal. However, our focus is not on how much money is deployed — but on long-term impact and outcomes. And going forward, these programs will be embedded in our business-as-usual operating system.  Affordable rental housing. Through our Affordable Housing Preservation program, we approved program funding to date of approximately $21 billion in loans to incentivize the preservation of over 190,000 affordable housing rental units across the United States. Additionally, we financed approximately $5 billion for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.  Homeownership. In 2023, we expanded our $5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant program to include over 15,000 majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities — and in January 2024, we increased our grant amount to $7,500 in select markets. Since our grant program began in 2021, we have provided about 8,600 grants totaling $43 million. We also have provided home purchase and refinance loans in 2023 worth over $4.6 billion for more than 14,000 Black, Hispanic and Latino households across the economic spectrum.  Small business. The Business Card Special Purpose Credit Program, launched in January 2023, has provided over 10,900 cards, totaling over $43 million in available credit lines to underserved entrepreneurs and communities across the United States.  Supplier diversity. In 2023, our firm spent approximately $2.3 billion directly with diverse suppliers — an increase of 10% over 2022. As a part of our racial equity commitment, over $450 million was spent in 2023 with more than 190 Black-, Hispanic- and Latino-owned businesses.  Minority depository institutions and community development financial institutions. To date, we have invested more than $110 million in equity in diverse financial institutions and provided over $260 million in incremental financing to community development financial institutions to support communities that lack access to traditional financing. JPMorgan Chase also helped these institutions build their capacity so they can provide a greater number of critical services like mortgages and small business loans.  We’re thoughtfully continuing our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.  Of course, JPMorgan Chase will conform as the laws evolve. We will scour our programs, our words and our actions to make sure they comply.  That said, we think all the efforts mentioned above will remain largely unchanged. And, in fact, around the world, cities and communities where we do business applaud these efforts. We also believe our initiatives make us a more inclusive company and lead to more innovation, smarter decisions and better financial results for us and for the economy overall.  We are often asked in particular about “equity” and what that word means. To us, it means equal treatment, equal opportunity and equal access … not equal outcomes. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging and trying to bridge social and economic gaps, whether they be around wealth or health. We would like to provide a fair chance for everyone to succeed — regardless of their background. And we want to make sure everyone who works at our company feels welcome.  We want to articulate how we weigh in on social issues and what it means for our customers.  Before I comment about culture issues, I have a confession to make: I am a full-throated, red-blooded, patriotic, free-enterprise (properly regulated, of course) and free-market capitalist. Our company is frequently asked to take a position on an issue, rule or legislation that might be considered “cultural.” When that happens, we take a deep breath and study the matter. Many of the laws in question have many specific requirements, some of which you would agree with but not others. But we are being asked to support the entire law. In cases like these, we simply make our own statement that reflects our educated view and values; however, we do not give our voice to others.  We believe in the values of democracy, including freedom of speech and expression, and are staunchly against discrimination and hate. We have not turned away — and will not turn away — customers because of their political or religious affiliations nor would we tell customers how they should spend their money.  Our commitment to these ideals is also reflected in our employees. The talent at our firm is a vibrant mix of cultures, beliefs and backgrounds. We are, of course, fully committed to freedom of speech. There are things that you can say that would be permitted under freedom of speech but would not be allowed under our Code of Conduct. For example, we do not allow intimidation, threats or highly prejudicial behavior or speech. Our Code of Conduct clearly stipulates that certain statements and behavior, while allowed under freedom of speech, can lead to disciplinary action at our company — from being reprimanded to being fired.  WHAT WE LEARNED: A FIVE-POINT ACTION PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE  In May 2023, we gathered with knowledgeable and influential people from the energy industry writ large to the government and financial services arena in Scottsdale, Arizona, for an action forum. The goal was to explore various aspects of the climate challenge and try to devise effective solutions that could help lead to meaningful progress. The climate challenge is immense and complex. Addressing it requires more than making simplistic statements and rules; rather, energy systems and global supply chains need to be transformed across virtually all industries. And there is also a deep need for new research and development. Energy systems and supply chains provide the foundation of the global economy and must be treated with care.  At the same time, the opportunity here is immense. The investment required to meet climate goals — estimated at over $5 trillion annually — could generate economywide growth and opportunity at a scale the world has not seen since the Industrial Revolution.  The task for industry, policymakers and finance is to help formulate solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon economy, balancing affordable, reliable access to energy with generating economic growth.  To find a way forward, we sought input from diverse stakeholders in pursuit of a North Star. In Scottsdale and in discussions with clients across industries about what’s needed to achieve a low-carbon economy, these five action steps and reforms were top of mind:  Supportive government policy and leadership to advance the transition. Policy that promotes favorable economic conditions to make the transition viable is a critical first step for clients. This includes government leadership via mandates, incentives or subsidies to support jobs and investment in the transition; actions on permitting and interconnection reform; and regulatory clarity and certainty, especially around long-term investments. As one vital example, current grid infrastructure is insufficient to accommodate the growth in renewables.  Public/private partnerships in scaling bankable projects. Scaling investments needs to happen both for commercially proven technologies (e.g., wind and solar) and for emerging technologies (e.g., green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture). Developing “bankable” clean energy projects will require the application of smart financial tools, as well as further policy support. It will take public/private partnerships and innovation to create catalytic forms of capital that can step into these gaps, absorb first-mover risks and provide the necessary funding. The cost of capital is too high for some companies — and public funds ought to be deployed in a smart way that effectively attracts private capital.  Public education and engagement. Without question, clients told us that public commitment to and investment in energy-related infrastructure is one of the most important parts of combating the climate crisis and running their businesses. Supporting the buildout of energy-related infrastructure with speed and scale is critical. Public acceptance of building and advancing the infrastructure needed to meet climate goals is at the heart of progress. While the energy transition is poised to deliver benefits to communities across the world, securing acceptance and support to build clean energy infrastructure at scale is challenging. Access to job-creating renewable energy projects can help rural communities thrive by advancing local economies. Ensuring public support and social license to operate requires better engagement strategies, including widespread stakeholder education about the benefits of these technologies for local communities.  Communication about concrete successes. Across industries, market participants need to do a better job of celebrating and championing concrete successes and tangible milestones. This includes highlighting success stories around emerging technologies and the complex nature of the carbon transition. Stakeholders also should better convey the benefits of clean energy — across all technologies — to help combat misinformation and foster a more informed dialogue.  Work skills training. Businesses depend on healthy, thriving communities so the carbon transition needs to work for everyone. This includes helping to ensure that workers are trained in the skills for the future, such as through improved engineering schools and job training programs. Work across the entire supply chain is essential to moving at pace. As one example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates we will need more than 70,000 additional electricians per year through 2031; it is currently unclear how the market will meet that demand. If the deployment of heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers accelerates, demand for electricians will be even higher. A concerted focus to train electricians can help the United States meet some of its climate goals while providing well-paying jobs that do not require a four-year college degree. Also, broadly speaking, businesses are in a better position to make investments with confidence when labor requirements across the value chain — from design and manufacturing to installation — are satisfied.  We recently reconsidered certain memberships.  JPMorgan Chase recently exited Climate Action 100+ and the Equator Principles. “Why?” we are asked. While we don’t necessarily disagree with some of the principles many organizations have, we make our own business decisions. We think we have some of the best-in-class environmental, social and risk standards because we have invested in our own in-house experts and matured our own risk management processes over the years. As a result, we are going to go our own way and make our own independent decisions, gathering the best learnings of experts in the field, and, of course, we will follow all legal requirements.  We are engaged but recognize our role: three more important points.  First, everyone should understand that conquering the climate problem needs proper government action, particularly around taxes, permitting, grids, infrastructure building and proper coordination of policies — we are not there yet. Second, there is no known technology that can fill the gap between our “aspirations” and the current trajectory of the world. We hope and believe that this will be found (for example, through carbon capture, improved batteries, hydrogen or other measures). This new technology will also require proper government research and development funding, as the effort cannot be accomplished by private enterprise alone. And third, we are going to use the word “commitment” much more reservedly in the future, clearly differentiating between aspirations we are actively striving toward and binding commitments.  For JPMorgan Chase to play the right role in tackling the climate challenge, we have organized a special group around the green economy and related infrastructure investment. This group will coordinate and inform our work across all established industry groups (from auto to real estate, energy, agriculture and others) and includes hundreds of employees devoted to these efforts.  POWERING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FLORIDA  From Tallahassee to Miami and from Tampa to Palm Bay, JPMorgan Chase has been committed to Florida for more than 130 years and has enjoyed being the bank for all communities. Each year, we contribute billions of dollars to the economy, hire and train local residents, help to revitalize neighborhoods and remove barriers to opportunity for Floridians across the state. Our partnerships with businesses, nonprofits, government entities and community organizations have enabled us to drive sustainable impact and help them achieve their goals. We couldn’t be more proud to help make opportunity happen in Florida.  This year, we forged a relationship with Inter Miami CF, one of the most recognizable sports teams in the world. Through this partnership and the newly named Chase Stadium, we’re continuing to contribute to South Florida and its local communities. In Tampa, home to nearly 6,000 of our employees, we’re triggering an additional $210 million in economic activity and creating over 660 local construction jobs through the renovation of our Highland Oaks campus and downtown Tampa office. We’re proud that one-third of all Floridians do business with us through deposits, credit cards or a mortgage. Through each of our investments across the state, we’re ensuring that residents have the resources and tools they need to thrive.  Our support to government, higher education, healthcare and nonprofit organizations:  We serve over 150 government, higher education, healthcare and nonprofit clients throughout the state, and over the last five years, we have provided more than $20.2 billion in credit and capital to them.  Our clients range from the city of Jacksonville to the Orlando Utilities Commission, the University of South Florida, Broward Health and the District School Board of Pasco County — a decades-long client.  We are the lead treasury bank for the Wounded Warrior Project, one of the largest veteran service organizations in the United States. Headquartered in Jacksonville, the organization caters to wounded veterans and service members who served in the military on or after 9/11.  Our support to investment and middle-market banking clients:  Over the last five years, we have provided in excess of $318 billion in credit and capital to local clients, such as utility, technology and tourism companies.  We have more than 12,500 large and midsized clients across the state.  Our support to local financial firms:  Over the last five years, we have provided more than $24 billion in credit and capital for financial institutions, such as local banks, insurance companies, asset managers and securities firms.  We bank over 50 of Florida’s regional, midsized and community banks, helping them play an essential role in maintaining the state’s economy and serve local communities.  Our support to small business:  At the end of 2023, balances for loans extended to Florida’s small businesses totaled more than $1.2 billion — funds being used to help those businesses scale and grow, contribute to the economy and create local jobs.  Across the state, we have over 654,000 small business customers.  In 2023, our bankers and senior business consultants spent more than 375,000 hours advising and supporting Florida business owners.  Our support to consumer banking needs:  We operate 1,445 ATMs and 410 branches across the state.  In 2023, we supported more than 6.1 million customers with mortgages, auto loans and savings, checking and credit card accounts, giving JPMorgan Chase one of the largest consumer banking market shares in the state.  We managed more than $70 billion in investment and annuity assets for local clients.  Our business and community investments:  Over the last five years, we have committed nearly $65 million in philanthropic support, including: $3 million to The Miami Foundation’s Resilient 305: Building Prosperity Collaborative to increase access to quality jobs and develop small businesses through training, investments and capacity-building. $1.6 million to the Community Justice Project, which empowers community-based legal advocates to help delay displacement and improve conditions for housing stability for renters across nine Florida counties.  In 2022, we committed $10 million over five years to Tech Equity Miami to advance equal access to tech skills, careers and education, including: A $1 million investment to Florida Memorial University, South Florida’s only HBCU, to help traditionally underresourced students pursue a career in technology.  Our support as a local employer:  We employ more than 14,000 residents throughout the state, including nearly 1,900 veterans and over 660 people with a criminal background who deserve a second chance.  In Florida, the average salary of our employees is more than $87,000 (plus a starting comprehensive annual benefits package worth nearly $17,600) compared with the statewide per capita income of nearly $40,300.  GIVING THE BANK REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY PROCESS A SERIOUS REVIEW  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was finished 14 years ago, and we believe it accomplished a lot of good things. But it’s been quite a while since then, and we’re still debating some very basic issues. It’s time to take a serious, hard, honest look at what has been done and what can be improved.  It’s good to remember that the United States has the best financial system in the world, with diversified, deep and experienced institutions, from banks, pension plans, hedge funds and private equity to individual investors. It has healthy public and private markets, transparency, rule of law and deep research. The best banking system in the world is a critical part of this, and, integrated with the overall financial system, is foundational to the proper allocation of capital, innovation and the fueling of America’s growth engine.  This is not about JPMorgan Chase — we believe we can manage through whatever is thrown our way. This is about the impact on all parts of the system — from smaller banks to larger regional banks that may not have the resources to handle all of these regulatory requirements. It’s also about the effect on the financial markets and the economy from the rapidly growing shadow banking system, as well as the ultimate impact on the customers, clients and communities we serve. This is about what’s right for the system.  The banking and financial system is innovative, dynamic and constantly changing.  The banking system is not static: There are startup banks, mergers, successful upstarts and fintech banks, and even Apple, which effectively acts as a bank — it holds money, moves money, lends money and so on. Nonbanks are competing with traditional banks, and, in general, this dynamism and churn are good for innovation and invention — with success and failure simply part of the robust process. Innovation runs across payments systems, budgeting, digital access, product extensions, risk and fraud prevention, and other services. Different institutions play different roles, and, importantly, small banks and big banks serve completely different strategic functions. Large banks bank multinational corporations around the world, make healthy markets, and wield technology and a product set that are the best in the world. A small bank simply cannot bank these same multinational governments and safely move the amount of money and securities that large banks do. Regional and community banks have exceptional local knowledge and presence and are critical in serving thousands of towns and certain geographies.  It is also important to recognize that the banking system as we know it is shrinking relative to private markets and fintech, which are growing and becoming increasingly competitive. And remember that many of these new players do not have the same transparency or need to abide by the extensive rules and regulations as traditional banks, even if they offer similar products — this often gives them significant advantage.  To deal with this fluid environment, banks of all sizes develop their own strategies, whether to specialize, expand geographically or embark on mergers and acquisitions. There are certain banking services where economies of scale are a competitive advantage, but not all banks need to become bigger to gain this benefit (there are many highly successful banks that are smaller). What is clear is that banks should be allowed to pursue their individual strategies, including mergers and acquisitions, as they see fit. Overall, this process should be allowed to happen — it’s part of the natural and healthy course of capitalism — and it can be done without harming the American taxpayer or economy.  While we all want a strong banking and financial system, we should step back and assess how all the regulatory steps we have taken measure up against the goals we all share. Since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010, thousands of rules and reporting requirements written by 10+ different regulatory bodies in the United States alone have been added. And it would probably be an understatement to say that some are duplicative, inconsistent, procyclical, contradictory, extremely costly, and unnecessarily painful for both banks and regulators. Many of the rules have unintended consequences that are not desirable and have negative impacts, such as increasing the cost of credit for consumers (hurting lower-income Americans the most).  The whole process, including the Basel III endgame, could be much more productive, streamlined, economical, efficient and safe.  Both regulators and banks should want the same thing — a healthy banking system, serving its clients and striving for continuous improvement. We all should also want the enormous benefits that would come from good collaboration between regulators and bank management teams and boards.  Over time, these relationships have deteriorated, and, again, are increasingly less constructive. There is little real collaboration between practitioners — the banks — and regulators, who generally have not been practitioners in business. While we acknowledge the dedication of regulators who work with banks on a daily basis, management teams across the industry are putting in a disproportionate amount of time addressing requests for extra details, documentation and processes that extend far beyond the actual rules — and distract both regulators and management from more critical work. We should be more focused on the truly important risks for the safety of the system. And unfortunately, without collaboration and sufficient analysis, it is hard to be confident that regulation will accomplish desired outcomes without undesirable consequences. Instead of constantly improving the system, we may be making it worse. A few additional points:  The Basel III endgame disadvantages American banks. The Basel III endgame has been 10 years in the making, and it still has not been completed. In my view, many of the rules are flawed and poorly calibrated. If the Basel III endgame were implemented in its current form, it would hamper American banks: As proposed, it would increase our firm’s required capital by 25%, making our requirement 30% higher than it would be under the equivalent European Union proposal. That means for every loan and asset financed in the United States by a major American bank, that bank would have to hold 30% more capital than any international competitor. The proposed regulations would also damage market making (see the following section). There are many other flaws but suffice it to say that much of the work being done today to analyze the effects should have been done before the proposed rulemaking. One of the single most important lessons from the great financial crisis is that there is enormous value to having a bank that is well-managed and has diverse revenue sources. Yet regulation since then both punishes consolidation and diversification — and punishes performance — through many features of the GSIB surcharge.  Built over many years, the framework is now full of duplication. The following is only a partial list: American gold-plating and conceptual inconsistencies among Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), recovery and resolution plans, liquidity requirements, global systemically important bank (GSIB) requirements, and safety and soundness principles. The many overlapping rules contribute to the bureaucracy that generates an extraordinary amount of make-work (an 80,000-page CCAR and shockingly another, coincidentally, 80,000-page recovery and resolution plan).  The new rules do virtually nothing to fix what caused the failure of SVB and First Republic. For example, they don’t improve certain liquidity requirements, limit HTM accounting or reduce allowable interest rate exposure.  The current regulatory approach to liquidity might simply run counter to the stated intent. Regulations should recognize the value and importance of lending and borrowing against good collateral and using central bank resources, such as the discount window. Adhering to current liquidity requirements permanently ties up good liquidity in a way that makes the system more fragile and more risky.  It is not clear what the full intent of the Basel III endgame was – it will have unintended consequences. Without real analysis of expected outcomes, additional regulation will likely reduce the number of banks offering certain services and increase costs for all market participants and activity, including loans, market making and hedging (by farmers, airlines and countries, among others). And new rules might even increase consolidation as companies race to achieve economies of scale in certain products and services.  Unfortunately, some recent regulations are ending up in court. You can imagine that no one wants to sue their regulators. Banks would not sue if they did not think they were right — or if they thought they had any other recourse — which they effectively do not. This is definitely not what anyone should want. A more constructive relationship with regulators would reduce confusion and uncertainty and would lead to better outcomes for banks, their shareholders, and their clients, customers and communities.  Collaboration between banks and regulators could improve the use of resources and create better outcomes.  True collaboration could dramatically improve the banking system. For example:  Redirect enormous resources from things that don’t matter to things that do. As mentioned, it takes 80,000 pages to describe a CCAR test and 80,000 pages to detail recovery and resolution. The talent and resources at the banks and regulators could be better used elsewhere. Such overload is distracting and takes your eye off the ball on real, emerging risks, including China, trade, payment systems and cybersecurity, among others.  Reduce bureaucratic processes that provoke a tendency to herd mentality. For example, CCAR is just a point-in-time stress test, and it can lull you into a false sense of security — for reference, we do more than 100 stress tests each week. On interest rate exposure, focusing on the documentation of details may stop you from thinking about big interest rate exposure. Sometimes analyzing “what ifs” and fat tail risks is better than excessive and rigid models and documentations.  Examine risks outside the regulatory system that are rarely analyzed and largely unaddressed. These risks include data and privacy, as well as consumer banking and payment systems, which are growing fast in the unregulated market. In addition, there are potential risks from private credit markets (which I talk about later in this section).  Let’s imagine what’s possible with real collaboration. Working together, we can improve how the FDIC manages failing institutions, how to limit contagion and restore confidence to depositors, how liquidity requirements can create more flexible funding for banks under stress, how the banking and Federal Reserve’s payment system can become more interoperable, how clearinghouse risk can be reduced, how stress tests can protect the system from a wider variety of outcomes, how costs and therefore consumer costs can be reduced (not increased), how anti-money laundering requirements can be simplified and improved at the same time, and how financial products can be brought to the unbanked. We can fix the housing and mortgage markets. For example, mortgage regulations around origination, servicing and securitization could be simplified, without increasing risk, in a way that would reduce the average mortgage by 70 or 80 basis points. The Urban Institute estimates that a reduction like this would increase mortgage originations by 1 million per year and help lower-income households, in particular, buy their first home, thereby starting them on the best way to build household net worth. There are many more things that can be improved — and we really should start working on them.  We need a detailed review and probably a complete revamp.  I know this might be wishful thinking, but now would be a good time to step back and have a thorough and candid review of the thousands of new rules passed since Dodd-Frank. After this review, we should ask what is it that we really want: Do we want to try to eliminate the possibility of bank runs? Do we want to change and create liquidity rules that would essentially back most uninsured deposits? Do we want the mortgage business and leveraged lending business to be inside or outside the banking system? Do we want products that are inside and outside the banking system to be regulated the same way? Do we want to reasonably give smaller banks a leg up in purchasing a failing bank? And while Dodd-Frank did some good things, shouldn’t we take a look at the huge overlapping jurisdictions of various regulators? This overlap creates difficulties, not only for banks, but for the regulators, too. Any and all of this is achievable, and, I believe, could be accomplished with simpler rules and guidelines and without stifling our critical banking system.  PROTECTING THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF MARKET MAKING (TRADING)  Before we discuss market making and financial markets, readers should understand that market making occurs in almost all businesses. There are healthy markets in farm animals, foreign products, commodities, energy, logistics, healthcare and so on. Healthy markets increase customer choice and reduce cost. They almost always involve holding inventory and taking some risk, which is simply a part of the process. America’s financial markets are the biggest in the world — U.S. public debt and equity markets total $137 trillion, constituting the biggest “market” in the world, and are larger than America’s gross domestic product (GDP) of $27 trillion.  Market participants are not “Wall Street.” They are large and small, mainly sophisticated, global investors (pension plans, mutual funds, governments and individuals) representing retirees, veterans, individuals, unions, federal workers and others. They all benefit from our efficient, low-cost and transparent markets.  Some regulators seem to think that market making is a speculative, hedge fund-like activity — and this thinking is what might be leading them to constantly increase capital requirements. The proposed capital rules could fundamentally alter market-making activities that are critical to a thriving economy, particularly in difficult markets when market making is even more important. The new rules would raise capital requirements by 50% for major banks — which could undermine market stability, make banking services costlier and less accessible, and push even more activity to a less regulated banking system.  Our financial system and markets are the best in the world and benefit ALL participants; exceptionally good market making in the secondary market makes our primary markets the best in the world.  We should recognize that the United States has the biggest, deepest and most liquid capital markets in the world. For these markets to function, it is critical for transparency and liquidity to be in the secondary market. Market making provides this, promoting the flow of capital to real economy investments and supporting all sectors of the economy, including companies, state and local governments, universities, hospitals, pension plans and overall job creation. Without market making in the secondary market, it would be extremely difficult for companies to raise capital through the primary market — equity and debt offerings — which have totaled approximately $3.6 trillion on average over the past few years. The incredible strength of these markets enables companies of all sizes to grow and expand especially during times of volatility and stress. It also enables consumers to access cheaper credit and governments (local, state and federal) to reduce their borrowing costs.  It takes enormous resources to properly support the Markets business.  JPMorgan Chase spends $700 million per year in extensive research coverage of nearly 5,200 companies across 83 countries. This massive effort continuously educates investors and decision makers around the world and often leads to improved governance and management. It also critically complements the firm’s market-making activities and further promotes transparency, enabling investors to make thoughtful choices around investing in capital markets.  I would also like our shareholders to know that our market making is backed by approximately $7 billion in support expenses, including over $2 billion in technology spend alone each year. This investment allows us to maintain global trading systems and constantly improve upon risk management and efficiency.  JPMorgan Chase deploys approximately $70 billion in capital to maintain our Markets franchise. This capital supports $500 billion in securities inventory (largely hedged) — and this inventory allows us to buy and sell $2 trillion (notional) in securities daily for our clients.  Market making entails risk but is not particularly speculative.  The main objective of market makers is to continuously quote prices and diligently manage an inventory to transact at those prices, which includes assuming certain risks to support heavy volumes and orderly trading. Market makers have a moral obligation to try to make markets in good times and in bad. Part of our brand promise is to stand ready as the willing buyer and seller. In this, we have never failed. In addition, in most cases regarding government debt, where we serve as a government securities dealer, we are legally obligated to make markets. This constant visibility into prices provided by market makers fosters investor confidence, keeps fees low and promotes economic growth by attracting more investors.  Many large market participants — for example, hedge funds and high-frequency traders, among others — have no obligation to make markets. In fact, many of these market participants often “step out” of the markets and dramatically reduce liquidity specifically when market conditions are difficult.  Market making is not particularly speculative since market makers generally hedge their positions, as you will see from some real life examples of the economics and risks. We earn revenue of approximately $100 million on a typical day. In the average year, the total is nearly $30 billion. On our $2 trillion in notional daily trading, this amounts to only one hundredth of a cent charged to the investor for these services — an extraordinarily low cost compared with any other market in the world.  Now let’s take a look at the actual risk and results versus the hypothetical risk and results. The hypothetical global market shock of the CCAR stress test has us losing $18 billion in a single day and never recovering any of it. Let’s compare that to actual losses under real, actual market stress.  Now consider these historical data points: First, over the last 10 years, the firm’s market-making business has never had a quarterly loss and has lost money on only 30 trading days. These loss days represent only 1% of total trading days, and the average loss on those days was $90 million. Second, when markets completely collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 2 through March 31, 2020, the stock market fell 16%, and bond spreads gapped out dramatically), J.P. Morgan’s market-making activities made money every day prior to the Federal Reserve’s major interventions, which stabilized the markets. During that entire month, we lost money on only two days but made $2.5 billion in Markets revenue for the month. And third, in the worst quarter ever in the markets following the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers, we lost $1.7 billion, but we made $5.6 billion in Markets revenue for the full year. The firm as a whole did not lose money in any quarter that year. In 2009, there was a complete recovery in Markets, and we made $22 billion in Markets revenue.  You can see that our actual performance under extreme stress isn’t even close to the hypothetical losses of the stress test.  Another major fallacy is that derivatives are objects of financial destruction. In reality, derivatives are an essential part of managing financial risk and are used by investors, corporations, farmers, businesses, countries, governments and others to manage their risks. And more than 85% of derivatives are fairly basic forms of foreign exchange or interest rate swaps.  One last fallacy is that the repo markets are all about speculation. While it’s true that repo is used by certain investors to leverage up their positions, about 75% of repo is essential to normal money market functioning, i.e., is done by broker-dealers financing their actual inventory positions, money market funds investing their cash backed by highly rated collateral and clients hedging their positions.  Market makers add confidence, liquidity and transparency to U.S. capital markets — market making helps stabilize markets and can reduce volatility.  In addition, more liquidity, not less liquidity, will be needed to maintain market stability. Large banks keep an inventory of securities they can deploy in times of stress to help soothe markets; however, with the implementation of new regulations, banks now hold 70% as much inventory in securities as they did before the 2008 financial crisis, while the total size of the market has almost tripled. Higher capital requirements will accelerate this trend even further, impacting banks’ ability to deliver support to clients and markets in times when it is needed the most.  Washington’s Basel III endgame proposal damages market making, hurts Americans and drives activity to less transparent, less regulated markets.  If this proposal is enacted as drafted:  Everyday consumer goods could be impacted. Households contending with inflation could also feel the effects of higher capital requirements on market-making activities when they shop. From beverage companies that need to manage aluminum costs to farms that need to protect against environmental risks, if the cost of hedging those risks increases, it could be reflected in what consumers pay for everything from a can of soda to meat products.  Mortgages and small business loans will be more expensive. Consumers seeking a mortgage — including first-time homebuyers and historically underserved, low- to moderate-income borrowers with smaller down payments — will face higher interest rates or will have a tougher time accessing one. This will occur not only because the cost of originating and holding these loans is higher but also because the cost of securitizing them will rise for banks, nonbanks and government agencies. Not only that, but the proposal will likely lead to reductions in the size of unfunded credit card lines, which will put pressure on FICO scores and thereby make it more difficult for some people to access other forms of retail credit such as mortgages. Again, this will have the greatest impact on low- to moderate-income borrowers who rely most heavily on credit cards for day-to-day spending and to build their credit history. It could even be argued that existing regulations go too far and that there is an opportunity to help underserved communities by dialing down regulations that lead to higher borrowing costs. This should be studied and the pros and cons analyzed. The same can be said for small business loans, which will become more expensive and less accessible.  Saving for retirement or college will be harder. The cost of products that families count on to save for retirement or college will go up as a result of this proposal. Asset managers, money market funds and pension funds all buy, sell and safekeep securities and other financial instruments for American investors. Under the proposed rules, the cost of banking products used on behalf of clients each day — including brokerage, advisory, clearing and custody services — will go up and feed through to customers. That will lead to lower returns on retirement accounts, college funds and other long-term savings.  Government infrastructure projects and corporate development will become more expensive. Federal, state and local governments, as well as corporations and other institutions, rely on large banks for access to U.S. capital markets to fund development. If accessing capital markets becomes more expensive, it will have a ripple effect on the hiring of American workers, investment in research and development, and funding to build hospitals, roads and bridges, including the planned infrastructure projects from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).  More market activity will move to unregulated institutions, out of sight from regulators and without the same level of consumer protections that Americans expect from their banks. Other market participants that don’t have holistic client relationships are less likely to provide liquidity to help stabilize markets.  In volatile times, banks have been able to intermediate to help their clients and to work with the regulators. With new regulations, they may be less able to do so. There have been several times in the past few years where banks had ample liquidity and capital but were unable to rapidly increase their intermediation in the markets due to very rigid liquidity and capital requirements. Finally, the proposed rules increase the chance that the Federal Reserve will have to step in again — and this is not something they should want to do on a regular basis but only in an extreme emergency.  Staying Competitive in the Shrinking Public Markets  In previous letters, I have described the diminishing role of public companies in the American financial system. From their peak in 1996 at 7,300, U.S. public companies now total 4,300 — the total should have grown dramatically, not shrunk. Meanwhile, the number of private U.S. companies backed by private equity firms — which does not include the rising number of companies owned by sovereign wealth funds and family offices — has grown from 1,900 to 11,200 over the last two decades. This trend is serious and may very well increase with more regulation and litigation coming. Along with a frank assessment of the regulation landscape, we really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?  There are good reasons for private markets, and some good outcomes result from them. For example, companies can stay private longer if they wish and raise more and different types of capital without going to the public markets. However, taking a wider view, I fear we may be driving companies from the public markets. The reasons are complex and may include factors such as intensified reporting requirements (including investors’ growing needs for environmental, social and governance information), higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, cookie-cutter board governance, shareholder activism, less compensation flexibility, less capital flexibility, heightened public scrutiny and the relentless pressure of quarterly earnings.  Along with the universal proxy — which makes it easier to put poorly qualified directors on a board — the pressures to retreat from the public market are mounting. In addition, corporate governance principles are becoming more and more templated and formulaic, a negative trend. For example, proxy advisors may automatically judge directors unfavorably if they have a long tenure on the board, without a fair assessment of their actual contributions or experience. Another example is the constant battle by some proxy advisors who try to split the chairman and CEO role when there is no evidence this makes a company better off — in fact, today, lead directors generally hold most of the authorities previously assigned to the chairman. The governance of major corporations is evolving away from guidance by governance principles that focus on a company’s relationship to long-term economic value toward a bureaucratic compliance exercise. Good corporate governance is critical, and a little common sense would go a long way.  THE PRESSURE OF QUARTERLY EARNINGS COMPOUNDED BY BAD ACCOUNTING AND BAD DECISIONS  There is something very positive about detailed and disciplined quarterly financial and operating reporting. But company CEOs and boards of directors should resist the undue pressure of quarterly earnings, and it is clearly somewhat their fault when they don’t. However, it is naïve to think that the pressure doesn’t exist because companies that “disappoint” can face extensive criticism, particularly those with a new or young CEO. It’s possible for companies to take short-term actions to increase earnings, such as selling more product cheaply at the end of a quarter, cutting certain investments that may be terrific but can show accounting losses in the first year or two, or just deploying more aggressive accounting methods at times. Once shortcuts like this begin, people all over the company understand that it is okay to “stretch” to meet your numbers. This could put you on a treadmill to ruin. Obviously, a company should not resort to these tactics, but it does happen in the public markets — and it’s probably less likely in the private markets.  THE HIJACKING OF ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS  One of the reasons it is less desirable to be a public company is because of the spiraling frivolousness of the annual shareholder meeting, which has devolved into mostly a showcase of grandstanding and competing special interest groups. We should treat shareholders with tremendous respect — and we do. At JPMorgan Chase, we are constantly talking with our investors — our directors, our lead director and our corporate governance experts visit most of our major investors whether they be direct owners or asset managers who manage the money for others. Meeting with your shareholders and investors is critical, but the annual shareholder meeting itself has become ineffective. We should try to come up with a far more constructive alternative.  THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF PROXY ADVISORS  There are essentially two main proxy advisors in the United States. One is called Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), and the second is called Glass Lewis. These proxy advisors started out providing reams of data from companies to help their institutional investor clients vote on proxy matters (information on executive compensation, stock returns, detail on directors, policies and so on). However, they soon also began to provide advice on how shareholders should vote on proxy matters. And, in fact, institutional investors generally execute their voting on an ISS or Glass Lewis platform, which often includes a clear statement of the advisory service’s position.  I should also point out, because it may be relevant, that ISS is owned by Deutsche Boerse, a German company, and Glass Lewis is owned by Peloton Capital, a Canadian private equity firm. I question whether American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance.  While asset managers and institutional investors have a fiduciary responsibility to make their own decisions, it is increasingly clear that proxy advisors have undue influence.  Asset managers (who manage money on behalf of others) and institutional investors (e.g., pension plans and endowments) may rely on a variety of information sources to support their valuation decision-making process. While data and recommendations may form pieces of the information mosaic, their votes should ultimately be based on an independent application of their own voting guidelines and policies. To the extent they use recommendations from proxy advisors in their decision-making processes, they should disclose that they do so and should be satisfied that the information upon which they are relying is accurate and relevant. However, many companies would argue that this information is frequently not balanced, not representative of the full view and not accurate. In addition, companies complain that they often cannot get the data corrected, and, therefore, a vote may go uncorrected.  Almost all asset managers receive proxy advisor data and recommendations; while some asset managers vote completely independently of this information, the majority do not. Most asset managers have formed corporate governance or stewardship committees that are responsible for their voting, and these committee positions are often held not by portfolio managers and research analysts (i.e., the people buying and analyzing the individual securities) but by stewardship experts. While it is good to have stewardship experts, the reality is that many of these committees default large portions of what they do to proxy advisors and, more troubling, make it harder for actual portfolio managers to override this decision making.  Some have argued that it’s too hard and too expensive to review the large number of proxies and proxy proposals — this is both lazy and wrong. If issues are important to a company, they should be important to the shareholder — for the most part, only a handful of proposals are important to companies.  We are making enhancements to J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s proxy voting processes to amplify the role of portfolio managers and to address the perception of asset managers’ reliance on third-party advisor voting recommendations.  Enhancements to the firm’s internal proxy voting process will include:  More portfolio manager participation in proxy committee decision making. The firm has significantly expanded the representation of portfolio managers on its North American Proxy Committee in an effort to increase the diversity of viewpoints represented on the committee. As part of this change, and in recognition that portfolio managers, as fiduciaries, may differ in their views on how to vote on particular proposals depending on a mandate’s investment strategy and guidelines, we are broadening our capabilities to support voting results that may vary across our platform.  Diminished role of proxy advisor recommendations. J.P. Morgan Asset Management makes its own independent proxy voting decisions (based on deep fundamental research) and stands behind the depth and rigor of its processes and historical information advantage. In most cases, the firm will only use proxy advisory firms for research, data and technical mechanics of vote transmission and not for outsourced recommendations. By the end of 2024, J.P. Morgan Asset Management generally will have eliminated third-party proxy advisor voting recommendations from its internally developed voting systems. Additionally, the firm will work with third-party proxy voting advisors to remove their voting recommendations from research reports they provide to J.P. Morgan Asset Management by the 2025 proxy season.  Other enhancements. We are working to give a company and its management even greater access to the ultimate decision makers; to raise critical issues to a company as early as possible in a constructive and proactive way; and to be willing to tell companies how we have voted once our decision is made rather than waiting until votes are finally counted.  Taken together, these steps are designed to respond to a growing perception (and, I believe, reality) that the asset management industry generally places undue reliance on proxy advisors in how proxies are voted. We believe these actions will strengthen our relationships with our clients and with companies while helping to build trust between shareholders, investors and companies.  THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF PRIVATE CREDIT  I have already mentioned some of the benefits of private credit, and I’ll now mention some more. Many people in the private credit arena are very smart and creative and want to help the companies they invest in navigate through market shoals. They can move quickly, discreetly and flexibly. Most generally understand that bad accounting drives bad decisions, and their goal is to make the right decisions for the future of the company.  On the other hand, not all players are that good. And problems in the private credit market caused by the bad players can leak onto the good ones, even though private credit money is locked up for years. If investors feel mistreated, they will cry foul, and the government will respond by putting a laser focus on the business. It’s a reasonable assumption that at some point regulations will focus on the private markets as they do on the public markets.  This scrutiny will include a look at how private credit values its assets, which isn’t as transparent as public market valuations. In addition, private market loans commonly lack liquidity in the secondary market and are not generally supported by in-depth market research.  New financial products that grow extremely rapidly often become an area of unexpected risk in the markets. Frequently, the weaknesses of new products, in this case private credit loans, may only be seen and exposed in bad markets, which private credit loans have not yet faced. When credit spreads gap out, when interest rates go up and when some leveraged companies suffer in the recession, we will find out how those loans survive stress testing. In addition, they can create a little bit of a “credit crunch” for borrowers since it might be hard for private creditors to roll over loans under those conditions. Under stress conditions, private creditors would have to charge exorbitant prices that companies simply cannot afford in order to book the new loan at par. Banks are in a slightly different position.  A BANK’S STRENGTH: PROVIDING FLEXIBLE CAPITAL  Banks generally try to be there for their borrowers in difficult times — striving to roll over loans, renegotiate terms and raise additional capital. Banks do this for multiple reasons: They normally feel an obligation to help their clients, they have long-term relationships and they can commonly earn other sources of revenue from client-driven transactions. Banks can also flex their capital and lending base as needed by their clients. This is because a bank can and should make decisions to help companies through good times and bad, seeking to retain them as long-term clients across many areas of the bank. They can and do take “losses” that help the client maintain the franchise. But an asset manager must act as a “fiduciary” of other people’s money and cannot lend based on a moral obligation or potential future relationship.  Recently, we have been witnessing a convergence between the public and private markets. But it’s too soon to say how this ultimately will play out, particularly if we go through a recessionary cycle.  Management Lessons: Thinking, Deciding and Taking Action – Deliberately and with Heart  I always enjoy sharing what I’ve learned from watching others, reading and experiencing through my own journey.  BENEFITING FROM THE OODA LOOP  The military, which often operates in extreme intensity of life and death and in the fog and uncertainty of war, uses the term “OODA loop” (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act — repeat), a strategic process of constant review, analysis, decision making and action. One cannot overemphasize the importance of observation and a full assessment — the failure to do so leads to some of the greatest mistakes, not only in war but also in business and government.  A full assessment is critical.  To properly manage any business situation, you need to perform a full and complete assessment of it. In business, you have to understand your competitors, their distribution, their economics, their innovations, and their strengths and weaknesses. You also need to understand customers and their changing preferences, along with your own costs, your people and their skills. Then there’s knowing how other factors fit in, like technology, risk, motivations … hope you get the point. For countries, you need a thorough grasp of their economies, strengths and weaknesses, population and education, access to raw materials, laws and regulations, history and culture. Research, data and analytics should be at a very detailed level and constantly reassessed. Only after you complete this diligent study can you start to make plans with a high degree of success.  Get on the road – it builds knowledge and culture.  I have frequently wondered about all the nonstop road trips, client meetings, briefings, greetings, bus trips, and visits to call centers, operating centers and branches, regulators and government officials, among others: Did they make a difference? The answer is absolutely yes because they enabled a process of constant learning, assessment and modification of best practices — gaining insights from employees to clients to competitors. Employees will tell you what you are doing well or poorly if you simply ask them, and they know you want to hear the real answer. Curiosity is a form of humility — acknowledging that you don’t know everything. Responding to curiosity allows other people to speak freely. Facts and details matter and inform a deeper and deeper analysis that allows you to continually revise and update your plans. This, of course, also means that you are constantly admitting prior mistakes.  You need to shed sacred cows, seek out blind spots and challenge the status quo.  Very often companies or individuals develop narratives based upon beliefs that are very hard to dislodge but are often wrong — and they can lead to terrible mistakes. A few examples will suffice. Stripe, Inc. built a payments business by working with developers — something we never would have imagined but might have figured out if we had tried to seek out what others were doing in this area. Branches were being closed, both at Bank One and Chase, because the assumption was that they would not be needed in the future. We underinvested for years in the wealth management business because we were always focused on the value of deposits versus investments. Question everything.  Use your brains to figure out the truth — not to justify what you already think.  It’s often hard to change your own attitudes and beliefs, especially those you may have held on to for some time. But you must be open to it. When you learn something that is different from what you thought, it may affect many conclusions you have, not just one. Try not to allow yourself to become rigid or “weaponized,” where other employees or interest groups jazz you up so much that you become a weapon on their behalf. This makes it much harder to see things clearly for yourself. When people disagree with you, seek out where they may be partially right. This opens the door for a deeper understanding and avoids binary thinking.  It's hard to see certain long-term trends, but you must try.  There is too much emphasis on short-term, monthly data and too little on long-term trends and on what might happen in the future that would influence long-term outcomes. For example, today there is tremendous interest in monthly inflation data, although it seems to me that every long-term trend I see increases inflation relative to the last 20 years. Huge fiscal spending, the trillions needed each year for the green economy, the remilitarization of the world and the restructuring of global trade — all are inflationary. I’m not sure models could pick this up. And you must use judgment if you want to evaluate impacts like these.  Also, a block of time as short as one year is an artificial framework for judging the impact of long-term trends that could easily play out over years. A helpful exercise is to think “future back,” in which you imagine different future outcomes, including the ones you want, and then work backward to events that are happening today (or that might happen or that you cause to happen), closely examining the connections between those events and your projected or desired outcomes. Those connections inform your risk and R&D planning. Similarly, when companies compare the attributes of their products and services with their competitors, they usually only consider where they are versus their competitors. But nothing is static — they should consider where their competitors will be in the future. Conditions are always changing, crises are always emerging. When analyzing the playing field, it is better to assume that your competitors are strong and are already in the process of improving and innovating. This minimizes the chance of arrogance leading to complacency.  DECISION MAKING AND ACTING (HAVE A PROCESS)  There is a time for an individual to decide and act.  Sometimes you should take the time to measure twice and cut once. And then sometimes making a quick decision is better than delaying. You should try to distinguish between the two. For example, with decisions that are hard to reverse, it’s usually better to go slow. With other decisions where you can test, learn, probe and change direction, it’s often better to go fast. It’s been my experience that it’s hard for some people to actually decide and act. This could be from analysis paralysis, lack of “perfect” information, fear of failure or the feeling that full consensus is needed before a decision can be reached. But whatever it is, it can slow down and possibly seriously damage a company.  To get people to think like decision makers and take a strong point of view, we like to ask, “What would you do if you were king or queen for a day?” It helps shift the direction to individual decision making. We also ask questions like, “What would you wish for if you knew X was going to happen?” (for example, higher interest rates). Decision making takes a mix of courage, grit and guts.  One exercise that I find useful (and sometimes painful) is to draw up a list of important decisions that need to be made — the ones I often avoid confronting. So I take time every Sunday to think about these tough issues and almost always make progress. Progress doesn’t always mean that you come to the final conclusion — sometimes it’s just a very rational next step that can put you on a path to the final decision.  Try to have a good decision-making process.  Try to give yourself the time to decide. Make sure you speak with the right people and make sure the right people are in the room. Information should be fully shared. People should be made very comfortable with open debate. Quite often, the “right” answer is simply waiting to be found — you don’t have to guess.  Crowdsourcing, compromise, consensus and committees have benefits and risks.  There are huge benefits to crowdsourcing intelligence. It is a form of full assessment, a strategy for getting the best ideas and challenging the status quo. We should do this for almost every major decision. It is perfectly fine on some occasions to compromise and gain consensus, particularly on decisions that are not critical and can easily be reversed. Often people spend too much time debating issues that are simply not that important; it’s better to decide and move on. Also, before you compromise, you should know exactly what you want to achieve and the consequences of any tradeoffs. However, sometimes compromise and consensus cannot work and only lead to a feel-good decision that is probably wrong — this could be the road to ruin.  The use of committees can be good when done properly. For example, if our risk committees could do a full assessment and crowdsource all potential risks, that would lead to better decision making. I will give one very personal and painful example, which is when we had a major trading scandal, called The London Whale. The scandal was not caused by the complexity of the trade but rather the failure to go to the proper Risk committee for a thorough review, which should have happened but didn’t. I have no doubt that had the trade been raised there, the flaws would have been exposed immediately, thereby dramatically reducing or eliminating the problem. On the other hand, the opposite can happen when a committee, with everyone staring at each other, devolves into herd-like behavior with people looking for confirmation and ending up with a compromise that is a poor choice.  Good leadership involves great observation and the ability to act, but there is more …  THE SECRET SAUCE OF LEADERSHIP (HAVE A HEART)  You need to earn trust and respect with your employees.  You can be great at assessment, you can be brilliant and you may often be willing to act. But all of that is not good enough for “complete” leadership. To become a true leader, you need to be trusted and you must earn your respect, every day. People have to know that you do not have ulterior motives and that you’re trying to do the right thing — not trying to burnish your personal reputation. Good people want to work for people they respect, and they will not respect people who take all the credit and share all the blame. People need to know that even when you make mistakes, you’re willing to admit them and take corrective action. And there is more …  The importance of vision, communication and inspiration.  The reason I’ve always hesitated to talk about “vision” is because often it is the basic BS of corporate speak — that somehow if you impart your vision to people, they will take the mountain. What it really is all about is this: After you’ve done your full assessment and decision making, you can then continuously educate, explain, train, simplify, propel and fight. But this only works if people know you are in the trenches with them, if they understand the mission and if they are there side by side with your effort.  We know that bureaucracy can lead to politics, corporate stasis and terrible decisions. So you can communicate your vision about how to fight bureaucracy by telling stories about the silly things we do — but with a smile — and then by showing people that you will actually fix the problems.  Finally, your vision needs to be clear, coherent and consistent. Within an organization, people very quickly pick up the pattern of management saying one thing but doing another. Because if words and actions are inconsistent (for example, and I could give many, when we say we want employees to be treated with respect, but we allow a jerk to be their boss), confidence in leadership will be eroded.  Heart cannot be overstated.  Heart matters. And it makes a difference when people know and see that you actually care. One example: Many years ago when I was new to JPMorgan Chase, I learned that the company’s security guards had been outsourced — to save money. Since after outsourcing, when the same guards continued coming to work every day at the same salary, I wondered, “How could this be?” (FYI, this was brought to my attention by the head of the Service Employees International Union, who came to see me over the objection of my management team.) The reason we were saving money is because the healthcare benefits were cut in half for the guards and their family members (currently worth approximately $15,000 a year), and the savings were split with us. This was a heartless thing to do — and the second I found out, I reversed the decision. JPMorgan Chase’s success will not be built off the backs of our guards — it will be the result of fair treatment of all of our employees — and we’re thankful that many of those guards are still with our company today.  You know heart and soul when you see it in effect on sports teams or with “the boys in the boat” — it’s a beautiful thing to watch. It’s not as obvious, but it happens in business, too.  It’s essential to build trust with your customers, constituencies and, yes, even competitors.  Of course, I’m not bringing this up as a matter of corporate governance or a corporation’s purpose: A business should, over the long run, try to maximize shareholder value. It is completely obvious that running a decent business —treating everyone ethically and earning trust and respect in all your communities — is not only fundamental to shareholder value but also to a healthy society.  A Pivotal Moment for America and the Free Western World: Strategy and Policy Matter  In past years, I have written extensively about public policy issues. It is important to engage in these conversations, particularly around domestic economic policy because policy matters. While JPMorgan Chase can execute specific plans to improve outcomes for customers and communities, there is no replacement for effective government policies that add to the general well-being of the country. A stronger and more prosperous country will make us a stronger company.  As CEO of this company, every year I visit numerous countries around the globe. I meet with foreign government leaders, presidents and prime ministers, business leaders, and civic and academic experts, which allows me to learn a significant amount about how public policy is executed around the world. It also reinforces some of the critical values and virtues that are essential to a healthy country.  Every time I see the American flag, it reminds me of the values and virtues of this country and its founding principles conceived in liberty and dedicated to the notion that all men and women are created equal. Talk with someone who has recently become a naturalized citizen or watch a ceremony where groups of people take the oath to America, and you will see extraordinary joy and newfound pride. They now live free, with individual rights protected by the Constitution and with their life and the well-being of their family and community protected by the U.S. military. As Americans, we have much to be grateful for and much to defend.  If you read the newspaper from virtually any day of any year since World War II, there is abundant coverage on wars — hot and cold — inflation, recession, polarized politics, terrorist attacks, migration and starvation. As appalling as these events have been, the world was generally on a path to becoming stronger and safer. When terrible events happen, we tend to overestimate the effect they will have on the global economy. Recent events, however, may very well be creating risks that could eclipse anything since World War II — we should not take them lightly.  February 24, 2022 is another day in history that will live in infamy. On that day, 190,000 Russian soldiers invaded a free and democratic European country — importantly, somewhat protected by the threat of nuclear blackmail. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent abhorrent attack on Israel and ongoing violence in the Middle East should have punctured many assumptions about the direction of future safety and security, bringing us to this pivotal time in history. America and the free Western world can no longer maintain a false sense of security based on the illusion that dictatorships and oppressive nations won’t use their economic and military powers to advance their aims — particularly against what they perceive as weak, incompetent and disorganized Western democracies. In a troubled world, we are reminded that national security is and always will be paramount, even if its importance seems to recede in tranquil times.  The fallout from these events should also lay to rest the idea that America can stand alone. Of course, U.S. leaders must always put America first, but global peace and order are vital to American interests. Only America has the full capability to lead and coalesce the Western world, though we must do so respectfully and in partnership with our allies. Without cohesiveness and unity with our allies, autocratic forces will divide and conquer the bickering democracies. America needs to lead with its strengths — not only its military but also its economic, diplomatic and moral forces. And now we must do so as America’s leadership is being challenged around the world. There is nothing more important.  Policy and strategy matter, and it’s important to be engaged.  In our increasingly complex world, there is a vital interrelationship between domestic and foreign economic policy, particularly around trade, investment, national security and other issues. And, of course, while American voters and leadership set U.S. foreign policy, being a constructive part of the global conversation has become more important than ever.  If you doubt how important public policy is for the health of a country, you need to look no further than the recent history of Greece, Ireland or Singapore. Each of these countries, starting from deeply challenging places, implemented effective government and policies that have done a great job of lifting up their people when many thought it wasn’t possible. Sweden is another great example of a country with good broad-based policies that have succeeded at precisely what we all may want — a dynamic, innovative, free-market economy (Sweden actually has fewer government-owned enterprises than America) and safety nets that work. Conversely, you need to look no further than North Korea or Venezuela to see the complete destruction and havoc that terrible public policies (often in the name of the people) can cultivate.  Strategy by its nature must be comprehensive. In the rest of this section, I try to answer the question: What must we do to ensure that the world stays safe, not only for America but for freedom and democracy? A comprehensive strategy entails four important pillars, and we must succeed at each:  Maintain American leadership (including military).  Achieve long-term economic success with our allies.  Strengthen our nation domestically.  Deepen focus and resolve on addressing our most pressing challenges.  COALESCING THE WESTERN WORLD — A UNIQUELY AMERICAN TASK  Only America has the full capabilities of military might, economic power and the principles that most people around the world yearn for — based on “liberty and justice for all” and the proposition that all people are created equal. America remains the bastion of freedom and the arsenal of democracy.  There is no alternative to American leadership.  In the free and democratic Western world, and, in fact, for many other countries, there is no real or good alternative to America. The only other potential superpower is China. Other nations know they can rely on the founding principles of America. If we reach out our hand, most nations will happily take that hand. America is still the most prosperous nation on the planet, which not only can guarantee our military strength but also positions us to help our allies develop and grow their nations (though we should minimize the “our way or the highway” type of behavior). This leadership is needed today to help Ukraine stay free in its battle with Russia.  Most of the world wants American leadership.  America continues to be the envy of much of the world, and as we’ve seen with the challenges at our borders, there is a reason people want to come here and not to autocratic nations. If you opened America’s borders to the rest of the world, I have little doubt that hundreds of millions of people would want to move here. By contrast, not many would want to emigrate to autocratic nations. Also, I have little doubt that if most investors across the globe could only invest in one country, they would choose the United States. Beyond our country’s borders, people and nations around the world understand the role that America has played in promoting world peace — known as Pax Americana. For the most part, Pax Americana has kept the world relatively peaceful since World War II and helped lead to enormous global economic prosperity, which has helped lift 1.3 billion people out of poverty.  Modern America does not engage in economic coercion or foreign wars to steal land or treasure. The fact that some of our foreign excursions might have been misguided does not negate this. We helped rebuild Europe and Japan after the devastation of World War II, and we, with our allies, have helped create global institutions to maintain peace. We are still trusted.  First and foremost, the Western world needs unquestioned military might — peace through strength.  “We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, but when they are weak,” said Ronald Reagan in 1980.  So far, the Western world has done a good job in strengthening military alliances in response to the war in Ukraine. Ukraine is essentially the front line that needs immediate support. Providing that support is the best way to counter autocratic forces that would seek to weaken the Western world, particularly America. But the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could become far worse and spread in unpredictable ways. Most important, the specter of nuclear weapons — probably still the greatest threat to mankind — hovers as the ultimate decider, which should strike deep fear in all our hearts. The best protection starts with an unyielding resolve to do whatever we need to do to maintain the strongest military on the planet — a commitment that is well within our economic capability.  American leadership requires not only the military but also the full “symphony of power.”  Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, in his book Exercise of Power, writes extensively in the first chapter about “the symphony of power.” He makes the critical point that America has often overused and misused military power and has massively underused other muscles — diplomacy, intelligence, communication (explaining to the world the benefits of democracy and free enterprise) and comprehensive economic policy.  America has the most extensive group of partners, friends and allies — both military and economic — that the world has probably ever seen. We should put this to better use.  The American public ought to hear more about why this is so important.  International isolationism has run through American foreign policy throughout our history, frequently with good reason. The chant, “Don’t get involved in foreign wars” was often right. That said, the American public should remember that even after the Revolutionary War, we did, in fact, have British and French armies on our soil. The sinking of American merchant and passenger ships during World War I and the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II brought isolationism to a close for a time. America is never far from being dragged into terrible conflicts. Global wars come to our shores whether we like it or not — we need to stay engaged.  In perilous periods of history when our allies and other democracies were under serious assault, great American leaders have inspired the American people — through words and actions — to stand up to help and defend them. Staying on the sidelines during battles of autocracy and democracy, between dictatorship and freedom, is simply not an option for America today. Ukraine is the front line of democracy. If the war goes badly for Ukraine, you may see the splintering of Pax Americana, which would be a disaster for the whole free world. Ukraine’s struggle is our struggle, and ensuring their victory is ensuring America first. It is imperative that our national leaders explain to the American people what is at stake and make a powerful case – with energy, consistency and clarity – for our strong enduring commitment to Ukraine’s survival for as long as it takes (and it could take years).  One last point: Ukraine needs our help immediately, but it’s important to understand that much of the money that America is directing to Ukraine is for purchasing weapons and equipment, most of which will be built in America. Not only is our aid helping Ukraine, but it is going directly to American manufacturers, and it is helping the country rebuild our military industrial capacity for the next generation.  STRENGTHENING OUR POSITION WITH A COMPREHENSIVE, GLOBAL ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY  Sustaining America’s economic strength is a bedrock for our long-term military strength. There are many things we need to do to strengthen the U.S. economy, and I talk about that later in this section. This discussion is about foreign economic policies – the economic battlefield.  The whole Western world is rethinking and reimagining its military strategies and alliances. We need to do the same for our economic strategies and alliances, but we should be guided by a comprehensive global strategy that deals with critical issues. Done properly, such a strategy would help strengthen, coalesce and possibly be the glue that holds together Western democratic alliances over decades.  Foreign economic policy involves trade and investment, export controls, secure and resilient supply chains, and the execution of sanctions and any related industrial policies. It must also include development finance — think of the “Belt and Road” efforts in China — which are critical to most developing nations. This framework should tell us not only how to deal with our allies but also how to work with nonaligned nations around the world. These strategies should not be aimed against any one country (such as China) but rather be focused on keeping the world safe for democracy and free enterprise.  Economic national security is paramount — both for the United States and for our allies.  It is a valid point that the Western world — both government and business — essentially underestimated the growing strength and potential threat of China. It’s also true that China has been comprehensively and strategically focused on these economic issues, all while we slept. But let’s not cry over spilled milk — let’s just fix it.  We missed the potential threat from three vantage points. The first is companies’ overreliance on China as the sole link in their supply chain, which can create vulnerabilities and reduces resiliency. But to the extent this involves everyday items, like clothes, sneakers, vaccine compounds and consumer goods, this dependency is not as critical or complex and will eventually be sorted out.  The second is the most critical. The United States cannot rely on any potential adversaries for materials essential to our national security — think rare earths, 5G and semiconductors, penicillin and materials critical to essential pharmaceuticals, among others. We also cannot be sharing vital technologies that can enhance an adversary’s military capabilities. The United States should properly and narrowly define these issues and then act unilaterally, if necessary, to fix them.  The third is also complex, which is countering unfair competition or “mercantilist” behavior in critical industries; think electric vehicles, renewable energy and AI, among others. Examples of this would be where a state, any state, uses government powers, capital, subsidies or other means to dominate critical industries and deeply damage the economic position of other nations. Weakening a country economically can render it a virtual “vassal state,” reliant on potential adversaries for essential goods and services, which also weakens it militarily. We cannot cede our important resources and capabilities to potential adversaries.  All these issues can be resolved, though they will take time and need devoted effort.  Every nation will have different national security issues. For example, Europe in general and countries like India, Japan and Korea need reliable, affordable and secure energy; many nations would put food security as their top concern. This means that we must work with our allies to accomplish our own goals and to help them accomplish theirs. We have extraordinary common interests in our joint security: We must hang together — because if we don’t, we will assuredly hang separately.  We already engage in trade — improving it is good economics and great geopolitics.  We must have a better understanding of trade. As a nation, we refuse to get into genuine trade discussions, but this ignores the complete and obvious truth — we already have trade relationships with all these countries. Approximately 92% of the world’s consumers live outside the United States. Increased trade allows our workers and farmers to access those markets. We should negotiate trade agreements that can achieve more, economically, for ourselves and our allies, as well as meet all of our national security needs. While it is appropriate to use trade to continue to nudge allies in the right direction around human rights and climate, this objective should be subordinated to our national interests of long-term security.  Negotiating must be done in concert with our allied nations so as not to cause a fissure in economic relations. This is critical — strong economic bonds will help ensure strong military alliances. The Inflation Reduction Act has much good in it (more on this later), but it angered many of our allies. To them, the bill was by America and for America, and, subsequently, they felt a need to match it so their businesses would not be disadvantaged. The terms of the legislation could have been better negotiated with our allies in mind, strengthening our economic ties with the free world.  We should also immediately re-enter, if possible, the prior negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Not only is it good for the economy, but it also could be a brilliant, strategic, economic security move — an economic alliance that binds us with 11 other important countries (including Australia, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and Vietnam). Geopolitically and strategically, this might be one of the most important moves to counter China. While this is a challenging step, our political leaders need to explain and lead — and not be afraid of dealing with the tough issues. We also need to acknowledge that there have been real negative job impacts as a result of trade, which are usually concentrated around certain areas and businesses. So any new trade policy should be combined with a greatly enhanced Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides retraining, income assistance and relocation for those workers directly impacted by trade.  Trade is realpolitik, and the recent cancellation of future liquified natural gas (LNG) projects is a good example of this fact. The projects were delayed mainly for political reasons — to pacify those who believe that gas is bad and that oil and gas projects should simply be stopped. This is not only wrong but also enormously naïve. One of the best ways to reduce CO2 for the next few decades is to use gas to replace coal. When oil and gas prices skyrocketed last winter, nations around the world — wealthy and very climate-conscious nations like France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as lower-income nations like Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam that could not afford the higher cost — started to turn back to their coal plants. This highlights the importance of safe, secure and affordable energy. Second, the export of LNG is a great economic boon for the United States. But most important is the realpolitik goal: Our allied nations that need secure and affordable energy resources, including critical nations like Japan, Korea and most of our European allies, would like to be able to depend on the United States for energy. This now puts them in a difficult position — they may have to look elsewhere for such supplies, tuning to Iran, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates or maybe even Russia. We need to minimize anything that can tear at our economic bonds with our allies.  The strength of our domestic production of energy gives us a “power advantage” — cheaper and more reliable energy, which creates economic and geopolitical advantages.  Industrial policy is now necessary, but it should be carefully constructed and limited.  In some cases, industrial policy (using government resources to subsidize investments to help make businesses more competitive) may be the only solution for quickly building up the industries we need (rare earths and semiconductors, among others) to guarantee resilient national security. The IRA and CHIPS Act are good examples of this and government has to get it right.  Such policy can also be used to help combat unfair competitive policies of nations that are using state capitalism and state control to dominate critical industries. However, when crafting industrial policy, the function of government needs to be narrowly defined and kept simple; i.e., governmental jurisdiction should be limited to very specific products and probably to what we know works, such as tax credits and, to a lesser extent, loan guarantees. And industrial policy should include twin provisions: 1) strict limitations on political interference, like social policies, and 2) specific permitting requirements, which, if not drastically improved, will badly inhibit our ability to make investments and allow infrastructure to be built. Adding social policy, politics and matters other than simple tax credits dramatically reduces the economic efficiency of industrial policy and creates conditions for corporate America to feed at the trough of government largess. We should quickly address how we can improve on already executed legislation. We do not want to look back and have great regrets about how so much of this policy work failed.  There are those who argue that the U.S. government needs much more far-reaching industrial policy to be able to micromanage and accomplish its many ambitious objectives. To those I say, read the next section about how ineffective so many government policies have been.  We should be tough, but we should engage with China.  Over the last 20 years, China has been executing a more comprehensive economic strategy than we have. The country’s leaders have successfully grown their nation and, depending on how you measure it, have the first or second largest economy in the world. That said, many question the current economic focus of China’s leadership as they don’t have everything figured out. While China has become the largest trading partner to many countries around the world, its own GDP per person is $13,000. And the country continues to be beset by many economic and domestic issues.  China has its own national security concerns. The country is located in a very politically complex part of the world, and many of China’s actions have caused its neighbors (e.g., Japan, Korea, Philippines, among others) to start to re-arm and, in fact, draw closer to the United States. It also surprises many Americans to hear that while our country is 100% energy sufficient, China needs to import 10 million barrels of oil a day. It is clear that China’s new leadership has set a different course, with a much more intense focus on national security, military capability and internal development. That is their right, and we simply need to adjust to it.  America still has an enormously strong hand — plenty of food, water and energy; peaceful neighbors; and what remains the most prosperous and dynamic economy the world has ever seen, with a per person GDP of over $80,000 a year. Most important, our nation is blessed with the benefit of true freedom and liberty. See the sidebar on the amazing power of freedom later in this section.  While we may always have a complex relationship with China (made all the more complicated and serious by ongoing wars), the country’s vast size and importance to so many other nations requires us to stay engaged — thoughtfully and without fear. At the same time, we need to build and execute our own long-term, comprehensive economic security strategy to keep our position safe and secure. I believe that respectful, strong and consistent engagement would be best for both our countries and the rest of the world.  We need to strengthen and rebuild the international order — we may need a new Bretton Woods.  The international rules-based order established by the Western world after World War II is clearly under attack by outside forces, somewhat weakened by its own failures and inability to keep up with the increasingly complex world. This international order relies on a web of military alliances, trade agreements (e.g., World Trade Organization), development finance (e.g., International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) and related global tax and investment policies and diplomacy organizations (e.g., United Nations), which have evolved into a confusing and overlapping regime of policies. You can now add to it the new issues of cyber warfare, digital trade and privacy, and global taxes, among others.  It might be a good idea to convene a group of like-minded leaders to build and improve upon what already exists. The time may be right for a reimagined Bretton Woods — and by this, I mean revitalizing our global architecture. Since too many parts of the world have been neglected, any new system has to take into account and properly address the needs of all nations, including areas of concentrated poverty.  While we hope the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East will end eventually (and, we hope, successfully from the standpoint of our allies), these other critical economic battles could possibly continue throughout our lifetime. If the Western world is slowly split apart over the next few decades, it will likely be the result of our failure to effectively address crucial global economic challenges.  PROVIDING STRONG LEADERSHIP GLOBALLY AND EFFECTIVE POLICY MAKING DOMESTICALLY  When you travel around the United States and talk with people of all types and persuasions, there is a rather common refrain; namely, why are we helping foreign nations with the safety of their borders and economies when we are not doing a particularly good job of protecting our own? While there is no moral equivalency in these arguments, they are understandable. It is clear that many Americans feel we need to do a better job here at home before we can focus over there. We can understand why some people living in this country, who have been neglected for decades, ask how their government can find the money for Ukraine and other parts of the world but not for them. It is a reasonable question.  From my point of view, our highly charged, emotional and political domestic issues are centered around 1) immigration and lack of border security and 2) the fraying of the American dream, particularly for low-income and rural Americans who feel left behind amid the growing wealth and prosperity of others around them. Please read the sidebar below, which I believe explains the legitimate frustration of some of our citizens. And I agree with them.  In the sidebar, I also explain how two policies (a large expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and focus on work skills and job outcomes at high schools, community colleges and colleges) would not only dramatically increase both the income and employment opportunities for many of those left behind but would also have the virtue of actually growing the workforce. The combined effect of all of this would be quite a boon to our GDP.  I believe that many affected Americans are not angry at hardworking, law-abiding immigrants and, in fact, acknowledge the critical role immigrants continue to play in building this wonderful country. Rather, they are angry that America has not implemented proper border control and immigration policies. It is astounding that many in Congress know what to do and want to do it but are simply unable to pass legislation because of partisan politics. Congress did come close on a few occasions — and I hope they keep trying.  Deliberate policies meant to drive healthy growth are needed.  For over two decades, since 2000, America has grown at an anemic rate of 2%. We should have strived for and achieved 3% growth. Had we done so, GDP per person today would be $16,000 higher, which would, in turn, have paid for better healthcare, childcare, education and other services. Importantly, the best way to handle our excess deficit and debt issues is to maximize economic growth.  Growth policies include (the list could be very long so I’ll just mention a few):  Consistent tax policies, conducive to both employment and capital investment. Capital investment is the primary driver of innovation, productivity and, therefore, growth in America. Tax policies change too frequently, which causes uncertainty and complicates long-term capital investment decision making (I won’t bore you with the details here). A bipartisan committee of Congress is probably required to fix this — and the sooner the better.  Well-conceived regulations (and related laws). This requires an ongoing concerted effort to streamline regulations to cost-effectively drive better outcomes for the United States. The last thing we need is a constant pile-on of politically driven, fragmented policies. Please read the sidebar, an editorial in The Wall Street Journal by George McGovern, one of the most liberal presidential nominees in our lifetime, in which he clearly lays out the complexity, risks and costs that businesses, large and small, face every day. While he acknowledges the worthiness of the goals of many regulations, he points out their negatives. He also calls out the “blame-shifting and scapegoating and the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees.” Not only is this state of affairs demoralizing, but it also reduces employment, capital investment and the formation of new businesses, as well as cause unnecessary bankruptcies. Estimates of the regulatory costs for America are approximately $19,000 per worker, dwarfing the regulatory burdens in other countries. We all want sensible regulations that make us a better and safer nation – but this number is astounding. We should be able to accomplish our goals while sharply reducing needless and wasteful expenses. And remember, it’s discouraging not only to companies but to all citizens who have to deal with it on a daily basis.  Timely permits on projects large and small. There is virtually no industry — from agriculture and construction to transportation, technology, and oil and gas — or business, large or small, that isn’t disadvantaged by the tedious process and the length of time it takes to get approvals for permits to get things done. This includes federal, state and local requirements. These bottlenecks also make investment far more costly and slow. Timely permits would improve infrastructure and save lives, not endanger them.  Proper federal government budgeting and fiscal management. The staggering inability of the government to draft and pass a proper budget causes deep and unnecessary damage to our growth. Some people estimate that the waste alone (due to improper payments, overlapping programs, and fragmented and duplicative contracts, among other things) could cost the nation hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This uncertainty filters through virtually every part of the American economy and should not be accepted.  We can all forgo a little self-interest to do what is right for our country.  Those of us who have benefited the most from this country bear even greater responsibility to do this. It’s perfectly understandable that institutions, including businesses, unions and industries, lobby in Washington, D.C., to protect themselves — in good ways and bad — but we should more regularly put national interests ahead of self-interests. It’s good to want to ensure well-paying jobs and healthy industries. But it is not good when it reduces competition, stops the deployment of enhanced technology, harms efficiency, creates fake jobs or builds bridges to nowhere or damages the general health of the economy. Doing the right thing, the right way – which is achievable – would be better for everyone. As former President John F. Kennedy said, “Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.”  Celebrate American exceptionalism.  We can safely say that America is an exceptional nation built and grounded on principles — principles of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and empowerment brought to us by our democracy through the power to elect our leaders and of our Constitution, which makes these individual freedoms sacrosanct. Much of the world yearns to be here because of those principles — the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We should extol those virtues while recognizing that America has never been a perfect nation, like all other nations. We can acknowledge our flaws and strive to constantly correct them, without denigrating our nation.  Let’s celebrate the shared sense of sacrifice that gives us all strength.  There were very few positives from the pandemic, but I’m mentioning one, which, unfortunately, didn’t last, but reflected the best of us. In New York City, at 7 p.m. every evening, people throughout the city would open their windows, shouting and screaming and banging pots and pans to show gratitude to the essential workers — sanitation workers, police, firefighters, emergency responders, nurses and doctors. Of course, these workers were always essential, but I was hoping that spirit and civility would become deeply embedded and have longer lasting effects in our society.  I can understand when an individual for conscientious reasons chooses not to do work that helps our military. But I cannot understand when an entire company takes that position. How can we have a sense of shared sacrifice, when America is home to 18 million veterans who were willing to risk their lives for America’s safety, and yet some companies are not even willing to use their fingertips to help?  For example, back in 1969 the cancellation of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps programs by the country’s most prestigious universities and colleges likely fueled the great divide – between elites and others in our country – that persists today. Our strength as a nation is best served when the best students and the best soldiers are brought together and we would all benefit from more civility and better teaching around basic virtues like hard work, shared sacrifice, justice, rationality and more respect for the enduring values of American freedom and free enterprise.  Resist being “weaponized.”  We can start by trying to understand other people’s and other voters’ points of views, even around deeply emotional topics. We can stop insulting whole classes of voters. We can stop name calling. We can stop blame-shifting and scapegoating. We can stop being petty. Politicians can cease insulting, baiting and belittling each other, which diminishes them and the voter. It has also become too acceptable for some politicians to say one thing in private and deliver a completely different message in public. It would also be nice to see some cabinet members from the opposing party. We should also stop degrading and demonizing American business and American institutions, which are the best in the world, because it erodes confidence in our very country.  Social media could do more.  There is no question that social media has some real negative effects, from the manipulation of elections to the increasingly documented negative effects on the mental health of children. These are issues impacting our individual and collective spheres, and it’s time for social media companies to take more action to remedy these challenges — and swiftly. Rapid advances in technology will not only make these existing issues harder to address, but they will likely create new ones. The current state of the online information landscape has wide-ranging implications on trust in institutions, information integrity and more — and it bears on institutions like ours, where platform policy has increasingly widespread implications for concerns about fraud, security and other issue spaces.  A range of tools and approaches is required to address this complex and important situation — and there are several measures that platform companies can immediately enact, voluntarily, while strengthening and improving their business models. One common sense and modest step would be for social media companies to further empower platform users’ control over what they see and how it is presented, leveraging existing tools and features — like the alternative feed algorithm settings some offer today. I believe many users (not just parents) would appreciate a greater ability to more carefully curate their feeds; for example, prioritizing educational content for their children.  Platforms could also consider enhanced authentication measures; i.e., having users identify themselves to the platform or to a trusted third party. This would have the virtue of increasing individual accountability and reducing imposters, bots and possibly foreign political actors on platforms. It would have immediate benefits for users who prefer content from authenticated sources that take responsibility for their postings. There are clear competing values that need to be balanced in such an approach, including those related to our cherished right to free speech, individual privacy and inclusion (for example, roughly 850 million people globally don’t have a way to easily authenticate themselves today). There are also legitimate questions as to whether authentication would be used as a tool to chill or block speech or quash bona fide political dissenters, and real work needs to be done to identify policy and technical solutions that balance such risks and benefits.  I offer these approaches as a starting place, understanding that it's crucial to continue honest conversation across sectors about the immediate, incremental improvements we can make to our online public square, considering the high stakes involved in how information is created and shared.  Effective measures will require time, money, learning and improvement, all in service of significantly enhancing the well-being, quality, and civility of our experiences online and in the world around us.  Healthy collaboration with business is needed.  Companies big and small create jobs, pay for employee healthcare and benefits, and build bridges, roads and hospitals. The people who work for and run these companies care deeply about their country — they are patriots, and they want to see people and communities succeed and prosper.  Unfortunately, the message America hears is that the federal government does not value business — that business is the problem and not part of the solution. There are fewer individuals in government who have any significant experience in starting or running a company, which is apparent every day in the political rhetoric that demonizes businesses and free enterprise and that damages confidence in American’s institutions. The relationship between business and government, in fact, might improve if there were more people from the business sector working in government. Inexperience with business is also evident from the regular lack of transparency or curiosity from regulators as they develop economic policies with potentially seismic consequences for the economy.  When I travel around the country, I experience a very different perspective on the street and at the local level — I see that many governors, mayors and city council members understand they are not facing big challenges alone. They stand shoulder to shoulder with our company, even when some of their constituents disagree or are skeptical about big banks. These government officials know they need partners who have the same stake in helping successful communities thrive and who care about building a prosperous future as much as they do. For example, in fewer than 10 years, Detroit saw one of the greatest turnarounds because of a vibrant collaboration between government and business. And businesses know they cannot succeed if individuals, families, towns and cities are not flourishing. We obviously don’t agree on everything, but there is a shared belief that we must work together. We can and should be full partners in developing solutions to our big problems.  The federal government, regardless of which party is in charge, needs to earn back trust through competence and effective policymaking.  The world is becoming more complex, more technologically competent and faster. Unfortunately the government simply is not built to innovate, compete and move quickly, as in the competitive business world. This may be the reason why government is becoming less effective. We need to take action on this because the loss of trust in government is damaging to society. We should be brutally honest about the staggering number of policies, systems and operations that are underperforming: Too many ineffective public schools do not give students the skills they need to land a well-paying job; we have over 25 million uninsured Americans, soaring healthcare costs and too many bad outcomes; we are unable to plan, permit and build infrastructure efficiently; our litigation system is capricious and wasteful; progress on immigration policies and reform is frustrating; lack of efficient mortgage markets and an affordable housing policy keep housing out of reach for many Americans; problems plague the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Internal Revenue Service; public universities don’t take responsibility for their costs and are often funded by excessive student lending; underinvestment in the electric grid results in high costs and unreliable service; highly inefficient U.S. merchant shipping and ports; and we have unfunded pension plans and no action on deficit spending, Social Security and Medicare. I’ll stop here. This should be unacceptable to all of us.  We need to find a way to bring more varied expertise and accountability to government.  We should be more ambitious in striving for excellence in government. I acknowledge that some of the best and the brightest are in government and the military today. Yet we should return to a government that seeks out more of the best and the brightest people from every background, including the private sector, to benefit from their knowledge and experience. Government also needs to leverage the expertise of business to address problems that it cannot solve on its own. And to be fair, business could use its influence to do less to further its own interest and more to enhance the nation as a whole.  We need good government. And there are some things only governments can do, such as oversee the military and justice systems. And while most innovation happens through the private sector, there are certain types of foundational innovations that can only be advanced by the government, such as basic research that simply cannot be funded by business. The Democrats want the government to do even more and the Republicans even less — I think we should spend more time trying to do even better. But no one, not even my most liberal Democratic friends, thinks that sending the government another trillion a year would be a wise use of money.  OUT OF THE LABYRINTH, WITH FOCUS AND RESOLVE  Even America, the most prosperous nation on the planet with its vast resources, needs to focus its resources on the complex and difficult tasks ahead.  I hope to never read a book about How the West Was Lost, summarized as follows: The failure to save Ukraine and find peace in the Middle East led to more bickering among the allies and weakened military alliances. This accelerated a division within the Western world, splitting countries into different economic spheres and with each nation trying to protect its economy, trade and energy sources. America’s economy weakened, eventually leading to the loss of its reserve currency status. Besotted by populism and partisanship and crippled by bureaucracy and lack of willpower, America failed to focus on what it needed to do to lead and save the Western world. The enemy was within — we just didn’t see it in time.  Paraphrasing what Winston Churchill was thought to have said: America, after it had exhausted all other possibilities, would do the right thing.  What I want and hope to see is a book about How the West Was Won. As the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East dragged on and as the fears of the Western world mounted, America rose to the challenge as it had in other turbulent times in history. America coalesced with its allies to form the alliances necessary to keep the world safe for freedom and democracy.  I remain with a deep and abiding faith in the strength of the enduring values of America.  WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FAITH IN THE AMAZING POWER OF OUR FREEDOMS  The heart and soul of the dynamism of America is human freedom — freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and empowerment brought to us by our democracy through the right to elect our leaders. Free people are at liberty to move around as they see fit, work as they see fit, dream as they see fit, and invest in themselves and in the pursuit of happiness as they see fit. This freedom that people enjoy, accompanied by the freedom of capital, is what drives the dynamism — economic and social — of this great country.  Our civil liberties depend upon the rule of law, property rights, including intellectual property, and restrictions on government encroachment upon these freedoms. Our Constitution and Bill of Rights secure our individual freedoms and reserve all rights to the individual other than those important but limited authorities given to the government.  The issue of individual rights is not all or none or freedom versus no freedom. There are, of course, terrible examples where individual rights were trampled upon, and the results were devastating — both for the individual and for the economy — in East Germany, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, to name a few. And there are many countries that protect individual rights and are on a spectrum closer to American values. Think of Europe, for example. But even in some countries that have some of these rights, a lack of dynamism — often due to bureaucracy, weak institutions and government, and corruption — is palpable and has clearly led to less innovation, lower growth and, in general, a lower standard of living.  Freedom must necessarily be joined with the principle of striving toward equal opportunity. Equal opportunity is what allows individuals to rise to the best of their ability — it also means unequal outcomes. Equal opportunity is the foundation for fairness and meritocracy. The fight for equality, which is a good moral goal, should not damage the rights of the individual and their liberties.  Democracy and freedom are cojoined — together, they make freedom more durable. Democracy also has a self-correcting element — every four years you get to throw out leadership if you don’t like them (which you do not see in autocracies). But we all know that democracy can be sloppy: Maintaining an effective democracy is hard work. Democracy fosters open debate and compromise, which lead to better decisions over time (whether in government or in business). Intelligence is effectively “crowdsourced” with constant feedback. Good public policy comes from good debate and analytics, guided by reason coupled with a firm understanding of what you would like the outcomes to be and complemented with an honest assessment of what is really happening.  Even democracies can become stagnant, bureaucratic and self-perpetuating. Good government does many admirable things, but admitting to mistakes is often not one of them. It takes civically engaged citizens and a strong free press to bring sunlight to issues and keep a nation strong.  Autocratic societies by their nature subjugate the individual to the state. By definition they are not meritocracies — they are more about “who you know,” and they exist to perpetuate the existing ruling class. Their decisions are based on a completely different calculation, and their decision-making process does not encourage and, therefore, benefit from open debate. Democracy means that it is immoral to subjugate individual freedoms to state actors other than to protect the existence of the nation itself.  There are values that many of us hold dear, such as religion, family and country. But none may be more important than the freedoms that allow us to choose to live our life as we see fit. We should do more to applaud the virtue and amazing power of our freedoms.  HOW WE CAN HELP LIFT UP OUR LOW-INCOME CITIZENS AND MEND AMERICA’S TORN SOCIAL FABRIC  To fix problems, we must first acknowledge them. Despite decades of government programs and all the moralizing that surrounds them, we have not done a particularly good job lifting up our low-income fellow citizens. I may be wrong, but I do believe this is tearing at the social fabric of America and is among the root causes of the fraying of the American dream.  The gap between low-wage and well-paid workers has been growing dramatically. From 1979 to 2019, the wage growth of the top 10% was nearly 10 times that of the bottom 10% — which, basically, had not increased at all. The growth of low-income workers’ annualized real wages after the pandemic was, for the first time in decades, higher than the top 60%, but that’s not enough. The net worth for the bottom 25% of households is $20,800, and the net worth for the bottom 10% is essentially $0. This makes it increasingly difficult for low-wage workers to support their families. Of the 160 million Americans working today, approximately 40 million are paid less than $15 per hour.  Low-income individuals bear far greater burdens than the rest of us. Nearly 40% of Americans don’t have $400 in savings to deal with unexpected expenses, such as medical bills or car repairs, which leads to financial distress. More than 25 million Americans don’t have medical insurance at all; of these, one in five are in a family with income below the federal poverty level. People who live in low-income neighborhoods also tend to have worse health outcomes, including higher rates of mental health issues, depression and suicide, and a lower life expectancy — as many as 20 years. Finally, low-income Americans generally experience higher unemployment and more crime.  No one can claim that the promise of equal opportunity is being offered to all Americans through our education systems. Students in the lowest socioeconomic bracket are 50% less likely to attend college than those in the highest socioeconomic groups. Many inner city schools graduate under 50% of their students — and even those who graduate may not be well-prepared for the workforce. In addition, boys growing up in the bottom 10% of family income are 20 times more likely to be incarcerated. Those who do run afoul of our justice system generally do not get the second chance that many of them deserve. Their exclusion from the workforce is not only unfair to them but also results in an estimated $87 billion average annual cost to the economy.  Too many policies that are wrong — affecting housing and mortgage markets, healthcare, immigration, regulation, education and student lending, to name a few — are jeopardizing the opportunity for American citizens to succeed. The people who suffer the most, throughout all of this, are not high-income individuals. I strongly believe that these outcomes are destroying the concept of “fair” in America and are driving populism and diminishing, if not eliminating, trust — not only in government but in all our institutions. Simply put, the social needs of far too many of our citizens are not being met. We should never accept these outcomes — we must fix them.  There are two policy changes that I believe can have a dramatic effect on jobs, growth and equality — and they go a long way toward repairing the frayed American dream. Let’s start by treating all jobs with respect. Even starter jobs, which are the first rung on the ladder of opportunity, bring dignity and create better social outcomes in terms of health, higher household formation and lower crime. Of these two policy changes, one would better utilize existing resources, and the other would cost some money. But both would significantly change outcomes for low-income Americans.  The free one is so blindingly obvious that it’s almost embarrassing to propose. Our schools (high schools, community colleges and perhaps even four-year colleges) should take responsibility for outcomes — they should be judged on the quality and income level of the jobs that their graduates and even non-graduates attain. This means providing graduating students and other individuals with work skills (in fields such as advanced manufacturing, cyber, data science and technology, healthcare and so on) that will lead to better paying jobs. These schools should work with local businesses to replicate effective programs that are in place — because that is where the actual jobs are now. This would be good for growth and, as there are so many examples of successful programs, we already know what to do. With nearly 9 million job openings and just under 6 million unemployed workers in the United States, job skills training has never been needed more. We already spend a tremendous amount of money on education — just not the right way.  The second step is related to the first: Get more income to low-paid workers. While this one would cost money, it is to me a complete no-brainer since it is an expansion of an existing program, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many Democrats and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the EITC supplements low- to moderate-income working individuals and couples, particularly with children and people living in rural areas. For example, a single mother with two children earning $9 an hour (approximately $20,000 a year) could receive a tax credit of more than $6,000 at year-end. Workers without children receive a very small tax credit (96% of all EITC dollars were received by families with children). This should be dramatically expanded, including eliminating the child requirement from the calculation altogether. We should convert the EITC to make it more like a negative income payroll tax, paid monthly. Any tax credit income should not be offset by any other benefits these individuals already receive (we have to eliminate benefit “cliffs” that disincentivize work).  An increase in the EITC to a maximum of $10,000 would cost tens of billions a year, but I have little doubt that these policy changes would do more than anything else to lift up low-income families and their communities. Well-paying jobs have been shown to reduce crime, increase household formation, improve health and reduce addiction. Both of these policies would have the virtue of increasing the number of people in the workforce. I also have little doubt that this would add to GDP.  We should attack all our other problems as well, but these two policy changes alone would dramatically improve our low-income neighborhoods, broadly strengthen the economy and give more opportunity to deserving citizens. It would restore the American Dream for many.  In Closing  It’s been 20 years since the Bank One-JPMorgan Chase merger — and it’s been an extraordinary journey. I can’t even begin to express my heartfelt appreciation and respect for the tremendous character and capabilities of the management team who got us through the good times and the bad times to where we stand today. And I recognize that we all stand on the shoulders of many others who came before us in building this exceptional company of ours.  I would also like to express my deep gratitude to the 300,000+ employees, and their families, of JPMorgan Chase. Through these annual letters, I hope shareholders and all readers have gained a deeper understanding of what it takes to be an “endgame winner” in a rapidly changing world. More important, I hope you are as proud of what we all have achieved — as a business, as a bank and as a community investor — as I am. Thank you for your partnership.  Finally, we sincerely hope to see the world on the path to peace and prosperity.

42418446,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGaj,1712578221,MicroStrategy Should Continue to Rally as Bitcoin Halving Nears: Benchmark,"MicroStrategy price target raised to $1,875 from $990 at Benchmark.  The software company is well positioned to benefit from the upcoming bitcoin halving, the report said.  The broker raised its bitcoin 2025 year-end price forecast to $150,000.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) is particularly well positioned to benefit from the bitcoin {{BTC}} halving set to occur around April 20, when new supply of the cryptocurrency will be cut by 50%, broker Benchmark said in a research report on Monday.  “We note that the three previous bitcoin halvings, in 2012, 2016, and 2020, saw explosive appreciation in bitcoin’s price occur only after the halving had taken place,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are reduced, slowing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply.  Benchmark raised its MicroStrategy price target to $1,875 from $990 while maintaining its buy rating. The new price target is based on the assumption that bitcoin will reach $150,000 by the end of 2025, up from $125,000 previously. MicroStrategy shares rose more than 11% to around $1,601 in trading before the official open of U.S. markets.  “While the upcoming bitcoin halving will create a supply shock as the previous ones had, we believe the event’s impact could be magnified by the concurrent demand shock created by the emergence of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs),” Palmer wrote, adding that “we expect inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs to grow dramatically once institutions begin to invest in them in earnest.”  MicroStrategy has a unique business model based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. The company is expected to continue to add to its bitcoin stash using proceeds from capital markets transactions and excess cash generated by its enterprise software business, the report said.  Benchmark estimates that the company will hold 298,246 bitcoins by year-end 2025, up from the 214,246 coins it owned as of March 19.  Rival broker BTIG said the software developer’s implied premium to bitcoin is supported by investors who want exposure to digital assets but may be unable to invest directly in the cryptocurrency or ETFs, and also supported by the company’s ability to accretively raise capital to purchase additional BTC, it wrote in a report on Friday.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  U.S. crypto-related stocks looked set to start the week on a positive note after bitcoin (BTC) climbed through $72,000 for the first time since mid-March as its reward halving draws closer. Coinbase (COIN), the only U.S. traded crypto exchange, gained 4.9% in pre-market trading, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, rose 10% and BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT), added around 6.5%. Bitcoin advanced 4.4% over 24 hours while the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, rose 4.1%. Other tokens rising on Monday included meme coins dogwifhat, which gained 18%, and pepe, which rose 10%. According to trader Michaël van de Poppe, there is still a lot of momentum to be gained for altcoins as bitcoin dominance continues to peak pre-halving. “They [altcoins] are super undervalued,” van de Poppe said in a post on X.  Bitcoin could soon rally to new record highs after breaking through a so-called triangle resistance, according to technical analysis by 10x Research. On its way to $72,000, BTC passed through a triangular consolidation pattern identified by a resistance line connecting March 15 and March 27 highs and a support line connecting March 20 and April 3 lows. ""If the breakout is bullish, which we suspect, bitcoin could climb above 80,000 during the next few weeks – if not earlier. Buying at $69,280 and setting a stop loss at $65,000 appears appropriate,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said in a note sent to clients early Monday.  BlackRock (BLK) added five authorized participants (APs) to the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), bringing the total number to nine as the exchange-traded fund continues to attract billions of dollars from investors. The new APs include Wall Street banking giants Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, Citigroup and UBS alongside clearing house ABN AMRO, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They join Jane Street Capital, JPMorgan, Masquarie and Virtu Americas. CoinDesk reported in January that Goldman Sachs was looking to play a key role for the bitcoin ETFs and was in talks with issuers about becoming an AP.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the ratio between bitcoin and gold's dollar-denominated prices.  While bitcoin recently set new record highs in fiat currency terms, it is yet to do so against gold. The bitcoin-to-gold ratio stays below the 2021 high.  Gold's price has risen nearly 5% this month, thanks to the massive buying spree by top Asian central banks. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has gained just 1%.

Ripple CEO Says Crypto Market Cap To Double By Year’s End Appearing in a recent interview with CNBC, Garlinghouse made a shocking prediction, stating that he sees the entire market capitalization of the crypto industry surging to $5 trillion by the end of 2024. The significance of this prediction carries severe weight, not just because of the startling numbers but also due to its ambitious timeline. Related Reading: Dogecoin Finds A Bottom: How The 7-Year Cycle Can Send Price To $40 Since the concept of cryptocurrency was first introduced about 40 years ago and the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, the overall market capitalization of the industry has only been able to reach about $2.5 trillion. This massive growth in a dynamic industry has been fueled by the evolutionary changes that have significantly reshaped the fundamentals of the financial sector. A rise to $5 trillion, as Garlinghouse expects, will see the crypto industry’s market capitalization doubling in about nine months. This substantial increase in such a short period would spell a revolutionary shift in the industry, extending its dominance as one of the most lucrative and thriving markets in the world. Currently, according to CoinMarketCap, the global crypto market capitalization is estimated at $2.59 trillion, reflecting a 0.74% increase in the past 24 hours. The cumulative market volume has also grown to about $61.98 billion, with Bitcoin dominance recording more than 50% of the total cryptocurrency market. Key Factors To Fuel Market Cap Growth During his interview, Garlinghouse revealed several crucial factors that could drive the crypto market capitalization to $5 trillion. The Ripple CEO disclosed that macro factors, including the Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, were prime catalysts for the market’s expansion. Related Reading: $115-Million Bitcoin Whale Wakes Up From 10-Year Slumber – What’s Next? Expressing optimism about the crypto industry, the CEO shared insights from his years observing the market’s trends. He emphasized that the introduction of ETFs has been a major driver, attracting institutional investors globally and pushing substantial funds into the market. Additionally, Garlinghouse pointed out that due to these macro factors, the demand for cryptocurrencies is increasing while its supply is dwindling. He implied that this imbalance in supply and demand typically results in price appreciation, eventually having a positive impact on the overall market. The Ripple CEO has also stated that he expects more regulatory clarity within the crypto industry, particularly in the United States. He hinted at the possibility of a favourable change in crypto regulations following the country’s election and transition to a new administration.

A minimum holding or staking of $1,000 worth of TOKEN is required for priority access, with additional benefits for higher holdings.  Developers say the move could address potential issues of token sale events being sold out quickly to the general public, where TOKEN holders should instead benefit.  The developers behind the TokenFi launchpad are presenting a proposal to boost the benefits for TOKEN users by allowing holders to gain early access to platform issuances.  The “TOKEN Supercharge Program” will provide preferential treatment for TOKEN holders and stakers, allowing them to secure tokens ahead of the broader public if the proposal passes.  The proposed move would further allow eligible users to acquire up to four times more tokens than the standard quota per wallet. Users who do not stake or hold TOKEN may face limited access to token sale events.  Users must stake or hold a minimum of $1,000 worth of $TOKEN for the proposed priority access, with higher holdings offering additional advantages.  “We have close to a dozen of these token launches already planned and due to be announced in the coming days and weeks,” TokenFi developer B told CoinDesk in a release. “However, we envision a scenario in which some of these token sale events could be sold out in minutes, especially if open to the general public.”  This could result in the majority of $TOKEN stakers and holders being unable to participate in these events when they should be the main beneficiaries,” he added.  TokenFi, which uses token (TOKEN) as its native digital asset, lets users launch any cryptocurrency without writing code.

The leading cryptocurrency reached above $72,000 on Monday; just after a week, it had touched around the $65,000 level. Bitcoin is currently changing hands at about $72,140, with market capitalization rising to about $1.42 trillion. Cryptocurrencies are expected to be in the spotlight for some time due to the halving event, which is soon approaching. After every four years, new token issuance goes down by half during this event. Previously, halving events were associated with bitcoin price gains. Positive momentum isn’t limited to Bitcoin alone; other digital tokens also recorded significant gains. Ether ( ETH-USD ) increased by 6.4% to $3,608, while Cardano ( ADA-USD ) rose 2.44% and Solana ( SOL-USD ) rose by 1%.

The latest breakout comes on the back of a blowout U.S. jobs report.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, could soon rally to new record highs after breaking through a so-called triangle resistance, according to technical analysis by 10x Research.  Early Monday, BTC rose past $72,000, passing through a triangular consolidation pattern identified by a resistance line connecting March 15 and March 27 highs and a support line connecting March 20 and April 3 lows.  ""If the breakout is bullish, which we suspect, bitcoin could climb above 80,000 during the next few weeks – if not earlier. Buying at $69,280 and setting a stop loss at $65,000 appears appropriate,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said in a note sent to clients early Monday.  The upside target of $80,000 equates to at least a 10% rise from the current price of $72,300.  The breakout comes on the heels of a hotter-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report that highlighted the U.S. economic resilience, spurring risk-taking across all corners of the financial market.  Bitcoin has been riding what can be described as an ""everything rally"" this year. Not only has the cryptocurrency soared to new highs, but so have traditional assets like Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, the broader S&P 500 and gold. The cryptocurrency's rally has been supported by persistent expansion in the supply of major stablecoins.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study price patterns to predict future trends in the asset. A symmetrical triangle, often called a coil, represents consolidation within a narrowing price range. The market typically builds energy during the consolidation, which is eventually unleashed in the direction in which the range is resolved. More often than not, symmetrical triangles end with a bullish breakout.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/08/bitcoin-may-rally-to-80k-on-triangle-break-technical-analysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d457b1fa06fc14e51e75e3cffe4620e74e2b7b2d-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LeClair observes, “As we’ve consolidated, an increasing amount of short liquidations are building from 70-75k.” Data from CoinGlass suggests that a surge to $70,000 could trigger liquidations worth approximately $174.17 million.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoins-resilience-unlikely-to-dip-to-50k-amid-rising-support-levels-and-calm-derivatives-market-analysts-predict/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

42418449,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGer,1712570100,"Bitcoin Halving Is Not a Volatility Event, Analyst Says as Implied Volatility Rises","Bitcoin's impending reward halving, though monumental, is unlikely to cause a volatility explosion, according to Amberdata's Greg Magadini.  The impact of the Bitcoin blockchain's reward halving on miners and the BTC price has been well documented over the years, leaving little room for a surprising outcome.  Bitcoin's fourth mining-reward halving is due on April 20, when the blockchain's code will reduce the per-block bitcoin {{BTC}} issuance to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.  In the run-up, implied volatility (IV) on the largest cryptocurrency by market value has ticked higher, suggesting increased price turbulence in the days surrounding the quadrennial event. Still, one observer does not favor placing bullish bets on volatility.  ""From a qualitative perspective, I continue to believe paying a volatility premium for a highly predictable outcome (the BTC halving) isn't worth a volatility event premium,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a newsletter on Monday.  Traders typically place bullish bets on volatility ahead of binary events, for which the market outcome is uncertain. Moreover, uncertainty opens the door to pre- and post-event price turbulence and has traders buying both call and put options or volatility futures to profit from any price swings.  But the impact of Bitcoin's reward halving on its native cryptocurrency and miners has been well documented. The cryptocurrency has historically produced stellar rallies in the 12-18 months following the halving.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained  It's important to note that major crypto events like Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, Shanghai upgrade, and spot BTC listings turned out to have little market impact, disappointing traders positioned for an event-led surge in price volatility.  ""Not to mention that nearly all the big volatility events in crypto (ETH PoS merge, ETH Shanghai upgrade, BTC spot ETF decision) had disappointed IV [implied volatility], buyers when RV [realized volatility] failed to materialize by very large margins,"" Magadini noted.  Bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility, which gauges the expected price turbulence over four weeks, has increased to an annualized 75% from 68% in a week, according to Amberdata.  Meanwhile, the 30-day volatility risk premium (VRP), or the gap between 30-day implied and realized volatilities, has surpassed 10% for the first time since early March. The VRP tends to rise ahead of and following extraordinary market events and can drop to low levels during extended periods of calm markets.  ""Options implied volatility is overpricing the event,"" Magadini said, noting the uptick in VRP.  Bitcoin changed hands at $71,800 at press time, representing a 3.5% gain on the day. The cryptocurrency has risen over 11% since hitting lows near $64,500 on April 2, CoinDesk data show.

The halving will reduce the rate at which new coins are created, an event that has historically preceded a bull market for the cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin topped $71,000 in Asian trading hours Monday ahead of the reward halving expected on April 20, giving some Ordinal and BRC-20 ecosystem bets a boost even as the broader crypto market remained little changed.  BTC rose 2% in the past 24 hours taking it to the highest since April 1, data from CoinGecko shows. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, an index of the most liquid tokens excluding stablecoins, was up 0.43%.  When halving occurs, the reward for mining transactions is cut by 50%, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available new supply. This has historically preceded a bull market for the token.  The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. Open interest on BTC-tracked futures has maintained record-high levels at above $25 billion for a few weeks, indicative of leveraged bets on more expected price volatility.  Some Bitcoin ecosystem tokens and projects rose as traders expect a BTC rally following the halving event. Such bets are a way to gain proxy exposure to bitcoin's rise without using futures products or leverage.  Data shows Ordinals volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated rise in Ordinals.  The BRC-20 category of tokens gained nearly 6% in the past 24 hours. Infrastructure token Multibit (MULTI) rose 22%, while meme coins pepe {{PEPE}}, alex (ALEX) and pizza (PIZA) rose as much as 60%.  PUPS, the token of the Pups Ordinal, lost 22% as traders took profits after a 500% jump over the weekend.  Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small bitcoin-based transactions.

25397815,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601931,1712563256,"12 Days Until Bitcoin Halving: Why $100,000 Isn’t Much Further Away","With the fourth Bitcoin halving just 12 days away, the community is buzzing with anticipation, speculating on the potential for Bitcoin to breach the significant $100,000 threshold. Joe Consorti of Theya Research has offered a comprehensive analysis, diving into the intricacies of Bitcoin’s current market position and the factors that might catapult its value to new heights. This event, a cornerstone in Bitcoin’s design to halve the rewards for mining new blocks every four years, historically triggers a bullish momentum, and the present scenario appears to be aligning with past precedents. The Significance Of Bitcoin’s Consolidation Phase Consorti’s analysis titled, “Bitcoin’s 4th Halving Is [12] Days Away, and $100,000 Isn’t Much Further Behind It”, begins with a deep dive into Bitcoin’s ongoing consolidation phase, which he argues is a critical period that precedes a potential bull run. “Bitcoin continues its consolidation. In keeping with its previous phases of consolidation at $30k and $40k, BTC spends several weeks at key psychological price levels exchanging hands between buyers and sellers before advancing higher,” Consorti stated on X. Related Reading: FOMO Gives Way To Fear: Bitcoin-Ethereum Ratio Signals Shift In Crypto Sentiment He emphasizes that this is the sixth week of Bitcoin’s consolidation above $60,000, marking the least volatile period at this price level and following a new all-time high. This, according to Consorti, signals a strong market confidence that could be the foundation for the next surge. The analysis further explores the broader market dynamics, particularly the correlation breaks within the current cycle that have made the stock market an unreliable indicator of US economic sentiment. “The market at large has experienced massive correlation breaks this cycle This has a great deal to do with businesses extending their debt maturity during 2021 when rates were still low, and the US Treasury’s massive crisis-level fiscal deficit,” Consorti explains. He argues that these factors have contributed to the decoupling of traditional economic indicators from the stock market’s performance, inadvertently benefiting asset prices, including Bitcoin. The Role Of ETFs And The Spot Market A significant portion of Consorti’s analysis is dedicated to the behavior of Bitcoin ETFs and their interaction with the spot market. Despite a slowdown in net inflows to Bitcoin ETFs, the volume remains robust, indicating a healthy market. “This was one of the lowest weeks yet for BTC ETF inflows, although when you net in the outflows they are still healthy compared to previous weeks,” Consorti notes, suggesting that ETF shares are actively exchanging hands, mirroring the consolidation seen in the spot market. Related Reading: $115-Million Bitcoin Whale Wakes Up From 10-Year Slumber – What’s Next? This interplay between ETFs and the spot market, according to Consorti, provides a stable foundation for Bitcoin’s price, further solidifying the case for an impending bull run. “The funding rate is extremely muted, and we’re still at the same price [around $70,000]. In this period of consolidation, the spot market has really taken control of Bitcoin price action. This will mean more stable footing for the ensuing bull run, raising my confidence further that this consolidation is preceding a move higher rather than lower,” Consorti concluded. Expert Consensus On The Bullish Outlook Consorti’s optimistic forecast is echoed by other industry experts, who have also shared their bullish predictions. CRG, another renowned analyst, emphasized the significance of Bitcoin’s recent performance, stating, “Great weekly close. Fresh all-time highs this week,” indicating a positive momentum that could be sustained in the post-halving period.

Bitcoin closed 2 consecutive months over the upper Bollinger band. Each time it has then doubled within 3 months before the next red candle.” This historical pattern, if repeated, could potentially drive Bitcoin’s price way beyond $100,000.

The timing of this transfer is particularly noteworthy as it follows a pattern observed in the past. When Ripple Labs strategically acquired stakes in cryptocurrency exchanges, similar whale movements to these exchanges were witnessed. This led some to believe that Ripple might be attempting to manage the altcoin’s market supply, potentially causing price fluctuations through controlled exchange inflows. 🚨 24,880,000 #XRP (14,752,878 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Bitstamphttps://t.co/wdX27lI223 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 7, 2024 Bearish Sentiment Grips XRP Market Further contributing to the price decline were signs of dwindling investor interest in XRP.

Source: Coinglass Bitcoin Halving Throws Uncertainty Into The Mix The upcoming Bitcoin halving, an event that significantly reduces the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation, has injected uncertainty into the broader cryptocurrency market. While historically such events have led to price increases for Bitcoin, the short-term impact on altcoins like XRP remains unclear. Some analysts believe the crypto could benefit from a post-halving Bitcoin surge, while others anticipate a more complex interplay between the two currencies. Can XRP Still Reach $1 In April? The recent price drop undoubtedly makes the $1 target for XRP in April seem less attainable. However, dismissing the possibility entirely might be premature. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and unforeseen events could trigger a rapid price increase for the coin.
