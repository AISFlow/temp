42399028,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Ud,1462567601,Bitcoin Price Climbs Past $460 After Craig Wright Stumble,"Bitcoin has had a quiet week, experiencing low trading volume and rather modest price changes as market observers saw Australian academic Craig Wright claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.  On the other hand, ether – the native token of the Ethereum network – fluctuated far more significantly in terms of price during the seven days through 6th May.  Market participants traded only 7.7m BTC during the period, Bitcoinity data reveals – far less than many recent weeks. Ether saw reasonable transaction volume, as the digital currency reached 24-hour volume of $11.6m at 23:59 UTC on 28th April and $18.3m between 00:00 and 04:23 UTC on 6th May.  Bitcoin started the seven-day period with a price of $449.86 on 29th April between 12:00 and 02:59 UTC, the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) reveals. It surpassed $455 between 18:00 and 20:59 UTC on that day, reaching a high of $456.84 for the period, and then proceeded to fluctuate largely between $450 and $455.  Yet the week of calm is showing signs of giving way to some weekend volatility. At press time, the price of bitcoin has begun to climb further, reaching a high of $461.54.  Craig Wright’s claim  The currency then fell below the key levels of both $450 and $445 between 06:00 and 08:59 UTC on 2nd May, additional BPI data show – the day Wright proclaimed himself the creator of bitcoin.  Gavin Andresen, a noted developer and maintainer of Bitcoin Core, and Jon Matonis, a Bitcoin Foundation founding director, both wrote blog posts supporting Wright’s claims.  Yet his assertion generated skepticism, and the proof he provided to support his claim was quickly debunked, as members of the bitcoin community revealed it was merely a key from a 2009 bitcoin transaction.  He later stated he would provide additional information to prove himself, but later reneged on the promise and deleted those related blog posts.  Steady markets  Wright’s claims seem to have had little impact, as bitcoin’s weekly low, reached between 09:00 and 11:59 UTC on 2nd May, was only $439.89.  The identity of Satoshi “may not be all that important, except for the 10% of bitcoin he holds,” Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, told CoinDesk.  After reaching the low point, the currency quickly recovered, surpassing $445 between 18:00 and 20:59 UTC and spending the remainder of the week fluctuating largely between $445 and $450.  The week’s relatively quiet nature was supported by long-short data from full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, which director of operations Petar Zivkovski indicated changed little during the period.  “One noticeable pattern we have detected is that some traders, possibly swing traders, have started to close out their long positions and take profit,” he told Coindesk. “This is most likely because [the] price has failed to rise as quickly as they had hoped and they perhaps see an opportunity to buy in at a lower price in the near future.”  Zivkovski pointed to figures that he said indicate bitcoin’s prospects in the near future.  “The current long-short ratio is 4.8:1 in favor of longs,” he told CoinDesk at roughly 10:30 UTC on 5th May. “This signals that the market overwhelmingly expects more upside in the days and weeks ahead.”  A technical analysis of the market also suggests that bitcoin could soon enjoy price gains. The digital currency recently rose about 10%, and has been putting in a support level over the last two weeks, Enneking argued.  Foundation building  While Craig Wright stole the vast majority of bitcoin-related headlines this week, there were another two pieces of news that could reduce bitcoin price volatility over time, Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, told CoinDesk.  “One, AWS formally declaring its support for the space via partnership with [Digital Currency Group] is a huge validation, given AWS’s cloud capacity is an order of magnitude greater than its 14 closest competitors (that includes Microsoft),” he said. “As more people build on top of bitcoin and transactional liquidity builds, it follows that volatility should drop.”  Beyond that, Burniske spoke to a separate development that could help increase the availability of derivatives, securities that could prove integral in helping market participants manage the risk and volatility associated with the digital currency.  “CME Group Inc's (CME) public intent to publish pricing data is a significant step towards more bitcoin derivatives, and follows upon NYSE’s Index, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE), another derivative exchange heavyweight,” Burniske told CoinDesk, going on to say:  “If major exchanges are racing to build superior bitcoin indices, this lays the foundation for bitcoin derivatives, which would further open up the market to institutional investors.""  While the broader bitcoin community might have been temporarily distracted by Wright’s claims to be the digital currency’s founder, several developments are brewing that could potentially bolster bitcoin’s credibility and push its price higher.  And though many critics have contended that bitcoin suffers from high volatility, this aspect may simply be part of a phase the digital currency will soon outgrow.  Charles L.

42399016,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Hq,1462558988,"In London, Researchers Look at Blockchain Beyond Financial Services","Blockchain applications have gained surprising momentum in the financial services industry.  Major banks and financial institutions worldwide have invested in blockchain startups or formed group efforts to test the technology collaboratively. Yet the newsworthy events coming out of the financial industry can sometimes mask blockchain’s potential in other industries that may not be making splashy headlines.  Change is slow, but blockchain technology is picking up steam in several other sectors of the economy far away from financial services – and some researchers are looking to explore applications beyond finance as well.  The Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering, a research effort established last fall at Imperial College London, was awarded a grant last February by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, a government entity that provides public funding for research.  Dubbed Cryptocurrency Effects in Digital Transformations, or CREDIT, the grant will support research into distributed ledger technologies in industries other than financial services.  Dr. Catherine Mulligan, the project's chief investigator, believes in the disruptive potential of distributed ledger technologies. She has previously worked on initiatives research at the intersection of digital tech, connected devices and urban living areas.  Describing the project, Mulligan outlined the research goals, telling CoinDesk:  “We're looking at how we can apply distributed ledgers or cryptocurrencies outside of financial services. So we're looking specifically at the disruptive effects of distributed ledgers in a variety of industries like energy, insurance, healthcare.”  The research, expected to last until July 2017, hopes to establish a methodology for evaluating the impact of blockchains on a variety industries, from music production to the car leasing sector, looking at the question from the angles of both startups and existing market players.  In addition, the project's investigators aim to craft policy proposals for lawmakers and government agencies.  Public vs private  The financial industry has shown a clear preference to build their applications on top of private, distributed ledgers as opposed to a public blockchain like bitcoin. This reduces regulatory concern, and allows closer monitoring of data, information and access privileges among the participants.  However, for other industries, that privacy-oriented direction isn’t such an obvious choice.  There are many uses of public blockchains when there is a lack of trust among participants, especially ones that involve an end consumer.  A private blockchain is only as trustworthy as the members who are privileged to update and validate information. In the absence of natural trust or trust from external sources, public blockchains may be more suitable.  Dr. Mulligan thinks there is still a place for public permissionless blockchains and they can be specially suited for industries outside of finance.  The idea isn’t new, but is finding renewed academic and industry interest. One startup, Chronicled, already raised $3.4 million and is exploring blockchain technology for use in collectible sneakers. Chronicled hasn’t yet settled on what blockchain to use, but is running tests on the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.  Internet of Things and blockchain  Companies like IBM have been on the forefront of combining the two major emerging trends of Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain. IBM has already released a proof of concept for merging IoT with blockchain. Speaking about the shared benefits, Dr. Mulligan describes this as having a lot of potential in the future.  “I think both of these technologies will benefit from one another. I definitely see a lot of potential on the cross-over between IoT and distributed ledgers, including IoT used in industrial structures, as well,"" she said.  As a concrete example, Mulligan points out the ability of such a system to form an early-warning system against tampering of IoT devices, which could potentially lead to harmful real-world effects.  Mulligan told CoinDesk:  “Blockchain technology can help protect critical infrastructure in urban environments. If you put your IoT devices into the urban infrastructure, you're effectively opening up your structure to hacking. Blockchains can help with getting an early warning on any changes that may have been made on your system.”  It is too early to predict the exact impact of this technology on a variety of industries. However, academic activity in collaboration with industry players may point to where the potential effect of this technology may be felt first.

42399057,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Nk,1462553088,Bitcoin Organized Crime Research Funded by Germany and Austria,"The Austrian and German governments are funding a research effort focused on the use of digital currencies in organized crime.  Dubbed ‘BitCrime’, the initiative is backed by a number of governmental agencies in the two countries, and is split into two sub-projects.  The German sub-project is primarily supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and has a budget of €1.8m (roughly $2m). Other supporting institutions include the country’s Federal Criminal Police Office, the University of Münster, and a number of federal offices dedicated to law enforcement and financial oversight.  The Austrian sub-project, with a budget of €635k (about $725k), is backed primarily by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology, the Austrian Institute of Technology, and the Federal Ministries of Finance and the Interior.  A memo  outlining the project states:  ""The joint project will assess the subject and its threat profile in order to develop innovative and workable approaches toward regulating virtual currencies in a way that is compatible with their fundamental nature. The project will strive to develop actionable, internationally applicable and interoperable solutions for Europe and beyond.""  German researchers, the memo outlines, are developing ""technical and organizational approaches"" to the issue, and are set to create test environments for trying out new practices. In Austria, project leaders will explore analytical methods for investigations that involve digital currencies, including those focused on dark markets.  The project comes at a time when European governments, as well as the European Union, look to both expand existing regulations to cover digital currencies and blockchain technology, as well as develop new frameworks for the technology.  Members of the EU Parliament discussed approaches at a recent forum, and the bloc’s executive branch, the European Commission, is also weighing options.  Representatives for the project did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42399022,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi1Qh,1462549704,Workshop Experts Explore Problems in Implementing Blockchain IDs,"Identity is one use case of the blockchain that has many people excited. For the first time, an individual has the potential to create a true, immutable identity distributed across an entire network.  As Consensus 2016 wrapped up earlier this week, a group of thought-leaders who have been working in the identity space for decades presented their beliefs on what to consider when building an identity system using blockchain.  Christopher Allen, the principal architect at bitcoin sidechain firm Blockstream, echoed the sentiment of other panelists about the duality of identity on the blockchain.  He said:  ""Blockchain, combined with identity, is a two edged sword. The best, we can hold the powerful accountable for their actions. Transparency, all the different types of things that happened in the 2008 crash, all of that can be avoided with identity and identity services on the blockchain. The worst is we weaponize identity for the powerless.""  Allen gave the Aadhaar card project passed this March in India as an example of the positive and negative.  On the one hand, he explained, the ID card system gives nearly 1 billion citizens a way to prove who they are, which allows for fair elections and tracking of abuse.  But on the other hand, he cautioned that during the 1930s, Holland had the best civil service structure in Europe. When the Nazis invaded, he said, more Dutch Jews died than Jews in Germany.  ""They [Holland] knew who [the Jews] were, who their friends were, who their family was, and where the businesses were,"" he said.  From this, he explained that every individual must be the root of their own identity and control its administration. ""No one may charge rent or be able to revoke another's identity,"" he said.  I am my identity  Paul Ferris, founder & CEO of London-based identity collaboration project ObjectChain Collab explained that identities are not static, but rather change and evolve over time.  He said:  ""Identity changes as I develop as a person and that very much becomes part of my identity.""  He explained that flexiblity allowed for personal ownership of identity, the ability to be selective with what information a person reveals, ease of portability so the person can move across the country or world, and for there to be no centralized authority.  Allen described this as the ""self sovereign identity"" and gave the use case of an individual going to the bar. Presently, to get a drink, a person needs to share his or her ID card, which includes address, age, hair color, eye color, and other personal information.  ""All they need to know is that I am allowed to drink,"" he said. With the self sovereign identity, that would become possible.  Utilizing blockchain for identity  Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Blockstack Labs, explained the technical limitations of building an identity platform on the blockchain, using firsthand experience from the creation of Onename.  He explained that:  Until you solve decentralized identity, you can’t really build other services off of that. This is the first problem that needs to get addressed. But doing a simulation or a proof of concept is very different from running a production system.  Ali cautioned developers into thinking that the blockchain can be the end all, be all. ""Use the blockchain very carefully and put as little information as possible because you will run into scalability problems,"" he said.  He also warned that choosing the strongest blockchain on which to base identity is incredibly important. ""If you’re building everything on top of this [weak chain] and something happens, everything can break down,"" he said.  Ali added:  ""The security model around bitcoin has proven to be really strong and there is a $6b bug bounty on it.""  Gaining adoption  During the Q&A, the panel fielded a series of questions regarding taking these ideas and making them production ready. David Birch of Consult Hyperion cautioned that these sorts of projects would take quite a while to implement.  Justin Newton, co-founder and CEO of Netki, a blockchain identity startup, warned that working with governments would also take time.  He said:  ""You can't walk into a government office and just tell them to get rid of their ID system and trust you.""  In spite of the potential obstacles Allen remained optimistic about implementing new forms of identity in the developing world. By and large, he said, people in less developed areas have completely skipped the desktop computer and gone straight to mobile devies. For an identity program to work, it needs to go through the cell phone, he argued.  “In effect, [those in the developing world] already have a certain amount of autonomy where the government doesn’t know what cell phone they have. They’re using minutes or number of texts prepaid as a currency they’re exchanging with other people,” he said.

42426846,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxArh,1462545725,2016 Has Brought a Bitcoin Awakening,"Vinny Lingham is the CEO of identity startup Civic, and the former founder of mobile gift card platform Gyft.  In this opinion piece, Lingham explains why he believes the price of bitcoin is headed higher, even if this won't be the direct result of the network's reward halving this year. The post is a follow-up to his widely circulated opposing prediction, issued in 2014.  After reading my post Finding Equilibrium, published in March 2014, one could argue that I was a bit bearish on bitcoin – believing that it would trade sideways and down until certain fundamentals were in place.  At that point, most people inside the community expected bitcoin to retest its previous high of $1,255 in 2013 and easily break $2,000. In fact, when I surveyed the audience at CoinSummit in 2014, barely anyone would take the contrarian view. I did, and this was coming from the same person who correctly predicted that bitcoin would hit $1,000 just the year before.  To summarize my previous post, I argued the following:  A lack of trust in exchanges would limit bitcoin purchasing  Bitcoin is not a currency, but a commodity (it has since been declared as such by numerous bodies, including the CFTC)  Loss of momentum (Bitcoin was on the way down, not up)  Mainstream consumer adoption was lagging (and it still is to a large extent)  Merchant adoption was outpacing consumer demand  Miner margins were being squeezed (forcing more coins to be sold)  ""Smart Contracts"" would be a particularly important use case for the bitcoin network.  How 25 months makes a difference in the world of technology!  If we examine the points above, the following changes are clearly visible:  Bitcoin is on the way up, creating upward price momentum  Merchant adoption has slowed (as a percentage) and consumers are catching up – mainly early adopters, but the delta between the two has virtually reversed  Miner margins are looking a lot more more healthy, from the lows of $200 last year  Smart contracts have become the latest buzzword, along with ""blockchain"" and other networks such as Ethereum  There is a strong trust in exchanges and platforms for purchasing bitcoin, such as Bitstamp, which recently got EU regulatory approval, as well as Coinbase, Kraken, Circle, BitX and others.  Headwinds approaching  On the basis of my previous arguments against the price rising, I believe the headwinds that were holding back bitcoin will take the price up to the $1,000 mark, this year.  As the title to this post suggests, there has been an awakening.  I’ve casually been speaking about some tailwinds for about a year now and some of these ideas have been gaining momentum, so I wanted to summarize them here into three categories:  Industrial use cases are coming to the fore    Venture capital has been pouring into blockchain and bitcoin startups at an unprecedented rate, now topping over $1bn. These startups are building out solutions which utilize blockchain technologies in industries where solutions were either not possible or financially viable.  The banking sector is investing heavily in what it calls ""blockchain"", but is specifically avoiding using bitcoin. I personally think the tide will turn on this point, as soon as one of these projects get compromised, from a security perspective. That said, many foreign banks are investigating and using the bitcoin blockchain for innovating around their processes.  I think we have to accept that we will live in a world where there is a ""chain of chains"", all interlinked in some way. Bitcoin may not rule the chains of the finance world, but it may act as an intermediary platform for cross-chain settlement.  The coming short squeeze    The most important driver of the pending price surge, in my opinion, is going to be what I term as the ""mother&*!er of all short squeezes"".  A short squeeze is basically what happens when people that are short selling an asset discover that the price has risen and they need to buy (cover) to ensure they do not make further losses.  In the bitcoin world, this happens under a number of scenarios.  Traders and speculators who have taken a view that the bitcoin price will go lower could borrow coins via exchanges and sell those coins into the market, waiting for the price to drop to buy them back cheaper, repay the exchange and make a profit.  Miners would normally want to lock in profits through ""hedging"", because they produce enough coins per day that they are able to pay out of their future production. However, halving day is approaching.  Halving day is the day that a certain block number is reached and the rewards per block are cut in half (to 12.5 BTC per block, from the current 25 BTC). This is expected to take place in early July of this year.  This poses a problem for miners if they are trying to lock in their profits right now by borrowing and selling coins, which they intend to repay after halving day. Unless they have spare bitcoins lying around, they will be forced to buy coins on the open market if they cannot produce enough through their mining operations.  It’s the same as selling crops in the futures market and then being hit by a storm that wipes out half of your fields. The only way, technically, that this doesn’t happen, is if the price doubles on halving day (it won’t).  Because bitcoin trades at the margin (which means that only a percentage of the total coins issued are traded), there is less liquidity and extreme changes like a 50% drop in the rewards per block will have a more marked impact on the price than one would expect, triggering a short squeeze.  One would argue that the market has already factored this in, but it hasn’t. The reason is that the hash rate will fluctuate very rapidly over the halving day period, and that is going to cause a lot of volatility for miners and traders. Also, the true deflationary rate of bitcoin is not known, as I will now explain.  Real inflation vs nominal inflation    Bitcoin was created as ""deflationary"" currency. The total supply is 21m units and it will never be changed. There are about 15.5m BTC in circulation and about 3,600 new coins minted per day, so roughly 100,000/coins per month, which amounts to nominal inflation (relative to actual coins issued) of around 8% per year.  This will arguably drop to 4% after halving day. Or will it?  If we assume that 4m BTC will not move anytime soon, then the active circulation of bitcoin is closer to 12m coins (based upon coins in issue today). Assuming that we are minting 100,000 bitcoins per month, then real inflation is at 10%, not 8%. So, if halving day takes effect, then real inflation drops to around 5%/year.  Based upon research by John Ratcliff, I’d like to construct a new view of the real inflation rate of bitcoin. For various reasons, it appears that 25% of bitcoins are not in active circulation (lost, cold storage, Satoshi, etc). This is even if we assume Craig Wright is Satoshi (which would mean his coins won’t move until 2020). All numbers are rounded.  In 2014, bitcoin nominal inflation was 10.3% and real inflation was 15.1%  In 2015, bitcoin nominal inflation was 9.3% and real inflation was 10.1%  In 2016, bitcoin inflation will be 6.4% and real inflation will be 8.7%  In 2017, bitcoin inflation will be 4% and real inflation will be 5.3%.  Inflation in bitcoin has an interestingly different application than inflation in the real world, in that prices aren’t going up because governments are printing money. Prices are going up because of scarcity (supply/demand).  If you note that real ""inflation"" is dropping nearly two-thirds in around just three years, it means that for the current volume of bitcoin buying to be satisfied, bitcoin will need to find a new, and higher equilibrium point and clearing price.  I don’t think these calculations have been adequately factored into the market price.  Coming arms race  The realization that bitcoin is a strategic global asset will trigger an ""arms race"".  Currently, the market cap of bitcoin ($7bn) is simply too small to facilitate a large buy of bitcoins from any governmental organization. If bitcoin started to surge globally, it could become of strategic interest to a government, and therefore other governments. I believe this would trigger something akin to a digital commodity race.  Imagine if China started buying up large amounts of bitcoin – would the rest of the world governments stand idly by and watch? I don’t think so – so my prediction here is that by 2017, governments will become the largest buyers of bitcoin, pushing the price up to new highs.  It’s always easy to make outlandish predictions. My goal for this post was to outline what I think the tailwinds are behind bitcoin.  I don’t know if the price is going to $1,000 or $10,000 – but I do know that it is going up. If I was forced to predict, I would say that it would hit $1000+ in 2016 and $3000+ in 2017.  Looking forward to seeing how this all plays out!

42426840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxAjh,1462541443,Ethereum: A Valuable FinTech Sandbox,"When it comes to bitcoin and blockchain technology, established industries have made already their technological selection – they clearly want blockchain, not bitcoin.  Given the ongoing travails of bitcoin, this is arguably reasonable, and allows the focus to fall on new platforms offering different features and advantages.  While bitcoin’s ledger technology is a more natural fit for interesting innovations being built outside of incumbent systems, separating the blockchain technology for experimental purposes within existing environments has an obvious use case.  Enter Ethereum, which has been facilitating this for some time, and has now released production-ready code.  To put it simply, Ethereum is a sandbox, enabling entrepreneurs and their developers to experiment with new products, including financial ones, without the risk of harming existing systems.  Experimenting with finance  This is an exciting time for FinTech. There is an eager audience awaiting fresh ideas within banking. A new generation, millennials, are beginning to make key financial choices, seeking out new and innovative banking services.  Today, there are viable alternatives to placing money into savings or traditional investment accounts. A good example is the proliferation of peer-to-peer lending, which sees investors put up money for personal loans to individuals in need of capital. Investors get a return, and individuals get the funds they need outside the restrictions of the traditional banking system. Both parties win.  And yet more inventive financial services are on the horizon. With blockchain-based smart contract systems on platforms like Ethereum, new products will proliferate in 21st century banking and savvy users will demand this 'milliennial financial stack'.  This technology isn’t just about modifying existing systems, it’s also about creating structures that are entirely new. It’s about rethinking cash and agreements surrounding existing money-based systems.  The failed altcoin experiment  The number of alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins is mind boggling, and while many are dead at the roadside, it’s unclear which of the remaining ones actually have any merit.  Some of these still boast dumbfounding market capitalizations too. NEM, for example, has a $13m market cap, but it’s not clear if this value is legitimate, since many altcoins are used for fraud such as 'pump and dump' schemes.  While once it was thought altcoins enabled experimentation in the digital currency ecosystem, they have been left behind, and I believe the era of alternative cryptocurrencies has largely come and gone.  Technically an altcoin, Ethereum stands out from the crowd, however. It takes the potential for experimentation far beyond its rivals – combining a currency (ether) with ledgers and complex agreements that can spawn digital assets. These advanced functions can enable innovations that were simply not possible before.  Further, as a standard and open framework, Ethereum is a platform upon which engineers can easily collaborate. It now has reached a stage where a great number technical projects are being built on its platform, and has matured to a point most altcoins never achieve: developer adoption.  Rethinking the concept of cash  Alternative cryptocurrency advocates claim altcoins create a “closed loop economy” that doesn’t touch banking. This is misguided reasoning.  Banking is the global glue that enables crucial economic levers, including market liquidity and the commercial paper markets. Without this glue, market seizure is inevitable, and that is what what happened during the Great Recession of 2007-8.  What alternative cryptocurrency advocates do realize is that the existing financial system is starting to look like the slowest runner on the track.  Today, tons of technical systems run an antiquated cash-based economy, using cash that is backed by ... nothing. These systems were built this way because there was never an adequate technology for a systematic rethinking of the concept of money.  What exists today is similar to an emulator on a PC, used for playing video games from ancient platforms. In the case of finance, the systems support an idea of money that is now looking rather antiquated – the equivalent of running the original Donkey Kong on your laptop, perhaps.  But now the technology for that rethink of money does exist in the power of cryptographically backed systems and, with cash already moving in the digital realm, is being seen as an increasingly attractive alternative.  So, what if, instead of emulating a cash-based economy in a digital world, we tried something entirely new – just to see if it works?  Many Ethereum projects intend to do exactly that. A list of conceptual projects can be found here: some of them financial, a few purely academic, and others are ambitiously pursuing complete reinvention. All these projects are setting out to try things and see what sticks.  New ideas, lower costs  I predict innovative ideas based on Ethereum will improve upon existing systems. Over the next few years, there will be a maturation in the Ethereum ecosystem, and some projects will become more than just good ideas, going beyond proof of concept into the real world.  Ethereum will help create new models for various incumbent systems, including finance, which will see a shift within the next decade. This is because the costs of deploying new financial concepts will drop dramatically thanks to systems built with blockchains.  This is similar to what has happened with the Internet’s development over the past 20 years: low barriers of entry coupled with declining costs created immense opportunity for new digital systems. With the combination of a unit of account, a blockchain and smart contract capabilities, Ethereum has the potential to innovate across many industries.  In finance, this will be an exciting period of innovation. It will be an era of change comparable to the Medici's record keeping centuries ago, creating as it did the modern banking system.  What will result is a new digital asset-based economic paradigm, and Ethereum as a platform for experimentation is helping bring that about.
