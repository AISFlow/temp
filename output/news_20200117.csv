42403810,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpgc,1579298756,Plaintiffs Move to Combine Their Market-Manipulation Lawsuits Against Bitfinex and Tether,"Plaintiffs in three separate putative class action lawsuits against Bitfinex and Tether have moved to consolidate their cases, according to a Thursday court filing.      Court filings by David Leibowitz et al, Eric Young et al, and Bryan Faubus et al, accuse the sister companies of manipulating the crypto markets. Their cases share common threads,filings show, including allegations that Bitfinex and Tether manipulated the price of bitcoin and bitcoin futures in violation of federal law.      All three cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.      Defendants did not object to the plaintiffs' proposed consolidation, with Tether writing in a press statement Friday it “looks forward” to debunking the “fanciful accusations.”      “Tether will continue to defend the digital token ecosystem and the many contributions of the cryptocurrency community, and will not now or in the future pay any amount to settle plaintiffs' claims,” the statement said.      The consolidation sheds some light on Young’s decision last week to withdraw and refile in the Southern District of New York. At first unexplained, it now appears that the plaintiffs abandoned the original Western District of Washington jurisdiction so they could join the other two in New York.      Tether anticipated a fourth class action suit, filed by Joseph Ebanks on Thursday, may also join in.

42403827,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpwM,1579298431,Grasping Lightning: Mapping the Key Players in Bitcoin's Next Phase,"You might have heard of bitcoin's ""lightning network"" but don't know what's going on with it right now. Who are the mysterious big players behind this magical technology that allegedly solves all of bitcoin's problems?      Lightning is one of the most promising technologies in the space right now, even drawing in Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Given current technical constraints, blockchains don't support many users, let alone the world's population. Lightning could multiply the transactions possible, while making transactions faster (like a millisecond) and cheaper.      Nerds have eagerly been putting the technology to the test. A range of lightning games has come out, such as one channeling the hit game Fortnite. And it's possible to buy Domino's pizza and Amazon gift cards with this new internet money.      But while, yes, lightning sort of works, there's a lot of work to be done. The technology is still risky and not easy to use. Although the theory's there, how it plays out in practice remains to be seen.      Here's a breakdown of the big players across the globe tinkering with the underlying technology every day, trying to improve it so it doesn't ""suck"" anymore.    Bringing the idea to life    The lowest-level coders are working on so-called lightning implementations, the code that puts the payment network into practice. Each has its own approach to the network.      The best-known of these is LND, created by Lightning Labs, with CEO Elizabeth Starkat the helm. Dorsey invested in the firm early in 2018.      Behind the scenes, there are many more developers working on implementations such as Blockstream's c-lightning and France-based Acinq's Eclair. While the developers behind each of these softwares tend to focus on different features, and they're written in different programming languages, all three are interoperable, meaning transactions can be sent between them with no bumps. To this day, developers from these three groups continue to hold bi-weekly IRC chats to discuss future changes to the protocol specifications.      To confuse matters further, there are still other lightning implementations on the fringe. With a decentralized payment network, anyone can make their own version.      Rust-lightning is a security-minded implementation headed by Square Crypto engineer Matt Corallo, who's been writing bitcoin code since he was a teenager. Japan-based startup Nayuta has built a lightning implementation specifically geared toward the Internet of Things. As more and more devices, whether toasters or TVs, connect to the internet and gather data, these same devices may need to make tiny payments, too, to say, automatically charge an electric car, the company contends. And bitcoin's lightning may be the only payment system in the world that allows for payments that small.      None of these coders is flashy. They put out announcements about how they've successfully created ""multi-path payments"" or ""watchtowers"" from time to time. While clouded in esoteric tech-speak, these announcements essentially mean that the technology is improving, and hopefully getting easier to use.    Wallets    This is all happening in the background. But what about actually using lightning, even if it's risky?      Right now it's not easy. Most of the most-used wallets out there, such as Coinbase and Blockchain.info, don't support lightning payments yet because the technology is still experimental. (There are exceptions, such as Electrum, a long-standing light-client wallet that added support for lightning last year.)      For the most part, a parallel ecosystem of daredevil developers have been creating completely separate bitcoin wallets that allow users to send and receive lightning payments.      There's a lot to choose from. Acinq's mobile wallet Phoenix is one of the oldest and most-employed non-custodial wallets, meaning users have full control of their private keys.      Lightning desktop wallet Zap started as a one-person side project by young developer Jack Mallers. One feature of the wallet power users love is that it hooks up with what's known as a ""bitcoin node."" This stores every on-chain bitcoin transaction made in its 11 years, the most secure way of using bitcoin. Zap lets you make lightning transactions from your smartphone, while running one of these clunky full nodes at home.      Wallets like Breez and BlueWallet are taking different approaches to building a slicker interface for lightning.      And that's just the tip of the lighting bolt.    Getting lightning    All this assumes users already have bitcoin.      If they do, they can use one of these wallets to send to a lightning ""channel,"" like a separate specialized bitcoin account secured by a smart contract that lets you start making lightning payments.      But if users want to buy lightning-powered bitcoins directly with USD, skipping a step, they enter a highly experimental realm.      Most other major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase and Huobi don't have that capability yet while the technology is still maturing. BTCC, for example, told CoinDesk that ""[m]ost people do not understand Lightning Network at present. We will support Lightning Network a bit later to acquire more user adoption.”      Exchange Bitfinex is the largest exchange so far to adopt lightning, meaning users can deposit or withdraw payments in the experimental form of the digital currency. But this makes up a small overall percentage of its transactions so far. Meanwhile, Breez lets users in 35 countries buy and sell lightning directly with a credit card.      While adoption across bitcoin companies is minimal for now, the goal for many of these players on the vanguard fringe of bitcoin is that once lightning is mature enough, most bitcoin wallets and exchanges will absorb it.      If user experience challenges don't get in the way, lightning could one day become the dominant method of bitcoin payments. It offers cheaper and faster payments, after all.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/17/grasping-lightning-mapping-the-key-players-in-bitcoins-next-phase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa9f8c8275c304a0d09789a7a6da9a1f597bb521-1500x833.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403818,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpjZ,1579293007,The Prospect of Building a New International Monetary System Is Getting Real,"This is part of a series of op-eds previewing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. CoinDesk will be on the ground in Davos from Jan. 20–24 chronicling all things crypto at the annual gathering of the world’s economic and political elite. Follow along by subscribing to our pop-up newsletter, CoinDesk Confidential: Davos.      Jeremy Allaire is co-founder, chairman and CEO of Circle, which, with Coinbase, pioneered the open standards CENTRE Consortium and USD Coin (USDC) – a dollar-backed stablecoin used in millions of financial transactions around the world. He has also been named to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) High-Level Advisory Group on FinTech. The opinions here are his own.      When world leaders gather in Davos next week, they’ll confront an essential question: Can they seize the opportunity generated by years of innovative blockchain development to reshape the global economic order in a way that creates wealth and value for people around the world?      From the fall of Lehman Brothers to the ensuing Great Recession, the international monetary system has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at trying to build an economic system that works for everyone, but those efforts have fallen short.      It’s time to try something new.      Fortunately, from the ashes of the Great Recession arose the first fruits of a solution: a new kind of secure digital money with no centralized authority, built on an innovative new technology – blockchains. This breakthrough was first described in the bitcoin white paper, published without fanfare just six weeks after the collapse of Lehman.      Since then, computer scientists, cryptographers, technology entrepreneurs and a deeply inspired global community has committed itself to building a more open and inclusive financial system. These blockchain projects are still in their early days but are gaining momentum with increasing velocity and force as large nation-states, big tech companies and the broader crypto community begin to deliver technologies for digital money that will reshape the international monetary system in exciting and unpredictable ways.      Just look at ethereum and many of its competitors. They’re creating an economic operating system for the internet, designed to provide an open and immutable system of record-keeping, transaction processing and computation. And, like the internet, no corporation or government has complete control over these public blockchains – a critical element at a time of high mistrust in public and private institutions.      Public blockchains mean it’s now possible to represent important records and assets in a digital form and to codify, literally, the rules for their exchange and use through smart contracts. This cuts out intermediaries, reduces costs and offers near-perfect auditability. Public blockchains made it possible to create global stablecoins, entirely digital representations of either fiat-pegged or fiat-backed central bank money that can be used and exchanged over the open internet similar to how we can easily exchange digital content.      Stablecoins are so transformative they’ve enticed the world’s largest technology companies (Facebook, for example) and some of the most powerful countries (China, for example) to prioritize blockchain and crypto technologies. Stablecoins have also significantly expanded the range of use cases for public blockchains, which have been limited by the volatility of cryptocurrencies.    What Davos should know about stablecoins    Stablecoins have rapidly emerged as one of the most important foundational components of blockchain-based financial infrastructure.      Unlike proposed Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), most stablecoins are designed to operate on public or semi-public blockchains, inheriting many of the most powerful attributes of cryptocurrencies – open, global, interoperable use over the internet, and the ability to integrate and use such currencies within smart contracts.      They also inherit some of the risks of cryptocurrencies and cash. These include financial crime and money-laundering risk and consumer protection risk through irrevocable loss of funds. However, through sound regulation, public-private partnerships and thoughtful operation of stablecoin networks, these risks can be managed.      The first generation of stablecoins were issued and tightly controlled by individual private companies. A proliferation of private and competitive stablecoins seems unlikely to lead to the kinds of standards and governance that can allow this innovation to flourish and become widely accepted around the world. We believe the right model for stablecoins is a multi-stakeholder model without a single point of control or failure.      Stablecoins offer a tremendous opportunity for businesses and policy leaders. Neither camp alone can reshape the global economic order for good. The public and private sector must come together acknowledge change is necessary and set global standards that enable innovation at the same time they protect consumers and the soundness of the overall financial system.      The CENTRE Consortium, which Circle co-founded with Coinbase, is one successful example of this new model. CENTRE has set out to build a broad consortium of stakeholders from both the public and private sectors. CENTRE stablecoins are designed to be multi-issuer, multi-currency and multi-chain. The first CENTRE stablecoin, U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC), is now the fastest-growing stablecoin and the second-largest stablecoin in the market.    My WEF mission    At Davos, I’ll be catalyzing a discussion about stablecoins in general and how central banks, regulators and the private sector can work together to create standards for stablecoins backed by central bank reserve deposits and ensure that stablecoins benefit the public and comply with new, well designed regulatory regimes.    You can read a white paper that I wrote with more details herehttps://www.circle.com/marketing/pdfs/en/CIRCLE-stablecoins-wp-Jan2020.pdf.    This approach balances the need for open technical development and innovation (driven by the private sector) while also ensuring that such global stablecoin systems protect and benefit the public by meeting a reasonable standard for compliance.      Global stablecoins and public blockchains point us towards a new architecture for the global economy built for the digital age, creating a financial system that is more inclusive, efficient, innovative, safe, secure and that helps create wealth and value for all who participate.

42403812,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpia,1579292158,Ex-NFL Team Owner Intends to Plead Guilty to Running Unlicensed Money Transmitter,"Former “shadow banker” Reginald Fowler intends to plead guilty to charges of operating an unlicensed money transmission business during a court hearing Friday.      In a hearing before the Southern District of New York, Fowler, a former co-owner of the National Football League's Minnesota Vikings, changed his original plea from not guilty, essentially admitting to providing exchanges with banking services through his alleged operations with Crypto Capital, a payment processor that served exchanges including Bitfinex, QuadrigaCX and CEX.io.      While Fowler intends to plead guilty, the prosecution and defense must first come to an agreement regarding his financial liabilities. An FBI audit shows Fowler could have banked upwards of $371 million in 50-odd bank accounts.      Fowler did not accept all the terms of the plea deal in court. Specifically, he did not consent to forfeiting all $371 million, even if the accounts do not hold the full sum.      A trial date has been set for April 27. The prosecution expects a trial lasting two weeks, while defense believes all motions can be concluded within three days.      Additional charges of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud were dropped, according to Inner City Press’s Matthew Russell Lee, who first reported the news.      According to Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute, Fowler could be sentenced to no more than five years in prison and fined. Under the terms of his agreement, Fowler will not appeal or challenge any sentence set to, or below, that length of time.      Fowler is accused of directing “the ebb and flow of significant amounts of money” from various international bank accounts, often assisting crypto exchanges in skirting know-your-customer and anti-money laundering regulations.      CoinDesk reported that Fowler planned to change his plea last month.      Fowler allegedly co-founded the payment processor Crypto Capital with Israeli national Ravid Yosef. The two are accused of defrauding financial institutions by opening accounts on the pretense of serving real-estate clients, but instead storing funds on behalf of cryptocurrency exchanges.      According to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, the Panama-based firm processed hundreds of millions of dollars over its half-decade of existence. Crypto Capital was a key financier to an industry that has had trouble securing banking relationships with legacy firms.      Yosef has been indicted but remains at large.      Crypto exchange Bitfinex reportedly lost access to approximately $850 million banked with Crypto Capital after the company's accounts were frozen.      According to a subpoena to depose Crypto Capital executives, Fowler had opened several bank accounts holding Bitfinex’s funds under his name, rather than Crypto Capital's, in Poland.      Crypto Capital also stored funds for clients of QuadrigaCX, at one point the largest crypto exchange in Canada.

42403820,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpnV,1579288697,Canadian Regulatory Group Targets Crypto Exchanges Holding Users' Digital Assets,"Canada's top financial watchdog has told crypto exchanges they will be subject to securities law if they act as custodians to users' digital assets.      The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) said in guidance published Thursday the common exchange practice of custodying users' assets – ""merely providing users with a contractural right or claim to an underlying crypto asset"" – could subject them to securities legislation.      ""Whether a crypto asset has been immediately delivered to a Platform’s user is an important component in evaluating whether, and the extent to which, the transaction and the Platform are subject to securities legislation,"" according to the joint statement. The CSA is a group of the provincial securities regulators in Canada, which does not have a federal equivalent like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      The CSA said transactions without immediate delivery constitute derivatives sales. Even if the custodied asset is generally recognized as a commodity, such as bitcoin, it could be classified as the sale of debt or of an investment contract, a transaction that comes under the country's securities law.      Exchanges that facilitate ""immediate delivery"" will be exempt, according to the CSA. It's unclear what timeframe the group has in mind for a transaction to qualify under this exemption, said Pamela Draper, president and CEO of Canadian crypto exchange Bitvo.      The new regulatory requirements may have a significant impact on the exchange landscape. Exchanges that can't or don't comply could be pushed out of Canada, Draper said, leaving the field open to a handful of exchanges that are both willing and able to fit within a more comprehensive regulatory framework.      The guidance, which applies to exchanges based in Canada, or with Canadian users, is consistent with a consultation paper the CSA and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada published in March 2019, said Evan Thomas, a litigator with Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.      “Although it will depend on the specifics of each platform’s structure and operations, it seems likely that regulators will consider many custodial trading platforms to be subject to securities legislation,” Thomas added.    Protecting consumers    Canada has been rocked by two exchange scandals in the past year. Users of the Quadriga exchange were unable to recover more than $190 million worth of funds when founder Gerald Cotten died mysteriously in December 2018. Cotten had siphoned users' holdings to fund his own personal lifestyle, according to an Ernst & Young report.      In November, the British Columbia Securities Commission was forced to seize the Einstein exchange after users complained they couldn't access their funds. Amounting to somewhere between US$8 million and $10 million, accountancy firm Grant Thorton said the exchange's wallet had been almost entirely drained.      “It looks like [the CSA is] trying to capture every platform and I think they're trying to do that for consumer protection, to prevent another"" Quadriga or Einstein, Draper said.      Compelling users to custody their own assets could protect them from hacks like Quadriga or Einstein. But there are downsides. It could make trading less accessible to everyday users by forcing everyone to set up their own wallet, said Draper.      “The concern I would have is, not everyone, [not] every consumer transacting in the crypto space has their own wallet or is comfortable with their own wallet,"" she said.      But it could also signify that regulators lack confidence in the industry.      ""I am sympathetic to the regulators,"" tweeted Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures. ""They saw a wipeout of ~$200 [million] worth of retail deposits. Exchanges have a terrible history of mismanagement. Canada is saying: [T]he crypto industry cannot be trusted with custodial models.""

42403822,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpqS,1579282210,Davos Needs to Wake Up to the Ills of Centralization,"This is part of a series of op-eds previewing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. CoinDesk will be on the ground in Davos from Jan. 20–24 chronicling all things crypto at the annual gathering of the world’s economic and political elite. Follow along by subscribing to our pop-up newsletter, CoinDesk Confidential: Davos.      Michael J. Casey is the chief content officer of CoinDesk. The opinions here are his own.      As the world’s most influential and self-entitled gather in Davos, Switzerland, for next week’s World Economic Forum, a predictable set of problems are on their minds: climate change, political polarization, trade tensions and cyber-attacks top their list of worries, according to the WEF’s just-released Global Risks Survey.      Those are weighty issues. But if we look at them through the decentralization mindset encouraged by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, it’s hard not to conclude that elephants in rooms are being overlooked. It’s with those issues, the ones not being talked about, where the real important stuff lies.      The disintermediating, fragmenting and decentralizing impact of the internet has made the 21st century’s political and economic structure profoundly different from the previous one. But the Baby Boomers who run our governments and companies still tend to apply 20th century assumptions about centralized money and power. They fail to see how our outdated political and economic institutions are out of touch with this new reality, and how that explains society’s ever-waning trust in them. It’s a myopia that also means they often fail to recognize, much less understand, the alternative decentralized models quietly emerging from the developers building cryptocurrency, blockchain and digital identity technologies.      So, as I head to Davos with my CoinDesk colleagues for a week of reporting and speaking engagements, I want to contemplate some of the issues “Davos Man” might be missing.      It’s worth remembering the people for whom these issues most matter are not those cocktail-sipping elites but regular Joes and Joans. This year may well mark the most divisive U.S. election in decades. If our bickering leaders aren’t focused on these big themes, where does that leave us in four years’ time? We need these issues on the ballot.    China’s digital yuan    China is expected to launch a digital currency sometime this year. The question not being asked enough is: As this project grows – and likely many others from other countries and companies – what will it mean for the dollar-centric global economy and its multitudinous stakeholders?      How will digital fiat currencies impact global trade and capital flows? Do they pose a competitive threat to the dollar and, by extension, to U.S. economic power? What would such a transformation mean for how the international community tackles the big-ticket issues Davos elites worry about: petrodollar investments in carbon-rich assets, for example, or global trade tensions?      The digital yuan might seem like a superficial change, akin to a more advanced banknote or a state-run version of a mobile banking or payments app. But while China’s centrally managed approach to digital-currency technology is in some respects the antithesis of the decentralized model behind bitcoin, it is nonetheless a radical change.      Two things matter: One, a digital fiat currency will circulate without banks managing the flow and, two, it is programmable, which makes it much more powerful than analog currency. Marc Andreessen says “software is eating the world.” Money-as-software might just devour it.      A digital currency will enable the Chinese government to directly manage and monitor its users’ spending patterns. Putting aside the terrifying surveillance prospects behind this “panopticon” vision, this information-gathering power will greatly aid China in its international aspirations. Its economic response machine will be run by a far superior data-analytics system than anything employed by any other country.      A “programmable” yuan will provide the missing payment component that hundreds of Chinese blockchain and smart-contract projects need. It will enable autonomous machines, micropayment infrastructure management systems, smart cities and other ideas the West will struggle to keep up with.      As I’ve argued elsewhere, currency programmability, when interoperable with other countries’ fiat digital currencies, could also enable Chinese companies and their foreign partners to do a direct runaround of the dollar-based trade system.      Currently, the yuan occupies an immaterial amount of cross-border trade and reserve asset holdings. But as this technology poses alternatives to the dollar and if China aggressively inserts its version into investment projects in Africa, for example, or into its 65-country Belt and Road Initiative, its international usage could grow rapidly.      Recently, a Harvard-MIT simulation game found that digital fiat currencies could quash America’s capacity to impose sanctions on rogue states. But the issue goes wider: If non-dollar digital fiat lets anyone bypass the intermediating U.S. banks that U.S. regulators lean on to catch international criminals, why will anyone use banks for cross-border money movements at all? Where does that leave Wall Street, that engine of American economic power?      Some people, including former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo, have recognized this threat to U.S. economic leadership. But Chinese digital currency dominance does not appear to be on many leaders’ radars – it’s certainly not featuring in the Democratic primary presidential debates.      So, come on, Davos, let’s talk about it.    Digital privacy    To be fair, privacy in the internet age, defined as the threat to our online personal data, will probably get a decent examination at Davos 2020.      The Cambridge Analytica story, Edward Snowden’s unveiling of the NSA’s citizen-snooping system and the growing awareness that Silicon Valley behemoths such as Google are managing our lives, has put this issue front and center. It deserves to be.      The problem is the structural factors behind this dangerous surveillance capitalism system are poorly understood.      Most political reactions to the drumbeat of stories about data abuse by Facebook and Google amount to leaders tut-tutting at these companies, occasionally fining them and demanding they just stop being bad. Few realize that, essentially, they can’t stop being bad. These centralized entities, with their closed, non-interoperable “walled gardens” of data, have built their entire business models – and therefore their shareholders’ profit expectations – on surreptitiously and systematically extracting information about human lives.      The other problem is the ad-hoc efforts to change these businesses’ behavior clashes with other demands placed upon them.      Witness the contradiction in lawmakers’ critiques of the Facebook-founded Libra digital currency project. On the one hand, they demanded it protect users’ privacy but on the other they demanded it maintain all the monitoring necessary to prevent money laundering. Or look at how Facebook’s critics simultaneously demand its social media platform remove disturbing hate-speech content and that it also cease arbitrarily censoring and “de-platforming” users. Without understanding the problem, people can’t see how holding both of these positions is untenable.      There are two approaches to this issue: a political one, such as an antitrust order to constrain the internet giants, or a technological one, in which social media platforms move to a decentralized structure of user control (one potentially where zero-knowledge proofs or other advanced forms of encryption enable verification without revealing identities).      Let’s discuss these options, Davos.    Disinformation    You thought fake news was a problem. You ain’t seen nothing yet.      As Arif Khan writes in this pre-Davos opener for CoinDesk, fake news is going on steroids.      With people such as Jordan Peele using clever stunts to highlight the problem, “deepfakes” – in which image manipulation technology is making it increasingly difficult for people to detect reality-altering changes to a digital video or image – are starting to get people’s attention.      Yet, the full extent of how much society depends on the glue of trustworthy information is greatly underappreciated. The foundation of our democracy, of our legal system, of our business relationships and of everything else in between is at stake when the truth cannot be verified.      How do we get ahead of this when artificial intelligence is progressing so rapidly and when information is no longer delivered to us through central filters?      A solution will require a combination of tools like AI detection software, watermarking and blockchain-based tracking of digital media provenance.      It also requires stakeholders at technology companies, media organizations and government bodies to jointly establish standards for those technologies so we can all agree on how we’ll re-establish the integrity of the information we rely on.      This is an urgent problem, one tailor-made for a mountain-town gathering of money and power.      Let’s look outside the bubble. Let’s become inquisitive. Let’s abandon rigid, outdated ways of thinking. Let’s say goodbye to know-it-all Davos Man, because clearly he doesn’t.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

42383195,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uVMl,1579279519,SEC: Cash-Strapped Telegram Launched 2018 Token Sale to Pay for Servers,"Telegram launched a 2018 token sale because it was ""short on cash"" to pay for servers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said.       The claim, made in the regulator’s latest document dump in its ongoing securities case against Telegram, shows for the first time the core of the SEC’s argument: that the token sale was merely a substitute for equity financing.      At the time of the sale, Telegram framed it as financing for a next-generation blockchain that would be faster and more versatile than its predecessors. The documents released Thursday show Telegram CEO Pavel Durov had been looking for ways to raise money, acknowledged the need to pay for equipment and considered an equity sale before going the more unconventional route.      The offering went on to raise $1.7 billion in early 2018. The SEC sued the company in October of last year, claiming the tokens, known as grams, were unregistered securities and demanded Telegram halt the launch of the TON blockchain. The first hearing in the case is scheduled for next month.      Until recently, Telegram was funded by Durov himself, according to the documents submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.      “In 2017, Durov therefore needed ‘cash’ to buy Messenger’s servers and pay for related services. He considered selling traditional voting equity but decided against it, ‘concerned that [it] would affect the company’s integrity its values, and [its] ethos,’” the regulator said in a motion for summary judgment. “Nor did Telegram wish to start charging users or selling ads, believing that doing so would hamper its ability to expand its user base and keep up with competitors.""      The SEC provided message exchange logs between Durov and Alexander Tamas, founder of Vy Capital and previously a partner at DST Capital, a stakeholder in Russian social network Vkontakte, founded by Durov.      On August 14, 2017, Tamas offered Durov the opportunity to buy $25 million worth of shares in an entity whose name is redacted from the document. Durov responded that the time was not right.      “At this point Telegram needs cash to keep buying more servers, but I can start considering such ideas after we solve our cash requirements,” he said.      In response, Tamas suggested he consider fundraising. Then Durov told Tamas he had decided to “abandon plans for VCs … unless somebody throws some insane offer our way.” An “insane offer” would be $500 million for 10 percent of Telegram or $1 billion for 20 percent.      On Jan. 16, 2018, Durov emailed an undisclosed person at investment bank Credit Suisse saying that Telegram had been contemplating raising equity but then decided to go with a cryptocurrency plan, the documents show.      To be sure, whatever the initial motive, after the sale Telegram contributed resources to building TON and released code for the blockchain in September. Investors received links to the key generator to generate their wallet for the future grams. Telegram also had to get help from its unofficial partner, TON Labs, the entity helmed by the TON investors and working on tools for TON developers.      According to the SEC, Telegram’s financial services specialist Shyam Parekh said during a call with Anchorage, a U.S.-based crypto custodian Telegram wanted to partner with: “Because the Telegram team is so stretched (TON Labs has more engineers than Telegram). They have been partners of Telegram for 6 months and helping testing from day one.”    Not validators, just investors    The SEC also said Telegram employees considered grams securities and used traditional capital market terms to explain the logic of the offering.      Telegram employee Shyam Parekh, a former Morgan Stanley banker, told an investor they “had the right to 72,835,916.68 Grams and that ‘the Fund has clear title to such securities,’ ‘will be entitled to receive... Grams when they are issued,’ and that ‘the securities are not pledged,’” the SEC said.      The TON investors themselves considered grams securities and bought them not to use on the TON blockchain as validators (TON is a proof-of-stake network) but purely as an investment, the SEC argued.      “Parekh analogized the staking of Grams to be selected as a TON Blockchain validator to stock lending,” the agency wrote, adding that Telegram didn’t ask the investors if they planned to act as validators on the network.      The SEC also said Telegram never contacted the regulator before the token offering started and only filed for an exemption from registration requirements under Regulation D after the agency’s staff learned about the offering and contacted the company.      During a deposition conducted by SEC lawyer Jorge Tenreiro on Jan. 7 of this year, Durov confirmed the company didn’t try to contact the SEC before the private placement of grams started. Telegram was still doing “research and exploratory work” at that time, he said.      “I don't believe we reached out to the Securities and Exchange Commission at that point, as we thought it was too early due to the fact that we didn't know specifically what we would be doing,” Durov said. He also confirmed Telegram hadn’t contacted the SEC by the time he signed the first purchase agreement for grams.       According to the SEC, the regulator learned about the offering on Jan. 8, 2018, and a few weeks later tried to connect with Telegram’s legal counsel. The following month, Telegram’s lawyer from the law firm of Skadden, Arps emailed the SEC and a Regulation D filing for the first sale round was submitted on Feb 13, 2018.       However, after that, Telegram communicated with the regulator extensively, the company said in its own motion for summary judgment. According to the filing, since Feb. 6, 2018, Telegram engaged in three in-person presentations for the SEC staff, nine phone calls and multiple email exchanges. The company also voluntarily produced documents to the SEC.      Telegram maintained in its motion that the tokens are not securities.      “Grams will not entitle purchasers to any income, any dividends, or any interests in Telegram ... nor do they resemble stock or any other form of equity,” the company said.",NEGATIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/17/sec-cash-strapped-telegram-launched-2018-token-sale-to-pay-for-servers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d05f4036333f8e9a44c3a278f4d28b231a080a44-1200x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383205,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uVab,1579279427,Block.One Will Not Launch Its Social Network on EOS,"In June when Block.one, the company behind the largest initial coin offering (ICO) in history, announced its Facebook-challenging social network, Voice, it promised the blockchain would run on the EOS mainnet. Plans have changed.      Voice is meant to be a new kind of social network, one with crypto built in and one that defeats bots by verifying the identity of every single account. The company went silent about Voice for months after the summer announcement but then, in December, it revealed a launch date for Voice of Feb. 14.      With this announcement came additional details, such as a frequently asked questions page on the Voice website that revealed the new application would run on a private deployment of EOSIO software. In fact, it's non-committal about ever running on EOS. The FAQ reads as follows:    ""While Voice is in beta and a highly iterative state, it will be run on a purpose-made EOSIO blockchain. In time, we would like Voice to leverage the EOS Public Blockchain, and potentially others that can meet the performance and governance demands of Voice.""    This ran counter to an unequivocal statement in the June press announcement of Voice: ""Block.one will launch the Voice platform on the EOS Public Blockchain."" Further showing its commitment to running on EOS, Block.one reserved 3.3 million eos of RAM in late May on the mainnet.      While Block.one never confirmed this, most watchers interpreted this as a stake to run the computing power behind Voice. On EOS, users lock up RAM on the blockchain in order to reserve some of the blockchain's computing power.      CoinDesk asked Block.one to explain what changed between June and December, but a spokesperson declined to elaborate further.      It's worth noting that Block.one builds software but other organizations run it. It created the EOSIO software and a coalition of organizations around the world launched what has come to be thought of as the EOS mainnet.      By market cap, it is ranked as the eighth-biggest blockchain in the world, according to Messari, but it's not the only deployment of the open source software. Telos, Worbli and the newly launched Lynx are other deployments of the EOSIO software.      Sharif Bouktila, CEO of EOS Dublin, which has served as a block producer on EOS and other EOSIO blockchains, told CoinDesk he remains longterm bullish on EOS despite the uncertainty around Block.one's biggest project since EOSIO itself.      ""There hasn’t been a decision that I can see but if Block.one didn’t need to use the EOS mainnet for its apps it would raise serious questions as to why and who else should use it,"" he told CoinDesk over Telegram.    Possible explanations    EOS has had performance issues that have become acute since last summer.      In September, CoinDesk reported on doubts about whether the EOS blockchain is run by companies that prioritize technology over speculative profits. Then in November it became bogged down by a smart contract called EIDOS which rewarded users for making as many transactions as possible.      In late November, Dan Larimer, the architect of EOSIO, delineated mistakes made in the assumptions governing applications built for EOS meant to optimize computing resource allocations. Not long after, the company announced Voice would start off on a private deployment of Larimer's software.      Aaron Cox, of Greymass, which runs a back-up block producer for EOS as well as on other chains, told CoinDesk he's come to support the decision strategically. There's competition for resources on EOS as it stands and that would be a distraction for a brand-new application taking on Facebook, one of the biggest companies in the world.      ""Those who invested in EOS because they heard Voice was coming to it are probably the ones who are most disappointed that it won't immediately [run on the mainnet]– but I think most who are involved in the tech side of things accept that this path forward makes some sense,"" Cox told us.    Fork options    Douglas Horn runs Telos, which is arguably the leading EOSIO alternative chain out there. He's optimistic Voice could be at least partially run on his chain.      Horn launched Telos with a copy of the EOS genesis block, but one that capped token allocations for each account in order to prevent domination by whales. He noted that Block.one finally claimed its allocation on the chain last year, suggesting it might be interested in running applications there.      ""There’s no strong indication of what their plans are exactly, but if they are looking for a public EOSIO chain to integrate with Voice I expect Telos would be their top choice,"" he wrote.      One ICO investor who had grown dissatisfied with Block.one last year and has come around in recent months, Shane Calfee, believes Voice will take advantage of multiple EOSIO blockchains to the benefit of all users. “This will more than likely be the beginnings of IBC (inter-blockchain communication), which is the holy grail of the blockchain world,"" he said.      But there's no guarantee Voice will ever run on anyone's chain but Block.one's. The language from the FAQ is non-committal, as multiple sources pointed out including EOS Dublin’s Bouktila, who noted there's no way for anyone to know what Block.one will do.      ""I'm hopeful that Voice could be a bridge from EOS to some of the other chains and projects, but the reality is we are all in 'wait and see' mode,"" he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/17/blockone-will-not-launch-its-social-network-on-eos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0264cc3e88ac18a16403cd4a4891b4bb1ed0f83-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As part of this effort, Manor allegedly ""darkened his hair [and] grew a beard"" out of concerns his actual identity might be toxic to the company.      In a statement, SEC Market Abuse Unit co-chief Joseph Sansone said investors should always learn about the identities and backgrounds of those raising funds.      “As alleged in our complaint, Manor’s brazen scheme to conceal his identity and criminal history deprived investors of essential information and allowed defendants to take over $30 million from investors’ pockets,"" he said.

Called Blockset, the new offering – announced Friday – is described as a blockchain data integration platform with a suite of tools that allow coders to create ""enterprise-grade"" blockchain applications. These bring the ability to automatically pull in on-chain data via an API and, BRD says, conduct transactions in ""near real-time"" on multiple blockchains.      Nodes can be hosted ""out of the box,"" BRD says. Blockset supports bitcoin, bitcoin cash, XRP, hedera and ethereum at launch, with more to be added during the year.      ""Blockset ... will fundamentally realign BRD’s business model for the high growth demands of the financial services and banking industry worldwide,"" according to the company.      The suite has been under evaluation in private pre-release by a number of firms including Ripple, SBI Holdings and KPMG, according to the announcement, with BRD aiming to soon bring in partners to help grow adoption.      All in all, the firm says the benefits of its new product include cutting hosting and developments costs, reducing build time and potentially the promise of new enterprise use cases for blockchain.      Around 90 percent of major banks are now exploring blockchain and cryptocurrency, said Adam Traidman, BRD's CEO and co-founder. “That is why we developed our own proprietary platform (Blockset) which banks, financial services, and large crypto companies will now be able to leverage to accelerate their time to market and deliver enterprise solutions to scale on a global basis for a fraction of the development costs.”      In October, BRD received a $750,000 investment from Ripple’s Xpring alongside a new partnership that was said to target the creation of ""the internet of value.” As part of arrangement, BRD was to integrate XRP and start building on Xpring’s developer platform.",POSITIVE,XRP,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | XRP,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/17/ripple-backed-crypto-wallet-brd-launches-blockchain-toolbox-for-enterprise-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/794849b1f106239efcd441b7bd3d86ef895a36b7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383202,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uVVZ,1579272467,Swedish Crypto Exchange BTCX Plans IPO in 2020,"One of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges in Scandinavia wants to go public later this year, hoping it will enable traditional investors to participate in ""new finance.""      Oskar Soderstrom, CEO of Stockholm-based BTCX, confirmed to CoinDesk it is looking to deliver an initial public offering (IPO) before the end of Q3 2020. Corporate financial advisory firm Eminova Partners has been engaged to help file the offering, expected to take place in Sweden.      ""Our aim is to bring bitcoin to the masses and to bridge the gap between new and traditional finance,"" Soderstrom wrote in an email. ""Being in new finance, a listing of the company via a traditional route feels like a natural progression to achieve that goal.""      Launching in 2012, BTCX supports trading in bitcoin and ethereum, with the Swedish krona and the euro as fiat funding options. It also features an ""express"" exchange facility, enabling transfers between digital and fiat currencies that complete in a matter of minutes. Users have to complete KYC/AML checks before they can use the firm's services.      Following the collapse of the ICO market in 2018, cryptocurrency companies have increasingly turned to more traditional means to raise funds. IPOs, which are heavily regulated and generally accessible to most forms of investors, allow companies to broaden their appeal and enhance their reputation among more skeptical elements of the financial world.      ""Choosing a traditional route could add additional transparency to an industry traditionally shaded in the eyes of the public,"" Soderstrom said. With blockchain-based alternatives still in a phase of ""immaturity,"" he added, a public offering would also satisfy any concerns raised by Sweden's chief financial regulator, the Finansinspektionen (FI).      There are some disadvantages to taking the IPO route, however. Investors can still lose money, as when the share price for cryptocurrency mining rig maker Canaan dropped 40 percent weeks after an IPO raised $90 million. Similarly, Chinese mining giant Bitmain had to step back from plans for an IPO in Hong Kong after profits dropped precipitously in the latter part of 2018.      Despite this, Soderstrom is confident that if managed correctly the BTCX IPO will be a success. ""We believe the traditional financial markets will be very interested in Sweden’s older crypto broker being listed,"" he said.

42383213,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uVgt,1579265860,Bitcoin Falls Back After Briefly Breaking $9k Resistance,"View  Bitcoin has all but erased the day's gains after pushing past the $9,000 resistance level this morning.  A significant move back above $9,000 could trigger liquidations and a possible short squeeze across the market.  Other cryptocurrencies continue to recoup losses from late 2019.    Bitcoin's bulls have failed to make a solid move above $9,000, having briefly topped the level earlier on Friday.      After an indecisive Thursday, prices started their rise during the Asian trading day. Based on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the top cryptocurrency by market cap moved from just under $8,700 at 01:00 UTC to $9,009 around 10:00 UTC – the third attempt to break through this morning.      At press time, prices had dropped back to $8,841 – a gain of 1.05 percent over 24 hours.      “$9,000 would be a test as it is seen as a key resistance level, both from a technical and psychological point of view,"" wrote Simon Peters, eToro analyst and crypto expert, in a note Friday. ""Such an increase would also see the price challenge the current 200-day moving average, a strong indication that bitcoin is entering into bullish territory.""      He added: ""However, there is always the risk of retracement if the community thinks bitcoin is overbought.""      The recent rally has not just bitcoin-only movement. Most other cryptocurrencies have also experienced strong gains in the past 24 hours. Coins in the top 10, including ether, XRP and Binance coin, are also coming close to two-month highs.      There are also some outliers. Following the launch of Binance futures Thursday, ethereum classic is now trading at just below $10, the highest since October 2018.      This strong surge in alternative cryptocurrencies has had a slight effect on the broader dynamics of the asset class. Bitcoin dominance – the coin's share of the total cryptocurrency market – has dropped from nearly 2 percent since last Friday.      Bitcoin currently makes up approximately 66 percent of the total market, according to CoinMarketCap. Declining dominance suggests traders are placing proportionally less value into bitcoin, attracted to the possibility of making better returns from bets outside of the original cryptocurrency.      Should the bulls be able to push bitcoin firmly back above the $9,000 threshold, the market may face a short squeeze – a sharp rise in a particular asset's price following a series of mass liquidations.      There's some precedent for this. In the space of a few days at the beginning of April last year, bitcoin increased by more than $1,000 after finally moving past the long-fought-over $4,200 resistance line.      Data collected by crypto analytics site Skew show that the April move caused more than $500 million worth of short liquidations on BitMEX (see chart below). According to CoinGecko, BitMEX’s BTC/USD derivatives volumes have increased over the past seven days. Daily volumes were approaching $3.5 billion at press time, more than a billion dollars higher than last Friday.      Helped along by the hype surrounding Facebook's Libra coin, the April move triggered a bull run that ultimately took bitcoin up to $13,000 by the end of June 2019. Looking at prices today, it's possible that should a short squeeze happen soon, the stars could align for a second time.

The product, called Civic Wallet, will let users carry cryptocurrencies and fiat currency on their own devices and uses Civic's facial recognition systems to secure the system. Because Civic holds none of the keys or currencies, the clients and MSB endpoints will use the wallet as a sort of piping. Lingham said his product uses Civic's Secure Identity Ecosystem to reduce dependence on complex keys.      Because it uses facial recognition, there are no seed phrases and restoring your wallet is as simple as looking at your phone.

42383204,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uVY5,1579251600,2019's DeFi Boom Raises New Questions for Tax Filing Season,"The decentralized finance (DeFi) boom of 2019, leading to over $785 million in locked crypto assets, is already making accountants dizzy.      If you lock up bitcoin or ether in exchange for a synthetic asset or a stablecoin, as nearly a dozen projects and platforms today allow, is that a trade or merely a temporary reorganizing of the original asset?      Cryptio CEO Antoine Scalia, of the accounting startup that received a small investment from ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin’s ConsenSys, said there’s no clear answer yet.      “The challenges will be how to account for all the use cases in 2020,” Scalia said. “The more complex transactions and assets are, the more complex the accounting is.”      That’s why firms such as Dragonfly Capital and Winklevoss Capital, the latter owned by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss of the Gemini exchange, invested $5 million in startups like TaxBit. TaxBit CEO Austin Woodward said so far “thousands” of users have signed up for the 2020 tax season, including a few exchanges.      Dragonfly Capital co-founder Alex Pack said connecting automated software to an exchange account could create additional privacy risks in the case of a cloud breach, which is why the firm invested in TaxBit’s experienced team.      “There are a lot of attacks on blockchain around anonymity or pseudonymity that rely on knowing a lot of the addresses between various exchanges,” Pack said. “That’s why we would only trust something like TaxBit … which comes from the business-to-business, security-focused mindset.”      He added the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is being “heavy-handed” when it comes to staking and DeFi products. Because there are no clear categories for the experimental assets, prudent DeFi users record everything from wallet addresses to open source code links in case the IRS comes knocking. That’s why these new compliance tools record and aggregate data across various networks.      “Our software offers real-time monitoring, because we have the API connections. We’re pulling in data as you trade, at least daily,” TaxBit’s Woodward said. “We’re releasing a lot of functionality around tax optimization. Recommending trades that could give users the most beneficial tax answer.”      So far, Woodward said DeFi users that used MakerDAO loans and other financial products beyond exchanges need to enter transaction details manually, relying on support from TaxBit’s chat hotline with tax attorneys and CPAs (Certified Public Accountants).    Unclear requirements    Both of the above-mentioned startups are working with clients to improve their systems’ ability to automatically flag potentially taxable events in the DeFi ecosystem.      As for Cryptio, which is strictly focused on serving businesses and doesn’t offer a TurboTax-style option for retail users like TaxBit, Scalia said his team is helping clients that used DeFi products to record information related to every smart contract the asset touched along the way.      “The exchange of the ETH that I’m depositing on the Compound smart contract for the c-ETH in my wallet could be seen as a trade. This [compliance standard] is unknown,” Scalia said, referring to the lending platform Compound, which uses synthetic crypto assets. “You have to be able to say, ‘Here is all the smart contract activity and transactions that led to the creation of this synthetic asset.’”      CoinDesk reached out to the team at MakerDAO, DeFi’s most popular loan platform, about the accounting challenges presented by leaderless services and will update the article if we hear back.      In part because the accounting requirements are so unclear, a Credit Karma survey found just 0.04 percent of Americans reported their crypto transactions in their 2018 taxes, compared to an estimated 4 percent of the population saying they used crypto. This is expected to change since the IRS issued a crypto-oriented guidance update in 2019.      Pack, Scalia and Woodward all agreed tax reporting is a major barrier to crypto adoption. People don’t know how to use the technology without the headache of so much paperwork. As such, these startups see their role as enabling the next wave of mainstream, compliant usage.      “My thesis is that within the next few tax seasons, the number of [people reporting crypto on their taxes] will be 100 times larger,” Dragonfly’s Pack said. “That hasn’t even been factored in yet. … I think figuring out how to [definitively] do accounting for DeFi is still several years out.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MKR | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/17/2019s-defi-boom-raises-new-questions-for-tax-filing-season,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c25e68e30da27ad0bcca4384d7e77186deb805f-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Included in the suite are advanced order types, charting and analytics as well as access to a feature allowing users to create algorithms for bot trading.      TT users eligible to trade on Deribit will be able to access all listed products, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures, perpetual and options contracts. Dutch-based (for another month) Deribit, founded in 2016, is now the fifth crypto-only exchange that TT supports, alongside BitMEX, CoinFLEX, Coinbase and Bakkt.      TT’s vice president of cryptocurrencies, Michael Unetich, said demand for crypto derivatives was strong in regions such as the U.S., Asia and Europe.      ""We hope to provide trading access to the highest volume derivatives exchanges in the world. CME is one leading derivatives venue, while others are located in Asia,"" Unetich said.      Trading Technologies creates professional trading software, infrastructure and data solutions for a wide variety of users including proprietary traders, brokers, money managers, chartered tax advisors (CTAs), hedge funds, commercial hedgers and risk managers. Traditional financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, stock exchanges like the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Europe’s largest derivatives exchange Eurex also use the 25-year-old firm’s tools.    Exploding options market    Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner of Kenetic, a Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm, said TT’s connection to Deribit was a “massive show of confidence” for the “exploding” options market.      “TT’s long-credible history and impressive user base combined with Deribit’s experience as one of the first crypto options platform is an exciting match that should significantly increase volumes over time,” Chu said.      Commenting on the Asia-Pacific region for retail investors, Chu said the TT and Deribit partnership would “expand the options markets for Asian traders through a familiar and trusted platform.”      Indeed, the BTC options market saw a large amount of activity on January 14, according to data provider Skew, with Deribit outstripping the competition to reach the highest amount of options traded in nearly two months. That activity has since cooled while the spot price of BTC is currently changing hands for $8,722, CoinDesk BPI data show.      Su Zhu, co-founder at Singapore-based crypto investment firm Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk the new options exchanges such as OKEx, CME and Bakkt are driving more volume to Deribit as the central primary liquidity venue for options.      “This month is shaping up to be the largest volume month ever for options,” Zhu said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/17/deribit-using-new-trading-tools-to-capture-exploding-options-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53cefa12bcbdf7da40650d30f5b43a579c55eaa5-1500x906.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
