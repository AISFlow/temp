42382968,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZFf,1572997541,US Congress Weighs Bill Spelling Out CFTC's Crypto Derivatives Oversight,"The U.S. Congress will soon vote on a bill providing new information about the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) authority over the cryptocurrency derivatives markets.  A provision in the 2019 CFTC Reauthorization Act clarifies how the regulator would collect information on digital commodities contracts and commodity swaps. The bill is heading to the House of Representatives for a floor vote after being passed unanimously by the House Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC.  If passed, the bill would be the first to place Congressionally-mandated, digital commodity-specific requirements on the CFTC. What’s more, according to the provision’s writer, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D.-NY), it has already become the first crypto derivatives legislation in history to make it past committee.  ""It’s time for Congress to get smart about crypto and create an integrated approach to regulating digital currencies,"" Maloney said in a statement. ""This provision is an essential first step in our efforts to close the gap in regulation of crypto-assets in the derivatives market, fight manipulation and detect fraud.""  The provision itself is short, saying the CFTC will “adopt rules detailing the content and availability of trade and trader data and other information the board of trade must be able to access” from contract markets underpinned by digital commodities.  A nearly-identical subsequent paragraph places the same requirements on swap execution facilities.  In response to a request for comment, a CFTC spokesperson sent CoinDesk a statement by Chairman Heath Tarbert, who said he commended the Agriculture Committee on passing bipartisan legislation.  ""The sound regulation of our derivatives markets, which see more than $4 trillion in notional activity each day, is critical to the health of the U.S. economy and the pocketbook of every American,"" he said, adding:  ""I look forward to working with members of both parties in both chambers to see a bill through to completion.""

42431152,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0M5h,1572995814,WATCH: What Are the Main Takeaways From Deribit's $1.3 Million Flash-Crash?,"Delphi Digital Co-Founder Yan Liberman joined CoinDesk’s Brad Keoun on Monday, Nov. 4, to talk about last week's flash crash on Deribit, a Netherlands-based cryptocurrency exchange, and the outlook for bitcoin.  (The following is an edited transcript.) Brad Keoun: We're here today with Yan Liberman. He's co-founder of Delphi Digital, which is a research firm founded in August 2018 focusing on cryptocurrency markets. Previously, Yan was an associate with Deutsche Bank and also an equity research associate with Bloomberg LP. He first dipped his toes into the crypto markets a few years ago. And loved it so much that he decided to start his own research shop. Yan, thank you so much for joining us today. We want to first start with some of the news in this market that came late last week. We had some pretty serious glitches on some of the bigger cryptocurrency exchanges. Can you tell us, from your perspective, what happened there? Yan Liberman: Sure, it seems like there was a mispricing with the Deribit index. Which caused the index price to shoot down about 2000 points to 7200. And because all the derivatives contracts are priced off of that index, it caused this massive flood of liquidations where, you know, a lot of longs got liquidated because the price tanked. And so because of this massive liquidation, they have to do about $1.3 million worth of reimbursements for all those. BK: What about that $1.3 million? That's a lot of money to pay for what appears to just be a snafu. What do you think about that? YL: Yeah, it is. And they're actually also paying it off their balance sheet. Not, you know, through their insurance fund. Which makes it considerably more painful in that respect. BK: And what does that say? I mean, does that show how competitive this market is, for the business of exchanges, or does it show how profitable this industry is? YL: I think it's a combination of all that. You have to realize that there's a lot of value, and in signaling that you do value your customers. And so by giving confidence to future customers knowing that, you know, even if some kind of glitch happens, the reversals will take place. And so the immediate monetary cost is huge, but I think the long-term value and then the signal that provides certainly makes it worth it. And I'm guessing that, you know, they kind of thought about it the same way. BK: Is that something that traders really value? I mean on the one hand I've been on one of these Deribit Telegram group chats and people are pretty upset. But is that something you think will help to maintain customer loyalty? YL: I think so. I mean, it's hard to judge completely on a case-by-case basis. I'm sure there are other factors like liquidity and just execution and things of that nature, rules, also dictate where customers go. But I definitely think it adds a a strong element of confidence, and it also proves that you know they're doing well enough that they can support that. And so I think it definitely makes sense. There's a lot of value, and I'm sure their customers kind of feel the same way. BK: Now Yan, Delphi Digital and your team there have just published your monthly outlook report. A lot of people have various predictions for how high bitcoin could go. And I'm just curious, based on the past couple weeks of trading and maybe looking at some of the technical indicators, have we received any new information on whether bitcoin prices could go a lot lower? YL: I don't think we'll see a dip below that low-7's level. We haven't really seen any long-term sellers, which would normally, you know, represent some capitulation. When that starts to happen, you really need a lot of new money to offset all that selling. So most of the recent price action has been dictated by short-term holders and traders. What we see with bitcoin is price begets volume begets price, and this is a very cyclical situation. What we can't really account for is this momentary influx of demand that can come from a wide variety of sources, and whenever that happens, you have all the individual traders now that have a lot of cash on the sidelines and just basically looking at it to get the best entry possible. That's where we will start to see these really, really aggressive moves up. And there are a decent amount of shorts that exists in the space just because you have higher convexity on a short trade. That can often act as fuel for short squeezes, and you'll see huge liquidations kind of going the other way. So I think we've certainly bottomed.

42431147,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Lvh,1572989445,"Filecoin, But Forever: Arweave Raises $5 Million to Build Out 'Permaweb'","A startup drawing on ancient history for modern-day inspiration has raised $5 million to decentralize the permanent storage of the world’s information.  “The big goal is to build this Library of Alexandria that just never forgets the valuable knowledge in the world,” Arweave founder Sam Williams told CoinDesk in an interview Tuesday.  The Berlin-based startup is getting fresh funding from a trio of prominent crypto investors: Andreessen Horowitz, Multicoin Capital and Union Square Ventures. The token-based funding round involved the sale of Arweave’s AR token.  Arweave makes decentralized permanent storage possible by relying on “a new blockchain-like data structure called the blockweave,” according to technical documentation published by the startup on Tuesday.  The Arweave protocol undergirds what the startup refers to as the permaweb, an “array of data, websites, and decentralised applications” hosted in perpetuity. In fact, users “pay for a couple hundred years of storage up front,” Williams said, based on laws of declining data storage costs. The Arweave mainnet launched in June 2018.  Miners are paid AR tokens to offer up their computers’ unused storage space, using what Arweave calls a “Proof-of-Access (PoA)” algorithm similar to Proof-of-Work.  Notably, the permaweb is accessible via normal web browsers like Chrome, Brave and others.  “Arweave is live and working today as promised, which says a lot,” investor Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital told CoinDesk, adding:  “There are clear and immediate applications for permanence on the Web today in government, media, classrooms, courtrooms, and more. I expect developers to leverage the Permaweb as another critical component in the web3 stack, and to build new applications that augment existing services or create entirely new ones.”  Roughly 100 apps have already been built on the Arweave platform, with projects ranging from social forums to article publishing to sticky notes. In a press statement, the company said over 45,000 objects were committed to the permaweb in October alone. To date some 157,000 transactions have been committed to the network.  “People are experimenting with almost all of the basic web services,” Williams told CoinDesk. “We would like to see them grow into bigger projects in the future.”  To grow those “seeds,” Williams said the $5 million funding round will go primarily toward developer outreach efforts. The 12-person team is adding two employees soon and will continue to hire, he added. Arweave is also in the process of expanding to the U.S. as it ramps up its commercialization efforts.  The funding round – Arweave’s first aside from a limited token sale in 2018 – puts the company in the same breath as other decentralized file storage systems such as Filecoin, Sia and Storj.  “We’re attempting to do something totally different,” Williams said. “We’re looking at permanent storage.”  Permanence poses problems, of course, a point that Albert Wenger and Dani Grant of Union Square Ventures pointed out in a blog post published Tuesday.  ""Definitely not all ways of applying Arweave will be positive. All technology can be used for good and for bad, starting with humanity’s earliest technology, fire,"" they wrote. ""Sam and the team at Arweave have given a lot of thought to that and have from the start designed features, including a democratic process where participants collectively decide on the network’s content policies, to help address this issue.""  Arweave's long-term vision is admittedly grand. Williams says he hopes the protocol one day unseats data storage companies like Amazon Web Services and even national archives. Said Williams:  “We are looking to build something that is truly owned by the people.”  Team photo via Arweave",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIL | AR | TOKEN SALE,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/05/filecoin-but-forever-arweave-raises-5-million-to-build-out-permaweb,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c842f86a6e139da6b4004c82f5da4bcbad19f86-1500x777.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CNBC reported on his talk.  “This is not going to be a thing that spreads like a social network. This is going to be the work not of years but of decades, and it’s worth making,"" Weil said.  The Calibra VP further claimed the Libra Association and its members remain determined regardless of the recent high profile departures, including MasterCard and Visa. The 21 initial members signed a formal charter last month in Geneva, Switzerland. Weil said that Libra was just an idea 18 months ago, but now has 21 members and a ""bunch more that are looking to be involved.""  Weil told Web Summit attendees that users will have more wallets than just Calibra, the Libra-specific wallet Facebook is creating, to choose from. Fears of Facebook using Calibra for discriminatory or otherwise unsavory purposes were recently raised by U.S. lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Libra joined by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg.  Weil reiterated Zuckerberg's hearing statements, saying other wallet options will be available that can still leverage ""the accessibility and lower cost brought by the libra ecosystem.”  Indeed, private wallets are already available.

42431140,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Lrh,1572976801,Ether on Lightning Is the Latest Bridge Crossing Crypto's Great Divide,"Ethereum developers are using the Lightning payments network to build bridges into the bitcoin ecosystem.  The venture-backed crypto startup Radar, best known for its decentralized exchange (DEX) relayers for 0x, just launched a service called RedShift, which allows people to pay a lightning invoice from an ethereum wallet.  Radar product lead Brandon Curtis told CoinDesk:  “There are some people out there who want to be bitcoin maximalists or only work on ethereum things. But I think there’s a large, silent majority of us that are interested in multiple chains, in multiple assets, and want to build things that bridge between them.”  MetaMask wallet users with an in-browser widget can simply add a second widget to their browsers and paste a lightning invoice into the ethereum wallet, like a normal wallet address. On the back end, Radar will swap the ether for bitcoin and manage channels so the recipient is paid in bitcoin. This widget will eventually connect the user to a pool of market makers beyond Radar, Curtis said, and work for other ethereum-based tokens as well.  “Our number one request from [DEX] users and market makers was somehow adding the ability to trade bitcoin,” Curtis said. “[Bitcoin has] more liquidity and just a lot of holders, users, a lot of interest.”  Radar may see the move as a competitive differentiator as it jockeys for usage in the DEX space. Currently, IDEX and Kyber Network are the leading DEXs in terms of trading volume, according to Etherscan statistics.  Building bridges  Radar is now among a handful of projects working to connect various cryptocurrency ecosystems.  Indeed, the Cross-Chain Working Group is already building a system for wrapped bitcoin tokens that can be used on the ethereum blockchain. Plus, the Electronic Coin Company is working on bridges for zcash into the ethereum network, according to ECC’s VP of marketing, Josh Swihart.  Likewise, Arwen CEO Sharon Goldberg told CoinDesk her startup’s atomic swap and settlement service for centralized exchanges like KuCoin now offers ethereum mainnet capabilities.  “You can take some bitcoin, buy some ETH, and do that settlement without losing custody,” she said. “The way we’re doing it is free of any third party. We don’t have any pegs, or any of the complexity we’re seeing from some of the other projects. You’re actually introducing new counterparty risk with those types of things.”  Whether startups focus on sidechains, lightning or other layered protocols like Arwen, Radar’s Curtis said that bitcoin is still the best form of cryptographic money, due to open questions about how ethereum development will play out. However, from his perspective, bridges that allow flows of value into bitcoin from more experimental assets can add more value to the bitcoin ecosystem by opening it up to new users.  “Right now, the hardest part about lightning is the onboarding process,” Curtis said, adding:  “With tools like RedShift, we can allow people who already have digital assets to tap into the [lightning] network without all that setup.”  Team photo courtesy of Radar Relay",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | KNC | MARKET | ZRX,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/11/05/ether-on-lightning-is-the-latest-bridge-crossing-cryptos-great-divide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92ec67d79b6ebb5a092736324cc175293b5a63c7-1500x778.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431146,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0M1h,1572973827,Coinbase Legal Chief Says Private Sector Should Build US Digital Dollar,"Coinbase’s legal chief is calling for private sector leadership in developing America’s digital currency.  Brian Brooks, in a Fortune essay published Monday, argued private corporations are best positioned to build a much-debated digital U.S. dollar, and that the government should stand back and let them, doing little, if anything, to regulate their underlying blockchains.  “The best path forward is one that harnesses our country’s remarkable capacity for innovation and also reflects government’s historical practice of setting broad guide rails for private innovation within the financial system,” Brooks said. ""... But there is no more need for the government to control the blockchain policy of stablecoin issuers than there is for the government to dictate the technology used by privately-owned commercial and investment banks.""  Essentially, Brooks envisions an informal public-private partnership in which private corporations leave monetary control to the federal government, and the government, in turn, secedes management of the technological infrastructure to them:  “In short: the private sector should build the technology, and the public sector should set monetary policy.”  His approach differs from the Facebook-led Libra project, which the social media giant first announced this past summer.  U.S. lawmakers and regulators alike have balked at the company's plans to develop a global stablecoin governed by a Switzerland-based council dubbed the Libra Association, claiming the cryptocurrency would be beyond regulators’ jurisdiction. Further, the project's plans to back the stablecoin with a basket of global currencies could, conceivably, strip America’s federal reserve of monetary control.  In October, Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said global digital currency projects like Libra could destabilize the world’s central banks.  Brooks contrasted Libra's approach with USDC (the stablecoin issued by Coinbase and Circle) and other similar tokens, asserting instead that dollar-backed digital currencies pose no threat whatsoever to central bank control. If the Fed-controlled dollar backs the private sector minted stablecoin, then, he pointed out, the fed still controls the stablecoin’s underlying monetary policy.  As Brooks sees it, the government’s best action would be taking little, if any. Other than ensuring that varied stablecoin projects – Libra and Coinbase’s USDC, among others – hold the fiat reserves they claim to, he called for a hands-off approach to private innovation.  Brooks did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.

42431138,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Llh,1572966004,"Tradewind, Canadian Mint to Verify Origins of Precious Metals on Blockchain","Tradewind Markets, a blockchain-powered gold trading platform backed by stock trading firm IEX, has developed and launched a system for stablecoin issuers on its platform to track the provenance of their precious metals.  Tradewind is taking its shot at stopping counterfeit gold seals and helping precious metals investors find metals that are produced responsibly. Designed with the Royal Canadian Mint and built on R3's Corda Enterprise platform, Tradewind Origins tracks the geography and name of the mine as well as under what standards the metal was produced.  “If you are a miner who produces responsible metal, once the bank buys the metal, it loses its identity,” Tradewind Chief Executive Michael Albanese, told CoinDesk. “That bank sells it to a wholesaler network down to a corporation. That miner is challenged to be able to advertise its metal. For the first time ever, the miner that produces responsibly is going to be able to tag their metal to advertise it to downstream buyers.”  Tradewind’s history with blockchain began in 2016 when it set out to create more transparency in the gold exchange process with the technology. In March 2018, the firm launched its VaultChain platform, which served as an authoritative record of title for precious metals ownership at the Mint. In April, Albanese left his position as global head of collateral management at JP Morgan to lead the startup.  Gold-backed coins are popular in the crypto community, where many see bitcoin as a better version of gold. With gold suffering from a counterfeiting crisis, tracking the provenance on blockchain has become necessary and gold-crypto funds have proliferated in the marketplace.  In September, Paxos launched a gold-backed crypto asset. InfiniGold unveiled a digital token backed by gold certificates from The Perth Mint in Australia in August. Earlier this year, four Iranian banks developed a gold-backed cryptocurrency called “Paymon” amidst reports that Iran was looking into a cryptocurrency to evade sanctions.  Tradewind Origins beefs up the company’s service of helping other companies develop precious metal-backed stablecoins.  The Mint, Tradewind and the miner are the only three participants with nodes on the platform with no information being recorded to the blockchain by the miner unless the Mint and Tradewind confirm it.  Tradewind aims to address the environmental, social and corporate governance standards that first affected equity and bond investing and are now important to investors in precious metals, Albanese said.  “You have corporations and jewelers that want to reduce reputational risk and their customers are interested in knowing that what they’re buying was produced responsibility in accordance with ESG principals,” Albanese said. “If you’re a fund manager, asset manager, a sovereign institution or a mutual fund, you’re also concerned about this because you want to make sure that what you’re buying is adhering to ESG standards.”  Gold image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/05/tradewind-canadian-mint-to-verify-origins-of-precious-metals-on-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da869b6d20769064b581c36b54624fe52be0dfbb-1500x913.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431150,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0MBh,1572964328,Decentralized Storage Startup Storj to End Token Conversion Program,"Holders of decentralized storage startup Storj Labs' early SJCX token need to act soon to avoid losing their investments.  The firm announced Tuesday that its long-running token conversion program – in which it swaps users' SJCX tokens, built on the Counterparty blockchain, to the newer ethereum-based STORJ token – will end on Jan. 1, 2020.  The firm said the number of conversions have been ""sufficiently"" low over the past six months to justifying the decision. The conversion period was originally set to end in mid-2018, but this period was extended for users who hadn't made the swap.  Any remaining tokens held to fund the conversion program will be moved over to the Storj general reserve after the closing date, the company explained.  Storj’s tokens are used to incentivize those with spare computer storage to store and protect its enterprise users’ files.  The token conversion began two years ago when Storj announced its intention to migrate its decentralized cloud storage service to the ethereum blockchain. At the time, users could convert their tokens on a one-to-one basis.  In its announcement, Storj said shift to ethereum meant lower transaction fees for STORJ holders, as well as improved security and programmatic payments. CEO Shawn Wilkinson previously told CoinDesk that reasons for the move also included the larger user network on ethereum and the lack of development on the Counterparty network.

The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume announced Tuesday it would utilize CipherTrace's intelligence tools, bringing anti-money laundering analysis and support to its self-developed blockchain, which is both the foundation for the Binance DEX (decentralized exchange) and home to the exchange's BNB token.  CipherTrace said in a press release that it would support ""institutional-grade"" AML controls for clients, continuing a long-standing partnership between the two firms.  Binance announced in April that it would integrate CipherTrace technology to track on-chain funds and problematic user wallet addresses. More recently, Binance said it was evaluating CipherTrace's solution to the recent Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations for having exchanges implement the so-called travel rule.  FATF formally published its guidance in June, asking national authorities to force crypto exchanges – dubbed virtual asset service providers – to maintain know-your-customer information for both senders and recipients of transactions, and pass that information to other entities.  Binance chief compliance officer Samuel Lim said in a statement that Tuesday's news is positive for the Binance Chain community.  ""Our users can soon expect more digital token/asset support across our fast-growing ecosystem and lines of businesses,"" he said, adding:  ""While we constantly strengthen our compliance and security controls to align with global regulatory standards, we stay true to our roots of being user-centric. This partnership with CipherTrace would ultimately encourage greater community involvement, developer participation and public interest in Binance Chain and pave the way for larger mainstream adoption.""  In another announcement from Binance Tuesday, the exchange said it's open-sourcing its implementation of a technology aimed to allow crypto startups to more securely manage private keys.  Binance's threshold signature scheme library for elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, it says, ""will enable wallet providers and custodians to avoid single points of failure in private keys with distributed key management.""

According to a CFTC news release from Friday, the district court for the Eastern District of New York ordered a fine of $4.25 million against Blake Harrison Kantor and Nathan Mullins plus four firms including Blue Bit Banc, Blue Bit Analytics, Mercury Cove and G. Thomas Client Services.  The order included a civil monetary payment penalty against Kantor and the firms for $2.5 million, while Mullins received a penalty of $300,000. Kantor and Mullins were further ordered to hand over ""ill-gotten gains"" of $515,759 and $89,574, respectively.  The CFTC first filed the case against Kantor and his associates in April 2018 for fraud involving binary options – a financial product giving a fixed monetary outcome or none at all – and the cryptocurrency ATM Coin. Under the scheme, the defendants used in-house software to alter the outcome of binary options in favor of the firm, Blue Bit Banc.  Investor funds were also transferred into the “worthless” crypto, which Kantor and Mullins told investors was “worth substantial sums of money.”  The CFTC said the defendants further persuaded customers to deposit money in accounts in the island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, increasing the difficulty of tracking such investments.

42431143,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Lph,1572953812,Investor Lawsuit Argues Ripple Still Has to Answer Over Ongoing XRP Sales,"Ripple's argument that an XRP holder waited too long to file suit has no precedent, a new legal filing claims.  Bradley Sostack, the plaintiff in a putative class-action lawsuit, saidRipple's statute of repose – a three-year period where victims can claim alleged wrongdoing – does not immunize the defendant from securities laws due to the on-going sales of XRP.  In a new legal filing made public late on Monday, Sostack claimed Ripple's monthly sale of XRP out of escrow constitutes on-going securities sales, as submitted in his response to Ripple's motion to dismiss from September.  Sostack is the court-designated lead plaintiff in a long-standing legal battle with Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, based on claims the payments startup violated U.S. securities laws by selling XRP to the general public and promising that the token's value would spike. The plaintiff is claiming he lost $118,100 through his XRP investment, according to an August filing.  Leaning on court precedent, Sostack said the defense relies on an ""out-of-circuit decision"" which ""cannot be squared with the Supreme Court’s more recent holding that the statue of repose 'runs from the defendant’s last culpable act (the securities offering).'""  The response states:  ""Defendants have failed to cite any case – and indeed, no court has found – that liability for multiple offerings have been barred by the statute of repose.""  The lawsuit was first filed early last summer. Sostack and his attorneys, law firms Susman Godfrey and Taylor-Copeland Law, then filed an amended class action complaint in August 2019, relating Ripple's alleged actions to the standards set out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its crypto asset framework in claiming that XRP is a security.  Ripple sidestepped the question of whether XRP is a security entirely in its response, instead arguing that the plaintiff had failed to file a suit within the statute of repose and that he'd failed to file a complaint under law.  While the complaint alleged that the cryptocurrency XRP is a security, it is unlikely that this question will be resolved during the ongoing proceedings, according to legal experts.  Ripple must respond to the new filing by Dec. 4, with oral arguments expected to commence Jan. 15.

42431156,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0MFh,1572951602,Bitcoin Keeps Failing at This Key Price Hurdle,"View  A four-month falling trendline proved a tough nut to crack during the Asian trading hours and reversed bitcoin's rise from $9,200 to $9,500. The outlook, however, would turn bearish only below the 200-day average support at $9,127.  The pullback from $9,500 to $9,200 lacked volume support and could be short-lived.  A high-volume UTC close above $9,470 is needed to confirm an upside break of the multi-month falling trendline and open the doors for $13,880 (2019 high).  Acceptance below the 200-day MA would weaken the immediate bullish. The resulting sell-off to $8,500, if any, will likely be transient.      Bitcoin's (BTC) struggle for a bullish breakout continues with a falling trendline capping gains for the fifth time in 11 days.  The top cryptocurrency is currently trading in the red near $9,300 on Bitstamp, having faced rejection near $9,470 – the resistance of the trendline connecting June 26 and Aug. 6 highs – during the Asian trading hours.  The four-month trendline sloping downwards from the 2019 high of $13,880 first came into play on Oct. 26. On that day, prices clocked a high of $10,350 but failed to print a UTC close above the resistance line.  Similar price action was seen on the following two days and on Monday when prices rose from $9,200 to a one-week high of $9,586 but failed to beat the trendline hurdle.  The repeated failure to scale the multi-month downtrend line may force some investors to question the sustainability of the recent rise from five-month lows below $7,500.  However, such fears may be premature, as prices are still holding above the 200-day MA support, a barometer of long-term market trends, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  BTC is again struggling to get past the descending trendline, currently at $9,470. Even so, it is early to call a bearish reversal, as the 200-day MA support at $9,127 is intact.  The average has been restricting downside since Oct. 30, having worked as resistance multiple times in the 16 days to Oct. 11.  All-in-all, BTC is being squeezed between the long-term average support and the falling trendline resistance.  A high-volume UTC close above $9,470 is needed to confirm an upside break of the falling trendline. That would imply a resumption of the bull market from lows near $4,100 seen at the beginning of April and open the doors for resistance at $13,880.  On the downside, acceptance below the long-held 200-day MA support at $9,127 will likely invite stronger selling pressure, leading to a drop to $8,500.  A bullish breakout looks likely, as the cryptocurrency tends to pick up a strong bid six months ahead of reward halving, as discussed last week.  Note that the recent pullback from $10,350 lacked volume support. Essentially, it represents a bull breather and could be reversed.  Hourly chart  BTC jumped from $9,273 to $9,586 in the 60 minutes to 22:00 UTC on Monday with buying volume (green bar) hitting the highest level since Oct. 31.  Indeed, the spike has been erased with prices falling to $9,165 a few hours ago but with weak trading volumes. Therefore, the possibility of BTC rising back to highs near $9,600 cannot be ruled out.

Coke One North America (CONA) says its pilot project with software provider SAP is now set to be expanded from two to 70 of the manufacturers that deliver the 160,000 bottles Coca-Cola shops daily, Business Insider reported on Tuesday.  The blockchain project promises to improve distribution for the participants, as all manufacturers can access a permissioned blockchain containing each others' orders, capabilities and requirements. For example, if a bottle maker is short of stock for a looming order, the network quickly provides options for filling shortfall. CONA told BI it hopes to reduce order reconciliation days from weeks to just days.  ""There are a number of transactions that are cross-companies and multi-party that are inefficient, they go through intermediaries, they are very slow,” senior manager at Coke One North America Andrei Semenov told BI. “And we felt that we could improve this and save some money.”  The pilot program’s initial positive results meant not only more bottles shipped, but more companies coming to SAP’s platform, as per the report. Semenov said that CONA has its eyes set on working with commerce giants Walmart and Target as a result, though scaling to work with those firms' supply chains would be a difficult undertaking, he noted.  ""What we achieved here with blockchain is creating a document flow across the supply chain,"" said Torsten Zube, head of SAP’s Innovation Center Network.  Coca-Cola's prime competitor PepsiCo also conducted a blockchain trial that the firm claimed in May had raised efficiency by 28 percent.

42431151,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0M9h,1572948052,US Startup Raising $10 Million for Private Jets You Can Lease With Crypto,"Jet Token is raising up to $10 million in a Regulation A offering for its ethereum-powered private jet leasing marketplace where travelers can pay for charters using ERC20 tokens.  Private charter flights, a travel option for people willing to pay for more than a business class seat, is a lively industry in the U.S. with substantial ticket prices – a flight from New York City to Miami would cost $15,000 on a charter.  Adding tokens as a form of payment would make the purchase process more flexible and ""allow for faster booking confirmation of air charter flights, particularly on weekends and holidays coincident with periods of peak travel demand,"" Jet Token said in a statement.  According to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association's data, there are 14,217 business jets in the U.S., making the country a leader in the industry. However, only 2,876 of them are available for charter booking – Jet Token's thesis is that rich travelers could get access to more options if the market was managed more effectively.  Its pitch to airplane owners and travelers: ""aircraft owners would achieve higher revenue per seat mile by filling an otherwise empty plane, and travelers would achieve access to on-demand travel at a lower average cost because of greater market transparency and price discovery.""  Eye on the SEC  The company, founded in July, 2018, would compete with TurnKey Jet, Inc, which is building a similar service and became the first crypto company that managed to secure a no-action letter from the SEC this April, while Jet Token decided to pursue more traditional fundraising for its raise.  Jet Token hopes to piggyback the SEC decision on TurnKey and follow the same principles to avoid getting their future tokens deemed securities, for example, in that the tokens would not be used to fund the development of the platform nor presented as having a profit potential.  ""We intend to operate in full compliance with the SEC’s guidance in the TurnKey Jet, Inc. No Action Letter dated April 3, 2019, and any future refinements to that guidance in the future, so that U.S. federal securities laws will not apply to the offer, sale and any resale of Jet Tokens,"" Jet Token's filing with the SEC reads.  As for the tokens, the platform is ""currently in development and is not yet operational,"" Jet Token says, and it's not clear yet when the tokens, based on the ethereum blockchain, will be issued. Potential clients will be able to buy the tokens for cash or cryptocurrencies, bitcoin in particular.  Apps and jets  Jet Token said it had already launched an initial version of its iOS app in September and is planning to ship the version with built-in crypto payments by the end of this year. The company will serve as a broker for booking flights, and also operate its own reserve fleet of aircrafts, which can be used if a flight booked by a client gets cancelled or delayed.  The filing said the company ""negotiated terms with Honda Aircraft Company for 4 HondaJets and with Gama Aviation for the maintenance, management and operation of our leased aircraft.""  According to Jet Token's recent SEC filing, the company is led by Mike Winston, principal at Sutton View Capital, as a founder, executive chairman and treasurer. The CEO is George Murnane, who previously chaired several aviation-related companies, the last being ImperialJet private charter broker.

42431155,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0MHh,1572944454,"The 'Bitcoin Rich List' Has Grown 30% in the Last Year, But Why?","The Bitcoin Rich List, or the number of addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC, has grown in the past 12 months, possibly reflecting an influx of high-net-worth investors.  The metric has registered growth of 30 percent since September 2018, according to Coin Metrics data. Even when adjusted to exclude addresses known to belong to exchanges, the figure shows a similar surge.  At press time, 2,148 addresses contain more than 1,000 bitcoins, amounting to just 0.01 percent of all bitcoin addresses, as per BitInfoCharts’ Bitcoin Rich List.  As seen in the fever line chart above, the list has witnessed a near 90-degree rise over the last 12 months. Investor and analyst Willy Woo believes the list has expanded mainly due to increased investor participation in the market:  ""The two options are we have high-net-worth investors coming in or it could be cold storage practice at the exchanges and custody solutions. The latter explanation cannot be ruled out, but it does not coincide with other data we have on the timing of when supply increased at these entities. For now, I’m going with the first explanation.""  Note that BTC fell from $6,400 to $3,100 in the final quarter of 2018 and experienced investors may have taken advantage of the price dip to snap up the top cryptocurrency on the cheap, leading to the rise in the addresses with more than 1,000 bitcoins.  Other observers, however, are not convinced that the number of individuals with 1,000+ BTCs has increased.  After all, an individual can move 50,000 bitcoins from a single wallet to 50 different wallets for custody purposes. Also, a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance holds bitcoins belonging to millions of users and can store coins in different wallets.  “It's mostly the exchanges ... both the amount of BTC held in exchanges and the number of exchanges/custodians have been growing,” trader Alex Kruger told CoinDesk.  He noted that on-chain transaction volume in BTC terms has been relatively flat since September 2018 – a sign the rich list is possibly increasing due to exchanges, which tend to have low on-chain transaction frequency. For instance, top addresses have fewer withdrawals compared to deposits and could, therefore, be exchanges' cold, or offline wallets.  While trading volume is the lifeblood of exchanges, it is not necessarily reflected on-chain, since these companies may internally debit or credit client addresses without executing a transaction on the public ledger.  That said, it is not possible to know for sure whether a given address with infrequent transactions is an exchange or a whale.  Further, as shown in the chart below, if you take out known exchange addresses, the rich list still grew by almost 30 percent over the 12-month period, to more than 2,100 addresses, pretty much the same rate as for all addresses.  This supports Woo's interpretation that the influx of high-net-worth individuals was a primary reason for the rise in addresses with more than 1,000 bitcoins.  One more possible reason for the rise could be the distribution of ownership over time, according to Qiao Wang, director of product at crypto data source Messari.  ""In the beginning it was Satoshi, then a few early miners, who owned all the bitcoin. But over time their share decreased and other people entered the market,"" Wang said.  Looking forward, both wealthy investors and exchanges may continue to drive the rise in the number of ""rich"" addresses. With the next mining reward halving – a historically price-bullish event – due in six months, new investors may enter the market.  Also, trading volumes at the Bakkt bitcoin futures exchange, which needs to store bitcoin for its physically delivered futures, are increasing. Recently, futures volume jumped by more than 250 percent to $11 million. The exchange, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, is set to launch options on futures on Dec. 8.

42431148,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0M3h,1572920100,Chinese Regulator Investigates Firm’s Blockchain Efforts Amid Stock Surge,"An obscure porcelain and education firm is under investigation by a top Chinese regulator after it became one of the most sought-after blockchain stocks last week.  Guangdong Great Wall Group, whose stock price soared for five consecutive days last week after Chinese president Xi Jinping praised blockchain technology, said Monday it was under investigation by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).  The investigation comes as the government appeals for ""rational"" investments in Chinese blockchain and fintech firms.  Great Wall Group, which started off as a creative porcelain firm in 1996, disclosed details about six blockchain projects in its 2018 annual report, but investigators have questioned whether this blockchain push is genuine in light of its recent stock bump.  According to the firm’s filing with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, investigators are looking at potential violations of information disclosure regulations.  ""According to the Securities Law of the People’s Republic of China, the committee of CSRC has decided to open an investigation against the firm,"" the filing said.  The firm received an earlier request from ChiNext, a NASDAQ-style board for the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, on Oct. 28, asking the firm to explain how its businesses are related to the blockchain industry, according to a separate filing.  ChiNext required more elaborate explanations on the six research and development projects that firm claimed were related to blockchain, out of 50 projects listed in the 2018 annual report, according to the filing.  The exchange wants to know more details, including the projects’ background, cycles, amounts of investment, research team and specific use cases.  It also asked profits generated from the projects and how much the realized profits and revenue from the projects affect the firm’s total profits and revenue over the last year and the first three quarters of 2019.  According to the firm’s response in the filing, two of the six projects are being developed by its internet training subsidiary Zhiyou Education, which plans to establish a cryptocurrency ecosystem based on its yet-to-be-developed OK Angel Coin software.  ""The two projects have not had any impact on our revenue or profits yet,"" the firm said.  The other four are from its recently acquired education wing, Emerald Education Group.  ""We have lost control over Emerald Education,"" Great Wall Group said in a June filing with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, adding:  ""The subsidiary no longer provides any financial statements and reports to us, therefore we are not able to explain how Emerald Education is related to the blockchain technology.""  Great Wall Group filed a lawsuit against Emerald Education Group regarding equity transfer disputes in August.  ""We have been unable to control the decision-making process in terms of its recruitment and funds due to resistance from Emerald’s core management team,"" the firm said in the filing.  Neither Great Wall Group’s semi-annual or third quarter reports have included Emerald’s financial statements.  The Shenzhen Stock Exchange may suspend trading of Great Wall’s stock if it cannot provide annual reports for two consecutive fiscal years, as it has not been able to include Emerald’s financial statements in them.  Great Wall Group’s market cap is 2.627 billion RMB as of Nov. 4. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.

42374499,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWva00Z,1572913516,Stellar's Foundation Just Destroyed Half the Supply of Its Lumens Cryptocurrency,"MEXICO CITY – The Stellar Development Foundation has burned 55 billion of its XLM tokens, over half the cryptocurrency's supply, CEO Denelle Dixon announced from the stage of the Stellar Meridian conference Monday.  Previously, there had been 105 billion XLM in existence, with 20 billion in circulation. With this burn, the supply has shrunk to 50 billion.  ""We didn't start by wanting to burn. We started by asking, 'What do we need?'"" Dixon told the room of roughly 200 attendees. ""As much as we wanted to use the lumens that we held, it was very hard to get them into the market.""  The organization decided instead it was better to project how much it could actually use over a 10-year period and calibrate to that number. ""To derive a plan from an arbitrary number serves no purpose,"" Dixon said.  The news was greeted warmly by the crowd, many of whom likely own the token. One participant in the packed room stood up and asked everyone to give Dixon a round of applause, which they did.  In the hour following the announcement, XLM's price jumped about 14 percent, to $0.08, according to data provider Nomics.  Dixon told CoinDesk that she couldn't anticipate how the crypto market might react, saying:  ""I don't know. I really just don't have a sense at all of what the market response is. From my standpoint, it's how the ecosystem feels about it. We got a lot of positive response from the ecosystem because we are rightsizing what the foundation has and the foundation holds.""  The foundation now controls 30 billion XLM, divided into several buckets. It has 12 billion XLM in the direct development fund (formerly called ""operations""), to support the organization.  In ""ecosystem support"" it has 2 billion XLM remaining (1 billion for currency support, and 1 billion for infrastructure grants).  Stellar has 10 billion XLM set aside to make investments (with 2 billion XLM for new products, and 8 billion XLM in its enterprise fund).  Finally, under user acquisition, the foundation has 6 billion XLM (2 billion for marketing stellar and 4 billion for in-app promotions).  The supply of XLM is fixed now because the community of token holders voted to discontinue inflation on Oct. 28.  ""SDF will not burn any additional lumens,"" Stellar said in a blog post.
