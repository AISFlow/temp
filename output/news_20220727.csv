Bitcoin and Ether Soar After Fed Rate Hike  By James Rubin  The U.S. central bank delivered as expected, raising interest rates 75 basis points. Crypto markets shrugged, continuing their two-day journey upslope, with bitcoin jumping 10% at one point following the Federal Reserve announcement. Ether soared more than 16% at one point.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $22,900, up over 8% for the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has mostly lingered between $21,000 and $23,000 for much of the past 10 days. Ether was recently changing hands just above $1,600, up more than 15% over the same period. Other major cryptos spent much of Wednesday in the green, with ETC up more than 30% and UNI and AAVE each rising over 20%.  Many market observers believed markets had already accounted for the Fed's rate hike, which the bank has been foreshadowing for over a week. ""A lot of people are saying that the rate hike right now is baked in just because the Fed has telegraphed for quite a while ... and even equity markets have been setting quite a bit,"" Katie Talati, head of research at asset management firm Arca, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program prior to the Fed announcement.  Talati added: ""We're going to continue to see weakness in equity markets. Since that correlation is pretty high with the crypto market right now, that's actually going to be what kind of cascades down into and trickles down into crypto markets.""  Crypto prices tracked equity indexes upward on Wednesday after investors reacted favorably to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comment the bank would continue its monetary hawkishness to tame inflation, but that it might also back off the recent drumbeat of robust rate hikes at some point. Powell also noted the U.S. economy had yet to fall into a recession, as many observers had anticipated, pointing to the torrid job market that has added 2.7 million jobs this year. ""It doesn't make sense that the economy would be in recession,"" Powell said.  Quarterly earnings continued to offer a confounding mix of upbeat and lesser news – sometimes within the same report – with Boeing (BA) on Wednesday saying profits had declined but also showing cash flow numbers positive for shares. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) on Tuesday reported its weakest growth in two years but also that ad revenue exceeded expectations. On Wednesday, Meta Platforms (FB) said it had finished with its first-ever revenue drop.  The tech-focused Nasdaq closed up a whopping 4.1%, its largest single-day increase since 2020, while the S&P 500 rose 2.6%.  The crypto industry continued to reel from the announcement earlier this week that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly probing crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) on suspicion it allowed U.S. persons to trade unregistered securities. On Tuesday, bitcoin advocate Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management sold a total of more than 1.4 million Coinbase shares.  Saylor on the Ethereum attack  Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR) founder and bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor took his latest shots at Ethereum at the Blockchain Economy conference in Turkey, questioning the economic, technological and ethical soundness of the protocol. Saylor has raised doubts about Ethereum before, so his comments were unsurprising, although noteworthy for their harshness.  ""Right now we don’t know the monetary policy of Ethereum and it’s just not clear what it is for the next 36 months, much less the next 1,000 years,"" Saylor said. ""So 'technically sound' means I need to see the protocol function for that thing after about five to 10 years. So we don’t know that either. Because if you are hard forking and changing it. Every time you do a big upgrade you introduce new attack surfaces.""  He added: ""And then 'ethically sound' means I need to know that nobody could change it, which means which includes Vitalik [Buterin, Ethereum's co-creator]. I need to know that no one at the Ethereum foundation, no individual can change the protocol, because if they could change the protocol it makes it a security. If it makes it a security then it’s not going to become global money.""  Saylor's comments came as Ethereum's 10th ""shadow fork"" went into effect on Tuesday, 26 hours earlier than expected. The network's tests ahead of the anticipated shift from an energy-intensive proof-of-work protocol to proof-of-stake have helped spur recent price gains. The shadow fork brings the project one step closer to Ethereum's mainnet upgrade in September. The third and final testnet merge, Goerli, is expected to happen Aug. 10.  ""The merge is going to be one of the most bullish events for this year for any crypto asset,"" Arca's Talati said. ""The shadow merge today is going to be giving more clarity on what that [launch] date will actually look like. Most are expecting end of September right now.""

INSIGHTS  Layoffs Are Hurting Crypto Companies  By Shaurya Malwa  Declining crypto and equity markets and contagion among crypto companies following the implosion of the Terra ecosystem in mid-May have hit the industry hard in perhaps its most crucial area – its workforce.  Layoffs have accelerated over the past two months, with prominent firms jettisoning talent that helped them climb during the bull market. An estimated 3,726 jobs have been lost as of July 21, 2022, based on media reports and press releases. The layoffs have hurt morale and weakened some firms, although a few companies have seen the bear market as an opportunity to add talent.  Cutting cost centers  Crypto markets often humble their participants, and the reality check arrived in the form of companies cutting “cost centers” that directly impacted their profitability. Coinbase cut as many as 1,000 jobs in June, while Bullish, Celsius Network and Huobi let go of as much as 30% of their headcount.  Some market observers say the firings have resulted from extensive hiring during a time of plenty.  “When analyzing the companies that are firing employees, most of them went through a very large employment campaign during the bull market” said Bruno Macchialli, CEO of crypto management platform Delchain.  “Coinbase, before the layoffs, had more than 5,000 employees. In comparison, FTX or Bitfinex has around 200-250 employees and keep hiring talent even during the crypto winter,” he said.  The moves affect former employees’ wellbeing, Macchialli pointed out: “When working in a company that is not strong financially due to the market decrease, a level of stress can be created on employees,” he said.  “The crypto winter sentiment will negatively impact some employees and can make them doubt the long-term benefits of the crypto economy,” he added.  These moves are expected to cause mistrust in the overall crypto ecosystem for job seekers, said Scott Scherer, CEO of real estate tokenization firm OwnersUnity.  ""Most crypto projects hire based on their needs, project roadmap and availability, which is limited in number and budget,” Scherer said. “By reducing resources they will spread departments too thin, which can affect performance and confidence in the market.”  A few add jobs  Still, some say laid-off employees may be picked up by players looking to attract experienced talent during a bear market.  “Companies like OpenSea, Compass Mining and Blockchain.com have cut between 15% and 25% of their staff,” said Mattias Tengblad, CEO of blockchain music platform Corite. “This action might at first seem to be detrimental to the company's reputation and staff morale, but well-established projects will have the chance to acquire talented candidates. “  Observers also note that the so-termed crypto winter could be a chance for crypto industry hopefuls to enhance their skills.  “On a positive note, the crypto winter is the occasion for employees to work on their crypto knowledge and train themselves,” Delchain’s Macchialli said, adding that companies can also take this time to develop the infrastructure needed to support the next bull run as they can allocate more time on this.  Corite’s Tengblad shares the same sentiment. “There will always be a purge during a down market, but we can choose to see it as an issue or a great chance for projects to build more products,” he said.  Exchanges like KuCoin are flaunting up to 300 vacancies as they seek to double down on crucial hires in a bear market. Binance shows nearly 900 open positions, while a LinkedIn search shows more than 8,000 job postings for crypto-related positions.  The crypto market remains attractive for future jobseekers, OwnerUtility’s Scherer opines. “Crypto will remain a high growth industry in the years to come, so there will always be new positions opening up for people who may have been laid off elsewhere,” he concluded.

42374155,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY4px,1658962860,Law Commission of England and Wales Sees Crypto as a New Type of Property,"The Law Commission of England and Wales – a statutory independent body tasked with reviewing and updating the law – wants to extend property rules to cover crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT), according to a consultation paper published Thursday.  Aside from legally defining digital assets as personal property, the proposed reforms could make it easier for crypto investors to claim losses in hacks or scams through legal action.  “A lot of people just invest in NFTs, but they don’t ask the question ‘what happens when things go wrong?’” Commercial and Common Law Commissioner Sarah Green told CoinDesk in an interview. “It's not clear at all what happens if you hack into my wallet and take my bitcoin or if ... this system fails and I can't access my bitcoin.”  The seemingly crypto-friendly proposal is aimed, in part, at helping the U.K. government’s goal of turning the country into a global crypto hub, the commission said in a statement. The commission's proposals, however, would not apply in Scotland or Northern Ireland, which have their own legal systems.  Last week financial regulators also proposed rules to Parliament that would recognize stablecoins – which are asset-backed cryptocurrencies – as legal means of payment. More stablecoin regulations are on the horizon, and the government is planning a consultation on crypto as investment assets for the end of the year.  In the consultation paper, which invites views from legal and tech experts, the commission steers clear of cryptocurrencies that function simply as means of payment. Instead, it focuses on digital assets that can be traded, used to represent other assets or used as stores of value.  The paper also argues that existing property laws can’t sufficiently accommodate digital assets, owing to their “many different features” and “unique qualities” when compared with traditional physical assets.  “The law must therefore go further to acknowledge these unique features, which in turn would provide a strong legal foundation for the digital assets industry and for users,” the commission said.  According to the document, property law in England and Wales currently recognizes two types of personal property: “Things in possession,” which include tangible objects like a “bag of gold,” and “Things in action” for property like company shares that can “only be claimed or enforced through legal action.”  To accommodate digital assets, the Law Commission is proposing the creation of a new category called “data objects” that would account for things composed of data in an electronic form like databases, software, digital records, domain names and crypto.  The creation of a third category would allow for a more nuanced consideration of new, emergent and idiosyncratic things, according to the document.  “It would allow the law to develop by analogy with things in possession or things in action where appropriate, while also recognizing that certain things do not fall neatly within either category,” the consultation said.  The Law Commission has been working on rules for digital assets since last year, and is halfway through its project. Commission evaluations typically take 18 months to complete. The public consultation on the rules is set to end Nov. 4.  In a project that ended in 2021, the commission concluded that existing laws can accommodate smart contracts that automatically execute and document digital transactions between agreeing parties.  The government has also asked the commission to look into rules for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), which are blockchain-based governance bodies. It will explore laws for DAOs once the digital assets project has been completed.

42374168,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY501,1658958668,Two-Thirds of Public Commenters Oppose US Adopting Digital Dollar: Cato Institute,"The Cato Institute has looked over more than 2,000 responses to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s invitation to comment on a digital dollar and has come to this conclusion: two-thirds of the responses appear to object to the idea.  The Washington, D.C.-based libertarian think tank, which opposes a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a government attempt to control people’s money, reviewed the public comments and found more than 66% of them raise concerns including the loss of privacy and damage to the U.S. financial system. However, the study released Wednesday noted that business interests have taken a more favorable view.  “The fact that two-thirds of the over 2,000 commenters are pushing back against the idea of a CBDC shows not only that this is not the niche issue it once was a few years ago, but also that Americans recognize the very real risk a CBDC could pose to their financial freedom,” Nicholas Anthony, the Cato policy analyst who compiled the statistics, told CoinDesk in an email.  Supporters of a digital dollar believe it could be a national-security benefit in the race against foreign competitors, reduce the environmental costs from the production of paper currency and improve trust in the monetary system by making it more transparent.  Officials at the Fed, which would be responsible for creating and maintaining a digital dollar, have said the agency won’t act on it without sign-off from Congress and the Biden administration, and some have predicted it would take at least five years to put in place.  Researchers for the Office of Financial Research (OFR) – an arm of the U.S. Treasury Department that studies risks to the financial system – looked into how a CBDC would affect the inner workings of U.S. finance, concluding earlier this month that worries about a future panic driving people to rapidly move assets into digital dollars may be overblown.

42411746,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgI2,1658955922,SuperRare NFT Market: A Beginner’s Guide,"SuperRare launched in 2018 as a non-fungible token (NFT) market for aspiring digital artists and fine-art collectors. But unlike such competitors as Rarible and OpenSea, SuperRare prides itself on being super-selective about who gets to mint NFTs on its site and ensuring each NFT is truly one of a kind. While this means there aren’t as many NFTs on SuperRare, it guarantees the NFTs you see here are screened for quality.  Due to SuperRare’s high standards, it has gained a reputation as one of Ethereum’s most elite NFT art markets.  What makes SuperRare different?  SuperRare is a curated NFT art market built on the Ethereum blockchain and co-founded by John Crain, a former product engineer at prominent Web3 company ConsenSys who now serves as CEO of SuperRare Labs.  To distinguish itself from other NFT marketplaces, SuperRare emphasizes the exclusivity of its digital artworks. Any artist who wants to mint NFTs on SuperRare must apply and gain approval from SuperRare Labs. SuperRare also requires artists to submit only one-of-one art NFTs to ensure their pieces are, well, “super rare.”  Since SuperRare focuses on fine art NFTs, it tends to generate higher sales per token. For instance, artists Kevin McCoy, Don Diablo and XCOPY have sold NFTs on SuperRare for more than $1 million each. Time sold an “Is Fiat Dead?” NFT magazine cover in 2021, and the fashion brand Gucci has launched exclusive NFTs on SuperRare.  In 2021, SuperRare introduced its native cryptocurrency, RARE, to help the platform become more decentralized. Today, anyone who holds RARE tokens can vote on the future direction of SuperRare and admit new artists to mini-marketplaces called SuperRare Spaces. Currently, the SuperRare community approves 10 new “Spaces” per month.  How do people buy NFTs on SuperRare?  Purchasing NFTs on SuperRare is similar to buying them on other Ethereum-based NFT markets.  First, customers must link their Ethereum wallet by clicking the Sign In button on the top right of the homepage. Most people who shop on SuperRare use a MetaMask wallet, but SuperRare accepts many other Ethereum wallets via WalletConnect. According to SuperRare’s help portal, you can safely use popular options such as Trust Wallet, imToken and Rainbow Wallet.  Once you’ve linked your wallet, you can start exploring current NFT listings by clicking the Market button under the Art tab. Here, you can browse the latest NFT drops on SuperRare and narrow your search with the Artist and Artwork filters.  You can select any NFT that strikes your eye to learn more about the artwork and its transaction history. If there’s a Place Bid button by the NFT, you can click on it and make an offer.  It’s important to note that SuperRare only accepts Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), for transactions. You must have enough ETH in your wallet before placing a bid. Also, you have to factor in SuperRare’s flat 3% commission fee and gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain.  If your bid is successful, you should see your new NFT appear in your SuperRare account. You can resell your NFT at any time, but you will only receive 90 percent of the secondary sale. The remaining 10 percent goes to the original artist as a royalty fee.  How can people mint NFTs on SuperRare?  Minting NFTs on SuperRare isn’t as easy as clicking Create, selecting a JPEG and paying a gas fee. If you want to sell your art on SuperRare’s platform, you must submit a formal application and conform to the site’s criteria for quality and scarcity.  SuperRare has an official Google Form that any users can fill out if they feel their art meets SuperRare’s standards. Those who apply must include a roughly one-minute video introduction plus at least three of their best artworks in a Google Drive folder. SuperRare only accepts artists who submit original digital artworks that haven’t already been minted on other NFT markets.  Since SuperRare is super popular, it won’t respond to people who don’t pass this application process. If you don’t hear back within about one month, however, you can submit a new Google Form to SuperRare for review.  The benefit of this rigorous screening process is that SuperRare can control the quality of NFTs allowed on its platform. From an artist’s perspective, a SuperRare listing gives a creator extra cachet in the crypto art community. SuperRare rewards its artists by baking in a 10 percent royalty fee for every secondary NFT sale as part of each NFT’s smart contract. Artists also get 85 percent of their primary NFT sale.  More recently, SuperRare has opened the door to more aspiring NFT artists and curators through its SuperRare Spaces program. According to SuperRare, these spaces function as “sovereign crypto-art galleries” where the operators control promotional activities, NFT drop schedules and fees. Because these Spaces are within the SuperRare ecosystem, however, they still have to conform to SuperRare’s standards.  People interested in operating a SuperRare Space must answer the 17 questions in the Space Proposal Template and submit their proposals on SuperRare’s official forum. SuperRare strongly recommends posting this proposal on its Discord server so community members can review it before voting.  Currently, SuperRare admits 10 new Spaces in two voting sessions each month. To participate in Space Race votes, people need to hold RARE tokens and take part in the 48-hour voting window.  Even if you don’t want to create or manage NFT art on SuperRare, you can participate in the SuperRare community by holding RARE tokens and voting on proposals. Currently, you can find these Ethereum-based tokens on many prominent centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges.  Is SuperRare the NFT market for you?  Along with Gemini’s Nifty Gateway, SuperRare is one of Web3’s most fashionable NFT markets for fine art. Instead of branching out into other industries – NFT gaming or profile pic collections, for example – SuperRare focuses on offering high-quality and scarce NFT artworks only.  Shoppers keen on digital art, photography and videos will enjoy exploring all of the professional-grade NFTs in the SuperRare market and SuperRare Spaces. For NFT creators, SuperRare is one of the most highly selective sites, so it might not be the best option for beginners. But if you’re an established artist with a professional portfolio, SuperRare offers access to the most passionate NFT art enthusiasts.

42374164,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY4wF,1658955255,Market Wrap: Crypto Markets Trade Higher as Fed Raises Rates by Expected Amount,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rebounded on Wednesday, rising 2% in early morning trading and soaring over 10% following the announcement by the Federal Reserve that it was raising interest rates by 0.75 percentage point.  Much of the talk on Wednesday in both cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets revolved around the Fed. Its rate hike matched expectations.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The Fed “dot plot,” which is the projection of each Fed’s official's prediction for the federal-funds rate, implies that the rate will increase to 3.5% by the end of this year. The Fed has three more meetings this year (September, November and December).  In traditional equity markets, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.34% and 2.44% respectively as investors viewed the rate increase positively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by less than half a percentage point.  Ether’s (ETH) price rose 16% on the day, partly on the rate decision. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain successfully implemented a “shadow fork,” or test software update, two days earlier than expected. The test puts Ethereum a step closer to its much anticipated shift from a proof-of-work network to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake one.  Altcoins traded higher on Wednesday, as well, with MATIC rising by 9.3% (following the prior day’s 11% decline) and SOL jumping by 5%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin Advances as Fed Raises Rates by Expected Amount  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Bitcoin rebounded in Wednesday trading, following a rate increase by the Federal Reserve that markets largely anticipated.  In light of the 75-basis point hike by the Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. central bank’s comments on May 4 about the size of its balance sheet are particularly noteworthy.  “We intend to significantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a predictable manner by allowing the principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet, up to monthly cap amounts,” the Fed said at the time.  The monthly cap was $30 billion for Treasurys and $17.5 billion for mortgage-backed securities. One interpretation of the Fed’s statement in May suggests that the Fed's balance sheet would decrease by $47.5 billion each month. As shown in the chart below, however, that hasn’t been the case, as the balance sheet size remains at about $8.9 trillion.  Additionally, the $47.5 billion amount is labeled a cap, and not a target, and so the reduction of the balance sheet will occur as Treasurys fully mature and subsequently drop off of the balance sheet. Investors may also consider Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s statement that:  “Our balance sheet decisions are guided by our maximum employment and price stability goals. And in that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments.”  Ultimately, the Fed has the goals of price stability and maximum employment in mind, but also has to determine the pace and manner in which it achieves those objectives.  The Fed’s policy affects risky assets like stock and cryptocurrencies. As seen in the chart below, the correlations between BTC, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite remain tight.  On a technical basis, the increase in BTC prices came in conjunction with a sharp uptick in RSI (relative strength index) to 56, which indicates increasing momentum.

42411777,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfh5d,1658954015,Sorare 101: How to Get Started With Sorare NFTs,"Sorare taps into the world of fantasy sports leagues and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to create a blockchain-based game.  The Sorare NFT collection features more than 280 soccer (football for those of you not in the U.S.) leagues and all 30 Major League Baseball teams. You’ll find baseball and soccer superstars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi. These NFTs are also available on the OpenSea marketplace.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week  You can think of Sorare as essentially a fantasy sports card game that allows you to win prizes that you can exchange for money. As with any trading card game, the rarer the card, the higher the price. Continually participating in the game can reward you with better cards you can sell or use for more challenging tournaments.  How do Sorare NFTs compare to other NFTs?  Sorare focuses on both soccer and baseball fans, providing play-to-earn mechanics with unique athlete cards. Each card holds helpful stats depending on the match's situation. However, unlike some other NFT card games like Gods Unchained, Sorare does not need you to mix and “breed” two cards to make a new card. What you see is what you get, and what you find on the platform are hundreds of cards to put on your roster.  The value of each card depends on the overall stats and scarcity. Moreover, there is no “official” price for every card.  How does Sorare work?  There are two categories: soccer and baseball. With the soccer option, you will need to gather five cards in your lineup. In baseball, you must gather six cards.  Read More: Sports NFTs: How to Get in the Game  Let's chose the soccer path for our walk-through.  How to sign up  Signing up for Sorare is streamlined. Follow the steps below:  1. Go to the official Sorare website and press the Signup button.  2. Accept the terms and conditions.  3. A wallet will be generated for you to integrate with your supported wallet. You will need to create a password.  4. The next screen will prompt you to fund your account or connect your current ETH wallet.     How to play Sorare  To begin playing, you need your free cards, randomly assigned to you after the registration process. Once you get your cards, you will be able to participate in available tournaments and create a team to compete with others in the Sorare community.  Read More: NBA Top Shot 101  Upon completion of the registration process, you will be guided through a simple onboarding session with the goal of creating your team. If you were to choose soccer as your sport, some of the tasks you will need to complete during the onboarding session include the following:  1. Creating your club details such as your nickname and club name.  2. Choosing your favorite soccer teams from various leagues. If you are a fan of multiple teams, you can select more than one.  3. Receiving your first set of cards of soccer players.  While creating your team like a general manager, you need to pay attention to a few details of your players.  Playing time - You want players who get frequent on-field playing time, as you won’t earn points from players who are sitting on the bench a lot or are currently injured.  Average score - You also want players with a good average score, as shown below. This is visible on each player's profile.  It is also worth noting that earlier in the onboarding process you were given free soccer players cards that only allow you to play in the Rookie league. However, in order to participate in the other competitions, you must obtain five rare cards for soccer or six for baseball that can be earned in games or purchased with ETH rewards.  Value assessment of cards  Apart from the Common tier, Sorare has four card scarcity tiers which include: Limited, Rare, Super Rare and Unique. The image below shows the card circulation number for each of the tiers.  Additionally, you can notice that each tier has a specific color. For instance, a Rare card will always be red.  Read More: NFL All Day 101: How to Buy, Sell and Trade NFL NFTs  You can also focus on card details to assess each individual card apart from its tier. There are three pieces of information to focus on: average score, bonus and league. The most important criterion to determine its value is the average score, which determines scoring performance during the past five games. You can get the player's average score as shown below in the red box.  It is also essential to know that card scarcity is a major factor that determines which competitions you can participate in.  Is Sorare worth your time?  If you like soccer or baseball, Sorare is a fun time with over 17,000 active players as of this writing. If fantasy leagues are what intrigue you, then Sorare is worth playing - especially since you can earn money by competing with other players. The competitive spirit lives through the players as you battle it out in high-stakes matches, simulating the immersion as a team coach.  With enough traction, the game may hit the big time because soccer and baseball have strong and active fan bases, especially when merchandise is involved.  Sorare FAQs  Does Sorare have a native token?  SOR tokens make up the native cryptocurrency of the game. It is an ERC-20 token, making it simple for ETH transfers and a lucrative form of play-to-earn gaming.  SOR tokens are integral to the Sorare ecosystem as they are used for interaction and transactions on the platform. Simply put, you can stake the tokens for passive income or trade them for more Sorare NFTs.  SOR currently has a total maximum supply of 330,000, which is fairly low given that the game is still brand new. The developers have not updated information regarding the increase of supply, or if it would start collaborating with other blockchain projects.  Can you register for both soccer and baseball games in Sorare?  Yes, you can.

42374154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY4nR,1658953087,Facebook Parent Meta Loses $2.8B on Metaverse Division in Q2,"Meta Platforms (FB) posted a second-quarter loss of $2.81 billion in its Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations, according to its earnings report released Wednesday. That was down slightly from its loss of $2.96 billion in the first quarter and better than analyst estimates for a loss of $3.67 billion for the division for the quarter, according to FactSet.  FRL generated revenue of $452 million in the second quarter, down from $695 million in the first quarter. That was a small fraction of the $28.4 billion generated in the quarter from Meta’s family of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.  The company said it expected Reality Labs revenue to be lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.  On the company's earnings call with analysts, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is more focused on its long-term metaverse and Reels growth than maximizing short-term revenue from monetization. ""Developing these [metaverse] platforms could unlock hundreds of billions if not trillions in revenue over time,"" Zuckerberg said.  Meta announced in last year’s fourth quarter that it would be breaking out results for the division to show the performance and investments in a group that it considers key to the next generation of online social experiences.  For 2021, Meta reported a loss of $10.2 billion on revenue of $2.3 billion for FRL. The company has said it is committed to spending even more on the division for the next several years.  During the company’s first-quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg said the company's metaverse arm is currently ""laying the groundwork for a very successful 2030s.""  Overall, Meta’s adjusted quarterly earnings per share for Q2 of $2.46 missed analysts' average estimate of $2.54, according to FactSet, while its overall revenue of $28.8 billion fell just short of estimates of $28.9 billion.  Meta's shares fell close to 4% to $163.25 in after-hours trading on Wednesday on the results. Shares of Facebook are down more than 50% this year.

42421132,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWE1,1658947874,"'I Don’t Believe in Any Kind of ""Gotcha"" Regulation,' CFTC Commissioner Says on SEC Insider Trading Case","Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) member Caroline D. Pham told CoinDesk TV Wednesday her agency should have had “a seat at the table” before the Securities and Exchange Commission brought insider trading allegations against a former manager at crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN).  Pham, who was sworn in as a commissioner in April, said the CFTC also has insider trading enforcement authority.  “I believe that anything that might impact or implicate the CFTC’s jurisdiction, it’s our job to go in there to enforce the law, and to make sure that we’re prosecuting wrongdoing,” Pham said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show. “If the CFTC is involved in some way, I think we have to have a seat at the table; or if our jurisdiction [is] involved, we have to have a seat at the table.”  Commissioner Pham’s comments came after SEC allegations a former Coinbase product manager engaged in insider trading. The accused allegedly gave his brother and a friend confidential information about tokens that would be listed on the exchange in the near future.  The lawsuit also labeled nine digital tokens involved in the insider trading as “securities,” a first for an SEC action when the issuers of the alleged securities are not the defendants. With crypto regulation still in a gray area, this case “could have broad implications,” Pham said.  Pham said there’s still a lack of regulatory clarity around many tokens. There are “open questions around some of the tokens that are described in the complaint, particularly utility tokens and those involving DAOs,” or decentralized autonomous organizations.  A clear path toward regulation and compliance, according to Pham, can be established via the use of tools the agencies already have “that don’t involve bringing enforcement cases,” which she describes as “disruptive” in the SEC’s case.  “People need to know what the rules are so they can follow them,” she said. “I don’t believe in any kind of ‘gotcha’ regulation, where the rules are constantly changing on people and they don’t know what they’re supposed to be doing.”  This is not the first time Pham has commented on “regulation by enforcement.” She spoke on the topic in a July 21 speech where she noted an effective crypto framework would be best achieved in a collaborative manner.  In a similar vein, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce has also expressed her disappointment with the SEC in the past when it comes to the agency's relationship with crypto. In June she highlighted the agency’s “puzzling” and “out-of character approach” to regulation.  Pham, meanwhile, told CoinDesk that “the most effective regulation is when it’s clear.” At the moment, she said, it is difficult to pinpoint which agency is spearheading an effective regulatory framework. “I think a lot of people are asking themselves questions,” she said.  Pham said that, ultimately, it is “incumbent upon regulators” to provide clarity for people to know what they can and can’t do within the crypto industry.

42411430,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNkwt,1658947738,How Sports Leagues Can Use Crypto to Engage Fans,"Crypto and sports depend on teams.  A sports franchise and a blockchain startup are both led by a small pack of operators – whether it’s a revered National Football League coach and a seasoned quarterback, or a visionary founder alongside a savant developer – who must take their team to victory. They handle challenging conditions as one unit, all the while contending with large personalities, changing cultural tailwinds and frequent setbacks.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week. Jonathan Manzi is the founder and CEO of Beyond Protocol, a blockchain company specializing in the Internet of Things with human performance use cases involving NFL players like Rob Gronkowski.  The team extends beyond the immediate unit into a broader community. Just as tens of thousands of Patriots fans pack Gillette Stadium for each game, legions of cryptocurrency believers swarm Telegram channels for company announcements and giveaways. Fans root for successful performances from their teams during tough times. Colorful mascots, like the one for the Las Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League or Uniswap’s mythical unicorn, serve as a rallying point for fans all connected by their shared love of the team.  While celebrity athletes have endorsed cryptocurrency projects, a real use case for crypto in sports lies in the stadium with fans and how they connect with the team. Whether it’s a blue-chip digital asset like bitcoin or colorful altcoins like doge, cryptocurrencies add a fun dimension to players’ storylines that fans now play crucial roles in.  Let’s give sports fans a “bitcoin”  When Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan Byron Kennedy caught Tom Brady’s 600th touchdown ball last October, the Bucs quarterback gave 1 BTC as a consolation prize to get the football back – in addition to season tickets and troves of Buccaneers merch.  “I am also giving him a bitcoin, which is pretty cool, too,” Brady said during a press conference, after tweeting “Let’s get this guy a Bitcoin.”  Brady has a partnership with crypto exchange FTX, and both parties turned the storyline to their advantage. Although the Buccaneers showered Kennedy with merch, the “cherry on top” is magical internet money landing in the fan’s smartphone – Bucs merch can be reproduced endlessly, but bitcoin is finite. Our company, Beyond Protocol, even joined the fun and gave Kennedy some of our native tokens, taking the journey from real life to social media to blockchain.  Cynics focusing solely on the corporate partnership between FTX and Brady miss the fact that crypto is fun, and there is a human and cultural element to it. Once regulation catches up with technology, sports franchises can offer airdrops to fans, while incentivizing the larger “team community” to publicly show support for players. Franchises can further leverage this model by tapping into iconic moments in their team’s history. Imagine receiving an NFT (non-fungible token) that grants access to baseball legend Ted Williams’ iconic red seat in the bleachers of Fenway Park in Boston.  Read More: How DAOs Could Change Sports  We’re still only in the top of the first inning when it comes to the maturation of blockchain technology. As the industry evolves, new use cases will emerge.  While it’s tempting to view these as theoretical talking points from crypto evangelists, the infrastructure in sports stadiums to enable blockchain is rapidly being built out, from FTX gobbling up the naming rights to the Miami Heat's arena, and then airdropping every fan in a section $500 in crypto, to Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban enabling dogecoin at Mavericks games.  Or just shower everyone in dogecoin  Crypto and sports are fun.  “The Mavericks have decided to accept dogecoin as payment for Mavs tickets and merchandise for one very important, earth shattering reason, because we can!” Cuban said in a press release in March of last year. “We have chosen to do so because sometimes in business you have to do things that are fun.”  As a billionaire invested in decentralized finance (DeFi), Cuban understands the value of seeding fun, new concepts into pre-existing institutions, letting them take hold and grow. Whether it’s a meme coin or ticket scanner, whenever a new variable is introduced to any environment, both change over time. By accepting payments in a meme coin, the Mavericks franchise allows cryptocurrency to evolve in a contained ecosystem, while studying what works and what doesn’t with adoption.  Six months later in September 2021, the Mavericks’ launched a dogecoin cashback rewards program, indicating that meme coins are growing into an even greater part of the organization’s culture.

42374161,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY4tj,1658945421,Federal Reserve Hikes US Interest Rate by 0.75 Percentage Point,"For the second consecutive month, the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point in an effort to curb inflation running at a four-decade high.  The aggressive move, which follows a similar hike in June, could keep pressure on markets, including cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC).  This is the fourth time the U.S. central bank has raised interest rates this year, bringing the federal funds rate (the rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight) to a range between 2.25%-2.5%.  ""Recent indicators of spending and production have softened,"" said a statement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a group of 12 Fed officials who set the Fed’s monetary policy. ""Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the [coronavirus] pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.""  The Fed’s decision to raise the fed funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, or 75 basis points, is no surprise to traders, who bet on a 74% chance that central bankers would decide for a move of that size, as shown by the CME FedWatch Tool.  After the consumer price index (CPI) in June showed a much higher than expected inflation rate, traders briefly bet that a 100 basis point rate hike was more likely. However Fed officials said shortly after the CPI release that they favored another 75 basis point increase.  ""Powell would not rule out a 75-basis point rate increase for the next meeting, but he did say that it will likely be appropriate to slow rate increases at some point. It seems traders aren’t thinking another large move will be justified in September,"" said Edward Moya, Oanda senior market analyst for the Americas. ""The FOMC decision provided optimism that the end of tightening is in sight and that triggered a nice rally for risky assets that helped elevate cryptos.""  Bitcoin price  Bitcoin’s price rose 3.6% in the hour after the decision as Fed Chair Powell said that another unusually large interest-rate increase will depend on incoming data – an indication that another 75 basis point increase is far from assured.  “We have seen the rate increases already have a major role in why public bitcoin mining companies and even companies like Tesla [TSLA] sold off their BTC to shore up their cash reserves as access to capital and costs of borrowing continue to rise,” said Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy.  “But I am more focused on the current correlation between BTC and the Nasdaq 100 [stock index], and if these rate increases and unwinding of the balance sheet allow BTC to break that correlation and start to act as the hedge against this type of quantitative tightening,” he said.  Central bankers started reducing the size of the Fed’s $8.5 trillion balance sheet in June in an effort to bring it back down toward the pre-pandemic level, closer to $4 trillion. In September the pace of reduction will get more aggressive, with a potential roll-off of $95 billion a month.  But the fed funds rate will likely remain the Fed’s primary tool for quantitative tightening, with central bankers hoping to raise interest rates to a range of 3.25%-3.5% by the end of this year – an unusually fast pace of monetary tightening given the rate was near zero just four months ago.  After Wednesday’s decision, traders will be closely monitoring Thursday’s gross domestic product (GDP) report released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which could show the U.S. economy slowed in the second quarter of the year, suggesting the economy is in a recession, according to one definition.

42411432,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNl3V,1658944793,Celsius and BitConnect: Not So Different?,"Over the past few days, I’ve been revisiting the story of the massive 2016-2018 crypto scam BitConnect for an upcoming project. One of my surprising takeaways is that, though BitConnect was a shady global network organized by anonymous masterminds and without any formal legal structure, in many ways it operated similarly to Celsius Network, the U.S.-domiciled corporate lending platform that recently froze customer withdrawals and then declared bankruptcy.  BitConnect was a global pyramid scheme that stole more than $4 billion through a network of “promoters” in nearly every country on Earth, and it did it by promising more or less the same thing as Celsius. BitConnect users sent bitcoin (BTC) to BitConnect, which then supposedly used sophisticated trading strategies to generate immense returns on those deposits – up to 365% a year. As should be obvious from that promised rate of return, it was a fraud, and both BitConnect’s creator (now known to be Satish Kumbani) and various lower-level promoters have been criminally charged.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I’ll leave it up to the courts to decide whether the similarities between BitConnect and Celsius justify a similar legal response. But whether or not they were substantively criminal in their implementation, the shared elements unquestionably contributed to Celsius’ fragility and its ultimately predatory relationship to its “customers.”  See also: How CEO Alex Mashinsky Went from Bashing Banks to Bankrupting Celsius  Taking a closer look at those elements is critical for regulators who want to prevent similar cons, and for users who want to avoid getting robbed – whether intentionally or merely through incompetence.  The ‘risk-free trading’ myth  Above all, Celsius and BitConnect are comparable because they were promising effectively the same service to depositors. Both said they would use advanced market strategies to generate returns on customers’ behalf that were both outsized and, wonder of wonders, risk free.  BitConnect’s promise was certainly the more cartoonish and criminally deceptive of the two. In marketing materials, BitConnect claimed that its immense yields were generated by a “proprietary trading bot” that was so good it could time market volatility. There was never any suggestion that this trading strategy was subject to any risk that might cost depositors’ funds.  For even moderately savvy observers this was an obvious con, if nothing else because if such a strategy existed, inviting millions of strangers along for the ride would actually make it less effective – an almost tautological consequence of efficient markets. That’s what has happened to the real-world inspiration for BitConnect’s fictional trading bot, high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies. Those rely on volumes vastly in excess of what the crypto market could offer at the time, and a frenetic technological arms race that probably can’t be recreated in a crypto context. But even HFT returns have trended back down to earth as more traders use the strategy, highlighting the fundamental illogic of BitConnect’s pitch.  See also: 5 Social Media Crypto Scams to Avoid  Celsius’ promises were more realistic on the surface but similarly fragile under scrutiny. The platform promised depositors returns of up to 20% on deposits, and 8.8% on stablecoins like Tether’s USDT, while CEO Alex Mashinsky constantly downplayed any risk entailed by these strategies. Celsius initially claimed it could generate outsized yields by simply lending customer funds to institutions. Later, Celsius shifted strategy towards more plays on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which led to repeated catastrophes and ultimately to the recently disclosed $1.2 billion shortfall in Celsius’ balance sheet.  The difference between BitConnect and Celsius here is clear, and hilarious: BitConnect knew it was making unrealistic promises and appears to have simply funneled the bulk of its victims’ deposits directly into organizers’ pockets. Celsius behaved as if it actually believed its own outsized claims, executed real trades to try to achieve them and imploded.  Celsius’ approach seems clearly less criminal than BitConnect’s – but also vastly more stupid.  Not your coins, not your yield  The second obvious similarity between Celsius and BitConnect is that both required depositors to hand custody over their assets to a third party, and let that third party do effectively whatever it wanted with those assets. Celsius used that carte blanche to make a series of terrible bets on customers’ behalf, while BitConnect simply walked away with the cash – but for victims that difference probably doesn’t feel too significant.  Because a cryptocurrency like bitcoin is effectively impossible to freeze, handing it over on trust is a great way to lose it. It’s also a sharp contrast to today’s DeFi lending and liquidity protocols, which allow users to “trustlessly” retain control of the tokens they earn yield on, including withdrawing or reassigning them at their discretion.  Roll your own token  Both Celsius and BitConnect issued their own token, and both leveraged their token to mislead users about the returns they were receiving.  BitConnect victims were required to first trade their BTC for BitConnect’s token, BCC. They could then deposit the BCC with BitConnect to receive yield. This yield was also received in BCC, and to realize their gains users had to sell that BCC on the market.  Incredibly, Celsius engaged in very similar behavior with its own CEL token. Though it was only one option for receiving yield, Celsius offered users higher average percentage yields (APY) if they accepted it denominated in the in-house currency.  Printing their own token made it practically free for both Celsius and BitConnect to pay out what looked like “yield.” Also in both cases, the rising U.S. dollar value of the CEL and BCC tokens motivated users to both accept payments in those tokens and hold the tokens rather than selling them off for BTC or another hard currency.  But that’s the essence of the trick here: Both CEL and BCC were rising in value because of rising customer interest in high returns. But those returns were at least partly paid in those tokens themselves. In other words, fundamentally illusory token value in both cases incentivized deposit demand that wouldn’t have otherwise existed.  See also: How Crypto Lender Celsius Overheated  That Celsius was allowed to do this, as a U.S.-domiciled corporate entity, may be the biggest sign that regulators were negligently asleep at the wheel during its expansion.  It wasn’t about crypto  The most counterintuitive takeaway from both Celsius and BitConnect is that neither was fundamentally a “crypto scam” in the most common sense. The risk in both cases was exaggerated not by the involvement of blockchains, but by their absence.  Both Celsius and BitConnect claimed their trading activities couldn’t be made transparent for essentially strategic reasons. BitConnect’s “proprietary” trading bot certainly would have been worth stealing if it had ever actually existed. Celsius’ veil of secrecy, similarly, wouldn’t be unusual in the worlds of hedge funds or money management – a profitable trade, particularly a profitable arbitrage, usually needs to be concealed so that other traders don’t copy it and erode or eliminate returns.  But neither entity was actually concealing genius trading innovations. BitConnect was hiding outright theft, while Celsius was merely obfuscating rank incompetence. For instance, in what now looks like an active disinformation campaign, Celsius ran its latter-day DeFi trading through a social media front known as 0xb1. Based on its volume, the 0xB1 wallet and identity was presumed to be a massively wealthy individual “whale,” and was only revealed as a proxy for Celsius funds after the platform’s collapse. And, surprise surprise, 0xb1’s activities appear to have effectively lost hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds.  If the Celsius case finds its way to any sort of criminal action, it feels more likely to be related to unexplained individual acts, such as CEO Alex Mashinsky’s transfers of CEL tokens and other assets to his wife, than to the system’s overall design and misleading marketing. In part, Celsius’ confusing structure and rhetoric may actually help shield scrutiny, simply because it might take too much effort to convey to a jury.  But regulators who really want to protect savers from hidden risk or outright fraud should learn to pay better attention to obvious red flags. Maybe they’ll actually be able to stop it the third time around.  Or the fourth. Or the fifth.  We can only hope.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | ZRX,David Z.

42411102,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC8q5,1658941699,Sky-High Yields and Bright Red Flags: How Alex Mashinsky Went From Bashing Banks to Bankrupting Celsius,"Alex Mashinsky likes to wear a T-shirt. The T-shirt is black and carries a simple slogan: “Banks are not your friends.”  He wears the shirt often, or at least he used to. There are lots of cheeky T-shirts worn by Mashinsky, the 56-year-old founder of Celsius Network. At the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, for example, Mashinsky encouraged everyone to “party like a crypto whale” and swing by the Celsius booth to grab your “HODL T-shirt.”  That shirt has a sneaky triple meaning. First, there’s the word’s boozy typo origin story. Second there’s the joke that “HODL” means Hold On (to your crypto) for Dear Life. The Celsius shirt meant that and something extra. It implies you should HODL your funds in Celsius, specifically.  It’s a simple pitch: Why keep your crypto in a private wallet when you can park it with Celsius – nearly risk-free! – and sometimes earn over 18% yield?  Mashinsky, oozing confidence, wore the black HODL T-shirt as he explained the basics in an August 2021 interview with the influencer known as CTO Larsson. Mashinsky assured viewers that Celsius posed “much less risk” than banks, but still managed “to deliver high-single-digit or low-double-digit” returns.  Read More: What Happens to Celsius Creditors if Crypto Prices Recover?  How was that possible? How could Celsius have “much less risk” but provide eye-popping returns? It sounded too good to be true. Mashinsky explained that the differential in interest rates simply “shows how much these banks are stealing from you.”  How do they get those yields? That’s the question asked repeatedly by Steven McClurg, cofounder and chief investment officer of Valkyrie Investments. McClurg met with Mashinsky several times.  “We would ask them really simple questions like, ‘Who are your counterparties?’” McClurg said. He never received satisfactory answers.  “He really wouldn’t ever give any details, and we tried to do due diligence on them,” but “so many [red] flags came up” and “he just wouldn’t answer anything directly,” said McClurg. When he had asked these same kinds of questions to well-known crypto exchanges Gemini and Coinbase (COIN), he received solid answers. Not so with Mashinsky, which is one reason Valkyrie declined to work with Celsius.  Flash forward to July 2022.  Celsius, as reported, has now filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It acknowledged a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet. It blocked users from withdrawing funds. A separate lawsuit now accuses Celsius of “operating a Ponzi-scheme.” And on and on and on. (This timeline is a good primer.)  Mashinsky is now the man at the center of a perilous moment in crypto history, an event my CoinDesk colleague Oliver Knight described as analogous to the Lehman Brothers collapse of 2008, “the failure that exacerbates a market crisis.”  So just who is Alex Mashinsky?  The futurist  Mashinsky was born in Ukraine, raised in Israel and, in his telling of the story, he has been a serial inventor and entrepreneur for decades. Even a futurist, a la “Ironman” Tony Stark or Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.  Voice over Internet Protocol? Mashinsky says he helped invent it, claiming in a 2018 video that with VoIP “we created a new technology, a new platform, completely decentralized, completely autonomous to the phone lines infrastructure.”  As the founder of early VoIP company Arbinet, maybe he helped. But the actual inventor of VoIP is murky. National Inventors Hall of Fame inducted a woman named Dr. Marian Croak for advancing VoIP technology; BlackHistory.com credits Croak as the creator of VoIP, even if ""most people have no idea who she is.""  Mashinsky also claimed to have had the idea for Uber years before Uber, back in the era of Blackberry phones.  “Uber copied everything we had. We didn’t own a single car, we were [offering] cars on demand. We were the first app you could order a car on,” he once told Cointelegraph. “And yet we lost it all to Uber because they subsidized $14 billion worth of rides for millennials.”  Read More: Former Celsius Employee on the Crypto Lender’s Mismanagement and Alleged Token Manipulation  As for Mashinsky’s futurist chops? He burnished them by sharing, in that same interview, “My wife claims that I live in the future all by myself. And once in a while, society ends up coming to where I have been sitting on the road and waiting for them for a long time. But sometimes they go in a completely different direction.”  According to Mashinsky’s website, he has founded eight startups (Arbinet, Comgates, Elematics, Transitwireless, Governing Dynamics, GroundLink, Inseego and Celsius – and was generally also the chairman, CEO or managing partner), holds 50 patents, raised more than $1.5 billion with over $3 billion in exits, “and now leads the Celsius team with over $25 [billion] in crypto assets.”  Presumably he’s too busy talking to lawyers to tweak the copy on his website (Mashinsky has not responded to any of CoinDesk’s requests for comment for the past week), but that “$25 billion” is almost certainly inaccurate or outdated, given the market’s price collapse. And it might not be the only inaccuracy.  Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, told CoinDesk he saw red flags when he investigated Mashinsky’s impressive-sounding bio and found that “he didn't have $3 billion in exits and he didn't have the most successful [initial public offering] of 2004.”  Celsius has now been running for five years. The origin of the idea? A lesson for Mashinsky’s kids. “I have six children and I was shocked to find out that they did not know about ways to earn interest and ways to have your money work for you,” Mashinsky once told the news site Chipin. “So I decided to do something about it.”  Celsius’ journey is likely instructive for his kids, but perhaps not in the way that Mashinsky intended.  Mashinsky shilled the lure of Celsius at conferences. He shilled it in ask-me-anything sessions (AMA) on YouTube. He shilled it on Twitter. And he kept shilling it on those spunky black T-shirts. Even now, during bankruptcy proceedings, you can still scoop up the T-shirts as swag: black HODL T-shirts, “Banks are nor your friends” T-shirts, HODL golf shirts, HODL skateboards (which Mashinsky once brazenly hoisted on a video call after Celsius lost 35,000 ether (ETH), worth about $100 million at the time) and even “Unbank yourself” baby onesies – because you’re never too young to get risk-free high yields.  ‘The Machine’  Another of Mashinsky’s favorite T-shirts says “The Machine,” referring to his personal nickname and the lending machine of Celsius. It’s a magic contraption that spits out high-yield returns. Or at least it did until it didn’t.  It’s a machine that bitcoin (BTC) arch-nemesis Peter Schiff – to his credit, far earlier than most – attacked with a vengeance. In November 2021, back when the price of BTC was still above $50,000 and seemed on a glide path to the moon, Schiff questioned Mashinsky’s claims in a testy debate on Kitco News.  “How do you generate yield on bitcoin?” Schiff asked. “What do you do to generate income?”  Mashinsky shook his head, telling Schiff that he’d be “happy to spend an hour with you, to educate you.”  Schiff persisted. “What are you doing to generate that [yield]? You must be taking tremendous risk to generate those returns.”  Mashinsky said that he was “not giving financial advice” and then repeated one of the oldest saws in the crypto space: “It’s an amazing opportunity for people to unbank themselves.”  Schiff saw the opportunity. He pounced. “You know who also had an ‘amazing opportunity’? Bernie Madoff.”  Schiff, of course, was not alone in his skepticism. As early as 2019, lawyer Lawson Baker told CoinDesk that he saw Celsius’ lack of transparency about rehypothecation (the practice of borrowing against collateral posted by clients) as a red flag. Or in 2020, also for CoinDesk, reporter Nate DiCamillo pointed out almost comical discrepancies between Mashinsky’s own statements (“Celsius does not do non-collateralized loans”) and Celsius’ own policy (Celsius did, in fact, make non-collateralized loans), under a prescient headline “What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn’t Telling Its Depositors.”  Read More: Celsius Network 'Could Stick Around' After Bankruptcy, Restructuring Expert Says  Others smelled something foul. Ron Hammond, director of government relations at industry lobbying group the Blockchain Association, recently told CoinDesk’s First Mover TV that Celsius “was getting a pretty bad rep” in the regulatory circles of Washington D.C. People were concerned that “they’re not all they’re cracked up to be,” and “might be in violation of securities law,” Hammond said. Celsius applied to join the Blockchain Association but was rejected, according to Hammond.  Then there was the curious behavior of Mashinsky himself. “Anytime you ask him [Mashinsky] a direct question, he always kind of turns things around and talks about all the great things he’s done in the past, like inventing [VoIP],” said McClurg. “And he always goes on and on about all these patents he has.” That, in a way, felt like “just craziness.”  The way McClurg sees it, there are “two different sides” to Mashinsky when he’s in public. On the one hand, “he has this edge around him where he acts like he’s very busy, and he only has five minutes for you, and then five minutes for somebody else.” The other side? “It’s very charming.” Yet, McClurg found that the charm had a dash of narcissism. When McClurg spoke on panels with Mashinsky, “Alex always made himself the center of attention.”  Soon there was evidence of more shenanigans. In June 2022, the pseudonymous crypto researcher Crypto Joe, along with his partner Riley_GMI, found through on-chain analysis that “it was clear they were leveraged-up,” meaning Celsius was using the funds from depositors in a riskier way than it had disclosed.  Crypto Joe put it like this for a layperson. “If you go to your bank and deposit $100, you expect to be able to withdraw your $100 at any point, right? You expect your bank to be managing that $100 responsibly.”  He continued: “If you go to your bank and the bank says, ‘Sorry, we invested it in low-cap s**tcoins, and you now no longer have $100,’ you’d be pretty upset, right?”  Crypto Joe said that Celsius also required its clients “to send more capital to prevent them from being liquidated.” (He cited this screenshot as evidence.)  A lawsuit now accuses Mashinsky of operating a Ponzi scheme. In that suit, KeyFi, Inc. claims that Celsius leveraged “customer deposits to manipulate crypto-asset markets,” that it “failed to institute basic accounting controls,” was “desperately seeking a potential investment that could earn them more than they owed to their depositors,” and that, ultimately, the firm “does not have the assets on hand to meet its withdrawal obligations” which shows – alleges the lawsuit – that the “defendants were, in fact, operating a Ponzi scheme.”  New best friends  The next chapter for Mashinsky is very much in doubt, even among the bankruptcy experts.  “There haven’t been many crypto-related Chapter 11s,” said Daniel Gwen, an associate at Ropes & Gray LLP who specializes in restructuring. Adding to the confusion, Gwen said that Celsius “marketed itself like a bank” despite its slogan that “Banks are not your friends.” Yet, real banks in the U.S., for the most part, are “excluded from the bankruptcy process” because they’re “governed by state law insolvency processes.”  But banks –at least the Wall Street rather than Main Street kind – could be part of the endgame.  A few weeks ago it surfaced that Goldman Sachs (GS) was leading an investor group to buy distressed Celsius assets. It remains to be seen how that would play out in light of the subsequent filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. But Gwen said that Goldman’s involvement remains a “theoretical possibility.” In the end, for Mashinsky, maybe banks will be his very best friends.  Oh, and all of that Celsius swag you can buy? You can also get a HODL Celsius tote bag, which is even “an exclusive signed edition from Alex Mashinsky.” Maybe that’s the perfect gift.  Because ultimately, when all of this shakes out, it will likely be the customer who’s holding the bag.

42374160,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY4sT,1658941461,Bitcoin Maximalist Michael Saylor Makes the Case Against Ethereum,"ISTANBUL – Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor has questioned the soundness of Ethereum, both in terms of its technical development and its ethics.  Saylor, the founder and CEO of business-intelligence software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR), spoke remotely for close to an hour at Blockchain Economy Istanbul Wednesday, elaborating on the question of what he thought of Ethereum.  Saylor, whose MicroStrategy holds a stash of 129,218 bitcoin (BTC) worth about $2.8 billion at current prices, noted that he was speaking as an institutional investor and in that regard, one would ""have to wait until the protocol is complete."" He pointed out that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in a speech last week that Ethereum was 40% done and had laid out a roadmap of three to four years, which means the ""protocol doesn’t look like it's going to be completed or stable for another 36 months.""  Saylor also questioned the lack of time-tested information about Ethereum, saying it led to concerns about the protocol's technical reliability and security.  ""'Technically sound' means I need to see the protocol function for that thing after about five to 10 years. So we don’t know that, either. Right? Because if you are hard forking and changing it, every time you do a big upgrade, you introduce new attack surfaces"" he said.  In addition, Saylor cast doubt on the ethical soundness of Ethereum.  ""'Ethically sound' means I need to know that nobody could change [the protocol], which includes Vitalik. I need to know that no one at the Ethereum foundation, no individual can change the protocol because if they could change the protocol, it makes it a security and if it makes it a security, then it’s not going to become global money,"" Saylor said.

42411757,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgz1,1658940004,Autograph 101: What Are Autograph NFTs?,"Dubbed as “the future of fandom,” Autograph amplifies the entertainment and sports merchandising system in a more personal way: delivering exclusive non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to fans. The thing that makes Autograph NFTs unique is right there in its name: Each NFT is autographed by the player or celebrity as part of the NFT collectible.  What Autograph aims to do as an NFT project  The Autograph platform allows famous athletes and celebrities to develop their NFT collections of real-life experiences to engage with fans. Famous athletes, such as Tiger Woods and Rafael Nadal, are directly involved in crafting their NFTs apart from adding the final touch of their signature.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  Rather than mere illustrations, Autograph NFTs come as high-graphic digital representations. Some collectibles include limited edition magazines, interactive posters and digital figures of iconic game-breaking highlights.  NFTs beyond athletes  Autograph does not restrict NFTs to just athletes. The platform also includes special items from cult classic movies like ""Saw"" and R&B artist The Weeknd’s Billboard magazine cover.  Autograph promises to include more NFTs from all walks of life in entertainment, including gaming, music, TV series and books.  What differentiates Autograph from other NFT collections  Autograph focuses on pop culture memorabilia and nostalgic moments of sports history, tapping into specific sports stars’ fan followings. For example, Tom Brady may sell an NFT highlighting the intense duel between the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005. Legendary tennis player Rafael Nadal released the El Rey mystery container, including exclusive images from his past games.  As buyers cash into the nostalgia, they also earn rewards. The higher the bid, the greater the rewards from Autograph.  Another way to get Autograph NFTs is through its airdrops. Once a collection of NFTs is first introduced to the market, a “drop” date and time will appear as its release date. On the drop date, you can go to the DraftKings Marketplace to wait with other users to access your desired collectible.

Technically, you may look at Autograph as highly similar to other sports-based NFTs like NBA Top Shot or NFL All Day. However, Autograph focuses more on selling iconic moments as 3D-animated statues and adding motion-graphic elements to even the simplest collectibles like cards to create unique NFTs.  NBA Top Shot restricts itself to NBA-related digital products, such as NFTs of short in-game video highlights, whereas Sorare is a fantasy sports trading-card game that features the best soccer and MLB athletes.  How to get started on Autograph  The steps to get started in Autograph are simple.  1. Press the “connect” button on the homepage, as shown in the red box below.  2. Press the “Sign up” link as shown in the red box.  3. You can choose three ways to connect to your wallet on this screen. Make sure your wallet is compatible with either Ethereum or Polygon network.     Those are the three steps necessary to connect to the Autograph platform.  Is it worth purchasing Autograph NFTs?  If you are a die-hard fan of a specific individual in sports while believing in the value of NFTs, then Autograph is likely a good fit.  With big names like Wayne Gretzky, Naomi Osaka, Tony Hawk and Usain Bolt, you get an opportunity to own great highlights from superstar athletes and connect with other fans. The other unique thing about some Autograph NFTs is that they include a real-world utility feature, for instance, access to private Autograph events in the future or a ride-along with Dale Earnhardt Jr. or an exclusive Zoom call with the racing star. But even if you can’t afford the priciest NFTs with utility features, you can partake in sports legends’ iconic moments by owning their authenticated digital collectible.

42374171,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY52X,1658939055,Women’s Sports Leagues and Crypto: An Overlooked Investment Opportunity?,"The crypto industry has turned to sports to educate the masses. Over the last few years, sponsorships in male sports leagues have popped up in large chunks. For example, soccer’s FIFA World Cup is sponsored by trading platform crypto.com, the National Basketball Association’s (NBA) Golden State Warriors is sponsored by crypto exchange FTX and the National Football League’s (NFL) Dallas Cowboys is sponsored by financial services company blockchain.com.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  But while crypto companies have raced to grow their presence in male-dominated sports leagues, the space has not expanded as fast in the women's. Could this be because crypto is a male-dominated industry? Possibly. But by engaging with women’s leagues, an industry that is growing exponentially, the crypto economy also has enormous opportunity to educate new fanbases.  Women’s sports – an emerging target for investment?  In 2020, women’s sports globally received less than $1 billion in sponsorships, while $467 billion went towards men’s and mixed sports (including Olympic and Grand Slam tennis events). This enormous inequity is astounding, especially given the fact that women’s sports in the United States alone have enormous returns and active engagement from fans.  According to a Nielsen report, sponsorships in women’s sports have gone up by 146% since 2018, indicating that there is vast momentum and a dedicated audience following women’s leagues. Fans of women’s sports are also 25% more likely to buy sponsored products than fans of men’s sports, adding to a widespread sentiment that women’s sports fans are fiercely loyal to their favorite athletes and teams.  These stats, combined with surveys showing that sports fans have a higher degree of understanding of what cryptocurrencies are, makes breaking into the female leagues that much more pertinent for the crypto industry. A poll from 2021 by the Morning Consult, showed that sports fans are twice as likely as non-sports fans to have some knowledge about Bitcoin or Ethereum, and three times as likely to say they are very familiar with the workings of the crypto ecosystem. Overall, 47% of respondents (who are sports fans) said they are very familiar with crypto, compared to 39% of U.S. adults and 23% of non-sports fans.  Read More: Why Sports and Crypto Getting Together Is a Win-Win  But when you break down the audiences and their awareness of the crypto industry, those that are loyal to “niche leagues,” such as women’s leagues, follow the crypto industry more intently than those who actively follow the big four leagues: the NBA, NFL, National Hockey League and Major League Baseball.  According to the chart above by the Morning Consult, about 64% of respondents who identified as Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) fans, and 70% of Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) fans were familiar with cryptocurrencies, compared with fans of the NBA (52%), NHL (52%), MLB (47%) and NFL (45%). Women’s sports fans are clearly more familiar with the crypto industry than fans of men's leagues. And yet, the crypto world, like other sponsors of sports leagues, has not used the already familiar audience and growth of popularity of women’s sports in its favor.  State of crypto involvement in women’s sports  So why hasn’t the crypto industry put more resources toward sponsoring women’s sports? Probably because the industry is dominated by men, and so are the major leagues. Although there has been little engagement and sponsorship from crypto companies in women’s leagues, there are some partnerships that have paved the way.  Naomi Osaka, the No. 1 ranked tennis player in the WTA, signed an FTX sponsorship in March. In addition to wearing the FTX logo on her uniform, Osaka also receives equity stake and compensation in crypto from FTX. As Osaka said in the press release: ""Cryptocurrencies started with the goal of being accessible to everyone and breaking down barriers to entry. I'm excited to partner with FTX to get back to that mission and to innovate on new ways to reach more people and further democratize the space.""  Though Osaka is the first major female athlete to join FTX’s sports ambassador program, this is not her first venture into the crypto world: In August 2021, she released a limited non-fungible token (NFT) collection with online betting site DraftKings.  Coinbase and the Seattle Storm  Coinbase (COIN) and the WNBA have partnered to educate fans on the crypto ecosystem. One of Coinbase’s partners is the Seattle Storm, the four-time WNBA champion. The partnership is unique in the space as it is the first crypto sponsorship in the WNBA franchise, a league that has become more popular than ever.  Nate Silverman, the senior vice president for Corporate Partnerships and Social Responsibility for the Seattle Storm, told CoinDesk that women tend to get behind brands that support women’s teams, so reaching out to this audience makes sense.  Read More: WNBA 'Moments' Are Coming to Dapper Labs' NBA Top Shot  “You look at the WNBA, we're seeing attendance in gate numbers grow. We're seeing TV viewership grow. Partnership revenue is growing significantly across the league and for teams specifically. And so we also know that women tend to be the decision makers of households when it comes to family spending. And the typical crypto investor is male. So like any business it's obviously important to diversify our customer base. So the crypto industry can really capitalize on both the growth of women's professional sports, but then also appeal to women viewers, and women’s fans through investing in women's sports.”  ‘Change makers, disruptors and first movers’  The partnership between the Seattle Storm and Coinbase is mutually beneficial. The Seattle Storm exposes and educates its audience on the crypto economy, while Coinbase contributes to the team’s social justice Force4Change platform, which gives a voice to marginalized and underrepresented communities.  With the partnership, Coinbase identified that social justice is important to it, too. Within the Force 4 Change network, Coinbase has formed its own program, called “The Blockchain.” For every shot blocked by a Seattle Storm player, Coinbase will donate $70 to TechBridge, a nonprofit which focuses on STEM learning for girls grades 5-12 in underserved communities.  Jessica Williams, director of partnerships at Coinbase, told CoinDesk about the importance of the loyal fanbase and growing popularity of women’s sports: “Coinbase knows the passion, innovation and die-hard fandom behind the women’s leagues, especially the WNBA. As the brand aims to bridge the divide in crypto adoption and bring the next 100 million people into the crypto economy, it’s important to be able to get in front of this captive audience to educate and empower them.”  Williams added, “Women’s sports are filled with change makers, disruptors and first movers. They’re used to facing pushback and yet still moving forward and building something new. That ethos is true to crypto and central to Coinbase values, so it’s a great cultural fit to have the brand associated with women’s sports.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/27/womens-sports-leagues-and-crypto-an-overlooked-investment-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd85728db91693cb1f773b343e150c48ccb1a832-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In preparation, Ethereum has been undergoing a series of test, or shadow, forks, which copy data from the main network (mainnet) to a test environment network (testnet).  The fork occurred at 11:45 UTC (7:45 a.m. ET) when Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) was overridden at 54,892,065,290,522,348,390,492 at block 15217902.  The shadow fork brings the project one step closer to Ethereum's mainnet upgrade in September. The third and final testnet merge, Goerli, is expected to happen Aug. 10.  Ethereum DevOps Engineer Parithosh Jayanthi told CoinDesk that this shadow fork will test releases that approximate the releases that will be used in the Goerli merge.  As for why it happened earlier than expected, Jayanthi said there was a clear change in the hashrate, or computational power, that could have sped up the process.  This will not be the last mainnet shadow fork, and Ethereum will continue to run mainnet shadow forks until the Merge.  No significant glitches were reported.

The license from the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) allows Komainu to offer crypto products and services to institutional clients in Dubai.  Dubai is emerging as a key player in the crypto world. It established VARA as in March, and has already issued licenses to crypto exchanges FTX Europe, Binance and Bybit. Its emergence as a cryptocurrency center has been accelerated by tougher regulations in prominent crypto hubs like Singapore, where the city-state’s central bank and financial regulators are cracking down on some crypto activity.  Komainu, a joint venture between Japanese investment bank Nomura, digital asset manager CoinShares and digital asset security company Ledger founded in 2018, has already established a firm foothold in the Asia-Pacific region and is eyeing an expansion into the Middle East, according to Sebastian Widmann, Komainu’s head of strategy.  “Dubai and VARA are establishing a new hub for digital asset businesses and bringing like-minded companies into the country to help establish its growing crypto ecosystem, and we look forward to contributing to these exciting developments,” Widmann said in the statement.  Komainu declined to comment on when the company expected to receive final approval from VARA.  Dubai’s reputation as a tax-free commerce hub has also served as something of a siren call for companies, though that allure could fade as the emirate gears up to introduce a 9% income tax on businesses’ taxable income exceeding AED 375,000 ($102,000) in 2023.

42411099,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC8jT,1658933416,How a UFC Heavyweight Champion Became a Crypto Trailblazer,"Francis Ngannou, the Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight champion, made more money from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) than he did in the octagon last year.  The UFC reportedly paid him $580,000 for knocking out former heavyweight champion, Stipe Miocic, in the second round of their highly anticipated rematch. The two fought at UFC 260 in Las Vegas on March 27, 2021. Right after the victory, Ngannou dropped his first-ever NFT collection on NFT site MakerPlace, generating over $581,000 in sales.  Mixed martial arts is the fastest-growing sport in the U.S. and one of the fastest-growing sports in the world. Prize fighting has been around for millennia, but MMA in its current form can be traced back to November 1993 at UFC 1, where eight men practicing different martial arts were pitted against each other to determine which martial art would reign supreme. There were only three rules – no eye gouging, no biting and no shots to the groin.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  The sport has since evolved into a well-regulated multibillion-dollar industry. World-class athletes and Olympians compete against each other using striking and grappling techniques from a variety of disciplines. The one thing that hasn’t changed is the intensity and ferocity of the sport.  Ngannou, a musclebound behemoth standing at 6 feet, 4 inches tall and weighing 265 pounds, is uniquely built to deliver that ferocity. Ngannou has the hardest punch ever recorded on earth, registering a whopping 129,161 units on the PowerKube – a device that calculates punching power based on speed, force and accuracy. UFC President Dana White said, “That’s equal to getting hit by a Ford Escort going as fast as it can.”  Ngannou’s journey to the MMA throne  Ngannou’s first job was working in a sand mine in Batié, a small village in western Cameroon. He was only 10 years old, but his grandmother couldn't’ afford to take care of him, so working in a sand mine was his only option. He worked in sand mines until his late teens. Then one day, a friend showed him a YouTube video of a Mike Tyson bout.  After watching the clip, Ngannou had an epiphany and decided boxing was his destiny. He started training in boxing and eventually decided to pursue a professional boxing career in France. To get to Europe, Ngannou had to cross the treacherous Sahara Desert. He wound up homeless on the streets of Paris before serendipitously stumbling upon a mixed martial arts gym. The gym’s owner convinced him to try MMA instead of boxing, and the rest is history.  Ngannou’s team wanted to capture his journey from the sand mines of Batié to the UFC in an NFT. They knew millions of fans would be watching him on the night of March 27, 2021. The team recruited NFT artist BossLogic to create an art collection, aptly named, “March to the Throne.” The collection featured two pieces of artwork – an exclusive piece and a limited edition piece. The exclusive piece came with a pair of signed UFC gloves and sand from the mines Ngannou had worked in as a child.  Read More: Crypto.com to Pay Bitcoin Bonuses to UFC Fighters  Ngannou’s team decided to make the NFT collection more enticing by offering it to fans only if Ngannou won his title fight, which he did, in devastating fashion.  That pivotal victory turned Ngannou into a trailblazer – the first Cameroonian UFC champion and the first UFC fighter to mint his own NFTs. Marquel Martin, Ngannou’s manager and a crypto enthusiast himself, introduced the champ to NFTs in early 2021.  “I just told him to trust me,” Martin said, and Ngannou has been on board ever since.  Earlier this year, Ngannou posted a photo of himself sporting an NFT image of his most brutal knockout to date. The piece is part of a collection called UFC Strike – a collaboration between the UFC and NFT startup, Dapper Labs. The collection features fighters with the most impressive knockouts and pays those fighters 50% of revenue generated from NFT sales. Ngannou, a terrifying knockout artist, already has two pieces in the inaugural UFC Strike collection. The entire collection sold out the same day it went live.  Crypto and MMA: a match made in heaven?  The partnership between Dapper Labs and the UFC is part of a larger trend toward crypto and MMA collaborations. The Litecoin Foundation was the first crypto organization to sponsor a UFC event. The foundation paid to have the Litecoin logo placed on the octagon canvas for UFC 232 in December 2018.  There have been several other sponsorships since those early years. However, the most significant crypto sponsorship in MMA was the 10-year $175 million deal between the UFC and popular cryptocurrency exchange, Crypto.com. The deal was announced last July, and gave Crypto.com extensive branding rights over fighter apparel and content.  Read more: Litecoin Takes to the UFC Octagon in New Sponsorship Deal  MMA is the toughest sport in the world. It requires an incredible amount of resilience. Maybe that’s why Ngannou’s enthusiasm for crypto remains steadfast despite the current bear market. In an interview with CoinDesk, Ngannou said, “I’m still learning [about NFTs]. We have some big plans that we’ve been working on for a long time that we’re excited about.”  Ngannou’s crypto savvy extends beyond NFTs: He accepts bitcoin and ether payments. His thoughts on Bitcoin are surprisingly philosophical.  “I think Bitcoin is the best, although it’s down now. It’s like digital gold. I also think it can be a better option [than local fiat currencies] for some countries in Africa,” Ngannou said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LTC,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/27/how-a-ufc-heavyweight-champion-became-a-crypto-trailblazer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c30bb7b55e1e4cffee41867a1136d7ea461038a2-3322x2492.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411435,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlA7,1658933340,"Tribalism, Meritocracy, Money: What Sports and Crypto Fans Have in Common","Upon first glance, the crypto world and organized sports have little in common. One domain consists of elite athletes who earn a living from their physical prowess, while the other consists of techies who – to put it mildly – don’t. But a closer look reveals that being a sports fan and being a part of a Web3 community are in many ways alike.  One can even argue that being a diehard sports fan is the closest “old world” analog to being a passionate degen.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Sports Week."" Omid Malekan is the author of several books, including ""Re-Architecting Trust, the Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets and Platforms"" and ""The Story of the Blockchain, a Beginner's Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands"" and an associate professor in finance at Columbia Business School.  After all, both domains revolve around individuals who look past traditional social constructs to form a community based on a shared passion. Just as a popular team like the Golden State Warriors or Manchester United might attract millions of fans with unique backgrounds from all over the world, so can a crypto community like Bitcoin or Ethereum.  Both domains celebrate tribalism (up to a point), and the most rabid fans can be hostile toward members of a different tribe.  Sports and crypto also share a belief in meritocracy. Just as sports fans love the familiar story of an underdog who rises to the top on sheer talent and hustle, crypto embraces the entrepreneur without traditional credentials who creates something worthwhile.  See also: How New Technology is Impacting Sports  Last but certainly not least, money is an important factor in both worlds – for better and for worse.  These similarities help explain the convergence between pro sports and Web3. Prominent athletes like pro basketball player Spencer Dinwiddie and football star Tom Brady were among the earliest celebrities to publicly declare their support for Bitcoin, and a number of professional athletes now get some of their salary in crypto.  Blue-chip crypto companies like trading platform FTX have plowed millions into stadium naming rights, and the industry as a whole is a big spender on ads during major sporting events like the Super Bowl.  Revolutionizing fandom  More interesting are the ways blockchain technology can revolutionize fandom. Sports fans have always been avid collectors, and – unlike the skeptics who still shake their heads at non-fungible tokens having any value – have no problem ascribing significant value to a picture.  NFTs represent a leap forward for things like baseball cards. They are easier to store and buy and sell than a piece of cardboard, can represent other kinds of media and can be programmed to include special rights, such as access to VIP events.  On-chain provenance allows anyone to airdrop other assets to the current owner, introducing a new type of composability to fandom. The leagues and athletes who issue the digital memorabilia can in turn program them to collect a royalty whenever they change hands. Everything can interoperate with DeFi (decentralized finance).  Best of all, NFTs are instantly verifiable in ways that pieces of cardboard are not. Counterfeits are a major problem for physical collectibles, but now there’s a blockchain for that. Less sexy but potentially more transformative is the adoption of NFTs for ticketing.  See also: Sports Picked up the Web3 Ball. Now It's Ready to Run  Blockchain platforms are all about trust, and few domains are more lacking in trust than event ticketing. For proof, check out the exorbitant fees that secondary markets like StubHub charge to help fans avoid being cheated. Such fees will go away once ticketing is moved on chain, and may instead be replaced by a recurring royalty that helps cut down on scalping going back to the venue.  Like with most Web3 applications, the ultimate promise lies in new engagement models between teams, athletes and their fans. Sports teams can issue fungible fan tokens with embedded rights like discounted tickets or access to exclusive events. They can even promise to buy and burn those tokens with a portion of their revenue, turning them into a form of equity.  Tokenization, engaged  Tokenization introduces new sources of financing for teams and a new way for individual athletes to monetize future earnings. They also enable a more engaged fan base.  The tantalizing possibility of fan ownership brings us to the one area where sports and crypto differ. Whereas Web3 projects are community owned, sports teams are often owned by wealthy individuals, leading to bad incentives. Some owners see their team only as a status symbol or cash machine and don’t care about nonfinancial results.  Tokenization represents a different model, one where fans own and operate teams. Governance will be challenging (as it always is), but gone will be the days of negligent owners who don’t care about winning.  This model is already being tried in lower leagues and there is even a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) trying to buy a National Football League team.  The leagues will resist such democratization, but saying no to their own fans will become increasingly difficult once things like NFT ticketing, digital memorabilia and fan tokens go mainstream. And besides, as every fan knows, sometimes you just gotta believe.

FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. The term was first coined by American business magnate and investor Warren Buffett. FUD is a popular approach for scammers in the crypto space to spread bad information about a certain coin or venture to reduce the price so that they may buy it at a lower price. FUD tactics aim to convince people that they must buy a product or invest in a company before it&apos;s too late. This fear of missing out (FOMO) can be a powerful motivator, especially when people feel they might miss out on something big. However, FUD tactics can also backfire if people feel like they are being manipulated or tricked. In some cases, it can even create negative PR for a company. When investing, FUD is sometimes used to talk people out of buying a stock or cryptocurrency. For example, someone might say that a particular coin is about to crash and that you should sell it before it&apos;s too late. Or, they might try to spread rumors that a company is going bankrupt to drive down its stock price. FUD is also sometimes used as a strategy in business competition. For example, a company might try to spread FUD about a competitor&apos;s new product to make people hesitant to buy it. When Can FUD Occur? FUD can occur at any time, but it is most likely to happen when there is negative news or information about a company that in...",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/what-is-fud-strategy-and-its-impact-in-the-crypto-space/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-is-fud-strategy-and-its-impact-in-the-crypto-space,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42374145,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY4ed,1658933079,KuCoin Says It Has No Exposure to wLUNA Tokens,"Crypto exchange KuCoin has denied having exposure to luna tokens amid chatter the company was facing possible insolvency after the Terra ecosystem's collapse in mid-May.  Rumors of trouble at KuCoin are thanks to “otteroooo,” a crypto-related Twitter account that last week alleged the exchange held large quantities of wrapped luna (wLUNA) in its wallet addresses and suffered losses as LUNA prices fell 99.7%. The once-popular otteroooo account has since shut down.  Otteroooo claimed that KuCoin held wLuna, even though the exchange didn't offer deposit or withdrawal services for those tokens to its users. That, according to otterooo, meant KuCoin took on massive losses as it held a token that greatly lost its value.  In a blog post earlier this week, however, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu said that the exchange supported ERC-20 LUNA before and that the service was suspended in May. Lyu explained that the exchange offered wLuna to users during a time period between January 2021 and May, but swapped the tokens after the old luna tokens ceased to exist – thus providing a rationale for its wLuna holdings at the time.  “Most funds in KuCoin wallets do not belong to KuCoin; they belong to our users,” Lyu continued. “Having a LUNC wallet does not necessarily mean KuCoin as a company is holding lots of LUNC tokens, and I'm sure the difference is obvious.”  Lyu further stated that KuCoin’s recent $150 million fundraising round had nothing to do with Luna nor was it about the need for capital to pay off depositors.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Lyu said it was “quite disturbing” to see that a large part of the crypto community took the rumors being circulated on Twitter seriously.  “Builders in the industry do not want to see such an event happen,” Lyu said, adding that the current market situation “incited suspicion and we understand those prone to it.”  As a result, KuCoin launched an “Anti-FUD Fund” on Tuesday as an educational initiative to provide accurate information to community members and crypto users and to take legal action against those who start rumors.

42374148,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY4h9,1658931310,Cybersecurity Protocol Naoris Raises $11.5M to Build Decentralized Proof-of-Security Consensus Mechanism,"Portuguese cybersecurity protocol Naoris raised $11.5 million in an equity and token sale with participation from Tim Draper’s Draper Associates, Holt Xchange and other investors, the company said Wednesday.  According to CEO and founder David Carvalho, Naoris will use the funding to expand and scale its operations, creating a decentralized proof-of-security consensus mechanism by the end of 2022.  Carvalho, who has worked in cybersecurity for the past two decades, is building a multichain layer 2 and layer 3 protocol, building on security and decentralization. His team is addressing the “points of failure” for Web2 and Web3, helping cybersecurity pivot to blockchain technology.  Users will be allowed to create individual validator nodes in a cybersecurity mesh network, where peer-to-peer transactions are distributed across devices, furthering network decentralization.  Naoris is built on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which aids the protocol in executing transactions atop Ethereum. According to Carvalho, “from a cybersecurity perspective, it's probably the most audited piece of code in the space.”  With the upcoming Ethereum merge scheduled for September, Ethereum users are anticipating its switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, which some have said will lead to centralization of the chain.  Naoris is seeking to change this sentiment.  The EVM allows the network to operate on a secure foundation. According to Carvalho, the validators work “across verge clusters,” which can also be described as a shards of the chain, making nodes extremely difficult to breach.  Carvalho is targeting those seeking to transition from Web2 to Web3. Naoris' security features make decentralization ideal for users new to the space that have concerns about the privacy of data living on the blockchain.  He sees the current crypto bear market as an even better time to make a change.  “It has the effect of like clarity of mind. All the noise disappears, and suddenly people are interested,” Carvalho told CoinDesk.

Market Moves: Cathie Wood's Ark Invest unloads Coinbase shares as the stock price falls; MicroStrategy's stock tumbles 11%.  Chart of The Day: Balance of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) drops to an eight-month low  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) traded higher on Wednesday, as stocks rose and the dollar dipped ahead of an expected Federal Reserve rate increase.  The top cryptocurrency by market value changed hands at $21,300 during the early U.S. hours for a 0.8% gain on a 24-hour basis. Futures tied to the S&P 500 rose 0.4% alongside similar gains in the major European equity indexes. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, slipped 0.2% to 106.97.  The Fed is expected to announce a second consecutive 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point) rate hike at 2 p.m. ET (18:00 UTC). Some observers said that the impending rate hike is priced in already and that bitcoin could see a relief rally following the announcement.  ING analysts expect the rate hike to put a floor under the dollar.  “Unless the Fed sends some dovish signals along the lines of the July policy announcement, we think that the 75 basis-point rate hike can fit well into a largely supportive dollar narrative on the monetary side,” ING analysts wrote last week.  Any post-Fed dollar strength might not bode well for bitcoin, as historically the cryptocurrency has exhibited an inverse correlation with the greenback.  “Bitcoin’s fortunes are negatively correlated with the underlying strength of the U.S. dollar, and so moves downwards on any sign of dollar strength,” Bitfinex market analysts said in an email.  Ether rises  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, traded at $1,460, extending late Tuesday’s recovery from $1,350 to $1,440. Ethereum classic (ETC), an offshoot of ether, traded 14% higher, while the privacy-focused monero token (XMR) was up 7%. The losing side included such tokens as cosmos (ATOM), chainlink (LINK) and helium (HNT).  ONE, the native token of Harmony, an open-source blockchain for decentralized applications, traded 0.7% lower as developers proposed issuing ONE tokens to compensate for the losses from the hack of the platform's Horizon bridge in June.  In other news, the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is facing a federal investigation for a potential violation of U.S. sanctions by allowing users in Iran and elsewhere to buy and sell digital tokens. Marco Santori, Kraken’s chief legal officer, told CoinDesk the exchange wouldn't comment ""on specific discussions with regulators.""

Market Moves  Ark Invest Offloads Over 1.4M Coinbase Shares as COIN Price Falls; MSTR and MARA Drop 11%  By Greg Ahlstrand and Michael Bellusci  Three funds of noted investor Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management sold a total of more than 1.4 million shares of Coinbase Global on Tuesday, the firm said in its daily trading update email on Wednesday, Greg Ahlstrand and Michael Bellusci report.  The move comes almost three months after Ark bought more than half a million shares of the crypto exchange in May.  On Tuesday, Coinbase shares closed down 21% at $52.93. Based on that price, the value of the offloaded shares is over $75 million. Coinbase shares were trading 5.7% higher at $55.96 during after-hours trading.  “Coinbase was considered one of the better-run crypto companies that tried to obey the rules and work with the regulatory bodies,” Edward Moya, senior markets analyst at Oanda, said in a note Tuesday.  “The risk of tougher regulation has been a constant headache for crypto, and it seems that a couple of tough rulings could cripple a good portion of the crypto-verse. If some cryptos are deemed securities, that would make the life of so many brokerages so much harder,” Moya added.  Stocks of other crypto-related companies also fell on Tuesday. Shares of MicroStrategy, a software company that holds a large amount of bitcoin in its treasury, and Marathon Digital, a crypto mining company, declined about 11%.  Also read: Coinbase's 20% Decline Leads Crypto Names Lower Following Report of SEC Probe  Chart of the Day  The number of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) balance has declined to 236,434, the lowest since Nov. 8, 2021, according to Glassnode.  The tally has dropped 17.2% since the collapse of Terra in mid-May.  “It’s likely related to Celsius’ repayment of their WBTC loan, and following redemptions prior to Chapter 11, at least the sharp decline in early July,” Vetle Lunde, an analyst at Arcane Research, told CoinDesk.  WBTC is the first ERC-20 token backed 1:1 with bitcoin and designed to act as a representation of the top cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain.  Glassnode defines the WBTC balance as the amount of bitcoin held by BitGo, the custodian responsible for minting new WBTC ERC-20 tokens and guaranteeing backing of new ERC-20 tokens by actual BTC.

42374163,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY4xV,1658930400,"DeFi Has Become Crypto Crime’s Main Arena, Crystal Blockchain Says","More than $14.5 billion in crypto has been lost to hacks and scams since 2011, and DeFi (decentralized finance) is attackers’ new favorite target, says analytics firm Crystal Blockchain.  In the past 11 years, there have been 167 hacks of DeFi protocols and 123 security breaches on centralized exchanges, according to Crystal's new report. While breaching centralized platforms accounted for over $3.2 billion in crypto stolen, more than $4 billion was funneled out of exploited DeFi projects. The remaining billions were lost to scammers.  Since 2021, hackers’ attention has shifted notably toward decentralized protocols. This year, decentralized projects have been hacked 20 times more often than centralized ones, the report says, and funds stolen from the top 10 DeFi attacks exceeded $2.5 billion.  The main reason for the acceleration of attacks on DeFi projects is the sector’s growth, Nick Smart, Crystal’s director of blockchain intelligence and data, told CoinDesk. While projects are rushing to market with insufficient testing, centralized exchanges are improving their security, he said, bowing to user demand and heightened attention from regulators.  “There is a saying that nothing is unhackable – all you need is enough time, talent and creativity and you'll get there,” Smart said. “And some illegal hacking groups, like nation-state backed ones such as North Korea's Lazarus, are very effective and very focused on exploiting such opportunities.”  “The most popular method of crypto-theft until 2021 was the infiltration of crypto-exchange security systems – currently the tendency has moved to DeFi hacks,” the report says. “CEX hacks are currently causing the least amount of financial damage.” The largest-ever hack of a CEX (centralized exchange) is the 2018 Coincheck breach in which $535 million of NEM tokens were stolen.  The largest DeFi attack was March’s Ronin network hack, when more than $650 million's worth of crypto was funneled from the popular Axie Infinity NFT (non-fungible token) game and laundered through the Tornado Cash mixer. The service received around 350,000 ether (ETH) in the first half of 2022, which is more than half of all ETH that ever went through Tornado Cash, according to Crystal.  Read more: Ronin Attack Shows Cross-Chain Crypto Is a ‘Bridge’ Too Far  In addition to hacks, the crypto market has seen some 74 fraudulent schemes blow up since 2011, leading to more than $7.3 billion going to scammers, according to the report.  Another surging kind of crypto crime comes in the form of so-called rug pulls, whereby a project’s founders either run away with users’ money or dump the token they created on the community. Rug pulls became the most popular kind of fraud in 2022, Crystal said. Out of 36 cases of fraud, 34 were associated with rug pulls, mostly on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain network run by major global centralized exchange Binance. Twenty-three rug pulls out of 34 happened on BSC, Crystal said.  But in dollar terms, the most money has been stolen on the Ethereum blockchain – probably because it’s the most popular DeFi platform overall. It’s followed by Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom and Polygon, Crystal said.  On Ethereum, $31 million's worth of crypto had been stolen through scams and rug pulls, along with $26 million on Binance Smart Chain, $10 million on Solana and $2 million on Fantom.",NEGATIVE,ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/27/defi-has-become-crypto-crimes-main-arena-crystal-blockchain-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/867d401d20c91f6282afac0d29c9a7797e0ad621-1316x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bankman-Fried is a billionaire who co-founded the FTX crypto exchange.  Trustless works with content creators and organizations to help them tokenize their TV shows using non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Shows can use the NFT model partly to crowdfund productions with holders who receive access to watch the token-gated content and who can participate in productions with on-chain voting.  The New York-based company is testing its own mission statement with the release of “Coinage,” a Web3 TV show that critically examines the crypto industry.  Trustless calls its collection of ""Coinage"" NFTs an experiment in “building a governing community,” with token holders given access to an ad-free version of the show upon its eventual release.  “Despite all the data we have, it's never been harder for studios and networks to guess what will break through the noise and actually connect with subscribers old and new,"" Zack Guzman, co-founder of Trustless, said in the release.  The greater NFT television landscape remains in its infancy, though several companies and big-name celebrities have begun testing the new business model.  Actress Mila Kunis announced in March she would be producing an NFT-backed TV show called “The Gimmicks,” which follows her successful NFT show “Stoner Cats,” which was released last summer.

Even though it&apos;s not yet safe to call a market bottom, the recent news of the SEC investigation has sufficiently reflected in the stock price.

42374181,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY891,1658928495,"Direct Blockchain Scrutiny Can Spot Financial Hacks, but Not Easily, German Study Says","Regulators can better fight cybercrime by looking directly at the blockchain – but it will take a lot of extra effort, a study written for the German financial regulator BaFin has found.  Lawmakers and financial supervisors across the world are seeking to bring crypto technologies into the regulatory net, but some officials are now getting worried about taking on duties that lie way outside their usual wheelhouse.  Web3 advocates argue that distributed technologies can actually help public policy goals like collecting tax or fighting financial crime – as long as regulators learn how to use them properly. But the study suggests it may take some changes to working practices.  “In the field of crypto custody, it is quite possible to collect and automatically process public ledger data such as blockchain data,” said the report, which was written by researchers at the University of Innsbruck in Austria and published Tuesday. And the highly formulaic nature of the information makes it easy to process.  “Even data that is not collected from the supervised entities, but rather from public sources, can add value for IT supervision,” the researchers added, meaning regulators can spot cyberattacks directly rather than waiting for routine reporting.  But the resources needed to maintain and interpret the information stream is high, it noted – requiring a small team of officials working round the clock. Coping with that kind of workload could require BaFin to work with other German regulators such as the BSI, which is responsible for cybersecurity, or the finance ministry, the report said.  Read more: EU Banking Regulator Worries It Can’t Find the Staff to Regulate Crypto: Report  BaFin has long been responsible for supervising conventional financial institutions, such as banks, and more recently took crypto custodians like wallet providers under its wing.  The regulator said in a statement posted Tuesday that it had already implemented initial findings from the project, which examines more widely how digital technology is changing finance, such as allowing innovative payment providers to access banking data, with consequent risks of data hacks and power concentrated in a few big tech firms.  In an interview published Wednesday, EU bank regulator José Manuel Campa said he was worried he didn’t have the expertise needed to undertake new duties set out in the bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law, given the high demand for specialists in the field.

Nearly 100% of all votes cast were in favor of the plan.  The proposal had been scheduled to run until Oct. 3, but voting closed after support crossed the minimum 55% requirement.  Fantom currently burns – i.e., permanently removes from circulation – 30% of all tokens that are paid as network fees. Following the vote, one-third of that 30% fee value would be submitted to an “Ecosystem Support Vault” held via a Special Fee Contract (SFC).  The SFC is controlled by the Fantom network validators and stakers via on-chain governance and community proposals. The remaining two-thirds of transaction fees would be burned as usual.  Payments will initially be manually executed via the Fantom Foundation, using tools such as LlamaPay, to fund projects whose proposals are approved by the Ecosystem Vault.  Developers say community members must add vesting periods to the payments to ensure project founders are incentivized to work continuously, instead of receiving the payments at once and possibly losing interest.  Risks outlined by the now-passed proposal include malicious approvals of projects requesting funds from the Ecosystem Vault, influential entities or groups funding themselves or promoting projects they control and a project that overpromises and cannot deliver with the received funds.  Measures, however, are in place to combat those risks. “Fantom reserves the right to halt any payment stream indefinitely if fraudulent user activity is suspected or if the Foundation believes it presents a negative risk to the Fantom ecosystem,” developers said in the proposal.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FTM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/27/fantom-to-fund-ecosystem-projects-using-portion-of-burn-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/048fb67caf82c7e908d6f4ab394193c07cbc7b13-4736x3552.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393804,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBLYt,1658925000,Will Stablecoins Be Tethered to the Fed? Lawmakers Have Circled That Option,"Companies issuing stablecoins would have to deal with the Federal Reserve as the chief oversight agency, according to the current version of a bill being developed in the U.S. House of Representatives, say people familiar with the talks.  While the industry is desperate for rules and supervision to settle the uncertainties that keep most investors on the sidelines, stablecoin firms would be policed by an agency that devotes much of its time trying to keep Wall Street banks on a short leash. This change would be novel for the Fed and for the nonbank crypto businesses that have never had a federal supervisor.  Lawmakers in the House Financial Services Committee have found common ground on a bipartisan effort to establish stablecoin oversight in the U.S. It could mark a first step toward crypto regulation, though a few points remain to be hashed out. As it stands, naming the Fed as the government’s watchdog for stablecoin issuers is in the bill, said two people who asked not to be named because the legislation hasn’t yet been released. The details are still fluid, though, so the Fed’s role could shift.  “The Fed is the big fish in the pond of bank regulators and stablecoins are a big deal, so this isn't surprising,” said Ian Katz, a managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm. “There was always going to be a big role for the Fed in stablecoin oversight because of stablecoins' potential ramifications for the dollar.”  Committee leaders initially thought they’d be set to put out the bill this week, but a last-minute intervention from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen may have delayed it until after the August congressional recess, said another person familiar with that matter.  The Treasury Department is insisting that the bill address risks to customers’ money when crypto exchanges don’t take steps to wall off that money from the firms’ own assets. Meanwhile, Republicans objected to expanding the legislation, the person said. Lawmakers and their staffs will have the rest of the summer to work on the language, though the Fed’s role isn’t as controversial as other elements of the bill.  Stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, which are tied to the value of the dollar, represent a relatively small share of the $1 trillion in crypto’s overall market capitalization but are traded at very high volumes because they’re often used by investors to move in and out of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies.  If the House bill opens such nonbank issuers to Fed master accounts, “it makes sense that the Fed would play the role of primary federal supervisor,” said Alexandra Steinberg Barrage, a former senior official at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. who is now a regulatory lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine. And if the Fed is in charge of licensing nonbank stablecoin issuers, it puts “the payment, licensing and supervisory functions in one regulator.”  Dueling roles  Licensing financial institutions is a job more commonly associated with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which controls bank charters at the federal level.  When that agency was run by Trump administration appointee Brian Brooks, who is now the chief executive of Bitfury, the crypto industry enjoyed a brief period in which a government ally tried to open the door for digital assets in U.S. banking. But that halted with the arrival of Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, a self-described “crypto skeptic” who says the industry has an unhealthy “dependency on hype.”  As of last week, the Fed officially has a new vice chairman for supervision, Michael Barr. While the crypto world knows him as a former adviser to Ripple Labs, he’s also known to champion aggressive oversight of finance, so his view on regulating digital assets remains an open question. That question would certainly be answered if his agency is suddenly granted direct authority over who issues stablecoins, because he’d be taking a leading role.  The central bank has long regulated and supervised Wall Street banks, and it routinely weighs applications for new bank holding companies or changes in their businesses. But the Fed’s experience with nonbanks is tied to powers granted in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which said the agency is the watchdog for financial firms that another group – the Financial Stability Oversight Council – declares are threats to the country’s financial system.  In practical terms, though, there aren’t any firms on that list at the moment. The council has leaned away from using that power, so the Fed’s background is limited.  The chairwoman of the House committee, Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), negotiates with the panel’s ranking Republican, Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), and each seeks support from the members of their parties. So a proposal to empower the Fed would have to thread a political needle.  Republicans have spent years railing against the Fed's powers. Progressive groups would rather not see nonbank stablecoin issuers given legal legitimacy at all, so Democratic lawmakers aligned with them are likely to resist the legislation. Meanwhile, financial lobbyists on both sides have weighed in – crypto representatives eager to get something done and banking lobbyists defending their industry’s turf.  If it manages to survive the House, the bill's next hurdle could be Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. He’s highly distrustful of the crypto industry, but his views on this legislative effort aren’t yet clear. The top Republican on that panel, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), has proposed his own version of stablecoin legislation and has said he thinks a bipartisan bill can be negotiated this year. He is retiring from public office at the end of the current session.  Putting the Fed in the driver’s seat for stablecoins could also raise questions about whether the Securities and Exchange Commission would have a lesser role with those tokens. The Fed's involvement could be welcome news for cryptocurrency businesses that have an adversarial relationship with the SEC. Its chairman, Gary Gensler, has often declared that most crypto tokens meet his agency’s definition of securities that should be registered.  The Fed can be one of the world’s toughest financial regulators when it comes to expectations for capital reserves and liquidity minimums, which are expected in this bill. Keith Noreika, who once ran the OCC, cautioned against crypto advocates being in such a hurry to get regulated that they disregard the potential difficulties of being overseen by the Fed.  “Perhaps at this early stage it is better to evolve regulation of this new technology organically rather than create a monopoly federal gatekeeper that may inhibit innovation,” said Noreika, who recently took a senior role at Patomak Global Partners and expects to be working with crypto clients. The longtime regulatory lawyer said the central bank often takes a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation, which may have a “dramatically adverse impact” on stablecoin technology.  The Fed had a track record thanks to one of recent history’s most prominent stablecoin efforts: libra, which became diem. That would-be stablecoin – backed by Facebook (now Meta) and other tech heavyweights – negotiated with the Fed, among others, for months before U.S. authorities stepped in and the diem effort eventually collapsed.  “Unfortunately, the timing just wasn't right, and the messenger wasn't right, either,” said Kurt Hemecker, who was chief of staff and head of internal business operations for the diem effort.  Hemecker, who is now chief operating officer for the Mina Foundation, has no ill will over that episode, suggesting that – considering the central bank’s role in supervising the U.S. financial system – it “makes sense for the Fed to be the kind of overall regulator” for stablecoins.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/27/will-stablecoins-be-tethered-to-the-fed-lawmakers-have-circled-that-option,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25e3f2d23645a003caad9aed817188bb1615ad6a-2327x1745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374182,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY86V,1658923200,Chainalysis Courts US Government With New 'Solutions' Subsidiary,"Chainalysis, the best-known cryptocurrency-investigations firm, is spinning up a government-facing subsidiary in an expansion of the blockchain tracer’s multimillion-dollar business with the U.S. military, federal investigators and police forces.  America’s hodgepodge of state, local and federal agencies together buy more Chainalysis software than anyone else, the company told CoinDesk. They drive the lion’s share of Chainalysis’ business: providing data tools that demystify who is sending bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to whom – and where. It's how the government polices an illicit crypto economy that Chainalysis estimated at $14 billion last year.  “Chainalysis has charting capabilities that have been used to show investigators how bitcoin transactions are conducted and how they can be used as a tool to identify targets, the bitcoin exchanges they are using, and how to subpoena the exchanges for personally identifying information and bank information of targets,” the Drug Enforcement Administration explained in procurement documents for a 2019 contract worth nearly $135,000.  Nowadays, government crypto-investigations stretch far beyond bitcoin’s use in drug markets; ransomware attacks, terror groups and nation-state hackers are also in the mix. Chainalysis, helmed by CEO Michael Gronager, is a behind-the-scenes force in many of those investigations, be it through its software data-sets or its investigators.  The value of Chainalysis’ government business stretches into the tens of millions, according to government documents.  Agencies’ demand for investigative services has ballooned alongside the explosion in crypto crime. That prompted Chainalysis – as the largest provider of such services – to divvy up its corporate structure to better serve its biggest customers’ needs. Hence: Government Solutions, the new unit.  The division between Government Solutions and the Chainalysis mothership will help prevent client conflicts of interest, said Erin Plante, the company’s senior director of investigations.  Staff may double  The subsidiary will start with 90 staff investigators (the company has 110 total), many of whom have security clearances, said Plante. The corporate division makes it easier for those on-chain sleuths to work alongside agents who are hungry for assistance, she said.  “I wouldn't be surprised if we see double-the-team growth in the next six to 12 months,” Plante said.  Government agencies are becoming more savvy at on-chain investigations, she said. For one, they’re incorporating Chainalysis data-sets into their own proprietary sleuthing tools, which she said Chainalysis engineers help build.  “They’re looking at the raw data itself,” Plante said. “It goes beyond the user interface.”  Chainalysis’ own tools augment investigations by weaving together IP-address data sourced from its nodes, a robust wallet labeling database and address clustering, according to government contracts reviewed by CoinDesk. Some of its tools cater to private businesses such as exchanges.  Eric Scofield, whose data consultancy, Abaxx Associates, was acquired by Chainalysis in February, will lead the Government Solutions subsidiary, the company said.  “This ecosystem is changing faster than any other set in the national security sphere,” Scofield said.

42393814,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBMOB,1658921400,Ethereum’s Rollup Race: What is a ‘True’ zkEVM?,"Last week, a trio of announcements from Scroll, Matter Labs and Polygon all had something in common: Each company implied that it would be the “first” to bring a zkEVM to market.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  zkEVMs are a type of zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup – a “layer 2” network that runs atop Ethereum to process transactions, bundle them up and pass them back down to Ethereum’s layer 1 mainnet. ZK rollups use fancy cryptography to take some of the load off Ethereum’s highly trafficked layer 1 network. As a result, they promise to offer users cheaper transactions along with a host of other benefits.  Read more: The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups  zkEVMs all aspire to the same goal: creating a ZK rollup experience that feels exactly like using Ethereum’s layer 1 blockchain. This means developers should be able to port over their existing smart contracts without changing their code and without abandoning the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) tools that they are accustomed to using.  The EVM, rather than being one specific piece of hardware or software, is better understood as an amalgam of rules, standards and software packages. When shared across different computers running similar software, this shared set of standards coalesces into a network (Ethereum is one such network, although plenty of other blockchain networks have adopted versions of the EVM as well).  But how can three companies all claim to be the “first” to create a zkEVM? The answer comes down to how they each define what it means to create a true zkEVM.  zkEVMs  We won’t explain all of the different types of rollups in this article. For more on that – including the difference between Optimistic rollups and the more advanced ZK rollups discussed here – you can read last week’s edition of Valid Points and CoinDesk’s Layer 2 explainer.  Until now, zero-knowledge rollups have only been applied to a handful of use cases – like sending tokens between addresses or trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs). zkEVMs – zero-knowledge rollups that aim to support any Ethereum smart contract – were expected to be years away until just recently.  Compared quicker-to-market Optimistic rollups, general purpose zkEVMs offer a number of security and user experience benefits. In the future, they are expected to take over from Ethereum’s mainnet as the primary hub for Ethereum activity in the years to come.  Competing timelines  As for why three teams all seem to think they have the “first” zkEVM, it might be the case that they were genuinely unaware that their competitors were moving at a similar pace.  When Matter Labs said that it would be the first zkEVM to market in the first quarter of 2023, perhaps it didn’t realize Polygon was en route to launch its zkEVM test network as soon as this summer.  And maybe Polygon, when it announced that it would be the first zkEVM to market, didn’t realize zkSync was (apparently) prepared to launch on Ethereum’s mainnet by the end of this year – ahead of Polyon’s supposed plan to launch in early 2023.  Timelines in cryptoland are notoriously unreliable, and the roadmaps from Scroll, Matter Labs and Polygon should be taken with a grain of salt.  But timelines aren’t the only reason why Scroll, Matter Labs and Polygon all claim they will be the first zkEVM to market. Part of the disagreement comes down to how they define what makes a true zkEVM.  EVM-equivalent vs. EVM-compatible  Polygon faced criticism last week when it announced that it would be launching the first EVM-equivalent ZK rollup to market. According to some onlookers, Polygon’s solution would be better described as EVM-compatible, not EVM-equivalent.  So what is the difference between compatibility and equivalence?  The two leading Optimistic rollups for Ethereum, Artbitrum and Optimism, boast that they are EVM-equivalent. This means that the experience of developing on Arbitrum and Optimism is 100% identical to the experience of developing on Ethereum; developers have access to all of the same tools and frameworks that they use to develop on the Ethereum mainnet, and they won’t need to worry about their layer 1 contracts breaking if they are directly ported over to a layer 2 chain.  EVM-equivalence is a massive deal to developers since it means far less overhead when migrating from layer 1 to layer 2.  Users, too, see the benefits of EVM-equivalence. Rather than juggling rollup-specific wallets or other tools, users of EVM-equivalent chains, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, won’t need to abandon familiar apps like Metamask.  EVM-compatibility is a looser definition than EVM-equivalence. Rather than the developer and user experiences being exactly identical to that of Ethereum, EVM-compatible chains might not plug in to all of the same tools and software frameworks that are used on Ethereum.  Developers might need to rewrite their smart contracts in order to port them over to an EVM-compatible blockchain – sometimes in a completely different programming language than Ethereum’s native language, Solidity. Even if developers are still able to write their smart contracts using Solidity, certain operations might not be fully supported by the rollup, which can lead to bugs or other engineering headaches.  Although users might be able to send assets back and forth between the EVM-compatible rollup and Ethereum, doing so might require a specialized wallet rather than Metamask.  Is Polygon EVM-equivalent?  When Polygon announced that it would be bringing the first EVM-equivalent zkEVM to market last week, some onlookers pointed out that the specifications provided by Polygon would be better described as EVM-compatible, not EVM-equivalent.  In a June Twitter thread, Scroll’s Luozhu Zhang described three different types of zkEVMs: bytecode level, language level and consensus level. All of the applications announced last week fall into the first two categories.  zkSync 2.0 falls into the language-level bucket. Developers can write smart contracts in Solidity, but zkSync will transpile that code into another language called Yul behind the scenes, which it then interprets in order to do all of the fancy cryptography that powers the zero-knowledge rollup under the hood.  On the plus side, Matter Labs, the team behind zkSync, says that its system was engineered to provide the rollup certain advantages – particularly around how it generates computation-intensive cryptographic proofs.  On the negative end, zkSync, by most definitions, would be better described as EVM-compatible rather than EVM-equivalent. There’s a chance that zkSync won’t be 1:1 compatible with every single Ethereum tool out there, though Matter Labs insists that this shouldn’t be an issue in the long term.  Scroll and Polygon are both taking a bytecode-level approach to their zkEVMs.  These approaches rip out the transpiler step completely, meaning they don’t convert Solidity code into a separate language before it gets compiled and interpreted. This means better compatibility with the EVM. But even here, there are distinctions that may make Scroll more of a “true” zkEVM than Polygon, depending upon who you ask.  As Messari explained in a report released last week, “part of the [‘true’ EVM] debate follows whether the EVM bytecode is being executed directly or interpreted first and then executed. In other words, if a solution does not mirror official EVM specs, it cannot be considered a true zkEVM. Within this definition, Scroll might be considered a ‘true zkEVM’ vs. the others.”  According to Messari, “Polygon uses a new set of assembly codes to express each opcode, the human-readable translation of bytecode, which could allow the behavior of the code to be different on the EVM.”  In other words, Polygon might be a bit further from EVM equivalence than its main bytecode competitor, Scroll. Yet Polygon will argue that it’s precisely these differences that will allow it to provide a better product than its competitors.  Marketing in the metaverse  Last week’s zkEVM announcements represent impressive advances in technology, but, as crypto has proven time and time again, even highly technical concepts are not immune to marketing distortions.  At the end of the day though, slight technical distinctions – like the difference between EVM equivalence and compatibility – exist on a poorly defined spectrum.  As Scroll co-founder Sandy Peng told CoinDesk, “There isn't a clear consensus on any definitions. [Scroll’s] whole research team tends to gravitate towards a certain narrative or certain view on things, but it's by no means a definitive thing. There isn't even a consensus within our research team on what everything means.”  What’s even less clear (and probably less important) is who can rightfully claim to be the “first” zkEVM.  “‘First’ is a very philosophical concept,” Peng explained. “Whether you measure first being the first to announce or the first to start, or the first to achieve mainnet … it could be a couple of months or years to iron out all the kinks and debug.”  In the long term, it seems likely that all of the zkEVM solutions announced last week – along with several others we haven’t even heard about – will coalesce around new technologies and rollup solutions that make Ethereum vastly more accessible than it is today.  The competition around timelines and definitions is just a sideshow.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week.

42374173,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY7xh,1658920987,EY Has Built an Ethereum-Based Product to Help Firms Hit Carbon Accounting Goals,"EY, one of the world's four largest consulting and accounting firms, has built an Ethereum-based system to help big businesses manage their carbon footprints and satisfy environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandates.  The carbon tracking prototype, which builds on the firm’s existing supply chain traceability product suite, is known internally as “Ops-chain ESG,” said EY global blockchain leader (and CoinDesk columnist) Paul Brody.  Many first-wave enterprise blockchain projects worked within the constraints of closed-by-design shared ledgers, situations where it might make more sense to simply run a web server. The EY blockchain team, in contrast, has remained focused on how business users can leverage Ethereum, the public blockchain that allows content-rich applications to run on it.  In fact, the data privacy concerns that have hobbled many applications of enterprise blockchain, largely melt away when it comes to transparent carbon emission tracking and accounting, hence an explosion in interest from EY clients for the new product, Brody said in an interview.  “When it comes to tracking carbon outputs, companies want to show that they’re both properly tracking their carbon and properly offsetting it,” Brody said. “They’re very comfortable letting the whole world know that they are taking into account their full carbon footprint, so we’ve made a lot of progress.”  The challenge met by a tokenized approach is the need to get granular data for determining the carbon footprint of the many component parts of, say, a packet of medicine or a TV set or a mobile phone, said Brody.  Using the example of a phone, the various parts such as the display, battery, SIM card and CPU each have their own carbon footprint. Then there’s the additional carbon footprint associated with transporting the parts, assembling them and marketing the product.  “Blockchain tokens that represent a CPU made in Taiwan, for example, and a display from Japan can transcend boundaries allowing a sum of all the carbon footprint data and carbon offsets to be calculated including the footprint when the parts are married together,” said Brody. “It’s a really powerful tool because almost nothing that gets to your border these days is made entirely by one company, everything is an amalgamation of other companies.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/27/ey-has-built-an-ethereum-based-product-to-help-firms-hit-carbon-accounting-goals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ebe61ba15ac4470702a968ffac6596e2c4d34435-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 24-hour trading volume of Tezos is $42.67 million, indicating a rise of 30%. Past Performance of XTZ As mentioned in our previous analysis, the XTZ prices take a bullish turnaround after the retest of the broken resistance trendline. The post-retest reversal accounts for a 22% price jump and forms a rising channel pattern. However, a bearish turnaround from the resistance trendline at $1.75 decreases the support trendline.

42374175,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY80D,1658916570,Harmony Proposes Issuing ONE Tokens to Reimburse Victims of $100M Hack,"Developers behind blockchain network Harmony proposed issuing ONE tokens to cover losses from the hack of its Horizon bridge product in June.  “The Horizon bridge incident resulted in the loss of $99,340,030.00 worth of digital assets across approximately 65,000 wallets and 14 different asset types,” the developers said Wednesday in a proposal posted on the protocol's governance forum. “The Harmony team feels it is important for the overall strength of the ecosystem that harms to impacted wallets are mitigated in a manner that is feasible and most viable for the project.”  The developers presented two options. The first proposes an estimated 100% reimbursement with the minting of 4.97 billion ONE, which equates to 138 million tokens a month over a three-year period. The second proposes an estimated 50% reimbursement. That would see a minting of 2.48 billion ONE, or 69 million tokens monthly over the same period.  Both proposals are based on the current token price of 2 U.S. cents, meaning the reimbursement amount would not change if the ONE price was to fall further. That level is a 95% drop from ONE’s lifetime peak of 37 cents in October 2021.  Harmony said the stolen tokens caused contagion damage in the form of uncollectible loans “across a handful of DeFi lending protocols” in the Harmony ecosystem, referring to decentralized finance.  “Failing to resolve these uncollectible loans may result in DeFi lending protocols choosing to drop support for Harmony on their platforms,” developers explained. They added that 86 million ONE will be minted as part of the reimbursement plan, and distributed to “certain affected DeFi protocols” over the same three-year period.  Community voting on the proposals will start Aug. 1 on Harmony’s governance forum and close Aug. 15. Community responses were generally negative at writing time, with users concerned about the effect of increased token supply on ONE's price.  Harmony said it chose not to use its treasury funds to reimburse users as it was against “the interest of the longevity and wellbeing of the project.”  The Horizon bridge allowed users to exchange assets such as tokens, stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFT), among the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Harmony blockchains.

Past Performance of CHZ As mentioned in our previous analysis, the CHZ prices continue to struggle and maintain above the $0.10 mark.

42374183,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY85F,1658914255,Crypto Traders Split on Upcoming Fed Rate Hike's Impact on Bitcoin,"The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely raise the benchmark borrowing cost by 75 basis points (0.75%) on Wednesday in a continued effort to drain liquidity to tamp down inflation. Crypto traders are split on how bitcoin (BTC) would react to the rate hike.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset management firm Blofin, foresees a bitcoin price drop after the Fed lifts rates by 75 basis points (bps) to the 2.25%-2.5% window.  ""Considering that the overall risk level of the crypto market has not returned to a reasonable level, it is very likely that the BTC price will drop by more than 10% after the Fed rate hike,"" Ardern said.  The Fed's liquidity-sucking measures, such as rate hikes and balance sheet runoffs, have roiled asset markets in the past few months. Bitcoin has declined by over 50% since the central bank kicked off the tightening cycle in March.  ""Bitcoin and the broader crypto market may see another relief rally following the 75 basis point rate hike after which we expect markets to trade sideways, while ether (ETH) may outperform in anticipation of the merge,"" according to Dick Lo, founder and CEO of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategie.  Perhaps traditional and crypto markets have priced in the impending 75 basis points hike, with Fed officials hinting at such a move in recent weeks.  Bitcoin's price has dropped by 7% in the week leading up to Wednesday's Fed event. ""We are seeing participants taking a risk-off approach ahead of the [Federal Open Market Committee rate] decision as expected,"" Lo responded when asked about the pre-Fed flows in the crypto market.  At press time, the Fed fund futures, derivatives based on the benchmark interest rate, put the likelihood of a 75 bps move at 75%, alongside a 25% probability of a 100 bps hike.  Trader and analyst Alex Kruger said the crypto market could see a small rally following a 75 bps rate rise but warned of a decline should the central bank surprise with a 100 basis point move. However, Fed officials had pushed back against a full percentage point hike earlier this month.  Beyond rate hikes  The focus will be on how worried policymakers are about unemployment risks and the looming recession in Europe.  The market has convinced itself that inflation has peaked and the Fed will go for slower rate hikes after July, eventually cutting rate next year. That seems to be evident from the 28 bps drop in the 10-year Treasury yield in the past seven days. At press time, the yield stood near 2.8%.  Read: Rate Hike at Fed's July Meeting Provides a Credibility Test, With Cuts Already on Horizon  Risk assets, like bitcoin, could rally if the Fed's policy statement or Chair Jerome Powell sound increasingly concerned about recession risks, bolstering market expectations for a policy pivot (from tightening to easing) in 2023.  However, observers expect the Fed to retain its single-minded focus on controlling inflation while downplaying recession fears.  ""There is no doubt that Powell will pivot, but the pivot will not be this year, at least until November, and there will be no significant reduction in rate hikes (like 25 bps). The reason is that the Biden administration needs the Fed to join them in expressing its determination and confidence to fight inflation to win the midterm elections in November,"" Blofin's Ardern told CoinDesk.  According to Jon Turek, author of the Cheap Convexity blog, the Fed is likely to stick to the June script.  ""We are in this time inconsistency state where the Fed is reacting to June [Consumer Price Index] and the market is trading the European recession. The Fed will side with June CPI and I think to more of a degree than risk assets are suggesting right now,"" Turek said in a Fed preview published Tuesday.

42374193,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY8KL,1658912400,Top GOP Senator Slams SEC for Ignoring Crypto Turmoil,"Sen. Pat Toomey, a high-ranking member of the committee that oversees the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accused the regulator of not providing the oversight that could've prevented several crypto company collapses.  “Had the SEC responded to calls for clarity on how it would apply existing securities laws to novel digital assets and services, things could have been different,” the ranking Republican on the committee wrote Tuesday to SEC Chair Gary Gensler. “Companies could have adjusted product offerings accordingly, preventing investor losses today and the SEC would have been free to focus enforcement efforts on the worst actors.”  Toomey referenced firms that “often promised enormous, seemingly unsustainable interest rates to depositors, and at least one business allegedly engaged in risky practices.” In particular he mentioned Celsius Network, whose lending left billions of dollars of customer funds in limbo. Despite requests from the senator and other lawmakers – and crypto firms themselves – Toomey said the SEC has declined to offer sufficient clarity about what digital assets meet the definition of securities.  Gensler has said the definitions already provided by legal precedent make it clear that most digital tokens are securities, and the exchanges where they’re traded should register with his agency.  Toomey, who has been taking up the crypto cause repeatedly during his final months in office before retirement, asked several enforcement-related questions of the agency and requested details about its findings on managing the so-called Howey Test that defines securities. The letter calls for a response by Aug. 9.  In May, the senator made a different argument, that crypto firms should be allowed to collapse, which he said is a natural part of the financial system.  “It’ll probably take some failures in this space in order for the market to figure out what works,” he’d said at the time the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) floundered.  Amanda Thompson, a spokeswoman for Toomey, said there's a distinction between oversight of stablecoins such as UST and that of firms like Celsius and Voyager Digital, where the SEC has some enforcement history and which clearly offered an expectation of profits – one of the tests to determine securities the SEC should regulate. She said it's ""unfair to imply he’s contradicting himself.""  Toomey has also previously cautioned against aggressive investor protection moves by the SEC. Last year, in defense of digital trading technologies, the lawmaker urged the agency “to proceed cautiously and avoid the temptation to pursue paternalistic regulations that restrict investor freedom under the guise of investor protection.”  UPDATE (July 27, 2022, 15:10 UTC): Adds a response from Toomey spokeswoman.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/27/top-gop-senator-slams-sec-for-ignoring-crypto-inferno,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/352c4e4ed8dadc230422a96209f78965bf113a0a-5331x3998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Campa told the FT that in three years crypto may have ""moved and transformed into other uses that I cannot anticipate.""  The EBA is worried about planning the logistics of enforcing its new powers because it won’t know which cryptocurrencies it will supervise till 2025 nears, Campa told the FT.

Key Technical Points: The XMR prices jumped by 7.03% in the last 24 hours. The consolidation range between $137 and $155 sustains between the 50 and 100-day EMAs. The 24-hour trading volume of Monero is $162 million, indicating a rise of 35%. Past Performance of XMR As mentioned in our previous analysis, the XMR prices sustain the wedge breakout rally and are forming a rising channel pattern. However, the price struggles to get to $175 because of the supply pressure building up close to the resistance trendline of the channel. In the end, the prices recover from the support trendline but struggle to exceed $155. Source - Tradingview XMR Technical Analysis The bull market resuming its upward momentum within the XMR price chart will face unfavorable selling pressure at the $155 horizontal mark. However, traders may discover a lucrative breakout entry point when the buyers can overcome the supply flow. The market value of the Monero token is well over the 50-day SMA that cushions bearish attacks. But the bullish breakout from the resistance trendline will confront the 100-day SMA, acting as a bearish threshold. The MACD and signal lines join after the bearish attack and then diverge again to return to the bearish alignment in case prices do not surpass $265.

Key Technical Points: The ETC prices jumped by 7.03% in the last 24 hours. The consolidation range between $22 and $28 sustains between the 100 and 200-day EMAs. The 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum Classic is $907 million, indicating a drop of 0.12%. Past Performance of ETC As mentioned in our previous analysis, the ETC prices struggle to surpass the 200-day EMA at the $28 mark. The consolidation range forms with the support of the 100-day SMA and the $22 support level and has kept the trend constrained for the last week. However, the higher price rejection candles near the 200-day SMA reflect a stronger bearish position.

However, the failed bullish breakout attempts warn traders to wait for a price action confirmation.

The 24-hour trading volume of Binance is $912 million, indicating a drop of 8.52%.
