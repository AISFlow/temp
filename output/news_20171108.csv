42428034,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5aJh,1510182316,Relief and Disbelief: Bitcoin Reacts to Sudden '2x' Suspension,"The tweets came fast and furious, almost quicker than the articulation.  After months of anger and debate, a group of businesses and mining firms that use bitcoin’s software to provide services suddenly shuttered an attempt at changing its rules. Scheduled to be introduced in mid-November, the Segwit2x software had emerged as a controversial bogeyman, a cloud of uncertainty over bitcoin’s future, that quickly gave way.  Among those who had for months spoken out against the proposal, and what they perceived as a broken understanding of how protocol development should proceed, euphoria was evident.  ""Segwit2x hardfork has been called off! Common sense prevails,"" exclaimed litecoin creator Charlie Lee. “Put a fork in it, it’s done,” tweeted author Andreas Antonopoulos.  Developer Akin Fernandez, one of a legion of bloggers who have stood staunchly against the proposal, tweeted succinctly:  “Bitcoin wins.”  Indeed, the strongest voices in the initial reaction were those who had joined a long-simmering protest movement called ""NO2X,"" which accumulated the support of dozens of companies and users, who displayed their opposition by adding a prefix to their social media names.  The social media behavior, launched in the wake of Segwit2x’s announcement in May, did much to highlight the differing perspectives of the proposal.  An open-source software that requires a diversity of stakeholders to agree to its rules to operate – bitcoin’s major companies, developers and mining pools have each taken a different view of development and how decisions about updates should be made.  Forged in an invite-only meeting, criticisms of Segwit2x came largely from developers, many of whom didn’t necessarily object to the idea larger blocks were needed, but a culture that had sprung up around startups that largely lacked a frame of reference for how network changes had been made, or even the various ways in which changes could be made.  As such, the news could be read as a culmination of a debate that began in 2015, when former bitcoin maintainer Gavin Andresen sought to galvanize interest in a block size change. Since then, several attempts have been made to tweak this aspect of the software.  However, despite its stakeholder support, Segwit2x now joins bitcoin classic, bitcoin unlimited and bitcoin-xt as proposed softwares to fail to gain adoption based on the idea.  Unexpected relief  That said, even many of Segwit2x's advocates were relieved the agreement was suspended.  ""I am glad it is over,"" said Guy Corem, a former miner who signed the original Segwit2x agreement in May. ""It was the right call.""  Others hinted at the hostility their public support had brought, and the tactics used by supporters of the ""NO2X"" segment. Members of the group were often criticized for disparaging remarks and attacks made against Segwit2x supporters.  ""I guess I can now pay more attention to more fruitful technical pursuits than following the news and fighting trolls online,"" said Segwit2x developer Jean-Pierre Rupp.  The acrimonious debate has been almost non-stop on social media channels such as Reddit and Twitter, at the peak leading to alleged death threats.  Due in part to this environment, there was a sense the Segwit2x proposal was not as welcomed by the community as participants had originally expected.  ""We're relieved. The goal of the NYA was to bring the community together and keep the majority of the users on the same chain for at least a little while longer,"" Peter Smith, CEO of cryptocurrency software provider Blockchain, wrote in a blog post.  Others argued much the same – that a hard fork to increase the block size makes sense, but only if the agreement achieves support from all corners of the ecosystem.  ""We are big fans of increasing the block size, as our customer really get impacted by the fees, but we want to see it done in a responsible way that brings the entire community together, and takes into account more voices,"" said Coins.ph founder and CEO Ron Hose.  New solutions  Still, there's a strong sense that bitcoin still needs to scale, somehow, in the future, as it seeks to accommodate new users.  “We'll either bring bigger blocks to people [with bitcoin], or we'll bring the people to bigger blocks [on bitcoin cash],” developer Peter Rizun told CoinDesk.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the news that a block size increase would not be pursued was highly praised by supporters of the Lightning Network, a proposed off-chain microtransaction network that seeks to move bitcoin transactions off the blockchain itself.  ""Now that 2x is officially donezo, excited to get back to work building long term solutions like Lightning!"" Lightning CEO Elizabeth Stark tweeted.  However, while the news today could position Lightning as a likely solution, the big advances that appear needed to get the network off the ground are now likely to come under scrutiny.  On display at Scaling Bitcoin, a two-day technical conference at Stanford University this weekend, were the challenges yet to be solved with the technology. This includes ensuring privacy in transactions and better understanding the economics of their interactions.  As noted by Hebrew University's Aviv Zohar, presenting new work on the subject, larger blocks may ultimately be needed to optimize the network.  In this way, speculation is already building that Lightning will not be enough, or that it will take too long to take off. As such, some think that businesses will embrace alternative protocols such as bitcoin cash, an alternative bitcoin with a larger block size, or litecoin, founded in 2012 as a vehicle for faster merchant payments.  ""We may start seeing more and more businesses move to bitcoin cash for on-chain transactions, due to the high cost of transacting on bitcoin, which is what Segwi2x was attempting to solve,"" Civic CEO and co-founder Vinny Lingham told CoinDesk.  Jake Smith, Bitcoin.com’s business developer and a long-time supporter of on-chain scaling, said he sold his bitcoin immediately after the news hit. His comments, while brief, showcase how supporters drawn to bitcoin’s possibilities as a peer-to-peer cash have been put off by the news.  ""Bitcoin just signed it’s own death warrant, as far as I’m concerned,"" Smith added.  Likewise, OpenBazaar lead developer Chris Pacia, whose company moved to distance itself from the proposal last week, said more companies would likely turn to other options.  ""[Segwit2x] didn't really make sense after the bitcoin cash fork,” he said.  Not the last  But while there is temporary relief, there is also new thinking about bitcoin's future.  The key thing that sets bitcoin apart, to many, is that it's a decentralized, digital way to move value that no one entity controls. And to some, Segwit2x’s failure simply showcase’s the strength of the technology in defending against influences that could undermine this.  Bitcoin developer Bashco pointed to the long line of attempts to increase the block size or undermine developers via such proposals, implying there will be others down the line.  ""They will lick their wounds and regroup,"" the developer told CoinDesk.  This view speaks to the idea Segwit2x was best considered as an attempted ""takeover"" of bitcoin, in that developers behind it wanted to rewrite the cryptocurrency's rules without getting full agreement from the community.  A controversial move was also the decision by Segwit2x developers to remove code that constituted what has been described as “replay protection,” meaning the fork could have been executed in such a way that user funds could have been at risk if two chains emerged.  Still, some used the news to call for changes to the culture and community, especially those that keep in mind how governments or authorities could use similar methods to corrupt or harm the protocol in the years to come.  ""[W]e must continue with the research into forks and chain splits and building tools and defenses because it will almost certainly be tried again,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo, who had publicly feuded with high-profile members of the Segwit2x group, voiced a similar opinion that sought to appeal to unity.  ""Let's take Segwit2x's failure as a learning experience – bitcoin's community is strong, and needs to broadly support any changes to bitcoin's consensus rules,"" he tweeted.  Others were more grandiose, hinting at the expansive narrative that has seemed to shroud what some outside the industry may see as a benign numerical change.  Pseudonymous bitcoin blogger WhalePanda tweeted:  ""We won this battle ... but they will keep coming to destroy bitcoin. We will not forget.”  Microphone image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Pete Rizzo and Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/11/08/relief-and-disbelief-bitcoin-reacts-to-sudden-2x-suspension,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15f80e913c1d27f20fd8a8fb2c15f4b346e529a9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428047,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5anh,1510177521,"Where to, Bitcoin? Price Sees $1,000 Spread As '2x' Averted","It turns out it wasn't your average ""sell the news"" event.  While bitcoin set a new all-time high of $7,879 in the aftermath of affirmation a controversial software proposal had been scrapped, its price fell just as quickly, erasing gains to hit a low of $7,070. But for analysts, the $1,000 range was a case of bitcoin's traders pricing in complex news: a group of miners and businesses would no longer seek to update bitcoin's software or otherwise form their own cryptocurrency.  In this way, market observers admitted the charts showcased something that hasn't been seen since September when China moved to ban ICOs and shutter its crypto exchanges – an unexpected shock.  As profiled by CoinDesk, the software proposal called Segwit2x, had been expected to be introduced to the network in mid-November, and many new buyers were said to have been allocating capital into bitcoin in anticipation of a split, thinking new coins would be created.  Yet, with the prospect of a quick dividend off the table, a look at cryptocurrency pricing service CoinMarketCap reveals a sea of assets in the green, as traders moved elsewhere in the market.  ""Everyone was selling alts [alternative cryptocurrencies] and buying BTC. Now we are unwinding that,"" said BTC VIX, the organizer of bitcoin trading group Whale Club.  Others, like Nejc Kodric, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp, noted it appears the news resulted in dissatisfaction for those thinking they could win big with a quick purchase before a split.  Kodric told CoinDesk:  ""I think 2x was a big cloud of uncertainty which now went away ... some like it, some were just in it for the airdrop.""  Others suggest it simply could have been the case that any development in the market was enough to spook new buyers.  Driven to bitcoin by its now nearly 700 percent gains on the year (or the news that major derivatives companies are looking to the market to launch new products), they simply may have lacked the ability to make a strong determination of how they felt about the event.  Such a view was put forward by Tim Enneking, managing director of the hedge fund Crypto Asset Management.  ""I don't think most people understood enough about the fork to understand the implications,"" he said.  The beneficiaries?  Still, with the market rally cooled, there were also attempts to determine how the news could reshape the relationships between available blockchains with publicly traded tokens.  Amos Meiri, CEO of Colu, a startup seeking to encourage the business adoption of local cryptocurrencies, noted the decision is likely to push startups that were inclined toward the Segwit2x proposal, to other options.  Still, even while he was against the measure, Meiri acknowledged that, for many of his bitcoin business peers, the scrapping of further Segwit2x scaling is cause for concern for which those businesses could actively seek other solutions.  For instance, on Twitter, there was talk about what the move could mean for litecoin and bitcoin cash, both blockchain communities that appear to define their protocol as a vehicle for peer-to-peer payments, though neither rose very much on the day. Bitcoin cash, created after an August fork of the bitcoin blockchain was down roughly 5 percent, while litecoin, which launched in 2012 to offer merchants faster payments, was up just 0.21 percent.  However, there are those who believe these cryptocurrencies may soon become more valuable to a new group of users disenfranchised with the state of bitcoin.  Jake Smith, manager of Bitcoin.com, an interactive web portal for cryptocurrency, called today's events ""great news for bitcoin cash.""  ""Businesses will start flipping. High fees hurting a lot of businesses,"" he continued.  As such, the statements set up for what could be further price discovery in the market ahead.

In his full remarks, he went on to characterize tokens issued for startup or open-source project fundraising as ripe for misconduct, mentioning them alongside penny stocks and hidden fees on investment products.  He told attendees:  ""[I]nvestors often do not appreciate that ICO insiders and management have access to immediate liquidity, as do larger investors, who may purchase tokens at favorable prices. Trading of tokens on these platforms is susceptible to price manipulation and other fraudulent trading practices.""  Citing the SEC's findings from its examination of the DAO meltdown, Clayton also reiterated that cryptocurrency exchanges need to either be registered or get an exemption.  He added that ""the Commission will continue to seek clarity for investors on how tokens are listed on these exchanges and the standards for listing; how tokens are valued; and what protections are in place for market integrity and investor protection.""  The SEC chairman described penny stocks and ICOs as ""topics that have proven over time to be fertile ground for fraud on investors,"" though he admitted further policy is needed on the issue.

Known for its strong early support from bitcoin startups and mining pools, the plan, called Segwit2x, or simply '2x,' was to trigger a block size increase at block 494,784, expected to occur on or around November 16th. The goal of the project, according to those involved, was to use the measure to increase bitcoin's transaction capacity, which is today constrained by the nature of the software's rules.  The suspension was announced today in an email written by Mike Belshe, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin wallet software provider BitGo. One of the leaders of the Segwit2x project, he argued that the scaling proposal is too controversial to move forward.  He wrote:  ""Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x.""  ""Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade,"" he added.  The note is also signed by companies that originally supported the plan, forged at an in-person meeting in May, including Xapo CEO Wences Casares, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, Bloq CEO and co-founder Jeff Garzik, Blockchain CEO and co-founder Peter Smith and Shapeshift CEO and founder Erik Voorhees.  The group said that it still hopes the block size will be increased further down the line, once there is more agreement from stakeholders.  In statements to the BTC1 Slack group, developer Jeff Garzik said the alternative software would continue to be developed, and that it may support ""other chains such as bitcoin cash, litecoin and other bitcoin-family chains.""

42380036,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ljl3,1510153252,Litecoin Price Looks Northwards Amid Korean Volume Spike,"Litecoin got its mojo back this week.  Having spent a better part of the last month defending the key trend line support, the cryptocurrency is finally exploring above the $60 mark – clocking a three-week high of $63.71 yesterday.  At press time, the litecoin-U.S. dollar (LTC/USD) exchange rate is at $62.00 levels. As per CoinMarketCap, LTC has seen a 7.46 percent appreciation in value over the last 24 hours. On a weekly basis, it's up 13.38 percent.  So what's behind the sudden rally?  Some in the investor community believe that South Korean exchange Coinone's decision to add LTC to its platform is the primary reason for the spike in prices. The argument has substance, as Coinone is one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the country – now the world's third largest cryptocurrency market.  CoinMarketCap  data indicates the rally has been fuelled by exchanges offering trading in litecoin/South Korean won pairs. Volumes on Bithumb, one of the biggest exchanges in South Korea, have gone up by 26.89 percent in the last 24 hours.  More generally, a 200 percent surge in trading volumes across all exchanges would seem to indicate that the price rally could have legs.  Elsewhere, an argument could also be put forward that litecoin may be seen as a safe haven for jittery bitcoin traders amid the uncertainty surrounding the fast-approaching Segwit2x hard fork.  Indeed, the price action analysis favors further upside for litecoin.  Litecoin chart  The above chart shows:  The trend line drawn from the Sep. 21 low and Oct. 9 low acted as a strong support over the last month.  Currently, LTC is trading above the trend line sloping upwards from the Mar. 30 low and May. 27 low.  The relative strength index is above 50.00 (bullish) and pointing upwards.  View  The spike above $60 yesterday and the move above the long-term trend line level today, coupled with the bullish RSI, indicate potential for a rally to $69.59 (Oct. 15 high). A violation there would expose the expanding channel ceiling seen today at $85.70 levels.  On the downside, only a break below the trend line drawn from the Sep. 21 low and Oct. 9 low would confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change and may open up downside towards $45.18 (Sep. 21 low).

15990355,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/what-is-a-bitcoin,1510152752,What is a Bitcoin?,"An introduction to the bitcoin currency The bitcoin digital payment currency was launched in 2009 by an anonymous individual simply known under the alias 'Satoshi Nakamoto'. It started as an open source software but has grown to become a digital currency which is now used across the globe. The currency is the first decentralised cryptocurrency. Instead of a central administration, the currency relies on transactions which take place directly between peers, without the need for an intermediary management process, such as a bank. In order to verify these transactions, network nodes are recorded in a publicly accessible ledger, which is known as a blockchain. Bitcoins are created though mining, which is a reward process. The currency can then be exchanged for other services, products or even traditional currencies. The bitcoin is gradually becoming accepted by an increasing number of merchants as payment. However, the majority of bitcoin owners are holding on to the currency as an investment. History of the bitcoin The first mention of bitcoin was on 18th August 2008, when the bitcoin.org domain name was created. This was closely followed by an academic paper written by Nakamoto, which introduced bitcoin as a peer to peer electronic currency. Over the remainder of 2008 the information spread across cryptography networks and in January 2009 Nakamoto released the bitcoin open source code. The first bitcoin was purchased by Nakamoto who mined the genesis block for 50 bitcoins. Nakamoto mined a further 1 million bitcoins before disappearing - currently his identity is still unknown. Today, Gavin Andresen is the lead developer of the Bitcoin Foundation and stands as the community's public face. On 1st August 2017 the bitcoin currency was split into two digital currencies known as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and the classic bitcoin (BTC). Why is Satoshi Nakamoto anonymous? It is thought that there are two reasons for Nakamoto keeping his or her identity unknown. The first is for privacy, as bitcoin becomes more popular across the world it is likely the founder would be subjected to large amounts of media coverage. The second reason is safety, due to the large values of currency involved. In the first year of bitcoin mining it is estimated that around $900 million worth of bitcoins were created. During this period it is likely that Nakamoto was one of only a handful of miners, which means he would have benefited significantly. The vast amounts of money involved could make Nakamoto a target for criminals. Why is bitcoin so popular? Bitcoin is seen by many people as the first successfully implemented distributed cryptocurrency. It is based upon the idea that a currency can be any object or record that can be accepted as payment for services or goods. The bitcoin currency is designed around the use of cryptography to manage the transfer and creation of currency, instead of relying upon one central authority. This means that many people benefit from the ease of transferring funds across the internet without the reliance of a third party, which demand high transaction fees. Why are bitcoins seen as valuable? Many holders of bitcoin have purchased or invested because it is a useful currency and it is scarce. Although they are scarce, the value relies heavily on the public's confidence in the currency. As an increasing number of merchants begin to accept bitcoin, the trust increases - this means the value also rises in line with this. How to get started with bitcoin If you are new to bitcoin it is not essential to understand the minor technical details. Most new users start by downloading a bitcoin wallet to their computer or mobile device and create a bitcoin address. How to get bitcoins The most common way to purchase bitcoins are through the popular bitcoin exchanges, which allow you to purchase or trade for a traditional country's currency. There are also several bitcoin ATMs around various countries and a bitcoin local directory of people who will accept cash in exchange for bitcoins. A number of businesses choose to accept bitcoins as payment for their services as a way to gain their own supply of bitcoins. Investing in bitcoins Many people are beginning to believe that digital currencies will increase in popularity in the future. The exchange rate between bitcoin for traditional currencies attracts many potential investors, who are interested in benefiting from currency fluctuations. Similar to all assets, the principle of purchasing while the price is low and selling when it increases applies to the bitcoin currency. Many people are purchasing bitcoin for a potential investment value rather than to use it as a form of payment. This is due to the large rises of value in May 2011 and again in November 2013; investors are hoping that large rises will happen again in the near future. What are the denominations of the bitcoin currency? Bitcoins are different to other currencies as they are highly divisible. As bitcoin is decentralised there is no official organisation to set and name the specific denominations. This has led to a number of names being created for the many smaller units, which are increasing in trade popularity. The most widely used units are bitcoins, bits and also satoshi. Using this system, 1 bitcoin is equal to 1000000.00 bits, with 1 bit equal to 100000000 satoshi. A single satoshi is usually abbreviated to 'sat' and is the smallest unit in circulation within the bitcoin network. How does a transaction work? Bitcoin transactions are defined by inputs and outputs. A bitcoin owner sends an output of bitcoins to a designated address, with the input referring to the owner's unspent amount of currency within the blockchain. This works in a similar way to common cash transactions, with multiple inputs similar to multiple coins. If change is required from the exchange this is sent as an additional output back to the original sender. How much will the transaction fee be? The transaction fee is based on the data storage size needed for the transaction to be generated and also on the demands of the network at that given time. This varies according to the number of inputs needed and also the age of the unspent inputs. The transaction fee is paid to the first bitcoin minor, which mines the block relevant to that specific transaction. It is not a good idea to pay a fixed fee for a transaction as there will be several considerations to take into account during the actual transaction processing period. If your bitcoin wallet estimates a high fee it is probably because your wallet contains a number of small coins, which means a higher number of inputs will be needed for the transaction. How does bitcoin ownership work? Bitcoins are registered to individual bitcoin addresses, which are known as random private keys. To spend bitcoins the owner must be able to enter their private key and digitally sign for the transaction. The bitcoin network will then verify the transaction through the signature and the public key. If an owner loses their private key there is no way to recover it, this means that any currency owned will be lost and become inaccessible. There has been a number of high profile cases where holders of bitcoins have lost large sums of money because they have lost their private keys. What is mining? Mining is a service which holds the records of a bitcoin transaction, with miners being the people that verify transactions and ensure the blockchain is accurate. The miners collect new transactions into blocks, with each block containing a cryptographic hash of the last block. The system uses the widely known SHA-256 hashing algorithm. The chain uses a proof of work system which makes it almost impossible to modify block information. The proof of work system requires the miners to discover a number known as a nonce - they are then rewarded. How are bitcoins supplied and held? When a miner successfully finds the next block they are rewarded with newly created bitcoins. For a miner to claim their reward a coinbase transaction is carried out, which is then included alongside the processed payments. All of the bitcoins which are in circulation have been created through this method. Every time 210,000 new blocks have been created the reward for mining a block is halved. Eventually a limit of 21 million bitcoins will be reached by roughly 2140, at this point there will be no reward for mining new blocks. A digital wallet is used to store the bitcoins' credentials, although several types of wallets are used. A software wallet is the most commonly used and allows users to spend bitcoins and also hold the credentials to prove they are the owners of the currency. There are also online only wallets and physical wallets which allow the holder to spend their bitcoins offline. What is the blockchain? The blockchain is a publicly accessible ledger which is used to openly record bitcoin transactions. The blockchain is updated through a network of intercommunicating nodes which all run the bitcoin software. The network nodes validate transactions which are then applied to their blockchain ledger. A new block of transactions is added to the blockchain roughly 6 times per hour, and this information is then sent to all network nodes. Will more blocks be created when no more currency is generated? Although it is predicted that the last block in the blockchain will be created in roughly 2040, the use of transaction fees will mean new blocks are still valuable to miners. It is predicted that creating new blocks will become more valuable from the fees than the current creation of coins. This means that the transaction fees will be able to sustain the currency and its associated network. There is no limit to the number of blocks which are able to be mined. Can bitcoins be lost? The bitcoin currency is based on the economic laws of supply and demand. If a user loses some of the bitcoin currency, this will make the remaining currency in the network more valuable as a form of compensation. As the value of a single bitcoin starts to increase the cost of purchasing a service or item will then decrease, based on the popular deflationary economic model. This means bitcoins are not as susceptible to inflation as other traditional currencies. Bitcoin volatility Bitcoin suffers from price volatility similar to all commodities and currencies. It is estimated that bitcoin has a volatility seven times greater than gold and roughly 18 times higher than the US dollar. The largest period of volatility occurred in 2011 when the value of a bitcoin rose rapidly from $0.30 to $32 before quickly decreasing to $2. How do tax regulations work? As bitcoin works without a centralised processing system it is impossible to enforce any specific restrictions, although certain activities can still be criminalised. Each country has its own legal status regarding the use of bitcoins, although many have yet to define or tackle the rules which govern its use. There are countries which allow the use of bitcoins and offer completely free trade, on the other hand some have completely banned the currency. The regulations which apply to bitcoin are not unusual, and extend to most cryptocurrency systems. What if a new digital currency becomes more popular? There is always a chance with virtual currencies that another could be created, and this would make an older and less superior one obsolete. During the development of bitcoin a large amount of careful ingenuity has been used. However, it is the first currency of its kind and so competitors will always be looking to take over. Bitcoin aims to stay ahead as the primary virtual currency, but as with all currencies there can be no complete guarantees. As bitcoin rises in popularity and becomes more widely used it is gaining stability and wide acceptance across the world. This helps protect the currency and means new competitors pose little effect, thanks to the network effect bitcoin is creating.

42421066,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXEKLN,1510149613,CoinDesk's Top 10 Token Traders and Analysts of 2017,"After the 1929 stock market crash, new regulations brought infrastructure that helped form the insular culture of Wall Street's traders and analysts.  The creation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ultimately meant that only a small percentage of people would qualify as accredited investors. Success within money's inner circle bred a culture of trade secrets and information asymmetry. Analysts and traders worked their edges and guarded their insight. Information moved within closed circuits of buy-side and sell-side analysts whose work informed limited numbers of investors and traders.  In contrast, the culture around cryptocurrencies looks much different.  Cryptocurrency analysts and traders have taken to social media and other platforms to publicly share their insights and advice on industry trends, popular tokens, price predictions and high reward trades.  Twitter is the most impactful forum, while CoinDesk guest contributors and Medium blog posts offer longer-form analysis and insight from around the world.  Inspired by the shift in culture from cloistered Wall Street to the more open and transparent influencers in the crypto space, CoinDesk has established the following Top 5 Analysts and Top 5 Token Traders lists.  With the final 10 selected from a total of over 30 candidates, factors for consideration included Twitter followers, analyses published, charts produced, industry experience, incumbent financial industry experience (with bonus points for having both), votes from the State of Blockchain Q3 sentiment survey, and several other data points.  CoinDesk's Top 5 Analysts  Spencer Bogart  @CremeDeLaCrypto15,000 followers  Spencer was perhaps the first Wall Street analyst to study bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  This led him to jump feet first into the cryptocurrency industry, where he runs research out of an early crypto investment fund, Blockchain Capital. Spencer shares much of his insight on Medium, and has also been quoted throughout the media landscape.  Chris Burniske  @cburniske32,000 followers  Another analyst to get his start on Wall Street, Chris' work has won him one of the largest follower bases in the industry.  His paper, ""Ringing the Bell on a New Asset Class,"" his current Amazon top-selling book, ""Cryptoassets,"" and his Twitter presence place his analysis behind many newly minted crypto-millionaires.  Chris is also responsible for unique insights that inform the industry – blockchain forks as a type of investor activism, as an example.  Willy Woo  @woonomic  31,000 followers  Willy has produced some of the highest-quality and most creative charts in the industry. While his experience is mostly independent, his insights have been shared on CoinDesk, Twitter, his personal site (Woobull) and other platforms.  Several of his charts have been retweeted thousands of times, including his Google Trends-BTC price correlation, which took a 10,000-year view of crypto and network value to transaction ratio.        Tuur Demeester  @TuurDemeester58,000 followers  Tuur drew the highest number of votes for top analyst in the State of Blockchain Q3 sentiment survey.  Another pioneer whose professional work goes back to the early days of bitcoin, Tuur looks at both the economic forces at work in cryptocurrencies, as well as the technology behind them.  He's authored opinion pieces on CoinDesk and created charts that help many navigate the volatility in bitcoin, making him one of the most heavily followed and respected people in the industry.  Alex Sunnarborg @alexsunnarborg4,000 followers  Alex started out in institutional investment, but when bitcoin began to take off, he quit his job and launched Lawnmower, a platform designed to make cryptocurrencies easier to invest in.  After a win at the Money 20/20 hackathon, Alex worked with Coinbase, and later joined CoinDesk. In addition, his work on State of Blockchain and his creative charts shared on Twitter give him some of the deepest experience in the industry.  Honorable Mention  Sheba Jafari  Sheba makes the list because of her excellent and ""right on the bitcoin"" price predictions. Despite her excellent analysis, she rarely shares her insight outside of what is reported by traditional financial media.  CoinDesk's Top 5 Traders        Bob Voulgaris  @haralabob119,000 followers  Bob is not a crypto-insider and some reading CoinDesk pages might be unfamiliar with his name. That's because he's too busy max-betting on NBA games as one of the most prolific sports betters in the world, with high-profile speaking engagements at the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference.  Make no mistake, Bob has traded cryptocurrencies since the early days, and evangelized friend Mark Cuban from his ""bitcoin is a bubble position"" to investing in tokens.  Peter Brandt  @PeterLBrandt72,000 followers  A veteran trader, Peter has enjoyed a wildly successful career, and now a whole new one as a bitcoin trader.  Other crypto traders have been able to learn from the best charter in the game, and the crypto industry is better for the attention, thought and skills Peter has brought.  He's even taken to schooling the crypto trolls and bickerings that take up so much time and space on Twitter.        Tone Vays  @ToneVays42,000 followers  Tone embodies the principles of the cryptocurrency industry and has a Wall Street background that included a front row seat for the meltdown at Bear Stearns.  An evangelist for the technology, Tone works to give insight into some of the political ideas around bitcoin along with trading advice through his own chart sharing.  While a Twitter handle exists that points out how well traders could do by ignoring Tone's trade advice, he could be considered a conservative trader and has taken a risk-averse approach to 2017's ICO boom.  ฿TF%$D!  @CryptoHustle30,000 followers  A not-quite pseudonymous trader, ฿TF%$D! is one of the most watched in the industry.  With nearly 30,000 Twitter followers, his tweets chart some of the more obscure investment opportunities in the industry. His Crypto Hustle website is full of dives into various altcoins and how to value them and his commentary on trades extends into these same markets.        CryptoCobain  @CryptoCobain55,000 followers  A pseudonymous trader, his crypto alter ego is a conceit of Kurt Cobain living, quitting Nirvana and leading the life of crypto.  Besides daily commentary, and never wavering from the idea that he quit the band, CryptoCobain shares helpful insight on risk management, portfolio allocation, and which coins he thinks are due for a pump.  Honorable Mentions  Wolf of Poloniex, Whale Panda  Wolf and Panda have all the criteria filled and challenged for a spot in the top five. The only difference, in our list selection methodology, was that time spent bickering was a negative data point. While Tone Vays dabbles in the art of bickering, Wolf and Panda out-bickered him and just missed the cut.  Ian Balina gets an honorable mention too, not because of his holdings or trades per say (though the author and self-promoter is doing well), but because of his habit of sharing a screenshot of his portfolio every day.

42380020,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LjSB,1510147807,"Deloitte Report: Over 26,000 Blockchain Projects Began in 2016","More than 26,000 new projects related to blockchain were created on code repository GitHub last year, according to data collected by Deloitte.  For its new report – titled ""Evolution of Blockchain Technology: Insights from the GitHub Platform"" and published today – the professional services firm drew information from the development platform, which plays home to the code for over 86,000 blockchain initiatives, including major projects like bitcoin.  As a whole, the study charts the course of development of the technology through various implementations (beginning with bitcoin) dating back to 2009.  Deloitte's report indicates that 2016 saw the most new blockchain projects (by both organizations and individual users) to date. By comparison, fewer than 15,000 were created in 2015. The data for 2017 includes only the first six months of the year, yet nearly 25,000 GitHub projects were created over that period.  The report also included data on the top blockchain code repositories on GitHub. Of those, bitcoin has (perhaps unsurprisingly) seen the most activity, with 627 total contributors and nearly 12,000 followers. Go-ethereum (or Geth), the software client maintained by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, has drawn 149 contributors to date with 5,603 followers.  Another major data point in the report is that the majority of blockchain projects seen to date are largely inactive on GitHub.  Deloitte explains:  ""The stark reality of open-source projects is that most are abandoned or do not achieve meaningful scale. Unfortunately, blockchain is not immune to this reality. Our analysis found that only 8 percent of projects are active, which we define as being updated at least once in the last six months.""  The authors add that organizations are a ""positive differentiator"" in the data, saying ""while 7 percent of projects developed by users are active, 15 percent of projects developed by organizations are active.""  The report further offers geographical insights into the pace of blockchain development thus far, noting that San Francisco plays home to the most blockchain-related GitHub repository owners, with 1,279 users and 101 organizations. London scored the second-highest with 919 projects in total, followed by New York with 774.  ""It is also worth noting the high level of activity in China, specifically, Shanghai and Beijing. In both of these cities, most of the projects pertain to cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges, with an emphasis on scalability,"" the report goes on to say.

42380038,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LjmJ,1510145114,"$7,500 and Rising: Bitcoin Price Looks Ready to Challenge Records","Having refused to succumb to bearish technical pressures, the world's largest cryptocurrency is better bid today.  At press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is at $7,511 levels on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. As per CoinMarketCap, BTC has gained 4.22 percent in the last 24 hours.  Over that period, prices have climbed by over $270 amid growing opposition to the upcoming Segwit2x hard fork, which looks increasingly unlikely to succeed in updating the bitcoin blockchain to a new rule set without creating another asset.  Increasing opposition to the alternative bitcoin code could mean heightened odds of a blockchain split into two rival assets. Thus, the bid tone around bitcoin may be strengthening on speculation that the event might end up creating free ""Segwit2x coins"" for holders of bitcoin.  The futures market also indicate low odds of the hard fork being implemented successfully. According to CoinMarketCap, Segwit2x futures have dropped 8 percent in the last 24 hours. Compared to the Nov. 4 high of $1,968.80, they are down 33.96 percent.  Still, caution is advised. Despite predictions of a split, Segwit2x may not yield the benefits that bitcoin holders enjoyed with the creation of bitcoin cash (BCH) in August.  With the market likely to stay volatile in the run-up to the hard fork, price action analysis suggests there is scope for a rally to fresh record highs, although the sustainability of any gains is uncertain.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows a symmetrical triangle breakout, which occurs when prices form lower highs and higher lows. It is a bullish continuation pattern: i.e. an upside break as seen on the chart above signals the revival/continuation of the rally.  Thus, the doors are open for a rally to fresh record highs above $7,600, however, the daily chart shows doji reversal, and there is merit in being cautious as long as the price trades below the doji high of $7,630.  Any rally to fresh record highs could be short-lived, courtesy of the overbought daily relative strength index (RSI).

42380032,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ljg1,1510138958,Ethereum Security Lead: Hard Fork Required to Release Frozen Parity Funds,"A resolution has yet to be found for yesterday's Parity hack which saw up to $150 million frozen across the ethereum platform.  However, speaking to CoinDesk, Martin Holst Swende, head of security for the Ethereum Foundation, confirmed that a hard fork of the ethereum blockchain will be required to free up the funds.  Holst Swende said:  ""There's unfortunately no way to recreate the code without a hard fork. Any solution which makes the locked funds accessible requires a hard fork.""  This means that ethereum would need to undergo an emergency upgrade, akin to The DAO blockchain rewrite that occurred last year, should it want users to be able to reclaim the lost millions.  A sudden upgrade of this type is a highly contentious issue, as it would not be limited to Parity alone, but would need to occur universally across the ethereum platform.  Yesterday, a smart contract developer claiming to be new to ethereum, ""accidentally"" deleted the code library that corresponds to the affected Parity wallets, rendering the software useless.  Parity developer Afri Schoedon told CoinDesk ""there is no easy fix"" for the exploit, and developers are currently working towards proposals to release the frozen funds.  Holst Swende said that, to date, the primary difficulties surrounding the fix ""are more of a political than technical nature."" The security lead has already proposed a potential fix, which would involve recreating the Parity code without the wallet exploit, he told CoinDesk, adding, ""I'd like to see this spearheaded by the affected parties, not the foundation.""  UK-based Parity Technologies, which develops the wallet, is separate to the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit behind Geth, the most popular ethereum client.  Going forward, Holst Swende said the team will work towards ""constructing one or several proposals,"" then work together as a community to select the best solution.  As the frozen funds cannot be removed, ""there is no hard time limit,"" he continued, ""so the governance process can in my opinion move along without rushing anything.""  To date, developers are pointing to an ethereum improvement protocol (EIP) that could be deployed to solve the issue. Opened by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin last year, the EIP, which allows the reclaiming of ether (ETH) from stuck accounts, would still require an unplanned hard fork in order to activate.  Speaking on Twitter this morning, Buterin publicly declined comment on the recent exploit, stating: ""I am deliberately refraining from comment on wallet issues, except to express strong support for those working hard on writing simpler, safer wallet contracts or auditing and formally verifying security of existing ones.""

Bridges, who pleaded guilty to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin during the U.S. government's investigation of Silk Road, was found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to a 24-month prison term yesterday by U.S. district judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco.  Judge Seeborg ordered the sentence to be served consecutively with jail time Bridges is currently serving for the theft of the bitcoin. He further ordered Bridges to pay a penalty of 1,500 bitcoins and other fiat currency that roughly totals $10.4 million in value, according to a press release.  Bridges had earlier pleaded guilty to the charges, following admitting using a private key to access a digital wallet belonging to the U.S. government and transferring 1,600 BTC to wallets he controlled.  The case was investigated by the FBI's San Francisco Division, IRS-CI's Washington, D.C. Field Office Cyber Crimes Unit, among other agencies.  Bridges was originally arrested in 2015 for the bitcoin theft, and was later arrested in February 2016 as he tried to leave the U.S. before beginning his prison term. Later, court filings stated that Bridges stole additional Silk Road funds after having pleaded guilty to the first charges.

Talking to CNBC during the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon yesterday, Nasdaq vice chairman Bruce Aust said the ICO funding method is still ""very young"" and in its early stages.  Further, he continued, Nasdaq has been ""at the forefront of helping companies raise capital"" via the Nasdaq private and public markets. ""[Nasdaq is] the market for companies to raise capital,"" he said.  Suggesting his company may not always be able to rest on its laurels in the face of competition from token sales, Aust continued:  ""We are a regulated market, I think that's the difference between us and an ICO. And we'll see at some point those markets become regulated and that will change everything"".  According to CoinDesk's ICO Tracker, ICOs have raised over $3.5 billion to date, the majority of that in 2017.  Despite the growing popularity of the blockchain-based funding method, though, ICOs have been making some negative headlines recently. Last month, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said that ICOs are an ""absolute scam."" Soon after, ""Wolf of Wall Street"" Jordan Belfort commented that token sales are ""biggest scam ever.""  Further, regulators in South Korea and China have issued outright ICO bans, while countries like Singapore, Canada and Japan, among others, have issued warnings over the risks to investors.

In an interview published on Oct. 29, Benoît Cœuré, one of the central bank's executive board members, elaborated briefly on the bank’s views on the subject, telling Le Journal du Dimanche it is following their development and spread.  The ECB is not ""ignoring"" the spread of cryptocurrencies, he said. Yet, at present, he does not consider them a risk to the bank or the euro.  Cœuré told the organization:  ""At the moment cryptocurrencies don't pose any monetary risk because the amounts involved are marginal. They are speculative financial instruments which create risks of a financial or even criminal nature.""  Some nations are moving away from physical bills and coins to their own cryptocurrencies, so central banks, in general, are monitoring them closely, he continued.  In September, the ECB's president, Mario Draghi, said nations in the eurozone could not use their own cryptocurrencies, but instead every member state had to use the euro.

In an earnings conference call this week, Chris Concannon, president of the derivatives exchange operator, stated that he sees exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the cryptocurrency coming to markets. Concanno went so far as to refer to bitcoin as a new asset class, saying he believes in the cryptocurrency space in general.  He said:  ""With regulated futures of a certain asset class like a bitcoin, you do have an opportunity to introduce ETFs and over time we do envision ETFs coming to market.”  Last week, rival derivatives marketplace operator CME Group announced its intention of offering a bitcoin futures contracts product by the end of 2017, pursuant to approval by U.S. regulators. The company followed CBOE itself, which said it would launch its own bid to offer derivatives based on cryptocurrencies back in August.  CBOE is also waiting on approval from government regulators.  The statements are notable given that previous attempts to launch ETFs based on bitcoin have not met with success. In September, money manager VanEck withdrew its own filing for a futures ETF after receiving pushback from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Similarly, REX ETFs withdrew its own filings a week later.  This pushback has not stopped other companies from trying to file for a derivatives product. ProShares Capital Management filed for two products in late September, though it is still too early to determine whether the bid will be approved or not.

42380031,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ljel,1510108251,Bitcoin's Bogeyman Cometh: Why Segwit2x Is a 51% Attack,"Edan Yago is CEO and founder of Epiphyte, a startup performing FX funds settlement on the bitcoin blockchain for financial institutions.  In this opinion piece, Yago discusses one of the biggest theoretical attacks against bitcoin, and why he believes an upcoming software change fits its definition. Follow Edan Yago on Twitter.      In bitcoin's Necronomicon of possible attacks and weaknesses, one reigns supreme – the 51% attack.  If there is a fear that has played on people's minds as the end-of-days scenario for bitcoin, it is this. Attackers who hold more than 50% of hashing power could stop transactions from confirming and even reverse some transactions. They could undermine the whole project.  Bitcoin's design and its system of economic incentives has been set up specifically to combat the destructive potential of a 51% attack. And it has worked. The 51% attack has remained a hypothetical bogeyman. Until now.  By all indication, a coordinated 51% attack will begin on, or around, Nov. 16. That's when a consortium of miners representing substantially more than 50% of the network's hashing power and an allied group of blockchain startups will seek to increase the block size.  This will require a hard fork, which while controversial, is a legitimate desire. In itself, this is not an attack.  Where it goes wrong  However, the consortium's effort has evolved beyond a simple fork. It is now being developed not simply as an effort to fork the chain, but to do so in such a way as to deliberately prevent the continued existence of the status quo chain.  Specifically, the developers involved have declined to introduce replay protection.  The 2x fork will create a situation where transactions performed on one fork, can be ""replayed"" on the second fork. In effect, users will have funds on both blockchains, but any transaction they perform on one blockchain could lead to a loss of funds on the other blockchain.  Replay protection is a fairly easy-to-implement method to protect users from this risk. Network attacks are those actions taken with the intention of disrupting the protocol’s normal functioning. The 2x change, bereft of replay protection, causes massive disruption. This is by design.  Without replay protection in place, a minority chain becomes less likely to survive.  Question of motives  The preferred outcome for the consortium is that the status quo chain ceases to exist, that its transactions fail to confirm.  This is the literal definition of a 51% attack. If it sounds a bit bizarre to call the consortium's effort an attack, that's because it is. The consortium comprises many real supporters of bitcoin, acting in what they believe is good faith. They don't mean to be attacking bitcoin.  However, without replay protection their efforts are like an autoimmune disease, having become overzealous and perverted.  So, bitcoin is finally coming to come face-to-face with the mother of all attacks. This is a watershed moment. The very worst outcomes are bad indeed.  Transactions could grind to a halt, faith in the system could be lost, bitcoin and by extension, the entire blockchain world could prove to be far more vulnerable to attack than we hoped.  We shall overcome  However, there is also another possible, even more likely, outcome.  Bitcoin could prove resilient to the consortium's attack and emerge battered but unbroken. In so doing, bitcoin will have proven itself resilient to even its greatest foe.  It is hard to overstate how important this will be to bitcoin's perceived reliability. Bitcoin has always been haunted by the risk that its rules might come to be dictated by special interest groups or hostile, state-sponsored parties.  This risk is never going completely away, but instead of the risk being a hypothetical bogeyman, it will become a much more prosaic thing: a successfully managed risk.  The 51% attack is bitcoin's boss level. I don’t think it's an exaggeration to say that we are now at the end of the beginning. If we successfully overcome this coming challenge, bitcoin will no longer be just an experiment, it will be a fact.  But don't expect less drama — we are now entering bitcoin's adolescence.
