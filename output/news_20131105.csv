Gavin Andresen, the lead developer of Bitcoin, was quick to dismiss the paper and its contents.    Executive summary of Cornell paper: not a big deal even assuming their analysis is correct (I'm not yet convinced).      — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) November 5, 2013    Although a similar attack called the 'Mining Cartel Attack' was proposed as early as 2010, the new study proposes a variation that uses sybil nodes in order to generate a more powerful attack than initially conceived of. However, the attack has created a controversy and many developers have hit back saying that the problem is quite well understood and not workable in practice.  In a nutshell, a 'Selfish Mining Pool', (explained in the blog post 'Bitcoin is Broken') keeps their discovery of a new block on the block chain private until such time as they must submit it to the network or lose it to another 'Honest Mining Pool'. The theory is that because they have kept a block secret, the rest of the network will waste resources looking for it whilst the Selfish Pool will get a head start on the next block.  The Selfish Mining Pool must also spy on other mining pools to anticipate their block discoveries and when an Honest Mining Pool broadcasts a block, they must employ a Sibyl attack on the network in order to get it to accept their secretly produced block first.  The block header of course is time stamped, so provided that enough sybil nodes report the Selfish Miner's block as being discovered first, the network is likely to accept it and reward the Selfish Miners.  Once they have achieved this they will already be ahead in the race to find the second block, and so, in theory at least they can offer a greater reward for other dishonest miners to come and join them. In time, the researchers argue, a Selfish Mining Cartel could theoretically build up enough power to monopolise the entire bitcoin network and gain control of the protocol.  To counter this possibility they propose a change to the protocol that would limit the amount of the network that each pool could hold to a maximum of 25%.  However, as the study was not first submitted to the Bitcoin Security List, (the mailing group that deals with precisely these kinds of issues), and instead submitted to public review first, controversy has flared up without the benefit of a reasoned and careful analysis by the bitcoin core developers.  In response, some media reports have been quick to seize on the controversy and blow it out of proportion. Bitcoin Magazine's technical editor Vitalik Buterin, notes however:    ""In practice, most Bitcoin miners act altruistically to support the network, both out of ideological considerations and because they do not want to destabilize the source of their own revenue. Such higher-level economic concerns are beyond the scope of Eyal and Sirer’s paper, but they seriously reduce the chance that this economic attack will work in practice.      Furthermore, unlike a standard 51% attack, which only becomes obvious after the fact, this economic attack would need to be announced in advance to let neutral miners know that they have the opportunity to join the attacking coalition for their own benefit. Thus, mining pools cannot practically pull this off; as soon as one announces its intention to cheat the network, its users will leave out of ideological considerations, and even if they do not other mining pools will likely offer heavy discounts on fees to that mining pool’s users to convince even profit-maximizing participants to switch away.""    With regards to the Sybil attack variation, lead Bitcoin developer Andresen also posted on the Bitcoin Talk forum saying: “I would still like to see blocks and transactions being broadcast over another completely different networking protocol, either peer-to-peer or not. More diversity so we're not relying on the one p2p network would be great, and, depending on how it was implemented, might automatically bring sybil resistance”  Stephen Gornick also echoed the sentiments of many core developers saying: “Isn't the economic benefit to joining the selfish pool easy to extinguish? The further ahead the selfish pool is, the greater the cost to them if they lose that race. [...] Wouldn't it be easy to tell if a block seems to be coming from a selfish pool as each new block will appear to be lagging since it has no recently arrived transactions?""  It would seem in this case that the researchers may have jumped too quickly to their conclusions and published their findings prematurely stating openly:  ""Bitcoin is broken. And not just superficially so, but fundamentally, at the core protocol level. We're not talking about a simple buffer overflow here, or even a badly designed API that can be easily patched; instead, the problem is intrinsic to the entire way Bitcoin works. [...] Ittay Eyal and I outline an attack by which a minority group of miners can obtain revenues in excess of their fair share, and grow in number until they reach a majority. When this point is reached, the Bitcoin value-proposition collapses: the currency comes under the control of a single entity; it is no longer decentralized; the controlling entity can determine who participates in mining and which transactions are committed, and can even roll back transactions at will. This snowball scenario does not require an ill-intentioned Bond-style villain to launch; it can take place as the collaborative result of people trying to earn a bit more money for their mining efforts.""  Despite Gavin Andressen's response, many observers feel that the jury is still out on this one, and no doubt this is one controversy that will probably rage for a bit longer.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/05/bitcoin-mining-network-vulnerability-not-a-big-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9b0d6c9b1626fae042c82b686ff39959c2383e5-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425124,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr1Ph,1383671149,High-profile investors reveal just how bullish they are on bitcoin,"It’s important to put money where your mouth is. Of course, if it is BTC, then putting bitcoin where your mouth is makes all the difference.  The proclamation of former Facebook executive and investor Chamath Palihapitiya that he owns $5 million in bitcoins, around 23,000 bitcoin at current CoinDesk BPI prices, is an exercise in confidence for the electronic currency.  And the fact that he wants to own at least $10 million more shows serious investor interest in a new type of asset class that some critics have in the past considered worthless.  The Winklevii  The Winklevoss brothers, benefactors of an early relationship with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, have been considered some of the biggest investors in bitcoin, but that has been relatively underreported in comparison to Palihapitiya publicly discussing his bullish views of bitcoin.  Business Insider reported back in April  that the twins own 108,000 BTC. At recent prices, that’s over $26 million.  No one can say for sure when the Winklevii purchased their hoard of bitcoins, but they’ve probably made off quite well.  Their investment in BitInstant, however, doesn’t appear to being doing as well.  That company has had a number of public relations problems, as the decision to include the word “Instant” in the company’s name has proven that actions need to be backed up by words.  At least the Winklevosses are backing up their words with bitcoin actions. But sometimes, their comments can be a bit too much.  For example, the comment that a country could switch its currency to bitcoin is rather far-fetched since that would effectively isolate it from trading partners, North-Korea style.  Chamath Palihapitiya’s stance  There’s no lack of enthusiasm about bitcoin from Palihapitiya, who like the Winkleoss twins has a connection with Facebook, being at AOL and then the social network in it early stages.  Palihapitiya told an audience at TechCrunch Disrupt earlier this year that bitcoin is ”everywhere that you have currency pressure, everywhere you want to basically shield your assets.”  “After that, it will probably become a payment mechanism,” he said at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY conference, held last April 27-May 1.  ""Right now you just want to own the underlying commodity,"" he told journalist Robert Scoble in an interview.  ""Google didn't choose to be in the US dollar business, Google is a business that is amazing that just happens to get paid in US dollars.""  ""Similarly, I'd rather own bitcoin"", than try to find a great bitcoin company, he said. And that makes sense. No one knows right now what will happen with bitcoin in terms of regulation.  It's still very murky water for an investor to wade into. Bitcoin-based businesses may have to shift strategy based on governing bodies and the type of policies they enact on decentralized electronic currencies.  But no matter what happens, Palihapitiya's philosophy is that bitcoin won't have that same type of pivot that bitcoin companies will likely face.  Growing investment interest  Bitcoin prices are reaching a high level once again. There is renewed interest in the currency after a lull during the summer months, particularly in July and a significant drop when Silk Road met its demise last month.  Yet there is resilience, especially in more mainstream investment circles. An executive of Fortress Investments, a hedge fund that manages over $54 billion in assets, has recently become advocate for bitcoin.  “Put a little money in bitcoin,” Michael Novogratz, chief investment officer for Fortress, said at a conference held by the bank UBS. “Come back in a few years and it’s going to be worth a lot.”  There are vehicles for investors to get involved in bitcoin now, a stark difference from last April's bitcoin price bubble when there was very little access to this type of investment.  SecondMarket, for example, which courts accredited investors with verifiable net worth (income exceeding $200,000, a trust worth $5 million, etc.) has been raising money for a bitcoin trust since September.  And the Winklevoss brothers have registered with the SEC a bitcoin trust, an exchange traded fund (ETF) that would be available to the average stock market investor.  It hasn't launched yet, but with the frothy valuation of bitcoin and other virtual currencies as of late (litecoin is currently at vaunted $2.98, according to BTC-E) it seems like the demand for it is there, should anyone be interested.  The price attracts investors seeking a return, but one has to wonder where the top might be.  For those paying attention, volatility is a concern. Bitcoin may be a wise investment, but its not for the faint of heart.  These are the good days, but the price is destined to go back down. All it takes are negative stories about it, sure to come alight as it is used as a tool for a number of things other than speculation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/05/high-profile-investors-reveal-just-how-bullish-they-are-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b89ab1c051efbf15365b7e3a7a701b4233703fd-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425110,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr0zh,1383662845,Bitcoin helps Iranian shoe store overcome international trade sanctions,"An interesting e-commerce site that went online just last week is accepting bitcoin only, because most overseas customers cannot pay with anything else.  The business is Persian Shoes, an over 70-year-old business selling handmade footwear. It is located in Isfahan, the third-largest city in Iran.  The owners are happy to ship anywhere, but paying them is a problem. Thanks to the vagaries of international diplomacy and the past few decades of history, the usual e-commerce channels are blocked.  Trade sanctions against the entire country of Iran by the United Nations, United States, European Union and others mean Western Union and major credit card companies will not deal with Iranian businesses, even those in the fashion world.  The only way to pay someone in Iran is with cash carried in your pocket - or some easily transferrable, mostly unregulated, digital currency.  The bitcoin-only store sold four pairs of shoes in its first day of business. ""To my standards it is a good sale!"" said the CEO, Mor Roghani. The store's success continued throughout its first week.  ""We have sold ten pairs of shoes so far using bitcoin. This is way above our expectations,"" he added.  Persian Shoes is currently operated by three brothers, who are keen to expand the business their father started. Roghani's cousin, who lives in Australia, introduced them to bitcoin and helped them to set up the site.  The site currently offers leather handbags, purses and shoes for women and seven varieties of shoes for men. Prices are all listed in USD and start around US $80.  Its FAQ page explains bitcoin and guides new users to online services like Coinbase, Bitstamp and BitBargain, as well as LocalBitcoins. It also explains the trade situation:  ""Our business is making and selling leather products. We like to sell our products across the world and the more customers the better. The problem is we operate in Iran and most payment systems either are not willing to serve us at all or impose a huge risk on our business. Before launching this website, our international sale has been limited to a few dedicated customers who knew about the quality of our products and were prepared to go through a lot of trouble to pay us! This of course, may sound incomprehensible for people who have all sorts of electronic payments at their disposal. However, before finding out about bitcoin, receiving our money was the number one obstacle in expanding our business.""  As well as international trade restrictions, exchanging bitcoin back into local currency (Iranian Rials) also faces knowledge and technical barriers.  ""Exchange is a bit tricky because bitcoin is not common yet. We are planing to hold onto some of the bitcoins and sell some at localbitcoins,"" Roghani said. A lack of online shopping culture locally and poor internet connectivity hinders trade with other parts of Iran.  Depending on your country of citizenship or residence, you may not actually be allowed to buy these shoes even with bitcoin. Just as Americans may not spend a weekend in Havana or enjoy real Cuban cigars, they are also forbidden to engage in any trade activity with businesses or individuals located in Iran.  Despite this, Persian Shoes has taken orders from customers in the US and is waiting to see how smoothly the deliveries go before advertising the business more widely (update: all US orders have reached their destinations so far without problems.)  A query sent to United States Customs and Border Protection (part of the Department of Homeland Security) asking specifically about private e-commerce transactions for items of clothing received the following response: ""Unfortunately, sanctions against Iran prohibit this.""  Government agencies in other countries are less clear about this sort of purchase, or did not respond to questions.  Most international sanctions target trade in goods related to technology or industrial equipment, but are less specific about personal transactions for everyday items (probably due to lack of payment options) and definitely do not mention shoes.  You are, however, still free to Like Persian Shoes' Facebook Page and browse the store.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/11/05/bitcoin-helps-iranian-shoe-store-overcome-international-trade-sanctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecf202621714e1de51614c6e1924fcfd8c5dd736-1025x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company, which enables people to mine bitcoins without having to operate their own mining equipment, filed for Chapter 11 protection in US bankruptcy court in Seattle on Friday, according to the Wall Street Journal.  The bankruptcy petition, which was signed by CoinLab CEO Peter Vessenes, states that Alydian has less than $50,000 in assets.  Also, the company owes $600,000 to CoinLab, $3m to New Zealand's XRay Holdings LLC and $40,000 to Vessenes.  Alydian  Back in early August, Alydian CEO Hans Olsen described his company's offering:  ""The system, based on our first generation 65 nm custom ASIC technology, will enable non-technical customers to participate in terahash and petahash-scale bitcoin mining without worry or technical expertise.""  The company's website is still up and running and advertises 5TH/s bitcoin mining for one year, which includes all energy and maintenance costs for $350,000. It also offers 10TH/s for $650,000, which many members of the Bitcoin Talk forum have deemed as far too expensive.  Forum member WastedLTC said: ""Prices are out of control. It should be cheaper per GH when purchasing this much juice but these prices are higher than most ASICs out there today.""  Today on reddit, forum members suggested they weren't surprised that the company was experiencing financial difficulties.  ""If they had true hashpower, they would have been like ghash.io: instantly able to mine their investing capital back and able to pay off debts. Yes this was definitely scamware/vaporware from the start,"" said forum member frankenmint.  CoinLab  CoinLab, which was founded in 2011, received $500,000 in funding in May 2012 from venture capitalists such as Silicon Valley's Draper Associates. It also received $575,000 (in the form of a debt security) in April 2013.

42425111,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr0vh,1383643536,Australian car company Tomcar now sells off-road vehicles for bitcoins,"Car manufacturer Tomcar Australia claims to be the first automobile vendor to accept bitcoin. The company, which makes rugged off-road vehicles, begins accepting the cryptocurrency today.  Bitcoin has proven to be a useful currency for online services, and mail order goods. Some bricks and mortar services also take it. However, the cryptocurrency has largely been ignored for purchases like cars, unless you buy via an online marketplace. Now, Tomcar, which makes specialist off-road utility vehicles, will happily take your decentralized digital cash.  ""Any startup company should maximize potential payment methods and we see bitcoin as a valid burgeoning payment format, just like credit cards were in the 1970s,"" said David Brim, co-founder and CEO of the Australian firm. ""When our Tomcars are suited to many driving environments, it makes sense to accept a global currency without nation state borders.""  How it works  The firm will be taking coins via the local CoinJar service. Customers select bitcoins on the site, and the purchases then go through CoinJar’s payment gateway. The price of the cars (which includes goods and services tax) will be calculated based on the value of the bitcoins in real time and reconciled by CoinJar. CoinJar, which provides the checkout code for its customers’ web sites, settles funds into a firm’s bank account daily and takes a 1% cut of the funds that it transfers.  Brim said that the CoinJar partnership will provide a “stability hedge” at the time of purchase, benefiting both Tomcar and the customer. He added:  ""This means that we have absolutely no exchange fluctuation risks against AUD or the USD.""  Tomcar’s vehicles were originally developed for the Israeli military. They now sell to military and commercial clients, who use its vehicles for applications including tourism, fire and rescue, and industrial and mining. It also sold to consumers for recreational purposes. The vehicles start at AU $24,950 and ranges up to AU $30,450 for higher-end models.  The company outsources its manufacturing, and sells directly to consumers, eliminating the traditional dealer network to reduce costs. It does maintain regional distributors outside Australia, however, along with a selection of direct agents around Australia, which it calls ""brand patrons"".  The key driver  Brim said that international money transfer fees are a key driver for accepting bitcoin - cryptocurrency allows overseas transactions with fewer fees. Only 5% of the company's transactions come from buyers outside Australia at present, he admitted.  ""We are looking to expand this, which is one of the reasons we decided to accept bitcoin as a payment methodology,"" Brim said.  Tomcar already uses bitcoin to pay some overseas suppliers, according to Brim who added that he currently pays between 6-12% for conventional money transfer, compared to 1% or less with bitcoin.  Brim told CoinDesk that he is trying to persuade more companies in his supply chain to also work with bitcoin. ""The cost of most international money transfers using traditional financial systems is unjustifiably expensive,"" he said. ""We aim to get all our partners using it in the short term and we see it as a significant saving for both our businesses.""  The company is talking with MTM Automotive, its manufacturing partner, which makes its cars. Last year, that firm announced a facility in Melbourne, Australia.  “We believe much of [the auto industry] requires a rethink,” said Brim, arguing that troubles in the automobile manufacturing sector show that it is important to modernize thinking in the business. He added:    “As we move into the digital era, many of the industrial methods are too cumbersome and slow in their approach. An example that springs to mind is the dealership systems and lack of true e-commerce.      Most OEMs still require you to walk into a dealership to buy a car, even if you start the process on-line. Like most retail, this system is costly and regressive.""    Previous flirtations  The car industry has flirted with bitcoin before. Last year, Wikispeed, an initiative to create an environmentally-friendly car using a crowdsourced design, announced that it was taking bitcoin payments.  A Texan car dealership, Sam Pack Ford, also announced that it would be taking bitcoin payments earlier this year. However, when CoinDesk contacted representative Matt Bonner, he said that he was new and had no idea what bitcoin was. The Ford dealership still isn't quoting bitcoin pricing, but Dubai-based Al Nabooda Automobiles was able to sell 25 luxury cars for credits within the BizX community currency network.  These instances seem to be either half-baked marketing initiatives, donations for unlaunched products, or one-off deals, though. Tomcar seems to be going all-in for bitcoin, with a proper checkout system, and a policy to promote their use internally. It may be a specialist vehicle manufacturer, but it's a small foothold for bitcoin in the auto industry, nevertheless.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/05/australian-car-company-tomcar-now-sells-off-road-vehicles-for-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88e7972d90094681fff15360ed0852407718363c-1167x540.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
