42402174,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3bhT,1542142835,Court Takes Control of Funds Amid Crypto Exchange's Banking Dispute,"Canadian court is taking charge of $26 million CAD claimed by crypto exchange QuadrigaCX due to a dispute over the funds’ provenance.  Judge Glenn Hainey of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granted the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) an interpleader order on Nov. 9, allowing the court to take control of the funds until their ownership can be established. However, the bank will maintain liability for the funds, given that CIBC froze the funds on its own initiative.  An interpleader right occurs when at least two parties claim the same funds, whether that is a debt, obligation or money, explained Christine Duhaime, a financial crime lawyer and managing partner of Duhaime Law, which is based in Toronto and Vancouver.  In this case, there was a dispute about which party has a right to about $26 million CAD and $69,000 USD (about $20 million USD overall) that the CIBC froze after questioning whether QuadrigaCX, its payment processor, Costodian, and Costodian director Jose Reyes were entitled to the funds.  Last Friday, Hainey found that the parties involved could not agree on who is actually entitled to the funds.  CIBC will now be required to transfer the funds to the court until it can establish ownership among the claimants.  ""The Court holds the disputed funds in trust only until the entitlement to the funds has been lawfully determined and competing claims are resolved,"" Duhaime, who is not involved in the case, explained.  She added:  ""The next step is that CIBC will transfer the disputed funds into the Court’s account and then the parties, including the customers of Quadriga who bought digital currencies with them during the time in question, can make an application for the return of funds that they believe are theirs. That includes Quadriga, who can bring an application to claim the funds.""  The judge did not rule on whether CIBC froze the funds wrongfully or not.  This is normal, given that CIBC filed an application, and there has not been a hearing on any party's conduct, Duhaime explained.  The good news for QuadrigaCX customers is they can now apply to have their funds released by the court, she said. The down side to this is their identities may be revealed as a result, which could potentially have tax consequences for some individuals.  QuadrigaCX founder and CEO Gerald Cotten told CoinDesk that he was “pleased that things are moving forward.”  He anticipates that the situation will be completed before the upcoming holidays, after the parties have met with a judge.  While he claimed that less than 1 percent of the exchange’s customers have been impacted by the banking freeze, he thinks that full services will return to “regular timeframes” within the next few weeks.  Precedents  Duhaime noted that in general, when banks de-risk accounts they provide clients at least 30 days’ notice, though this number may increase to as much as 90–120 days for crypto exchanges.  This allows clients to find alternative banking services.  Banks typically do not hold on to funds in the event of a de-risking action by anti-money laundering specialists, as that would require banks to keep the “high-risk account” open.  “So here, though, there was a clear departure from normal de-risking practice,"" Duhaime told CoinDesk. ""There may be reasons why, that later emerge in subsequent proceedings, but it is odd that normal AML practice was deviated from.""  As such, CIBC’s actions are a reminder for payment processors that banks look at their clients, “and they make de-risking decisions all the time based no the client behind the client.”  She concluded:  “It’s not just about your client, it’s about ensuring that your client’s client operates in a way that does not pose a reputational, legal or regulatory risk to a bank.”  CIBC image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/13/court-takes-control-of-funds-amid-crypto-exchanges-banking-dispute,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5c454ed0c735634e4eb5802afb4da01a299be1a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402168,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3bcY,1542129941,Traders Now Betting 2-to-1 Bitcoin Cash Fork Will Cause Price Decline,"New data is offering insight into how crypto traders are pricing in a coming technical update to bitcoin cash, one that could cause the world's fourth most valuable blockchain to split into two competing networks.  At press time, there are now almost twice as many open short positions betting that the price of bitcoin cash (BCH) will fall as there are longs betting its price will rise. According to data from crypto exchange Bitfinex, which allows margin trading for multiple cryptocurrencies, there are currently 89,457 open BCH short positions and 53,322 open longs.  That so much market activity is taking place is perhaps no coincidence, since there is a network update scheduled for bitcoin cash set to take place on Nov. 15. Under one possible outcome, BCH will split into two cryptocurrencies – one centered around the Bitcoin ABC software, the other around the Bitcoin SV version of the software – resulting in two distinct versions of the code.  (Traders who own bitcoin cash, in such a scenario, would then hold value on both blockchains.)  Still, while more margin traders believe in the possibility of a price decline, there's strong sentiment on both sides. BCH longs and shorts both reached all-time highs in the last 24 hours.  Short and long positions began to pile up on Nov. 2 when exchanges like Binance and Coinbase announced support for the upcoming fork. From Nov. 2-7, the price of Bitcoin Cash spiked over 50 percent to reach a two-month high of $646 on Bitfinex.  Surges in price are usually met with a rise in short positions since the more significant the ascent in price, the more likely a pullback tends to become. In this case, the recent surge in price combined with the upcoming fork created a perfect storm for a bearish trading environment.  It’s likely many traders brought up BCH in anticipation of the fork purely in order to receive ""free"" coins that could arise from one scenario. Once the fork occurs, the recent purchasers of BCH could simply sell BCH and either keep or sell the forks in order secure a profit.  As can be seen by the skyrocket in short positions, the market finds a ""post-fork"" sell-off to be the most likely outcome.  However, the abundance of shorts may put bears at risk of a short squeeze should the price rise above its recent high. If the price of an asset begins to rise to the point of a short no longer being profitable, those shorting will likely be caused to close, or cover, their position in order to avoid taking a further loss.  The act of closing an abundance of shorts can have a bullish impact on the market and cause a rapid price increase, known as a short squeeze, since the only way to close a short is to buy back the underlying asset.  Since longs are also at all-time highs though, a long squeeze is also a possibility if prices continue to dip. Closing a long requires the selling of the asset which can have a bearish effect on its price if the closing is done in abundance.  While its just speculation at this point, one thing is for certain, all eyes will be on Bitcoin Cash on November 15.

42402171,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3beW,1542128431,Bitcoin Cash's 'Mining War' Escalates as Blockchain Hard Fork Approaches,"The global network of computer operators who today help power the bitcoin cash cryptocurrency are beginning to signal that they may take differing paths ahead of a technical update scheduled for Thursday.  Data from Coin Dance  indicates that bitcoin cash mining pools, collectives of individuals and companies providing computer power to the cryptocurrency, the world's fourth most valuable, are indicating they will run a version of the software called Bitcoin SV, an alternative to the Bitcoin ABC software most widely used by the network today.  In fact, early signs suggest Bitcoin SV may control some 76.39 percent of the network's current mining power.  While it's too early to tell if this many computers will actually update their software, causing the bitcoin cash network to split, the strong rhetoric employed by those backing the upstart Bitcoin SV software, including Craig Wright, the Australian cryptographer who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, suggests this is a possibility.  Wright in particular has vowed to destroy the ABC network, going so far as to threaten ABC proponents on Twitter.  Amidst this dialogue, SV’s hash power advantage is up from 73.62 percent just a day ago. In particular, CoinGeek, the platform owned by Wright supporter Calvin Ayre, jumped from controlling about 30.6 percent of the overall hash power to 41 percent.  In contrast, okminer and Mempool both lost a significant portion of the hash power, falling from 7.64 percent and 6.25 percent respectively to 3.47 percent each.  Meanwhile, mining pools supporting the Bitcoin ABC implementation spearheaded by Roger Ver have made gains of their own. In particular, Bitcoin.com, Antpool and BTC.com now control 8.33, 4.86 and 6.25 percent of the total hash power respectively. Antpool and BTC.com are controlled by bitcoin cash supporter and hardware giant Bitmain.  As of yesterday, both of Bitmain’s pools only controlled 2.78 percent of the power each, while Ver’s website had 6.25 percent.  While several mining pools have firmly declared support for one party or another, a number have yet to publicly express which network they might help secure. The most prominent of these is ViaBTC, which controlled 7.64 percent of the network total yesterday, though its relative power dropped to 2.08 percent by 14:00 UTC Tuesday.  Another pool, Northern Bitcoin, likewise has yet to commit to a particular implementation, though chief technology officer Moritz Jäger told Forbes that his pool switched from bitcoin to bitcoin cash to be among ""the decision makers on the upcoming fork.”  Price fluctuation  Still, while Bitcoin SV seems to have a clear advantage in hash power, traders seem more confident about Bitcoin ABC.  BCHABC, a trading pair being offered in advance at some exchange, is still trading at a higher price than markets for SV, though its lead has shrunk slightly. At press time, pre-fork trading of the token hovered around $391 (priced in the USDC stablecoin), down from $415 just 24 hours ago.  In contrast, BCHSV’s price surged 22 percent in that time period to reach $136.  According to TradingView, BCHABC may also be seeing less interest in terms of volume, with only 876,258 USDC being traded over the past 24 hours, up from 818,375 yesterday.

Revealed in the firm's latest financial report, published Monday, that figure is markedly worse than its Q2 loss of 360 million yen (around $3.2 million). GMO put the drop down to a “worsening” external environment and increasing depreciation costs.  Overall, however, the firm saw a slight increase in revenue from mining, with Q3 revenue coming in at 1.23 billion yen ($10.78 million) as compared to 1.17 billion yen ($10.26 million) in Q2.  The firm mined a total of 1,590 bitcoins and 25 bitcoin cash in Q3, according to its latest monthly crypto mining business report.  GMO also provided data on its mining capability, or hashrate, which saw an increase to 674 petahashes per second (PH/s) in October as compared to 479 (PH/s) in September. The firm indicates it is aiming to achieve 800 PH/S within the year.  Meanwhile, the company's exchange business has more positive news for Q3, netting profits of 740 million yen (about $6.5 million) – that's up 34.4 percent compared to the previous quarter. Revenue came in at 1.36 billion yen (about $11.92 million) for the same period.  Overall, the crypto segment also saw an increase in Q3 revenue, although profit again declined from the previous quarter. Net sales are reported at 2.6 billion yen (about $22.80 million), while overall profits declined to 104 million yen (about $912,840).  GMO said in a separate report that its cryptocurrency mining loss was offset by profit seen in the cryptocurrency exchange business.

VAKT Global, the consortium building the platform, revealed the news at a digital commodities summit hosted by S&P Global Platts on Monday.  The effort effectively intends to help oil companies replace paper-based documentation with smart contracts – a move expected to cut costs, reduce the risk of errors and make post-trade processes more efficient. The platform will comprise a ""secure, real-time blockchain-based platform to manage physical energy transactions,"" according to the group.  ""We expect to go live at the end of November in the North Sea oil market. In 2019 we will look at ARA barges, waterborne markets and US crude pipelines,” said Lyon Hardgrave, VAKT Global’s vice president of product development.  The first licensees are expected to be on board by January, Hardgrave added.  VAKT Global saidhttps://www.vakt.com/press-detail/november-2017-commodity-traders-energy-majors-and-banks-join-forces-to-create-a-blockchain-based-digital-platform-for-the-energy-commodity-trading-industry earlier this week that the blockchain platform would be run as a new venture by the consortium members, to be managed and operated as an independent entity. Regulatory approvals for the venture are pending, it added.  Apart from Shell and BP, other members of the group include Norwegian energy company Statoil, trading houses such as Gunvor, Koch Supply & Trading and Mercuria, and banks including ABN Amro, ING and Societe Generale.  Licensees that join the blockchain platform on a fee basis can expect to save around 40 percent in post-trade resolution, Hardgrave said.  He added:  ""This not a trading platform, nor a settlement platform – there is no cryptocurrency involved.

42402186,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3btH,1542106846,Bitcoin Back on the Defensive After Price Hits Two-Week Low,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price dropped to two-week lows earlier today and could extend the decline to key support near $6,100, technical charts indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency was teasing a bullish move 24-hours ago, having carved out a lower high of $6,270 along the support of the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 low and Oct. 31 low.  The defense of the key trendline support was also backed by a bullish divergence of the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram.  Even so, BTC failed to pick up a bid, possibly due to sharp losses in US equities, and fell back to $6,252 in the Asian session today – the lowest level since Oct 31. BTC was last seen changing hands at $6,285 on Coinbase, representing a 0.80 percent drop on the day.  4-hour chart  BTC has breached the ascending trendline support on the 4-hour chart, adding credence to the lower highs and lower lows pattern created from the Nov. 7 high of $6,540.  The relative strength index of 32 is also biased toward the bears. So, a deeper drop could be in the offing. The bearish setup, however, would be invalidated if prices cut through the descending trendline, representing lower highs pattern.  3-day chart  Over on the 3-day chart, BTC looks set to test support at the trendline connecting the June 24 and Aug. 14 lows, currently at $6,113, having charted a “gravestone doj” (bearish reversal pattern) earlier this month.  The bearish candlestick also marks the bulls' failure to capitalize on the sideways breach of the triangle pattern, witnessed at the end of October.  View  The drop to two-week lows has likely opened the doors for a test of the trendline support at $6,113. A 3-day close below that level would strengthen the bear grip on BTC, allowing for a drop to June lows below $5,800.  On the higher side, the weekly high of $6,540 is the price to beat for the bulls. That level could be put to test if prices beat the resistance at $6,383 (falling trendline hurdle on 4-hour chart).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402181,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3bpL,1542103823,What Fork? Asian Traders Are Buying Bitcoin Cash,"With bitcoin cash (BCH) now looking certain to split into two competing cryptocurrencies, some traders in Asia are betting that the sum of the parts will be worth more than the whole.  Specifically, these investors have been buying BCH in anticipation that Thursday's contentious network software upgrade, or hard fork, will leave them owning two coins with a combined value greater than the current price.  James Quinn, head of markets at Kenetic Capital, said even some institutions have gotten in on the act, as ""the number of requests and interests in the area increased remarkably in the general market development.""  While forks are a relatively new and complicated phenomenon unique to cryptocurrencies, they can be intuitive to traditional investors used to analyzing equities, Quinn told CoinDesk, explaining:  ""I think this type of trade is accessible and can be understood by institutions even if they don't have a lot of crypto experience, because in some way it's similar to a special dividend or stock split.""  As a result, the Hong Kong-based Kenetic, a cryptocurrency and blockchain investment firm that executes trades with its own capital and on behalf of institutions and high-net-worth individuals, has seen a significant uptick in BCH trades.  ""We are doing multiples of what we'd normally be looking at,"" Quinn said.  Kenetic is not alone. According to data from CoinMarketCap, daily BCH trading volume overall has seen significant growth since early November, climbing to as high as $1.4 billion on Nov. 4 – more than 6 times the $228 million seen on Nov. 1.  The increased buying pushed the price of BCH to as high as $638 on Nov. 7, though since then it has declined to around $500 as of press time. But the price still has a 10 percent premium over an average of about $450 throughout October.  Stepping back, bitcoin cash has been doing a hard fork roughly every six months since it split off from the original bitcoin network in August 2017. While previous upgrades were largely uneventful, the one coming up November 15 threatens to tear the community apart.  One camp has rallied behind the more-established version of the bitcoin cash software, known as bitcoin ABC, and keeping the network's current block size at 32 megabytes. The other, led by Craig Wright – one of the most polarizing figures in crypto, famous for claiming he is bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto – is pushing for an alternative called bitcoin SV (“Satoshi’s vision”) and an increase in the block size to 128 MB.  Last week, crypto exchanges with the largest trading volume for BCH including Binance, Huobi, OKEx and Bitfinex, all announced they will support the fork, bringing potential liquidity in the secondary market for the forked-off assets, should the split occur.  OKEx told CoinDesk that the exchange has also seen a similar trend, with an almost 10-time growth in BCH trading volume from institutional investors on the platform since last week.  ""We can see that traders are excited for the fork. Of course, everyone will try to capitalize on the creation of new coins. But at the same time, the huge increase in trading volume also indicates their confidence in the market, especially for institutional traders.” said Andy Cheung, head of operations at OKEx.  While Huobi and Binance declined to share specific data, a Huobi representative said: ""If it's about getting free candies, the expectations for institutions and retail traders are pretty aligned. So their overall trading trend is also similar.""  Quinn said Kenetic had sent out commentaries early November to clients explaining why this fork could be interesting but the actual volume didn't see an uptick until last week.  ""Other desks have done the same. We aren't the only desk that is talking about it,"" he said. ""It didn't seem like a lot of people were talking about it before November. ... So it's interesting to see how it has been there but the price actually didn't really start until early November.""  A 'risk-on' trade  To be sure, not every buyer is necessarily set on holding bitcoin cash until after the fork. Quinn said there may be investors that just take advantage of the uptick in volume and volatility but are not waiting on the fork specifically.  ""Whether institutions care [about arguments of the fork] depends on how they make decisions,"" he said. ""Some will use a more fundamental approach and may look for insight in how the fork may work out. Others won't care about the background really because they have a more quantitative approach.""  And this wouldn't be the first time traders made a bet on a hard fork. There was a similar buying trend in 2017 ahead of the one that led to bitcoin cash seceding from bitcoin.  But the context has changed. Back then, crypto prices were going gangbusters, and it was plausible to assume that a newly created token would surge in value once it hit the market.  This time around, it’s far from guaranteed that any ""free money"" BCH holders receive will be worth much for long.  ""The market was generally a lot active and hot, and generally bullish in 2017,"" Quinn said. ""Whereas in 2018, [the overall sentiment] was more like, ‘okay, none of this is working this year. Let's take some risk off.’”  As such, the BCH buying is “a risk-on type of trade,"" he said.  Yet the fact that investors are willing to take such risks is itself encouraging, Quinn said, concluding:  ""The price action, volumes and flows we've seen ahead of this fork have demonstrated interest in committing capital. We see this as constructive in terms of sentiment.

42402178,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3bnN,1542099653,"Australia's CSIRO, CommBank Complete 'Smart Money' Blockchain Trial","Australia’s federal science agency and one of the biggest commercial banks in the country say they have completed a successful trial of a prototype blockchain app that aims to make money ""smart.""  The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s (CSIRO) Data61 division and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank) announced the end of the trial Wednesday, saying the blockchain-based ""programmable money"" app could improve the management of insurance payouts and budgeting.  Part of a blockchain project dubbed Making Money Smart, the trial saw participation from 10 members of the country’s National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), allowing them to cut administration costs and remove paperwork.  The app is based on a blockchain token coded with smart contracts allowing participants and service providers to execute payments based on pre-defined conditions, such as who can spend which funds by what deadline.  ""We're excited by the potential to enable NDIS participants to exercise greater choice and control over their disability support services, while streamlining budget management and removing the need for paperwork,"" said Julie Hunter, CommBank's head of government and ADIs.  CSIRO and CommBank believe that if the prototype was developed and implemented at a full scale across Australia, it could save “hundreds of millions of dollars annually,” estimating that users of the app could potentially save 1–15 hours per week and 0.3–0.8 percent of annual revenue.  Mark Staples, Data61’s senior principal researcher in the Software and Computational Systems program, said that the use of blockchain could help them innovate “many payment environments and unlock network-effect benefits.”  He added:  ""This could include more directly connecting citizens to public policy programs, empowering people to optimise their spending through things like smart savings plans and smart diets, and reducing costs for businesses, including through the potential for self-taxing transactions.""  The CSIRO and CommBank first announced the plan to test the application in early October.

In a complaint submitted to the U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington at Seattle, Bitmain alleges that the unidentified thief stole 617 bitcoin from an account it holds at crypto exchange Binance, and is seeking a jury trial for damages.  According to the filing, the ""as-yet-to-be identified 'John Doe'"" stole the bitcoin holdings on April 22, 2018 from its account. With a single bitcoin valued at $8,935 at the time, the company is claiming that it is owed more than $5.5 million in damages.  Bitmain claims that the thief used the bitcoin in its Binance wallet to buy MANA – a crypto asset used as part of the Decentraland project – “at a price that was far above the going market rate.""  The thief also allegedly created a purchase order for ether using Bitmain's BTC wallet, before making another purchase order for MANA using Bitmain's ETH.  At the same time, the attacker created a sell order with their existing MANA wallet, allowing them to trade Bitmain's BTC for their MANA ""at a correspondingly inflated price,"" adding:  ""Upon information and belief, Binance's automated system matched the deflated MANA sell order with the deflated MANA purchase order and executed the trade and John Doe obtained significant gains—at the expense of Bitmain. As a result, John Doe benefitted twice from transferring MANA into and out of Bitmain's digital wallet.""  Jurisdiction  The complaint filing in Seattle, Washington, has to do with the fact that the alleged thief is said to have utilized an account they held with crypto exchange Bittrex. The lawsuit alleges that the MANA the thief used in the transaction was originally stored in a Bittrex wallet, and Bittrex is based out of Washington.  Moreover, “after John Doe had completed his/her theft of BTC from Bitmain, he/she transferred that BTC out of the John Doe's Binance wallet and ultimately into a digital wallet on the Bittrex cryptocurrency trading platform.”  The lawsuit is therefore claiming that the Washington court has jurisdiction over the matter based on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Washington Cybercrime Act and other computer fraud laws.  The court may also have jurisdiction depending on the thief's identity, the filing stated.  While Binance and Bittrex are named in the suit as the institutions providing accounts for Bitmain and the John Doe, neither are parties to the suit, meaning they are not being sued and are not suing.  An attorney for Bitmain declined to comment when reached.
