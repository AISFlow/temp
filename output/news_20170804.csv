42379673,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUVb,1501873220,Bitcoin Cash Block Production Accelerates as Mining Difficulty Adjusts,"After a slow start, blocks on the newly launched bitcoin cash blockchain are now being mined more frequently.  When the cryptocurrency originally split from the main bitcoin blockchain earlier this week, blocks were crawling in, with the first one taking about five hours to find and another taking nearly 13 hours. This came as no surprise to many, since bitcoin cash has much less mining power (with only a few groups, ViaBTC, Bitcoin.com and other unknowns securing the new blockchain).  But since blocks on the bitcoin blockchain are generated roughly every 10 minutes, some onlookers derided the new cryptocurrency for this initial roadblock, one that made it more difficult for users to send transactions or exchange bitcoin cash for other cryptocurrencies.  However, block speeds have since picked up a bit. Today, for example, there's been roughly one block per hour.  This change is directed by an automatic adjustment of the difficulty (a function that regulates how easy it is for miners to generate new cryptocurrency tokens). Bitcoin cash's difficulty has adjusted since it first broke off Tuesday, so miners are now having an easier time finding blocks.

42379680,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUeP,1501869639,Why Even Miners That Hate Bitcoin Cash Might Want to Mine It,"Block 478,617  on the bitcoin cash blockchain contained an interesting message – I won't repeat what it said, but let's just say the miner that mined this block doesn't seem very fond of bitcoin cash.  In this article, I'm going to explain what might motivate a miner that doesn't like bitcoin cash to mine a block on that chain.  Miner profitability  Before we can understand what's going on with miners between blockchains, we have to learn a little bit about how miners make money. Miners make bitcoin (or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency) by finding proof-of-work and creating blocks. They take both the coinbase reward (currently 12.5 BTC in bitcoin) and fees (roughly 1.5 BTC) for each block.  The actual difficulty of finding the proof-of-work varies, and is adjusted by the network so that a block is found every 10 minutes.  When the bitcoin cash fork happened on August 1, both bitcoin and bitcoin cash had the same exact difficulty. That meant that a miner had to do the same amount of work on either blockchain to find a block.  Since the reward is denominated in the currency of the blockchain, it's economically rational for miners to mine on the chain that has a higher price. While bitcoin cash had a high of 0.4 BTC on Bittrex recently, that's still nowhere near enough reward (0.4 * 14 = 5.6 BTC vs 14 BTC) for a miner to have enough economic incentive to mine Bitcoin Cash.  You might be asking yourself, why would any miner then mine on bitcoin cash?  If you're a miner that went only for short-term rewards, mining bitcoin cash would have made no sense. However, there are longer-term rewards to mining bitcoin cash that perhaps some miners were counting on. In any case, to offset these risks a bit, the bitcoin cash developers added an interesting hard fork rule that made mining on bitcoin cash easier.  Difficulty adjustments  As I explained in another article, bitcoin cash added a feature to adjust difficulty downward. Basically, if less than six blocks are found in 12 hours, the difficulty goes down by 20%.  But, a downward adjustment in difficulty has a lot of consequences for a miner. A miner will be able to find a block 20% faster and thus spend 20% less electricity. This means that mining a block on bitcoin cash becomes more attractive.  Block 478,571 took 13 hours to mine, so there were six difficulty adjustments downward. This resulted in the difficulty of bitcoin cash being roughly 26.2% that of bitcoin.  In this light, it is even possible that the amount of time it took to mine the 13-hour block was purposeful, meant to trigger adjustments and make bitcoin cash more attractive to mine.  Bitcoin is still more profitable to mine, though, as it is giving roughly 10x the reward (current ratio of bitcoin price to bitcoin cash price is roughly 10:1) for 4x the work.  If, however, there were another 12 hours of no blocks on the bitcoin cash chain, this would trigger another 6 difficulty adjustments downward. This would mean that the difficulty on bitcoin cash would be 6.87% that of Bitcoin.  The profitability calculation would suddenly change. Finding Bitcoin blocks would be 14.5x as hard as bitcoin cash and assuming the price ratio stayed at around 10:1, it would be more rational to mine bitcoin cash blocks instead.  An exodus of miners from one coin to the other may cause bitcoin cash's price to rise (hash power and price have correlated in coins in the past), making the problem worse.  Preventing a downward adjustment  So, how would a miner prevent a downward difficulty adjustment on bitcoin cash and trigger an exodus of mining power from bitcoin?  The easiest way is to make sure bitcoin cash mines 6 blocks every 12 hours! There are already miners that seem to be ideologically driven to keep mining on bitcoin cash, but another miner may have wanted to make sure there were six blocks every 12 hours in order to prevent the triggering of the downward difficulty adjustment.  By sacrificing some profit, a miner is able to prevent an exodus of other miners. But then this brings up another problem, how do you tell others you are mining Bitcoin Cash not to support it, but to prevent a difficulty adjustment?  That's where the coinbase message comes in. By adding the message that they did, they can signal to other miners that they're not really supporting bitcoin cash, but are blocking downward difficulty adjustments.  Conclusion  Game theory often produces counter-intuitive results like this.  Miners have to take into account what other miners will do, and take steps to prevent it if that's not in their interest.  If this miner holds to this strategy, we can expect that at least 6 blocks be found every 12 hours until block 479,808 when the normal difficulty adjustment will occur.

42379671,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KURp,1501864842,OTC Trade Group: Blockchain Smart Contracts Could Spark Interpretation Challenges,"Smart contracts may only see limited real-world applications in the near future, according to a new research paper.  The paper, released by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (a New York-based trade group for over-the-counter derivatives firms) and London-based law firm Linklaters LLP, casts a broad overview on smart contracts and distributed ledger tech. The ISDA, formed in the 1980's, counts more than 800 firms among its membership, according to the group's website.  It notably posits that the use of such contracts, which are self-executing pieces of code tied to certain conditions, are more likely to be used only in particular instances.  The paper's authors argue:  ""Certain operational clauses within legal contracts lend themselves to being automated. Other non-operational clauses – for instance, the governing law of a contract – are less susceptible to being expressed in machine-readable code. Some legal clauses are subjective or require interpretation, which also creates challenges.""  Operational clauses, according to the paper, refer to more objective legal actions, for example one that requires a payment on a certain date based on an amount calculated by the nature of a work.  ""It is assumed the most likely implementations of smart contracts in the near term will relate to operational clauses...rather than to non-operational clauses,"" the report reads.  Non-operational clauses, on the other hand, are more subjective to human interpretations, such as when the law should be applied under certain conditions. The paper's authors state that in their view, programmable contracts bay not be able to account for the subjective nuances that exist in human interpretation.  ""For example, if an event of default occurs under an ISDA Master Agreement, this gives the non-defaulting party the right to terminate outstanding transactions. But the non-defaulting party might decide it does not want to exercise such a termination right at that time...depending on the commercial and relationship context at the time of the event, the nature of the default, and other external factors,"" the paper noted.  But even within those operational clauses, the authors suggest that a more standardized definition of complicated terms and activities need to be outlined before the smart contracts can be put into work.  ""This would require those actions – for instance, payments and deliveries – to be represented in a more formal, standard way within the ISDA Definitions, enabling them to be read by machines,"" the paper concluded.

42379669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUT5,1501859115,Filecoin Presale Raises $52 Million Ahead of ICO Launch,"San Francisco-based startup Protocol Labs has sold $52 million in a token pre-sale ahead of an initial coin offering launch next week.  Notable backers of the Filecoin pre-sale include Union Square Ventures and Sequoia Capital, according to a representative of the startup. The Wall Street Journal covered the pre-sale earlier today, and in a tweet, reporter Yuliya Chernova said that Winklevoss Capital, Digital Currency Group and Y Combinator president Sam Altman also took part.  The startup did not immediately respond to a request for additional information about the pre-sale’s backers.  Filecoin is a blockchain-based data storage network with its own built-in cryptocurrency. The idea is that users can effectively offer some of their excess storage capacity for sale, and receive payment in the form of filecoins.  Next week’s sale is limited to accredited investors, who can participate via a platform called CoinList, which was developed by Protocol Labs and startup investment platform AngelList.  The platform’s stated aim is to serve as a platform for regulation-compliant ICOs, incorporating an issuance framework called the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, or SAFT.  The sale comes amid growing interest – and participation – in token sales. According to data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker, more than $1.6 billion has been raised through ICOs between 2014 and 2017.

As CoinDesk reported, BTC-e – one of the longest-running and most secretive of the world's bitcoin exchanges – was targeted in a broad international police effort last week.  Authorities in Greece moved to arrest Alexander Vinnik, who was accused of operating BTC-e and laundering billions of dollars with bitcoin over a multi-year period. U.S. prosecutors later unveiled a 21-count indictment that included a $110 million civil fine levied against BTC-e itself.  However, just days later, BTC-e's account on the Bitcoin Talk forum came to life. In that initial message, the exchange promised to return funds to users, though no clear deadline was offered at the time. It further denied that Vinnik was the mastermind behind the exchange or even an ""employee of our service"".  In the latest message, BTC-e said (statement translated from Russian):  ""We were able to access our databases and wallets, at the moment we are evaluating data and balances on [coins], this information will be made public by the end of next week.""  It remains unclear who from the exchange is posting through the account.

42379688,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUlx,1501848007,$1.6 Billion: All-Time ICO Funding Climbs as Record $500 Million Invested in July,"Blockchain projects have raised a total of $1.67 billion via initial coin offerings (ICOs) so far – a figure that was bolstered by a record-breaking month of July, according to data from the CoinDesk ICO Tracker.  Incorporating data from 2014 to 2017, the newly unveiled data explorer showcases the rapid growth observed so far in the nascent sector. And should ICOs continue their torrid pace, they are likely to even eclipse all-time venture capital investments in August.  According to CoinDesk data, blockchain startups have raised just under $1.8 billion through traditional venture capital firms.  Although the numbers look small when compared to the booming US IPO market, where more than $22 billion was raised this year (according to Renaissance Capital), the rate of growth is objectively astonishing.  In total, $1.38 billion of the total $1.67 billion in ICO funding was raised in 2017, which represents more than 600% growth year-over-year.  The impressive figures were boosted by a July in which blockchain projects raised more than $540 million, making it the third month in a row in which a new monthly record was set.  Perhaps in response, traditional venture capital investments in blockchain companies have slowed down in the last two months.  After peaking in May with a then-record-breaking $107 million funding round for banking consortium R3, traditional blockchain investments only raised $6.12 million in July.  In Q2, blockchain projects raised nearly $800 million in ICOs, dwarfing the $241.3 million total funding provided through traditional venture capital.

42379684,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUgv,1501840808,Patent Reveals Nasdaq Planning Blockchain-Powered Data System,"Exchange operator Nasdaq is seeking to patent a system for securely distributing time-sensitive information via a blockchain.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) released the patent application – entitled ""Systems and Methods for Securing and Disseminating Time Sensitive Information Using a Blockchain"" – on August 3, though it was initially submitted in late January of this year.  Overall, the document details how the system, by way of running on a distributed platform, enables information to be transmitted and timestamped, in a way that's reminiscent of bitcoin transactions on the blockchain.  According to the application, the system would enable a user to submit a time-sensitive document to an authority, who, after making edits, could share it with a third party for approval.  Each modification would be recorded and updated on a distributed ledger, in a bid to ensure transparency and prevent any alteration of that data. The system would also incorporate cryptography by giving each participant a public identifier and a corresponding private key.  As such, the patent represents the latest effort by Nasdaq to secure rights related to its work with blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  Last October, the USPTO published a patent application from Nasdaq detailing a plan to create blockchain ""backups"" for exchanges, that would create an auxiliary record of transactions in the event of an emergency.

42379676,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUZN,1501833629,Mastercard Eyes Cryptocurrency Refunds in New Patent Application,"A new patent application from Mastercard suggests that the global credit card issuer is exploring ways to build refund services for cryptocurrency users.  The application, titled ""Information Transaction Infrastructure"", was published by the the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on August 3, having been submitted in late January. Vladimir Goloshchuk, who according to LinkedIn previously worked as a senior analyst at Mastercard, is listed as the sole inventor.  The application details an infrastructure through which users could verify their identities, which would then be linked to cryptocurrency addresses they elect to disclose.  The text of the application points to this being most relevant for situations in which users are submitting payments to merchants from accounts on exchanges, or other services, in which their funds may be held alongside those belonging to others.  In the event that a merchant has to send the money back for a refund, they would send it back to an address linked to that user's account – a situation in which the exchange or custody holder might then need to know where those funds are being sourced from and why.  To counter this, Mastercard proposes a way for users, through a shared service, to have two kinds of wallets.  ""The basic principle of the arrangement ... is that a user of the shared wallet service has two types of wallet. Firstly, they have a 'public' wallet for on-the-chain publicly visible and verified transactions. The user will make and receive cryptocurrency payments external to the shared wallet service using a public wallet,"" the application explains, adding:  ""Using this approach, the refund problem can be addressed – a payment received from the public wallet can be refunded by an equal payment back to the public wallet.""  The application is the latest from Mastercard, which has filed several patents in the past few years. The company has also developed projects focused on blockchain tech, releasing a set of dedicated APIs last fall.
