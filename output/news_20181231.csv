42430073,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0Xh,1546275357,Fidelity's Man: Can Tom Jessop Bridge Crypto and Wall Street for Good?,"Everyone in cryptocurrency has a story about the time they went down the proverbial rabbit hole. Tom Jessop’s takes place in his kitchen.  It was around 2013 or 2014 when Jessop, then a managing director at Goldman Sachs with two decades of Wall Street experience, became enthralled with bitcoin – at the time an obscure topic in finance circles.  ""This idea of this scarce asset, this fully digital money, cryptographic trust replacing institutional trust – all these things, I thought, were interesting,"" Jessop recalls.  As part of his self-education, he tried to explain the phenomenon to his wife and three sons. ""We ended up watching a Khan Academy video there in the kitchen,"" Jessop told CoinDesk. ""My youngest son at the time was 10 or 11. No one understood it. My little guy said 'I understand it.' For an 11- year-old, he did a reasonably passable job explaining it to me.""  Looking back on it all, he understands why people struggle with the concept, explaining:  ""In hindsight the reason my family didn't understand it is: it sort of challenges how you think about money. A lot of people think money, fiat money in particular, has intrinsic value. It doesn't. If you can't understand that, there's this mental thing, and you can't get to the next level.""  Jessop, however, did get to that next level of understanding. And now, nearly five years later, he and his team at Fidelity Digital Assets (FDAS) are poised to help take the cryptocurrency market to a new level of maturity – and, perhaps eventually, liquidity.  Fidelity Investments will officially launch the new business, a trading platform built for institutional investors, in the first quarter of 2019. The product of years of behind-the-scenes research, experimentation and planning at the Boston-based asset management giant, FDAS represents one of the boldest moves to date in the space by an incumbent financial institution.  The platform promises to address market structure problems that have kept crypto-curious big-money investors on the sidelines, specifically around issues like custody of assets and price discovery. By offering to safekeep bitcoin and ether on behalf of hedge funds, family offices and the like, and to match their buy and sell offers with a range of liquidity providers and exchanges, FDAS aims to make these institutions feel at home in a nascent market infamous for hacks, thefts and a lack of transparency.  That doesn’t necessarily mean the launch of FDAS, or other soon-to-open institutional markets like New York Stock Exchange parent ICE Group’s futures platform Bakkt, will immediately resuscitate crypto prices from their year-long funk. But they are laying important groundwork for the industry’s long-term growth.  ""What will really make an impact is the next bull run, when these institutional tools are available,"" said Daniel Cawrey, chief executive officer of Pactum Capital, an over-the-counter (OTC) trading firm.  Jessop is perhaps unusually suited to lead such an effort, given his pedigree. He’s worked in traditional capital markets, but also invested in blockchain startups and helped run one for a time. He sees the long-term promise in open financial networks but has also pitched blockchain tech to enterprises and knows what they require to be comfortable, and compliant, dealing with crypto assets.  ""He has this unique combination of skill sets bridging all these areas and real experience in bringing emerging technologies to market,"" said Jill Carlson, a blockchain consultant and fellow Wall Street veteran who worked with Jessop at the startup Chain in 2017.  The road to Fidelity  Soft-spoken and genial, Jessop is a far cry from the stereotype of Wall Street executives as ""human piranhas"" or ""masters of the universe.""  ""He just doesn’t have a bad bone in his body, and he's no pushover, a unique combination,” said Brad Levy, who worked with Jessop in Goldman’s principal strategic investments (PSI) group. ""He somehow finds a way to be ambitious and forward without hurting people in the process.""  Levy credits Jessop for helping Goldman to reshape the U.S. equity markets in the early 2000s, for example, through the firm’s investment in Archipelago, an early electronic stock trading platform (which eventually mergedhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/nyse-completes-acquisition-of-archipelago-holdings with the New York Stock Exchange).  ""Tom played a big role in all that coming together from a Goldman perspective, benefiting the market and us at that time,"" said Levy, now the CEO of MarkitSERV and global head of loans at IHS Markit.  By the mid-2010s, Jessop was helping to put together Goldman’s investments in fintech startups, including a small but symbolically important stake in one of the longest-running exchange services, Circle Internet Financial. ""In 2015, there had not been a lot of large players in banking who had made investments in companies in the space, so it was noteworthy back then,"" said Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire.  Carlson, who was working at Goldman as a bond trader around that time, agreed that taking a stake in a bitcoin startup was a bold move for that era.  ""It's easy to forget now, but just a few years ago, to use the word 'bitcoin' or 'blockchain' within a bank would get you raised eyebrows or people looking at you with a puzzled look, like, 'What is this thing you’re talking about?'"" she said. ""Now there’s this stereotype of the Wall Street person who bought into bitcoin, but when Tom got into the space, making the investment in Circle, that was definitely not the case.""  Jessop himself sounds more humble than anything else when he talks about this period, when he met with early evangelists of the space like Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert, and spoke on panels with the likes of Balaji Srinivasan of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (now the CTO at Coinbase).  ""It was crazy, trying to learn at the same time as these people, who were further ahead, were doing interesting stuff,"" Jessop told CoinDesk.  In April 2017, no longer content with just investing and learning from startups, he joined one, becoming the president of Chain. That company, founded by Adam Ludwin, had started in 2014 as a provider of APIs for bitcoin developers but repositioned itself the following year as a vendor of blockchain technology to enterprises. ""Visa was a big client. That was exciting because Visa had something in production,"" Jessop said.  Stepping back, the conventional wisdom during the 2014-2016 bear market was that digital currencies running on public networks weren't going anywhere anytime soon, but that businesses could leverage the tech to create their own private versions.  But the year he came on board at Chain, the crypto market came roaring back, and the zeitgeist once again shifted away from gated corporate blockchains in favor of the public ones powering digital coins and tokens. So did his new employer.  ""The founders decided to do something more in the public space,"" Jessop said. ""In the span of nine months to a year they completely pivoted the business model."" (The transformation became apparent to outsiders in September 2018, when Chain was acquired by Lightyear, a for-profit company building on top of the public Stellar protocol.)  It wasn't what Jessop had signed up for – though that’s not to say he was averse to public blockchains. ""By no stretch of the imagination am I a private-versus-public guy,"" he said. ""Everything we’re doing here [at Fidelity] is public, and I love it. And I’ve always had a keen interest in both."" But at Chain, ""I didn’t feel I could be particularly helpful to them in where their business was headed.""  As Chain moved in a new direction, Jessop started talking to Fidelity, and he joined the company in January 2018 as head of corporate business development. It was a similar job to one he'd held at Goldman, scouting for M&A, venture and partnership opportunities.  But very soon, Fidelity would hand him a bigger challenge.  Not your grandfather’s money manager  To understand the significance of that challenge, it helps to recall how Fidelity, the world’s fourth-largest asset manager, had positioned itself as an unusually crypto-friendly corporation.  For years, Fidelity had been studying bitcoin. Not just ""the blockchain,"" which had been the politically correct area of interest for regulated, reputation-conscious financial institutions, but bitcoin itself. This curiosity had stemmed from a wargaming exercise that took place in 2014.  ""We were trying to envision what potential futures might look like that we weren't putting any probability against but just trying to prepare for and imagine the possibilities of,"" recalled Katie Chase, a senior vice president at Fidelity who was involved in these scenario-planning discussions. ""One of them was 'frictionless capital markets.'""  ""Frictionless"" described bitcoin, or at least certain aspects of it. Transactions in the cryptocurrency typically settled in minutes, rather than the days it took for bank transfers or securities trades (and weeks or even months for instruments like syndicated loans).  While buying or selling bitcoin through exchanges like the now-defunct Mt. Gox was a cumbersome process for early adopters, once on-boarded, you could zap value across the globe instantaneously. (Well, nearly instantaneously; more on that shortly.) Picture the Autobahn… except with really crummy on- and off-ramps.  Was this the ""straight-through processing"" that financial professionals had long dreamed of? The strategic planners at Fidelity thought it was worth at least investigating.  The company started experimenting with crypto in the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology (FCAT), an R&D lab. Some of its early trials had inauspicious results, such as allowing employees to buy food with bitcoin at the company cafeteria. Chase recalls an awkward time when a senior executive held up the line trying to pay for a snack with the cryptocurrency.  ""The cashier was trying to wait for the transaction to clear. That can take a while, as opposed to giving him his banana and assuming the transaction would come through,"" she said. Unlike a credit card transaction, in crypto there’s no intermediary to guarantee eventual payment. So even though a merchant won't have to wait days to see the money, as they would with Visa or Mastercard, it might take 20 minutes to get a confirmation that the transaction was recorded in the blockchain rather than an immediate authorization.  Friction at the point of sale aside, the employee pilot taught FCAT another lesson. ""People don’t want to spend their bitcoin,"" Chase said, because it tends to appreciate over time. ""You hear all these stories about how someone transferred $1 to their friend, 'Yay, good job.' They come to realize that that $1 in today's terms is many many more dollars.""  While that didn’t bode well for bitcoin as an everyday currency, it underscored the case for the asset as ""digital gold,"" a long-term store of value for those willing to stomach the volatility.  Fidelity's explorations continued. In 2015, a blockchain incubator was spun up within FCAT. The researchers started mining bitcoin, an activity that continues to this day, according to Chase, who now runs the incubator. Fidelity's charitable arm began accepting crypto donations.  And then there was the coming-out party: In May 2017, Abigail Johnson, the chairman and CEO of Fidelity, spoke at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017. ""I love this stuff,"" she declared, sporting a ""Vote Nakamoto"" pin, a humorous reference to bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator.  The fact that Fidelity is a privately held company (49 percent owned by Johnson’s family) helps explain why it can push the envelope this way. Spared from the pressure of having to show short-term profit growth quarter after quarter, it can invest in cutting-edge projects that might not pay off fast enough to satisfy Wall Street analysts’ expectations.  Crypto is not the only example of Fidelity’s adventurousness. Jessop notes that Fidelity was one of the first firms to offer online trading back in 1993, via the internet but not on the World Wide Web, which was still in its infancy. ""There’s this reinvestment in innovation here which I think is unique,"" he said.  Notably, Fidelity has not participated in any of the private enterprise blockchain consortiums, like R3 or Hyperledger, that other banks and financial companies joined.  ""To date, the technology isn’t mature enough for it to be particularly impactful in the securities space,"" explained Chase, citing scalability and privacy issues. She said:  ""Ultimately, we believe the future is in open permissionless ledgers. Right now the technology’s just not ready for us to be doing financial securities transactions on open permissionless ledgers.""  All things considered, then, it wasn't a huge surprise that the first business to graduate from the FCAT blockchain incubator was not some esoteric back-office play, like using a shared ledger to track proxy votes or audits. Instead, Fidelity decided to build a business around what is arguably the most successful application of blockchain so far: trading crypto.  The corporate type  Not long after Jessop arrived at Fidelity in January 2018, he was asked to lead the new business, which would fill a gap the team had identified.  ""We didn’t see an institutional quality offering in the market,"" he said. ""People are trying to be institutional, but not the way institutions want to consume that service.""  Further, Fidelity saw institutions are the more appropriate investor category to make its initial focus. ""Digital assets is an emerging asset class, [with] a lot of volatility,"" Jessop said. ""A lot of things still need to be proven out. Institutions are more sophisticated in terms of how they think about this stuff.""  The business plan was kept under wraps for most of 2018, as Jessop recruited employees (his team is now 100 strong) and got the wallet and other technology that the incubator had already developed ready for production.  ""When you’re using things internally, you don’t really need fancy, intuitive front ends. But when you have a customer who’s going to be interfacing with the system, you have to do UI/UX design,"" he explained, by way of example. ""So it’s really just productizing these technical components and objects that we’d already been using internally.""  After FDAS was unveiled in mid-October, some on Wall Street scratched their heads that Fidelity, best known as a consumer financial brand, was courting institutions. ""People see us as an asset manager and a personal wealth manager. But we have an institutional business,"" Jessop said. ""We have a capital markets business. We service about 13,000 banks, broker-dealers, funds. So we have that DNA.""  And with that DNA, FDAS aims to bring a level of sophistication to the market previously unseen from service providers in crypto. Take, for example, its custody offering.  For context, the blockchain industry has already developed innovative ways to safeguard assets, such as cold storage (keeping the cryptographic private key to a wallet offline, either on a device disconnected from the internet or a piece of paper locked away in a safe) and multi-signature wallets (which can be programmed to require more than one private key to release funds).  To some extent, these innovations were born out of necessity, since crypto is a bearer asset, more like cash or jewelry than stocks or bonds. Knowledge of the private key means control of the asset, and if a key is compromised and the thief transfers money out of a wallet, it is gone for good.  According to Jessop, FDAS will marry crypto security methods with processes and procedures that enterprise clients expect, things Fidelity does as a matter of course in its traditional custody business. ""You think about another custodian keeping your own personal coins at Xapo or Coinbase, there's a single login. Institutions don't want that,"" he said. ""Institutions want something called 'maker-checker' – the segregation of duties in which two individuals within an organization must sign off on a transaction.""  Think of it as the corporate, pre-crypto forerunner of multi-sig. ""You might be able to say, 'I want to transfer bitcoin out of a wallet' but guess what, there's someone else in your organization who needs to approve that electronically before it can happen,"" Jessop said.  Another potential differentiator: Leveraging Fidelity’s insurance relationships, FDAS has obtained an insurance policy against theft or loss of the digital asset it will custody for clients. Such coverage is notoriously scarce right now, in part because the insurance industry doesn’t have much of a track record to go on in underwriting the risk. As Cawrey of Pactum put it: ""Any insurance policy in crypto is bespoke.""  Jessop would not name the carriers or say how much coverage FDAS secured, but he said it is significant. ""Based on what our knowledge was of industry capacity at the time we asked for the insurance, we were pleasantly surprised by how much we got,"" he said.  However, Jessop was clear that Fidelity's own balance sheet won't be an additional backstop for losses, since FDAS is separately capitalized from the parent company, ""a standalone business unit."" This is also one reason FDAS is pursuing state licenses rather than piggybacking on Fidelity’s federal broker-dealer license, Jessop said.  A slow burn  On the trading side, Jessop emphasizes that FDAS will not be an exchange. Rather, it will act as a brokerage, helping clients find the best price available across a highly fragmented global market.  ""If you’re an institution now and you want to trade digital assets you need to open accounts at various exchanges and fund those accounts,"" he explained. ""There’s no concept of a consolidated tape. I have to interrogate those exchanges separately to see who's got the best price and then execute.""  To address this problem, at the outset FDAS will allow clients to submit buy or sell orders and have liquidity providers compete for their business.  ""Our goal is that those liquidity providers will quote tight markets around some benchmark or index,"" Jessop said. ""So clients have a sense that they are getting a best-price experience through Fidelity.""  And over time, it may ""cross"" orders, i.e. match one investor client’s order with another’s, he added, though ""that won’t happen until there’s a critical mass of trading activity on the system.""  Implicit in that statement is the assumption that critical mass won’t be there on Day 1. So it bears repeating: anyone expecting bitcoin or ether prices to go ""to the moon"" in the first quarter simply as a result of FDAS (or Bakkt) coming online is likely to be disappointed.  To put things in perspective: Allaire says Circle signed up 1,000 institutional clients in 2018, and while the majority have started trading crypto, many are ""waiting and getting ready.""  ""The nature of the institutions involved today, it’s not the BlackRocks or pension funds or large asset managers,"" Allaire went on. Rather, the players to date have been smaller pools of capital, like hedge funds and family offices.  Hence, while Fidelity’s platform ""is going to be useful"" in bringing in the larger investors, ""they’re a little bit ahead of the market,"" Allaire said. ""It’s not like asset managers are banging down the door to get some bitcoin.""  Such caveats aside, it’s still fair to say FDAS’ conception is a milestone for cryptocurrency.  ""Fidelity was one of the more real and most exciting announcements of 2018,"" Carlson said, adding:  ""The fact that a mainstream, retail but big financial markets platform is moving into crypto in such a serious way – not just a proof of concept, not just dipping a toe in the water, but diving into the deep end – is a huge leap, and hopefully a testament to the fact that this space has now grown up and become an industry and is here to stay.""  Even Caitlin Long, a former Morgan Stanley executive turned bitcoin and blockchain advocate who has expressed worries that Wall Street will ruin crypto by ""financializing"" it through practices like rehypothecation (essentially, creating multiple claims on the same asset), said this is less of a concern with Fidelity.  ""Fidelity is a lot more likely to be careful about these issues than the sell-side firms ... because Fidelity (and other mutual fund companies) are on the losing end of these practices in securities markets,"" Long said. ""So I’m more optimistic that Fidelity will do this right.""  2019 and beyond  By December, FDAS had signed its first investor client. Jessop said the platform will launch in the first quarter of 2019 and will spend the first half of the year ""executing on the richer pipeline opportunities, things we’ve been cultivating for a couple of months,"" while making sure ""everything is working and we’ve shaken off the kinks, so to speak.""  As for the revenue model, Jessop said FDAS will charge a commission on trades (no spread, since it won’t be taking a principal position) and a fee based on assets under custody.  To start, it will facilitate the trading of bitcoin and ether, and then look selectively at adding the rest of the top five to seven coins by market cap. Notably, the other reason FDAS won’t seek a broker-dealer license, according to Jessop, is that it doesn’t need one, since it won’t be dealing in securities – suggesting that tokens from initial coin offerings (ICOs) that are at risk of being designated securities by regulators won’t be supported on the platform for the foreseeable future.  But that doesn’t mean Fidelity doesn’t see a bright future for the representation of securities with tokens on a blockchain.  ""We envision a day when people will trade stocks, bonds, real estate, private securities in tokenized format,"" Jessop said. ""It’s not just getting this parallel universe with these new assets, but the application of the underlying technology to the existing financial system. Which is incredibly powerful.""  He noted recent transactions in which a Colorado hotel and a World Bank bond issue were tokenized. ""We’re watching that trend carefully,"" he said. ""That’s the fullest expression of what we’ve built and quite frankly it has much more applicability than to just bitcoin, ether and other things.""  Five years out, he predicted:  ""You’ll have an interesting mix of assets that only exist because the technology allowed them to exist [and also] other assets that want to take advantage of the technology. We’ll be custodying all of those things and we’ll be developing other types of services that make us look more like a full-service institutional brokerage for this asset class. So we think this is actually a new type of brokerage business.""  In the meantime, Jessop advises observers of the blockchain industry not to put too much stock in the price doldrums of 2018.  ""It’s very easy to over-index on what’s going on in the market right now from a price standpoint,"" he said. ""If you look at the uptake of [bitcoin scaling project] Lightning, if you look at institutional investor attitudes in this space … things are probably more robust than the casual observer would see.""  For example, he noted that venture funding for the industry in 2018 approached $3 billion, a nearly threefold experience from the year before.  ""There’s a lot more smart money coming into the field, a lot more smart people from academia,"" he said.  And showing that his passion for crypto goes way beyond lucre, Jessop expressed wonderment at the accomplishments of the community’s open-source software developers.  He concluded:  ""It’s fascinating, it’s like the power of the crowd. In a way it’s like this massively crowdsourced innovation around what money is and could be or what assets could be. It’s really exciting if you tune off the market data terminal for a while.""    ––––––––––––––––––––––––    Original art by HyperDragons / MixMarvel (@mixhyperdragons)  Photos by Marc Hochstein for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/fidelitys-man-can-tom-jessop-bridge-crypto-and-wall-street-for-good,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50c53c32050699e0343f0d8ec7ab2873e730cf17-1720x861.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430068,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0Nh,1546275344,"Crypto Mom's Crusade: Inside the SEC, Hester Peirce Is Putting Up a Fight","""It’s always time for a change.""  Unexpected words from a regulator, but then again, Hester Peirce, one of the five commissioners at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), isn’t an average regulator.  When she speaks of the disruptive role of cryptocurrencies, her words could pass for those of any aspiring blockchain disruptor.  ""I'm excited to see what's going to happen over the next 10 years, how our lives will be affected and I'm excited to see how that will happen,” she remarks over conversation in Washington, D.C., blocks away from the very agency many believe is doing its best to slow that transition, at least when it comes to cryptocurrencies.  Yet, unlike most regulators in Washington, Peirce is unabashedly optimistic about the changes blockchains could bring to society.  It’s not exactly a secret either that she feels that way. You probably know Peirce as “Crypto Mom” – a nickname given after her now infamous remarks dissenting a decision by the SEC to reject an exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering exposure to bitcoin.  But Peirce’s dissent didn’t just contest the disapproval of what would have been the first exchange-traded vehicle of its kind. It was also a rallying cry for bitcoin believers who reject arguments the SEC has been using to delay a key milestone in its market maturation.  To Peirce, it's an overstep; she argues it's not the role of regulators to tell investors where they should invest their money.  So, if others at the SEC see crypto as a market that needs to be kept at arm’s length, Peirce’s concern is that regulators risk taking over the narrative around crypto innovation.  ""I say we let them give it a try,"" she says, with a gaze to match.  Indeed, the very idea that she’s been selected for this list is a symptom of the problem in the eyes of Peirce, who tells CoinDesk:  ""I don’t want this world to be a world about regulators. I want it to be a world about entrepreneurs.""  Creating change from the inside  Sure, other regulators have said supportive things about cryptocurrency in 2018.  Even Peirce’s nickname is a nod to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s J. Christopher Giancarlo, who earned the moniker “Crypto Dad” for remarks at a U.S. Senate hearing in which he framed the technology as a generational issue.  But if others have made similar comments to less effect, it’s perhaps Peirce’s assured tone that separates her.  Her voice seems to always ring clear, even through the ambient bustle of a D.C. pizzeria. Sitting back in her chair, she confidently rattles off use cases for blockchain in remittances, micropayments, prediction markets and more.  Although, if she sounds like someone who’s about to jump to the private sector, Peirce, who spent over a decade in government before the SEC, clearly sees herself as a regulator first.  It's also the role of the agency itself that has amplified her actions. Due to the swift rise of initial coin offerings – at one point in 2017, they even surpassed VC funding as a way of raising capital – the SEC has found itself in need of a clear position on just who can issue cryptocurrencies.  Still, it's less clear what Peirce’s public emergence infers about that question. For one, she alone isn't able to overturn what she called consensus-driven decisions at the agency.  Labeling her dissent one incremental step ""to making the Commission a little more open to innovation,"" Peirce gets that the SEC won’t change its apprehensive attitude on crypto ""overnight.""  ""I came to the SEC, having been here before, knowing that [regulators] are not particularly good with innovation,"" she says.  For 2019, she’s eager to work on key ""non-enforcement guidance"" for cryptocurrencies, listing three different goals for the agency: clarifying whether a cryptocurrency is a security or not, helping people determine when a cryptocurrency might transition from a security into something else and helping trading platforms understand when they are falling short of SEC requirements.  Peirce isn’t concerned about whether those efforts will pay off; she believes they will, over time, and you believe her when she says it.  Ohioan at heart  If she’s out of place at the SEC, though, Peirce also feels like an outsider in Washington.  Despite having resided in the city for 20 years, Peirce doesn’t consider the city her home. She tells me that her heart is still in Ohio. “I still hope to go back to Cleveland one day,” she admits flipping through a menu, “My family is still there. My parents are still there.”  At the same time, Peirce feels drawn to the SEC for its key role in enforcing and creating the framework under which the U.S. capital markets operate.  These markets being a fascinating and powerful force in Peirce’s eyes, her aim as a commissioner from the outset was and still remains all about expanding market access.  She says:  ""The reason I took this job is because I think our capital markets are an amazing resource for the country and so I care about them. I think they’re a key to unlocking potential in people. … I want to look at ways that we can make it easier for people, a broad range of people, to use those markets.""  Peirce recounts that studying economics at Case Western Reserve University ""fundamentally changed"" the way she viewed the world. Going on to pursue a law degree at Yale, Peirce would spend close to a decade working in the early days of her career at the SEC as a staff attorney and counsel.  From there, she went on to work for a period under Senator Richard Shelby on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Another pivotal moment in Peirce’s professional career was her work on Capitol Hill overseeing regulatory reform after the 2008 financial crisis.  The aftermath of what economists now describe as the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression ultimately got Peirce thinking.  ""What is broken in our [financial] system? What is that causes that problem?... Are we responding to it in the right way? Are we making problems worse?"" she asked.  The role of a regulator, Peirce now believes, is to ensure regulation is written in such a way that ""allows disruptive technologies to come in, allows innovators to come in and challenge the way things have traditionally been done.""  'Not knocking people over'  So, is she living up to that ideal?  Waiting now for the check, I begin to pry a bit more about her role inside the agency: ""Are you able to disclose whether you were responsible for starting the reviews of the nine ETFs that were rejected?""  Peirce's response to my burning question is a kind but unmoving no.  ""Some votes get disclosed and other votes don't. That's a vote that doesn’t get disclosed,"" she explains.  As for that mystery, it seems, we have only our suspicions. Outside of Peirce’s dissent in July, she tweeted in August that the SEC would move to review a decision disapproving nine different bitcoin ETF proposals, effectively breaking the news ahead of the agency.  With no evidence to suggest the action for review had been petitioned by either of the two exchanges filing the proposals (as was previously done in the case of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust), proponents in the crypto industry could only guess ""Crypto Mom"" was behind the action.  Neither do we know how this conversation is progressing inside the SEC itself, as the outcome of the review has yet to revealed. What’s more, one additional proposal – submitted by money management firm VanEck and startup SolidX – remains undecided upon by the SEC, which has until late February of next year to either approve or reject.  As such, there is hope yet in the new year for investors wanting greater exposure to bitcoin through traditional stock exchanges.  At the same time, chances for regulatory approval aren't exactly high especially given a recent address by SEC chairman Jay Clayton.  Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus: Invest conference in November, Clayton warned of persistent concerns over market manipulation barring widespread support from regulators for the open sale and trade of a bitcoin ETF.  This year alone having seen both the launch of an official investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into cryptocurrency trading, as well as the publication of new academic research suggesting evidence of illicit market tactics to boost bitcoin price, regulators like Clayton at the SEC are hesitant to endorse crypto-based securities.  ""How that [manipulation] issue gets addressed, I don't have a particular path. But it needs to be,"" Clayton stated at the conference.  Bringing up these same concerns with Peirce now, she begins by questioning the ""statutory authority"" she and her fellow commissioners have at the SEC to consider the behavior of the underlying bitcoin markets.  Shaking her head, she tells me:  ""Underlying markets are often very messy. Minerals are often mined and traded on exchange in parts of the world that we don’t have any say over or have any regulatory authority over. … From my perspective, we shouldn't have to look at that. The community itself is looking at those issues.""  ""If the regulator is too involved in how that all works, they can mess it all up,"" insists Peirce.  Getting up to gather her things, Peirce accidentally bumps into one of the servers at the restaurant, a move she quickly uses to underscore her point.  ""See! Regulators are supposed to be in the background, not knocking people over.""  Full steam ahead  Back inside the SEC, Peirce is showing me a picture of a steamship, not exactly an example of ""cutting-edge"" technology. But to Peirce the picture is a useful reminder of ""how technology changes"" over time.  Thinking now to the present-day, Peirce likens present market trends in the cryptocurrency industry to a healthy process of ""winnowing.""  ""I think people are getting more sophisticated in thinking through: these are the markers of a potentially successful project and these are the hallmarks of one that’s nothing more than a scam,"" she remarks.  In the same way, she also seems to understand the SEC needs to take its time, undergoing a lengthy process of review before reaching a conclusion.  ""Don’t sit on the edge of your chairs waiting for something to happen from the SEC. You have to go on with what you’re doing,"" Peirce advises.  For her part, Peirce affirms that she will continue to work ""in the background"" to allow innovation in the crypto markets to flourish.  How impactful will those efforts be? Time will tell. But if this resolve isn’t already shared by nearly all innovators and entrepreneurs in the crypto space already, this next one surely is.  She concludes:  ""I would suspect that I will continue to want things to move faster than they sometimes do.""    ––––––––––––––––––––––––    Art by Diego Rodriguez (Plasma Bears by @NeonDistrictRPG)  Original photos by Christine Kim for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/crypto-moms-crusade-inside-the-sec-hester-peirce-is-putting-up-a-fight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e57323e7fa15fe58c7a5887d0a7b15bcc74ee9fc-1720x861.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430070,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0Rh,1546275331,Stable Times at Circle: A Crypto Startup Counted Out Is Riding High,"As I walked from my car to Circle’s offices in Boston on a Friday afternoon in early November, the sun appeared to have already set, even though it would be up a while longer – past 4:00 p.m.  The weather was gray, windy and cold – above freezing, but only because it was due to rain biblically for the entire drive back to New York. If a bright orange parking ticket wasn’t already fluttering on my windshield, it would be soon. Oh, and bitcoin was down two-thirds from its peak less than a year beforehand, with further to fall.  Winter – crypto winter, winter winter – had arrived.  But Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s co-founder and CEO, didn’t seem to care. Asked if crypto market conditions had affected Circle’s business, he gestured to his co-founder and Circle’s president, Sean Neville. “Yeah, clearly, Sean’s wearing black.”  Everybody laughed.  Of course, one doesn’t weather a crash like 2014 – or 2008 or 2001, for that matter (Circle, founded in 2013, is not Allaire’s first rodeo) – without a bit of “bear market? what bear market” swagger. But there may be more than that to Allaire’s insistence that “the bubble deflates, but you actually have brought an enormous amount of capital and talent into the space, and innovation continues.”  Despite being a year of decline for the crypto sector as a whole, 2018 was a banner year for Circle.  In February the company acquired Poloniex, a troubled exchange whose reputation Circle is working hard to rehabilitate, for a reported $400 million. The following month it launched Circle Invest, a product that allows users to buy and sell 12 (at the time of writing) of the most well-known cryptocurrencies.  In May Bitmain, the China-based crypto mining hardware manufacturer, led a $110 million Series E investment in Circle, which valued the company at nearly $3 billion. At the same time, Circle announced that it would issue a dollar-linked stablecoin, USDC, to compete with the beleaguered incumbent, Tether.  Circle began issuing USDC in September, and Coinbase joined the Circle-led initiative behind the coin, Centre, the following month.  And finally, also in October, Circle signed a deal to acquire SeedInvest, a platform that lets companies raise equity from retail investors through crowdfunding, using an exemption from the 2012 Jobs Act.  Nothing about raising boatloads of money or jumping into multiple lines of business guarantees success, of course. ConsenSys, an ethereum-focused startup and incubator that recently announced layoffs and a strategy overhaul, is a cautionary tale in this sense.  But Circle has already been chastened by a long retrenchment, unlike the un-wintered ethereum ecosystem. In 2017, the year retail piled into crypto and seemingly every media outlet on the planet stoked the mania, Circle was mostly MIA – if a bit less so than most people realize. Meanwhile, Coinbase ate its lunch.  In 2018, however, Circle got back in the game. And if its timing meant a missed opportunity in the Year of FOMO (to be fair, Circle was still “meaningfully profitable” in 2017), that’s OK. Allaire has a longer timeline in mind: “it’s probably going to take 10 to 20 years to realize all these ideas,” he said, “but in the end, it literally can change the world.”  And by that, he means, “you could reconstruct the whole financial system on top of this.”  Sitting it out?  Almost exactly five years before I spoke to Neville and Allaire, Circle entered the world with a bang. The company’s $9 million Series A was the largest ever for a bitcoin company (this was before there was any “crypto” to speak of outside of bitcoin).  Allaire had just moved from CEO to chairman at his latest venture, the video platform Brightcove, and his goal with Circle was “making bitcoin extremely easy for consumers and merchants to adopt.”  That would prove easier said than done. The dream of merchant adoption faded, but Circle persevered. It completed a hard slog towards regulatory compliance, becoming the first company to win a BitLicense from New York state’s notoriously finicky Department of Financial Services.  It also won approval from British regulators, which allowed users of its flagship payments app, Circle Pay, to send money between the U.S. and Britain using bitcoin as a bridge. But as with merchant adoption, bitcoin’s promise of basically free, basically instant cross-border payments also proved illusory.  Meanwhile, Venmo was doing very well without any blockchain, thank you. And a focus on bitcoin – that first, clunky implementation of the “underlying technology” blockchain, in the emerging narrative – well, that was just quaint.  Allaire and Neville appear to have agreed. “You can find all kinds of stuff about us saying things that were critical of bitcoin,” Allaire told me recently, referring back to 2016. “That the developers weren’t moving, that innovation had stagnated, that a lot of the ideas that were important in this ecosystem weren’t happening.”  By mid-2016, Allaire was downplaying bitcoin’s role in Circle’s mission, saying the firm “was not positioned as a bitcoin thing, it was [about] making money work.”  “We tried to define the product around instant money,” he told CoinDesk at the time, “and underneath it was bitcoin.”  And then at the end of that year, bitcoin went from underneath to more underneath. In December 2016 Circle removed the ability for customers to buy and sell bitcoin, and to send it to other bitcoin addresses, using Circle Pay (customers who held bitcoin could still keep it in the app or convert it to fiat without charge).  That left the way open for Coinbase to take full advantage of a hype cycle that was – though few at the time could have guessed it – only six months away.  When I spoke to him in November, though, Allaire stood by the “heresy” that bitcoin had stalled out, arguing that “now everyone sort of acknowledges that it was all true.” Of course, he allowed, “there are still maximalists.”  Or biding time?  Yet that’s not the whole story. Circle did not abandon bitcoin. For one, cross-border payments on the Circle Pay app still used bitcoin, by way of a hazily defined new technology Circle spoke about at the time, called Spark.  More importantly, though, at least in retrospect, Circle maintained the trading operation it had built to power Circle Pay.  “What a lot of people don’t realize,” Allaire said, “is that starting in 2014, we started to become one of the largest buyers and sellers and traders of bitcoin in the world.” That business grew in 2014, 2015 and 2016, he added. And of course, in 2017, it grew “like crazy.”  “So while we turned off for a period of time the ability for the average retail individual person to be able to access and get bitcoin using Circle’s consumer product,” he said, “we were actually one of the biggest and still remain one of the biggest buyers, sellers, traders and market makers in the world, not just bitcoin but in all the major digital assets.”  Despite its radio silence, in other words, Circle did not really miss out on the crypto boom.  And in a way, the out-of-control growth the industry experienced in 2017 provided Circle with rare opportunities to rebuild its crypto offerings.  First, one of its trading desk’s biggest customers was looking for help. Poloniex, a Boston-based exchange created by altcoin miner Tristan D’Agosta, hit – as Allaire put it – “a lot of the constraints that happen when a business grows really, really fast.”  In 2017, as token projects were proliferating and customers were flocking to the exchange, the relatively small team at Poloniex was having trouble keeping up on multiple fronts: operations (maintaining crypto wallets, for example), regulation (the SEC’s dim view of many token projects was becoming increasingly clear), customer service (there was a backlog of 185,000 open customer service tickets) and compliance (such as conducting know-your-customer [KYC] checks).  It was all too much to handle, and the exchange began talking to Circle about being acquired. Which was convenient, because as Neville told CoinDesk, “we had imagined much more of a broader marketplace for all kinds of assets that can be tokenized,” though they “didn’t necessarily decide to build that right away, in 2016 or 2017.”  Following the Poloniex acquisition, Circle has such a marketplace. And while the company has work to do to rehabilitate the exchange’s image, Allaire says they’ve made progress: open customer support tickets are down to 2,000, KYC checks are in place, a number of tokens have been delisted, and regulators are reportedly less keen on pursuing Poloniex for potential violations of securities law.  Another opportunity presented itself in the form of the ICO boom, which served as a sort of proof-of-concept for a form of crowdfunding Allaire and Neville are now planning to offer: sales of securities – such as debt and equity – to retail (that is, non-wealthy) investors.  The issue, of course, is that unless they register with regulators and comply with burdensome disclosure rules, companies are not allowed to issue securities to retail investors – only to “accredited” (read, “rich”) ones. That’s the crux of many token issuers’ current predicament: they may have broken the law by conducting unregistered securities offerings.  There’s a relatively obscure exception to those rules, however, which was passed as part of the 2012 JOBS Act but not implemented until 2015. It allows companies to raise limited amounts of capital from ordinary investors, providing an avenue to conduct what amount to compliant ICOs.  “It’s slightly different from … crowdfunding, slightly different from something like token sales that we saw last year – it’s a maturation of both in a new direction,” said Neville. To provide a platform for these security token offerings, Circle has signed a deal to acquire SeedInvest, a platform built around the Jobs Act exemption that already – as an “alternative trading system” – has the necessary regulatory approvals.  “Businesses can issue these digital tokens that may, in fact, be securities, and that’s OK,” Allaire said. “It’s not like a scary thing. A security is just a way to ensure that investors have some protections.”  Finally, the grinding saga of Tether – a wobbly “stablecoin” with nearly $2 billion in outstanding issuance – proved two things: that crypto traders want fiat-linked blockchain tokens, and that their go-to left much to be desired.  USDC (what eventually came of the “Spark” initiative) is Circle’s answer to that demand, and the coin has also been adopted by Coinbase as its stablecoin of choice.  Tokenize the world  A year ago, Circle’s product suite was an odd, barbell-shaped contrivance. The company had, as Neville put it, “Circle Pay at the extreme consumer end of the spectrum – people using crypto and they don’t even know they’re using crypto.”  At the other end, the company had “this sort of high-touch, high-value trading system, OTC that enabled that thing to work.”  To fill the “big gap” in the middle, the company created a retail investment product not unlike Coinbase’s. But the rollout of USDC and the acquisitions of Poloniex and SeedInvest do more than fill out a lopsided product offering. They point to a lofty ambition to create “a radically more open, global and inclusive financial world,” as Allaire put it.  In a world of tokenized – well, everything – Allaire said, “an individual in one part of the world can not just send and receive value, but can enter into economic arrangements with other individuals over the internet without an intermediary.”  People could tokenize not just debts and equities and claim on cash flow, but contractual relationships – “all mediated by code on blockchains over the internet.”  “The level of economic integration that becomes possible on a global basis,” Allaire said, “is just staggering. And so for us, we’re just excited to create the platforms and markets and tools to let people take advantage of that.”  That “tokenization” has so far enabled little more than the creation of probably-immutable, probably-non-confiscatable cat-themed collectibles – is beside the point. “It’s sort of like in the early 90s saying, here’s all the websites that are out there, this is it, we’re done, the web’s done,” Allaire said.  Circle has capital, live products, experience and ambition – none of which guarantees success. But even if tokenizing the world falls flat, the company has proven the ability to survive a bad bet in the past, and go on to thrive.  Facilitating the adoption bitcoin – or whatevercoin – for day-to-day purchases will be some other firm’s coup if anyone ever manages it. Circle, for its part, has moved on.    ––––––––––––––––––––––––      Art by CryptoKitties (@CryptoKitties)        Photos by David Floyd for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,David Floyd,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/stable-times-at-circle-a-crypto-startup-counted-out-is-riding-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c1431d0aad6bac2bd17aa8836fe281ef0e5ecd8-1720x861.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430071,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0Th,1546275321,"McCaleb’s Comeback: Breakups, Breakdowns and Stellar’s Big Break-Out","You might know Jed McCaleb as the creator of Stellar, the world’s sixth most valuable cryptocurrency, and if you do, it can’t be exaggerated just how big of a miracle that is.  In the pantheon of early cryptocurrency evangelists, there might be no one whose name has been run through as much mud as McCaleb’s. Sure, Charlie Shrem went to jail, Roger Ver was branded a heretic and Gavin Andersen faded into obscurity. Even amidst such company, though, McCaleb has seemed to excel at being five feet from the dumpster fire.  But the point of this article isn’t to rehash the past, to talk about how he (technically) started Mt. Gox, the defunct crypto exchange that now only lives in court dockets, or to discuss Ripple and XRP, the often intertwined company and cryptocurrency he helped create, only to abandon in a story that, years later, is still one of the tech’s most tabloid-worthy.  No, because someday, when the history book is written, McCaleb might come to be best known for Stellar, a project that, while launched four years ago, arguably became the quiet comeback story of 2018. Read between the lines of some of the year’s biggest stories, and you’ll be apt to find Stellar, silently omnipresent.  IBM, the blue-chip behemoth whose executives once swore IBM would never “do coins”? They’re moving real money with cryptocurrency now, via a partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation, the non-profit that manages Stellar’s code.  Blockchain, the bitcoin wallet provider that’s chosen airdrops as its next best strategy? There’s a billboard at one of San Francisco’s busiest intersections boasting of how it’s giving away $125 million in crypto to users (unmentioned is that the asset in question is XLM, the cryptocurrency that powers Stellar).  The year’s biggest crypto acquisition? Stellar can lay claim to that, too; Stellar’s San Francisco offices are now home to Adam Ludwin and Devon Gundry, the founding team behind Chain, formerly one of the best-funded and most publicly visible startups seeking to connect financial incumbents to the blockchain.  Yes, at some point during 2018, Stellar, the cryptocurrency that was roundly derided at launch as a spiteful Ripple rip-off, came of age, emerging from a period in which McCaleb admits people “forgot Stellar existed” into a market he says is now hungry for mature blockchain projects.  But if the conversation around Stellar has changed, McCaleb remains the same as he ever was – an unpolished evangelist.  Clad in a T-shirt bearing Stellar’s signature blue, he looks down into his lunch as he offers his best estimation of the project’s success, telling CoinDesk:  “It was just sticking around, and not having major catastrophes.”  Not quite Vitalik  But if McCaleb is now one of the more successful entrepreneur-developers to launch his own cryptocurrency, he notably stands apart in how he approaches that role publicly.  Unlike say, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin or Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson, you won’t find him embroiled in flame wars on Twitter. (His account, filled with mostly retweets, has just 24,000 followers, compared to the hundreds of thousands garnered by his peers).  Neither does he have, as he admits, the “fanbase” of this new breed of cryptographers who travel the globe on a seemingly endless Merry-Go-Round of speeches and conferences.  Still, his aversion to that type of public visibility, no doubt, is due to brushes with the press in which he believes he was branded as a callous and carefree California surfer, one who the articles seemed to allege was oblivious to the harm and damage he caused.  It would become a pattern for years that McCaleb would accept interviews only if Mt. Gox and Ripple weren’t up for discussion, or else grapple with editors for later omissions to such mentions. Looking back, the word “sucks” is what he uses most often to describe the shadow of his early work and how long it’s managed to endure.  “It’s increasingly less relevant, so that’s good, but it’s annoying,” he says now.  As interpreted by some of his oldest friends and supporters in the industry, however, the characteristics that made him controversial can be interpreted differently; his frankness translated as authenticity, his combativeness reframed as resiliency.  “Jed is super brilliant and humble, he just seems to have a natural knack for being an early visionary with great ideas,” Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, who invested in Ripple after striking up a friendship with McCaleb, says. “But he’s also able to execute well.”  In person, it’s easy to see both versions of McCaleb as a kind of yin and yang in the eye of the beholder.  They’re on display as we talk about the XRP Army, the online community that has sprung up around his former project Ripple and that no doubt has 1) already now found this article through obsessive Google searching and 2) is busy dissecting whether it is covertly for or against the XRP cryptocurrency.  “I think the culture of a team and the community flows from the founders of it. It’s really true and the point was driven home more with this Interstellar acquisition,” McCaleb says, recalling the acquisition, which was finally revealed to the public in October.  “Adam [Ludwin] and I are very aligned on things, but there’s these personality differences. You can feel it through the team. The same phenomena is happening with XRP where it flows from the top,” he continues, before realizing he might have said too much.  “I don’t know,” he continues. “I’ll leave it there.”  'The Ultimate Mission'  In interview, it’s surprising how open McCaleb remains with his comments given his candor has often been used against him in articles that seek to interpret and define him or to hold him accountable for losses and wrongs.  It’s unfortunate because when speaking about himself, McCaleb truly shines.  Should our conversation have an overriding mantra, it’s the idea of mission, a concept that McCaleb evokes frequently when discussing both his life and vision for Stellar.  “It's weird to me that people don't think about that more, what they want to achieve in life, why they are they doing what they're doing. Especially, it's weird people make a ton of money and they just don't know what to do with themselves, they just buy a huge yacht,” he says.  Backstage at Consensus 2018, McCaleb went so far as to say he wasn’t ever a billionaire, acknowledging he didn’t quite manage his holdings to perfection over the years. His most extravagant purchase? “I bought a house in the Bay Area,” he quips now.  Yet, McCaleb maintains he isn’t motivated by money, but rather “this idea that having a universal internet-level protocol for payments helps everybody.”  But while hundreds of entrepreneurs might utter the same words, it’s McCaleb’s experience that now lends them power and vivacity. In person, he has a confident optimism that might pass for something in even more limited supply in the cryptocurrency these days, maturity.  Still, if McCaleb has grown up, he argues Stellar has, too. Originally aimed at building a network of microfinance institutions in underdeveloped countries when it was founded in 2014, McCaleb now says this idea “proved too early.”  If there’s a new emphasis for the Stellar project, then, it’s to connect existing financial firms to the blockchain, particularly mobile wallets, a mandate he described as core to the work of Interstellar, the company now powered by Chain’s former team, and that shares an office with the Stellar Development Foundation.  “What it boils down to is that it's trying to make the first killer app. The foundation can focus on building the platform. Interstellar is a viable business built on Stellar,” he says.  It’s also this alignment that he feels is the biggest differentiator in his approach to Stellar as a leader, a better sense of his own goals and how to align those with others.  “I am definitely more careful about who I worked with, and I made sure that people’s motivations were about achieving the mission,” McCaleb says, adding: “Sure, you end up making money if you achieve the mission, but you have to believe in the idea.”  Early like the Arpanet  Still, if you’re expecting that all of this leads to a breakout for Stellar in 2019, McCaleb isn’t convinced. In fact, he believes the calculus of the industry in estimating its own development is off, perhaps even by decades from where it is in conventional wisdom.  “People put the time frame wrong as dot-com, when actually it’s just way before, like Arpanet kind of stuff,” McCaleb says.  As an example, McCaleb estimates the size of the Stellar development ecosystem today as being only around 50 people who are working on the core code, and he sees the next step in its evolution as enlisting more people to build the wallets and exchanges needed for it to truly become what it was meant to be: a useful, open-source protocol for payments.  For his part, the Stellar Development Foundation now employs 12 people, while Interstellar now has a headcount of 25 staff members dedicated to that mission.  Still, the project is a long way off, he says, from being useful to one of Stellar’s more notable original backers, Stripe, the U.S. payments startup built to ease frictions in internet payments and that, according to McCaleb, is now working with Interstellar.  “They basically need the ecosystem to be a certain level of maturity, they need the anchor, the person issuing the fiat currency on the network. We need those entities to exist before they can use the network,” McCaleb says. “That’s the hope.”  In the meantime, McCaleb expects his focus to remain on payments, despite the fact it’s become less sexy in recent years, supplanted by ICOs, crypto-collectibles and all manner of new markets enthusiastic entrepreneurs think can be powered by distributed systems.  That’s not to say McCaleb doesn’t expect those projects to continue using Stellar.  His argument is that Stellar has become more broadly useful because it's agnostic, and that he wouldn’t be surprised to see securities tokens or tokens representing real estate on the network at some point in 2019, just as ICOs, including one of the most high-profile in mobile messenger Kik, migrated to the platform this year.  It’s a core part of why he expects a big focus of Stellar’s unreleased 2019 roadmap to be on a form of sidechains, or blockchains that are compatible with the core Stellar’s software, but that operate on their own, with purposes and missions unrelated to Stellar’s own.  “For lack of a better way to describe it, that will allow us to innovate there, and allow people to build stuff there,” he says.  Fill in the blanks  Here then, we finally get a sense of how McCaleb has been able to not just overcome the stigma around him, but his own unsteady evolution, from Berkeley physics dropout to embattled founder to quietly successful distributed network architect. He has a capacity to leave answers unfinished or unspecified, to say just enough for you to begin filling in the blanks.  Sometimes, such as when talking about project specifics, this leaves a lot to be desired.  On Blockchain’s airdrop (at press time, no one on either side seems to be able to confirm it will actually happen) McCaleb says: “They’re figuring out the kinks. It’s kind of ongoing.”  On IBM, he says: “They’re building a thing, WorldWire, that is a replacement for SWIFT, and it’s built on Stellar. We just talk to their engineers and help them through the process.”  Still, this open canvas can have the opposite impact. When McCaleb begins to extol the virtues of napping – he sleeps 15 minutes a day in Stellar’s dedicated nap room – it’s enough to make you want to change your habits. (McCaleb insists he is able to achieve real sleep, complete with full dreams.)  But while he won’t say exactly what he dreams about, it might not be life beyond Stellar.  When asked about the responsibility he now feels at the helm of a $2 billion network, he’s quick to clarify that he believes working on the network is where he belongs.  McCaleb says:  “I’ll need to be a part of Stellar until I know that if I walk away, it’s not going be detrimental. I don’t want to let people down and want to make it successful.”  In that same way, one of the more remarkable things about Stellar’s offices is the attention to detail and the level of comforts for employees. Sure, the front door may look like a front for a storage locker, but inside, one is just as apt to find free catered lunch as cards on the wall filled with facts and histories of employees.  Later on, I find Gundry, scouring an ample snack rack that stretches across two full rooms, and includes all manner of self-serve nuts and soft drinks, eating a grass-fed beef stick. He reclines in a chair and grills me a bit on the profile.  “Did you get the story? Did you get, the how do you say it, scoop?” he quips.  Is he busting my balls? Defending his boss? Either way, that might just be the story itself.  The road ahead may be long or even fruitless for McCaleb, but in front of the snack rack, one thing is clear: McCaleb has the supplies – and now, the people – to last the winter.    ––––––––––––––––––––––––    Art by Diego Rodriguez (Plasma Bears by @NeonDistrictRPG)  Original photos by Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | XRP,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/mccalebs-comeback-breakups-breakdowns-and-stellars-big-break-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a714041f00c363607011e1c1a474c00be138aea-1720x861.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430075,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0bh,1546275316,A Psychic Visit with Nouriel Roubini: The Mother and Father of All Crypto Skeptics,"Admit it – you already hate that this article exists.  That itself is no small testament to the man it's about, Dr. Nouriel Roubini, the outspoken economist and professor whose tweets, interviews and public testimonies this year have seemed to treat the entire cryptocurrency movement with all the tenderness of an insubordinate prison inmate.  In the process, Roubini has arguably become the embodiment of an incumbent intellectual class that sees cryptocurrency as responsible for not just a massive price bubble but a flurry of frauds and scams that have bilked consumers out of billions with the promise that their token of choice could eradicate everything from poverty to disease.  ""The mother and father of all bubbles gone bust?"" That's still how Roubini describes what others have called the next internet, and if there's any hope he'll soften his stance when the cameras aren't rolling, Roubini quickly snuffs it out.  ""The words are not a provocation,"" he reaffirms.  In person as in video, he draws almost no distinction between the technology and the admittedly opaque industry that has sprung up around it, even going so far as to dismiss bitcoin's answer to the double-spend problem, its core technical innovation, as having earned it a spot in a ""future museum on clever economics of the past"" – and little else.  Over two days of interviews, this is the closest he’ll get to a compliment.  Still, if there’s a moral to our sprawling conversations, it’s this: while innovators in the crypto community are quick to demand that others see their vision (and overlook their faults), Roubini is living proof they aren’t always so empathetic as to extend this courtesy to others.  Indeed, what's surprising in Roubini’s case is how unilaterally he’s inspired hostility. He is, after all, no recent apparition in the world of economics, where he’s hovered between rock star and also-ran status in the decade since his 2006 prediction of a global financial crisis. Further, he shares many of the same critiques of the financial system as cryptocurrency enthusiasts.  Have you ever stopped to read any of Roubini's articles? Have you actually read his 37-page testimony before the U.S. Senate? (He has a suspicion you haven't.)  But if Roubini is to blame for his gleeful hyperbole, admittedly casual grasp of technology and a command of English that betrays his long journey to the U.S., then crypto enthusiasts are guilty of not making an effort to read past his soundbites and understand his arguments.  From his office at New York University, Roubini is keen to first direct the dialogue to the scars he’s accrued in the resulting war of words. Denial-of-service attacks, death threats, spam emails – if Roubini sees the worst in cryptocurrencies, he’s seen also the worst in their supporters.  With a leg on a desk, he breaks apart a Kind bar as he discusses his response.  ""When people try to bite you… Not just barking but biting dogs... An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth…” he says, later pursing his lips to punctuate the lingering sentence.  Behind a desk, there he is, finally, the weary professor wondering what the hell happened in class while he was in the hall.  First, a few grievances  Sorting the good from the bad in Roubini’s arguments, however, is a tall order.  If Roubini is at best a passionate defender of economics and the canon of learning it comprises, he often does himself a disservice in conversation.  A fair amount of that appears to stem from two factors. One, Roubini’s convictions are actually fairly simple, and two, he often buries his point under responses to tangential topics.  Asked about the specifics of his own research, Roubini is quick to give an answer, citing a study he's read on the high rate of ICO failures – ""in any legitimate industry, you don’t get 81 percent of scams in the first place,"" he says – that is, before he starts decrying crypto’s association with alt-right ideologies and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.  Asked if bitcoin can be viewed separately from other cryptocurrencies, with less mature code or markets, he gives a strong response – ""bitcoin is based on blockchain and cryptography and authentication based on proof of work"" – before turning the subject to how it's ""AI, machine learning and a combination of big data and internet of things"" that will revolutionize finance.  ""Ninety-nine percent of anything crypto and blockchain is vapourware,"" he continues.  In Roubini's mind, there's a clear connection between all these points. However, it's hard not to feel like Roubini is sometimes avoiding your question or simply using it as a vehicle for whatever point or grievance he was going to air in the first place.  For example, it's the accusation that he's in the pocket of banks that seems to get the most airtime and ire, despite the fact this isn't brought up in any questioning.  ""That’s nonsense. I’ve written about the financial crisis and the distortions that lead to the financial crisis,"" he says, adding of his detractors: ""They don’t know anything about money so they want to reinvent everything, decentralize everything.""  My attempts to halt the flow from topic to topic seem to do little to break Roubini’s momentum, and next, we’re on to how he’s been unfairly categorized as anti-innovation.  ""People tell you are a dinosaur, they throw you this nonsense. If you believe in innovation, you have to believe in blockchain or crypto. It’s become a fad,"" he says. ""There are thousands of fintech companies, they’re not going to give you a shitcoin.""  If you're about to tune out now, re-read the sentences above. In short, Roubini believes crypto isn't working because it isn't delivering results, that crypto entrepreneurs demonstrate a poor grasp of economics and that they underestimate the impact of other technologies.  So far, nothing all that objectionable. Later on, he offers a more subdued take, one that is unusual as it could be characterized as a sober and salient distillation of his views.  ""I try to give you the skepticism of an economist. I may not understand anything deep about technology,"" he says. ""My view is that models of digital and mobile payment systems are working, and they all have to do with fintech.""  A detour to Death Valley  Still, if Roubini can be lauded for strong convictions, deeply buried, it’s hard to tell how exactly he’s arrived at some of his conclusions. Is he someone who studies deeply or goes with his gut?  It's a question that has been asked about Roubini before, most notably in his New York Times profile entitled simply ""Dr. Doom."" ""When the economist Anirvan Banerji delivered his response to Roubini's talk, he noted that Roubini's predictions did not make use of mathematical models and dismissed his hunches as those of a career naysayer,"" an excerpt reads.  Indeed, in our conversation, Roubini seems to see-saw between implying his opinion is driven by research, and at other times, indicating it's simply the result of spotting human nature.  In fact, the latter appears to be a common denominator in the predictions that have defined his career to date – his sentiment on the U.S. housing bubble and the crypto crash were both inspired, he says, by moments in which he was able to recognize realities beyond numbers.  ""I was in Basel for Art Basel [in December 2017]. Thousands of people go there because it‘s big parties and they don't know anything about art, and everybody was telling me, 'Should I buy bitcoin?'"" he recalls. ""Price action every day has nothing to do with fundamentals. Even strangers come up to you and say, 'Ah Roubini, should I buy bitcoin?'""  ""It was the same light bulb that I drove to Vegas and Death Valley, and I saw thousands of empty homes, people brainless. FOMO is the driver of every bubble,"" he continues.  Alone, the blurry lines between Roubini the researcher and Roubini the soothsayer might not be much for conversation – he at one point even makes a joke about economists and weathermen – but they’re more problematic when he applies the same logic to his opinions on technology.  On some subjects, Roubini even ends up sounding like cryptocurrency supporters, using similar language and assurances to back his statements.  Take for instance his insistence that technology should be easy to intuit. ""I’m not a technology guy, but even I understand the logic of what technology is about... what’s enough for a layperson who wants to understand it,"" he says.  The statement seems to conflate two realities that are certainly true of all technologies – they can be extremely simple to use, yet also contain almost untold intricacies that end up being entirely shielded from the user. Still, it's an emphasis he makes repeatedly.  ""I’ve read dozens of papers... about Casper and sharding ... technology is complicated, but an intelligent person should be able to read one thing… it could be astrophysics, popular science ... so that a reader of the Wall Street Journal could make sense of it,"" he says.  Here, he draws most often on experiences with the internet, in which he describes himself as an early adopter of the technology. According to Roubini, he even coded in basic HTML, using Microsoft Frontpage, in the early 1990s, work that resulted in a simple blog that aggregated links on past financial collapses and that helped him build an early consulting business.  (Unfortunately, the blog, originally hosted by NYU, no longer exists. Roubini says the content was transferred to a website for the Roubini Global Economics, a later consulting venture, and that the blog posts and any records of it have since disappeared.)  ""I wanted to know why things were going bust,"" he recalls. ""It was every blog, papers on Indonesia, Malaysia, it was a big set of pages and a directory. I had hundreds of thousands of people using this piece of junk and each page was a country and subtopic.""  But if Roubini benefitted from a platform of information delivery that lowered costs such that his writings could be accessible the world over (or at least to those who owned expensive, boxy computers and dial-up internet connections), he doesn't draw similarities to cryptocurrency.  “It was sub-pages and I could do hyperlinks. But it was all done by myself. Everyone was using the internet because it was amazingly useful. I went through the internet and I know when there’s a technology, you know certain things that change completely,” he says.  Now, remove the nouns here and put in your favorite crypto words.  Finally, the points  Soon after, Roubini and I hail a cab and take our argument out on the streets of New York. The sky is still a gun-metal gray, but it’s brightening, and so, too, are my prospects for more participatory conversation.  Me: ""Can we agree it’s new?""  Roubini: ""Yes, but I don't think that it's a new idea that can work.""  Me: ""What about new markets that are digital where frictions on exchange are high?""  Roubini: ""Why do people use the cloud of Amazon or Microsoft? Because there is a bundle of services and these things have some price. So, competing with them will be impossible.""  Me: ""But don’t we want to democratize finance? To allow more people into more opportunities.”  Roubini: ""People say in this space… the paternalistic government doesn’t let me invest. There is a good reason it cannot be sold to non-accredited investors.""  And on and on, until finally, I think I start to see the points.  Stripped of all the hyperbole and internet chest-banging, Roubini can be seen as having three core critiques when it comes to cryptocurrencies.  Whereas cryptocurrency supporters see the financial crisis as an issue that can be eradicated by clever code and by removing power from incumbent players, Roubini views central banks and incumbents as necessary inventions that have benefited market stability.  Second, he doesn't believe tokenized services can be used in areas where they would compete against real-world goods and services, which could simply adjust their prices. (""Dentacoin is a failure. Say, you have most dentists, even 10 to 30 percent, using dentacoin... they coordinate and increase the price of the services you need the token for ... they're creating a cartel."")  Third, and perhaps most importantly, he believes that tokenizing every good or service to make it tradable on a blockchain would reintroduce problems economists believe they have already solved centuries ago through the creation of money.  ""I asked myself whether bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and assets could satisfy the definition of money or a currency,"" he says in a rare reserved moment. ""There are standard definitions. A key one is a unit of account. Otherwise you end up into barter.""  Me: ""Don’t you think computers could programmatically barter cryptocurrencies?""  Roubini sighs and looks at me like I'm someone who's going to fail Economics 101.  We’ll always have Dallas  The back and forth is occasionally exhausting, with neither of us quite hitting a middle ground. Though, credit where credit is due, Roubini doesn't seem to lose his energy.  Just when it seems all hope is lost, though, a small miracle appears on the street in the form of a fortune teller named Dallas. Sitting near a besparkled sign, she's offering readings for $10.  Say what you will about Roubini, he's not without a sense of humor, or even a playful willingness to hear out others. Soon, he's bought into my idea that we should ask her questions about the future of money and have her settle our arguments.  Roubini (to Dallas): ""The question is, he believes that there is a great future for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, I believe there is no future for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, so we need someone like you who can read in the future, and tell us.""  She looks up at us, startled, but she's buying it.    Dallas: ""That’s that thing that you invest in, like you buy it for a certain price … it goes up.""      Roubini: ""He thinks it’s the future of money and it’s going to change everything.""    Dallas: ""I don’t think it is.""    Pete: ""Is this your psychic opinion?""    Dallas: ""It’s my psychic opinion.""    Pete: ""So ... it’s not going to be useful for anything.""    Dallas: ""Well, I had people that got involved in it and it didn’t go so good... It’s really difficult... really confusing.""    We thank her, and to my surprise, Roubini reaches into his wallet and actually pays her $10.  Good for a few laughs, but not worthwhile, I think as we walk back to the office. Still, Roubini seems to linger on the conversation, and he seems impressed enough for me to believe he thinks the conversation was worth the money.  As we walk away, he's smiling, considering.  He adds:  ""You know, a lot of psychics... they're just good psychologists.""  Now, think about what that says about us.    ––––––––––––––––––––––––    Art by HyperDragons / MixMarvel (@mixhyperdragons)  Photos by Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/a-psychic-visit-with-nouriel-roubini-the-mother-and-father-of-all-crypto-skeptics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/529b6a9acbe4fa4cc6b279f4c94678b5f175acdd-1720x861.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430077,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0fh,1546275308,"The FUD Stompers: Like It or Not, XRP Army Is Winning Crypto's Hashtag War","When it comes to crypto, everyone loves to talk about “community.”  Every cryptocurrency has one, we’re led to believe, but often as not the community is just a Telegram channel peppered with demands of “@admin wen airdrop.”  There is one cryptocurrency, however, for which the word is anything but a cliche. I’m talking of course about XRP, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which is closely – if contentiously – associated with the San Francisco-based startup Ripple.  “It has become a second family to me,” TplusZero, one of XRP Twitter’s most active and followed members, told CoinDesk.  Search Twitter for XRP-related content, and you’ll find yourself among thousands of accounts dedicated mostly or entirely to XRP and the ecosystem around it – which, in addition to Ripple, includes startups such as Coil, which aims to help content creators monetize their webpages.  A few big names will quickly become familiar – XRP Trump, Hodor, Tiffany Hayden, Bank XRP. Seemingly nothing happens in the world of XRP without these accounts knowing about it, and if they happen to miss an update, there are dozens of other accounts standing ready to flag it.  There’s a whole constellation of forums, blogs and YouTube channels that feed an XRP-hungry audience, but Twitter is arguably the hub for the XRP community (especially its English-speaking contingent), and several people I spoke to created Twitter accounts for the first time just to participate in the XRP conversation.  XRP Twitter is perpetually abuzz up with discussion about the merits of XRP and the challenges – none of them insuperable, of course – that it faces on the road to mass adoption in cross-border payments (its main use case) and beyond.  Many of these discussions are deeply wonkish, assuming a detailed knowledge of the Ripple product suite, the incumbent cross-border payments infrastructure and the XRP Ledger’s consensus protocols. But this is crypto after all, and much of the banter is rah-rah.  For many in the community, XRP’s eventual “mooning” (crypto jargon for astronomical price gains) is a bygone conclusion – the only question is when. Ripple Me This, a bull among XRP bulls, told CoinDesk: “I describe this as the opportunity of several lifetimes,” adding, “those who recognize the opportunity and position themselves accordingly will be the next 1 percent.” The account has since been suspended.  Many XRPers believe the coin’s rightful place is not just at the top of the cryptocurrency hierarchy, but at the center of the “Internet of Value,” a technological revolution that promises to allow money to move as easily as email:  The community’s favorite hashtags – #0doubt, #xrpthestandard – serve as a kind of shorthand for this narrative of universal hyper-XRP-ization.  Of course, every crypto “community” worthy of the name has carved out a niche in social media where their geekiness and optimism can thrive. So what makes XRP special – or influential?  To paraphrase another pick for this year’s Most Influential series, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance: strength.  In a recent tweet, CZ complimented the community – at least, they took it as a compliment – saying, “the xrp base shill is strong.” In this case, he was referring specifically to the push to make XRP tradeable against every other asset on the exchange.  “Get it out of your system,” CZ urged, “and put all your shills under this one tweet, and let’s see how much we get.” It would be tough to exaggerate the intensity of the shilling – CZ’s word – contained in the 3,400 replies that followed.  Below is a sample that captures the tone of the replies (and showcases the strength of the often-ignored – in the West at least – Japanese XRP contingent):  The community needs no invitation to make the case for XRP, of course, and they will frequently home in on exchanges, brokerages, media outlets and others, urging them to list, cover, respect, promote or simply recognize XRP.  The most recent push? A write-in campaign for a Bank of England Twitter survey.  The XRP Army  Given their ability to mobilize in support of their favorite asset, it should come as no surprise that the XRP community can also mobilize in its defense. And when that happens – when the community feels XRP is being threatened – their geeky charm melts away.  Meet the XRP Army: the community on the FUD-fighting warpath (the image below is from a thread I’ll detail further down).  Short for “fear, uncertainty and doubt,” FUD refers in theory to baseless criticism that’s meant to deter research on or investment in its target. In practice, though, there appears to be near-zero room to question XRP without being cast as a FUDster: all criticism is baseless criticism. Even statements made by Ripple to the media will be attacked as fabrications if they don’t conform to the narrative.  What’s the difference between XRP enthusiasts’ trolling and any other variety of trolling? After all, publicly expressing an opinion on any cryptocurrency will invite similar negativity from that token’s tribal chauvinists.  Again: strength.  The XRP Army distinguishes itself mainly through scale and organization. Question another coin’s merits, and a handful of trolls might come out of the woodwork. But measured by volume, intensity, duration and consistency, the attack will pale in comparison to an XRP Army operation.  First, a foot soldier will spot the offending tweet, article, podcast or video and rally the troops by posting a few hashtags – #XRP, #XRPArmy and the like – and tagging the high command: some combination of XRP Trump, Hayden, Hodor, BankXRP and their peers.  Then, as an XRP enthusiast going by BoiDontFollowMe described it (disapprovingly) to CoinDesk, a flood of accounts will “brigade” the alleged FUD-monger, posting dozens or hundreds of comments.  As a few of these replies attract dozens of likes and retweets and spawn their own threads in turn, the attack forms a torrent of thousands and thousands of angry notifications that lasts for days.  Dispatches from the front  Any number of case studies are available to see the community in action, including the XRP Army operation this article spawned – almost immediately after the reporting for the article began, and before a word of it had been written.  As with pretty much any article, the first thing I did for this piece was to identify a few potential sources. That done, I reached out to them where I thought they might respond: in this case, Twitter direct messages. I wanted to knock out a number of interviews, so I prepared a list of questions. It didn’t go well.  One of the first people I reached out to sounded the alarm, and soon enough XRP Trump had jumped in to denounce my approach: “I’m not participating in that. I don’t like the behind closed door sending messages to some people while ignoring others. So I’m not answering.” (Asked who I was ignoring, he responded, “How would I know?” I didn’t ask him to elaborate on what an interview that isn’t “closed door” looks like.)  Hayden also declined to be interviewed. But in reality, she and XRP Trump did engage, just on their own terms, in public, posing – and answering – their own questions. (The XRP Army is practiced at controlling the narrative.)  Hayden and XRP Trump proceeded to publicly lambast the yet-to-be-written article in a string of posts. And they weren’t alone. The bombardment continued for days, following familiar lines of attack. In no particular order, these were: allegations of incompetence based on previous work …  … of bias …  … of stupidity …  … and of desperation …  Add a bit of professional belittlement …  … insinuations of sinister intent …  … and an implied threat of legal action …  XRP Trump, it should be said, argued against suing CoinDesk and attributed that particular suggestion to a “false flag” attack by a “bitcoiner.” Whether or not that’s the case, Hayden took up the thread to speculate that Ripple may be unable to sue CoinDesk because Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company) is a Ripple investor …  How exactly that meshes with DCG’s status as a bitcoin-shilling cabal with an iron grip on crypto “media” is unclear …  … unless, that is, DCG only invested in Ripple to prevent Ripple from fighting DCG’s pro-bitcoin bias – or you know what, never mind …  Top all that off with questions of psychological fitness …  … and some top-shelf, high-proof, barrel-aged vitriol …  … and you’ve got a sense of the XRP Army on the warpath. In this case, the “brigading” lasted well over a week. Here’s what my notifications looked like one morning after not having checked them overnight. “One morning” being the morning of day nine …  The thread was still going after nearly three weeks, but following the iron laws of internet entropy, it had devolved into jokes about small penises at that point.  The A-word  It’s worth mentioning what angered the XRP community in the first place.  The catalyst was that I asked – among other questions, such as “What's your experience with the XRP community been like?” – whether “some of the more aggressive behaviors some XRP fans engage in are justified.”  Full disclosure: the first person I reached out to – who was also the first to sound the alarm, was sent a different version of the question, which gave examples of “aggressive behaviors”: “Name-calling, piling into people's mentions, threats (I know that threats are rare)?”  After he refused to answer, I removed that section when reaching out to others. As Hodor’s tweet shows, though, it didn’t make much difference.  It should also be noted – fuller disclosure – that the XRP Community has not forgotten about this story about their Community Night party in May, so they are not inclined to give me the benefit of the doubt.  What’s most bizarre is that, side by side with this barrage of, well, aggression, were questions about why I’d provided no evidence of aggression:  Some participants in the thread, though, were apparently aware that its general tenor was less than friendly …  … and in a private message another XRP supporter, Crypto Dave, did not mince words.  Asked if he thought aggression was justified, he answered in all caps, “YES.” He cited a “media blackout” of XRP and Ripple by the likes of CNBC and Bloomberg, which aim “to suppress the price.”  He also said that the same media outlets, which refuse to mention XRP and Ripple, “call XRP ‘Ripple’ all the time, which it isn’t.”  Another community member offered some kind words: “I feel bad about the massive backlash that has come your way... I am sure you are just trying to do your job.” (“Don’t quote me,” they added.)  And as noted above, another community member, BoiDontFollowMe, said, “if you’re talking about the accounts that brigade and are rude for the sake of being rude, then no, I don’t think that’s justified.”  More than one person I spoke to, however, expressed the view that casting XRP community members as aggressive – even some of them, some of the time – simply has no basis in fact.  “Aggressive XRP members,” XRP Yoda told me, channeling his namesake’s syntactic quirks, “I have not seen any.”  The view from the inside  It’s tempting to see blanket denials of aggression on the part of the XRP Army as, to use the voguish term, gaslighting.  But that might be unfair. From an outsider’s perspective, the XRP Army is a horde that appears on the horizon, wreaks havoc and then departs.  From the insiders’ perspective, though, the same group is a community that – left to its own devices – would peacefully nerd out on the minutiae of the XRP Ledger’s consensus protocol, Ripple’s business development efforts and product suite, Coil’s content monetization product and the like.  TplusZero described individuals in the community as “incredibly intelligent, curious and visionary,” adding “consistently welcoming, humble, idealistic and autodidactic” for good measure. Several other community members offered similarly glowing descriptions.  “I have found the community to be well researched, level headed and open to a good discussion,” a user going by EDadoun said, adding, “I also really appreciate how engaged elements of the community are in terms of advocating for high level use of the technology.”  Beyond being interesting conversationalists, XRP supporters can be incredibly supportive, kind and generous. One Twitter user described going through “some really hard money issues” which made it difficult to get his daughter to spinal surgery in a different state.  The XRP community “helped get her there not even knowing me or her,” he said, and she’s now home recovering.  Another community member recalled a time when an XRP-er went to the hospital “for a serious condition.” Since hospital food “isn’t so good,” another person from the community, RobertLe88, sent food to the hospital, which the patient then shared with his nurses.  The community’s favorite app (barring Twitter), the XRP Tip Bot, has enabled acts of charity both large and small.  The Tip Bot functions as a sort of fourth engagement function on XRP Twitter. Have something to say? Reply. Like something? Heart it. Really like something? Retweet it.  But if you feel overwhelming love or gratitude, you send the person who posted it a small tip in XRP using the Tip Bot, which automatically integrates with Twitter. XRP Trump is particularly lavish with the XRP-denominated love.  Wietse Wind, the independent developer who created the Tip Bot, told CoinDesk that he “really didn’t expect it to take off like this,” since he’d just approached it as “a hobby project.”  One user, going by KingBlue, saw potential for the tool do more than brighten a few XRP tweeters’ days. “My mind immediately turned to charity,” he told CoinDesk in a recent interview, specifically to St. Jude, a non-profit children’s cancer research hospital.  KingBlue began organizing the fundraiser in June. The initial goal was to raise 5,000 XRP but, he said, “we blew through that,” bringing in over 24,000 XRP at the time of writing (worth over $8,300), as well as nearly $3,400 in fiat.  What happened?  So, what accounts for the disconnect between these two sides of the XRP community – the one that buys winter coats for kids and the one that generates deluges of angry spam?  Of course, not all individuals engage in both types of behaviors. But here’s the answer I heard again and again from community members: they are under constant siege. Journalists, entrepreneurs, developers, investors, influencers, lawyers and garden-variety trolls constantly needle the community, leading to the kinds of response we’ve seen above.  The critics have a few favorite talking points: XRP is an unregistered security issued by Ripple; it’s a “banker coin,” a cynical effort by the financial powers that be to co-opt a budding revolution; it’s a worthless “shitcoin”; it’s being dumped on naive retail investors in a “never-ending ICO” (to quote one lawsuit’s complaint); Ripple has full control over the ledger, including the ability to freeze it; Ripple can release the XRP it’s locked in escrow on a whim; the list goes on.  Some of these claims are purely a matter of opinion (“shitcoin”). Others probably have a definitive answer, but either it can’t be known yet (the security question is working its way through the courts) or we hit a wall: he-said-she-said, can’t-prove-a-negative. Some lines of attack do in fact appear to be genuine FUD (XRP’s technical documentation, all forms of emphasis in the original, says: “XRP CANNOT be frozen by any entity or individual”).  “XRP fans have been targeted for many years,” Kieran Kelly, an active member of XRP Twitter, told me. “I think the XRP community just got to a stage where they got fed up with the constant insults.”  Another member of the community urged me to consider the “hundreds of hours” people like Hayden, Hodor and XRP Trump have put into fighting bad information. BoiDontFollowMe said that seeing the “same misinformed talking points parroted across different channels by people who have no interest in educating themselves” causes understandable frustration.  Hayden, in particular, has had to put up with more than others. Anti-XRP trolls often go personal, and when she’s the target, the attacks sometimes veer into sexism – even in-person intimidation.  At the XRP Community Night party in May, she said, “somebody seemed to be there entirely to harass me. That’s *really* scary. Nobody helps, but they hold up scorecards to judge how I handled being attacked.”  No, you’re a bot  As with any group that feels it’s under siege, what most rattles the XRP Community is the idea that they’ve been infiltrated, that the saboteurs walk among them.  For XRP Trump, it was that random account that pitched the idea of suing “FUDDesk,” which I naively – in his estimation – believed was an authentic XRP supporter. “False flags are real,” he wrote. “Just stay long enough to become a target and you’ll know.”  For Kelly, it’s the so-called 589-ers, whom he cast – though he acknowledged he can’t prove it – as bitcoin maximalist infiltrators intent on discrediting the XRP community as a whole.  Here’s why 589-ers might cause XRP enthusiasts some reputational harm: they predict – “preach” might be a better word – that the price of XRP will be $589.00 or higher at the end of 2018. They continue to say so as of Dec. 20, with XRP trading at around $0.37.  Those who question their prophecy are “sheep.”  Kelly argues that the ones spreading 589-ism, beginning with the now-dormant Reddit account bearableguy123, are “sockpuppets” – fake social media accounts, sometimes automated, sometimes operated manually – which their owners use for “astroturfing”: social media manipulation that creates the illusion of broad support for a message and aims, in turn, to catalyze real support.  The idea that astroturfing is rife on XRP Twitter, however, is most associated with Geoff Golberg, an independent researcher who’s been studying the XRP community’s online presence for months.  “It’s coordinated amplification,” Golberg said in a recent interview. “This isn’t organic.”  He cited suspicious patterns of following, liking and retweeting that point to some degree of manipulation. In certain cases, the accounts appear to be automated (“bots”), that is, controlled using a script.  In other cases, he said, the accounts appear to be controlled manually, but even so, “there isn’t an actual, XRP-supporting person behind each pseudonymous XRP Army account. That’s the whole point.”  In short, he said, “these aren’t real accounts.”  While Golberg hasn’t shared evidence that explicitly links the alleged astroturfing efforts to any particular culprit, he made it clear that he doesn’t think it’s limited to or even primarily the work of 589-ers. Far from a bitcoin maximalist attempt at sabotage, he said, it appears to be a coordinated effort to promote XRP as an investment.  It’s not difficult to find anecdotal evidence of astroturfing in XRP. To illustrate the point, Golberg performed a network analysis of XRP Trump’s followers using the data visualization software Graphistry. In the graph below, each of the account’s followers is represented by a dot:  The dots’ positions are determined by how connected each one is to XRP Trump’s other followers. The analysis relies on an algorithm called Eigenvector centrality (or Eigencentrality), which determines the influence of a node in a network. The algorithm is used, for example, by Google to rank search results.  The large, light blue circle on the upper right-hand side of the graph is XRP Trump. The colorful clouds emanating from that central node represent different “communities” of followers, who are more closely related to each other, relative to the dataset as a whole.  There’s one section, though, that doesn’t look very much like a “community.” The green, red and pink sections are nebulous, with messy, complex interrelations among nodes. By contrast, the light blue blobs in the upper right-hand corner look less, let’s say, organic. Particularly when viewed close-up:  As it turns out, the 8,200 accounts that make up these blobs all have the exact same mathematical relationship to XRP Trump’s following as a whole: an Eigencentrality score of precisely 0.013143. That score also happens to be the lowest in the whole dataset.  “They are all equally disconnected,” Golberg said.  For over 8,000 of XRP Trump’s roughly 21,000 followers (when the data was collected in September) to have an identical relationship to the broader network – down to the sixth decimal place – would be staggeringly unlikely in an organic, human network, where thousands of complex, individual volitions yield thousands of different degrees of influence. Golberg told CoinDesk that it’s “a huge red flag.”  To get a sense of how strange this distribution of Eigencentrality scores is, here’s a chart of the 10 lowest scores, along with the number of accounts corresponding to each (around 1,200 accounts with identical centrality appear outside of the two big blobs, bringing the total to around 9,400):  Clicking through a few of the blobs’ accounts doesn’t inspire confidence that they are just improbably like-minded people.  Take “xrp to riches” (@to_xrp), who follows XRP Trump, Hodor, Ripple, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Ripple CTO David Schwartz (along with a couple of other XRP influencers). “xrp to riches” doesn’t say much:  Or “patrick morrison” (@XRPaddy), another real human person who follows all of the accounts mentioned above (and a slightly different set of “other XRP influencers”). “patrick” is every bit as chatty as “xrp to riches”:  Then there’s “x5r5p”, who – again – follows all the big Ripple and XRP names mentioned above, plus a smattering of second-tier accounts, and – again – struggles with shyness:  Golberg – who has examined other crypto communities as well as political campaigns – readily acknowledged that astroturfing is widespread in crypto, but said of the XRP community, “I’ve never seen it to this extent.”  To try and corroborate his findings, CoinDesk used SparkToro’s “fake followers audit” tool, which shows that XRP Trump, Schwartz, Hodor and Garlinghouse all have above-average proportions of fake followers, relative to the sizes of their followings:  Those data points in isolation leave important questions unanswered, though. They don’t indicate who is responsible for the fake followers. I have around 150 fake followers (11 percent of the total), according to SparkToro, but I certainly didn’t purchase them or spin them up myself.  And as Kelly argued, astroturfing can indeed be used as a false flag attack. For example, in a recent U.S. Senate election, supporters of the Democratic candidate attempted to discredit his opponent by using thousands of Russian sockpuppet accounts to follow the Republican (who lost). This attack created the impression that the Republican candidate was colluding with a foreign power, recalling alleged collusion between the Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.  Filippo Menczer, professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University and a contributor to the self-explanatory Botometer project, told CoinDesk that finding the answer to the astroturfing question depends on exactly what you want to know.  If you’re asking “whether the online conversation about the topic of interest (XRP/Ripple) is manipulated via bots,” he said, “you would want a sample of *tweets* (as opposed to accounts) on the topic,” he said. Fake follower counts, in other words, don’t directly answer that question.  There are certainly a number of pseudonymous, XRP-themed accounts that post and retweet at high rates. Take “grega” (@ceramika74), which has found the time – in its 241 days of existence – to retweet 38,838 XRP-related tweets (161 per day) and like 84,717 (352 per day). It has never composed an original tweet.  Few XRP accounts are as prolific as “grega,” but it is an extreme example of a pattern: nameless, faceless, often short-lived XRP monomaniacs who do not gripe about politics or make fun of celebrities or do anything at all but signal-boost bullish messages about XRP. In many cases the signal-boosting is clearly manual; not every sockpuppet is necessarily a bot.  (To be clear, many accounts – including high-volume, XRP-focused, pseudonymous ones like Hodor, KingBlue and XRP Trump – clearly represent a real person’s primary social media presence.)  Mike Kearney, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, told CoinDesk that a search for $XRP did turn up “evidence of automated/coordinated activity,” including “an usually active base of users posting exclusively from the web browser.” It’s “more common to see automated/bot/inauthentic accounts post via non-cell-phone sources,” he explained.  In addition, “these exclusively web-client-posting accounts also just so happen to have created their accounts within the last few months at an unusually high rate,” Kearney said.  Capitulation  Whatever the extent, nature, intent or provenance of XRP Twitter’s alleged astroturfing, many in the XRP community are enraged by Golberg’s allegations.  He said they frequently report him to Twitter and LinkedIn (the latter suspended his profile as a result), as well as threatening to hack him. This is above and beyond the normal trolling XRP Army targets can expect (based on my own experience and that of others I spoke to).  Golberg does not always eschew trolling himself, it should be said. He called Schwartz “full of [poop emoji][poop emoji] and a coward.” Middle fingers, kissy faces and taunts worthy of the XRP Army are go-tos, in DMs as well as public tweets. Hayden and XRP Trump have called him a “psychopath.” He said such claims are “character assassination” meant to discredit his findings.  In one case, however, an XRP investor (who confirmed as much to CoinDesk) took things a step further and publicly called for Golberg to be killed.  The intended target needn’t have worried too much. Nassar deleted his account and apologized to Golberg from a different one in a private message.  Still, incidents such as this one have made Golberg less civil in his engagements with the XRP community, he told CoinDesk.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Nassar said: “I was losing all my savings” the day he sent the “who can kill him” tweet. Few in the XRP community directly address this subject, but the financial pain is no less real for going mostly unmentioned.  Also largely unacknowledged is the role XRP bullishness might have played in tempting new entrants to invest too much. Influencers on XRP Twitter frequently criticize outlandish price predictions (especially ones presented as near-certainties), but during the heady days of early 2018 it was sometimes a different story:  Given the fall in prices, you might expect cracks to show in some XRP community members’ enthusiasm.  One person I spoke to quit XRP Twitter as I was working on this article, though they didn’t cite the price. When I first began reporting this story, BoiDontFollowMe told me that perceived aggression by XRP community members was “generally […] justified.”  A couple of weeks later, however, the same person messaged me from a different account, saying they’d deleted their old one.  “My thinking has evolved,” they said. Referring to the de facto leaders of the XRP army, they added, “it’s clear they’re aggressive, but if anybody disagrees or tries to call them out, they” – that is, the ones doing the calling out – “[are] sheep, or weak, or a rape victim blamer or any other horrible names.”  The account-formerly-known-as-BoiDontFollowMe called this behavior “childish and embarrassing,” particularly as it was coming from “some of the largest and most influential individuals in the community.”  Some members of the community will likely never throw in the towel, but for many, it may prove difficult to keep the faith in the face of monetary losses and – depending on who you ask – negativity.  Compared to its peak at the beginning of the year, XRP’s price is down by more than 90 percent. Of course, plenty of other cryptocurrencies have fallen further. And, it should be noted, many investors are still in the green at current prices, having bought long before XRP’s price went parabolic in 2017.  Even so, “2018 has been a very tough year for people,” Kelly told me. “If you bought in January and you held, you have lost money. Fact of life.”    ––––––––––––––––––––––––    Original art by CryptoPop (@cryptopop)  Images by David Floyd for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET | XRP,David Floyd,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/the-fud-stompers-like-it-or-not-xrp-army-is-winning-cryptos-hashtag-war,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b4c00f5c6c61df0f2411223dc27bfcc7a9b58a5-1500x750.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430069,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0Ph,1546275303,Bitcoin's Warrior Queen: Lightning's Elizabeth Stark Is Building an Army,"–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  A former academic, Elizabeth Stark likes to play devil's advocate. Take, for instance, her appearance at the Crypto Springs conference in October 2018.  It's a sunny morning in Palm Springs, California, and a handful of attendees are lounging by the pool; onstage, however, Stark is busy describing some of the darker potential scenarios for the cryptocurrency industry, ones in which it could fall short of its potential.  But if the words of warning aren't drawing a response, it's perhaps because the price of bitcoin is still north of $6,000, and some are optimistic that the so-called ""crypto winter"" will soon be over, evaporated by an end-of-year upswell in institutional money entering the industry.  It's not a sentiment shared by Stark, though, who warns attendees that legacy financial players could take stronger measures to impede the sector's growth. ""When you change how money is created and valued, there is going to be major pushback,"" Stark says.  Later, Stark draws applause when she castigates the previous year's explosion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), and the sometimes shady startups that used them as a means of securing fundraising from a market that was suddenly full of unsophisticated buyers.  ""I’m all for experimentation, but I’m not for experimentation if it means that retail investors are going to get sluiced,"" she says. ""Ninety-five percent of the coins that we have right now will probably fail.""  The stance has come to dominate more and more of Stark's talks of late, that innovation can and must be balanced with steps that avoid consumer harm, and it's one that's taking on increasing relevance as the crypto market cools and the industry attempts to take stock of why billions in consumer money came in 2017, only to quickly retreat.  “If you really believe in decentralization then why are you creating all these centralized services?"" she continues.  Referring to the way crypto exchanges and certain wallet providers control the private keys to their customers' wallets, thus undermining the value proposition of personal financial sovereignty, she adds: ""We need to get to a world where people can hold their own keys … have this autonomy.”  Yet, as frank and sobering as her talk might have been, Stark has the clout to not only call for change in the industry, but deliver it. After years of quiet building at her startup, Lightning Labs, 2018 has been a breakout year for both Stark and her company.  In fact, Stark's accomplishments this past year dwarfed those of most other entrepreneurs, as her decision to roll up her sleeves in 2015 and take the helm of an open-source project many saw as the best chance to massively scale bitcoin (but that perhaps had little business value) began to bear serious fruit.  Rallying the troops  If it weren’t for Elizabeth Stark, bitcoin’s lightning network might still be just an idea.  Instead, it’s become a functioning, if niche, payments system; a hotbed of software development; and a beacon of hope for those who believe in bitcoin’s potential as an everyday currency. All in the space of a year.  A law school graduate, Stark doesn’t code much. But there are many who credit the Lighting Labs CEO for much of the remarkable progress lightning has made.  ""She helped get everyone to actually make stuff,"" said Tadge Dryja, who co-wrote the 2016 lightning white paper with Joseph Poon. ""Her thing is not only identifying a super-cool project, but then saying, 'We should actually build this.'""  As such, Stark is often described as a kind of warrior queen, who now commands an army of elite developers.  ""Her general conviction and ability to organize and arm the troops and to aim the cannon, then allow these really talented people to shoot, is really rare in this space,"" said Jack Mallers, who developed the Zap bitcoin wallet using the lightning network's open-source code.  It was Stark, after all, who recruited Olaoluwa Osuntokun, a Nigerian-American prodigy, to work full-time in the cryptocurrency industry. The former Google engineering intern known as ""Lalou,"" now Lightning Labs’ CTO and co-founder, has become one of bitcoin’s most prolific developers, taking over the work Dryja and Poon started on the layered scaling solution. (Both have since departed, citing differences within the team).  More broadly, Stark is also widely credited for turning her friend Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and co-founder of Square, into a lightning believer. Since Dorsey fell into Stark’s orbit, the Square payments app has become one of the most popular ways for U.S. retail investors to acquire bitcoin. He also invested personally in Lightning Labs, the company Stark co-founded that develops the open-source Lightning Network Daemon (LND) protocol.  But perhaps the clearest proof of her influence can be seen in the blossoming of lightning itself during a brutal year for cryptocurrency prices and a period of overall retrenchment for blockchain companies.  The number of nodes on the nascent network swelled from a few dozen in early January to more than 1,900 in mid-December, according to BitcoinVisuals.com. (1ml.com gives an even higher estimate, including some that aren’t currently active, with more than 4,500 lightning nodes.)  Lightning now has the capacity to process about $2 million worth of crypto transactions, based on the balances held in its more than 13,000 payment channels. While that may seem small, it’s an auspicious start considering the beta version of LND was only released in mid-March. Underscoring the health of the young ecosystem, there are multiple implementations of the software, of which LND is only one.  ""Lightning is a movement,"" Stark told CoinDesk recently, recalling a conversation with a bitcoin fan who first coined this phrase. ""We've spent the past year building this movement and it's working.""  From law school to lightning  It's been a long time since Stark, an affable vegan who hardly fits the bitcoin stereotype of a socially awkward introvert, started her journey to become an unlikely heroine in bitcoin’s origin story.  ""As a teenager, [I] was an internet geek who liked electronic music,"" Stark told CoinDesk. ""So basically I'm the same person today.""  Growing up in the New York suburbs, she said, she knew her calling was to build new technology. ""As a teenager, I interned at startups in New York City,"" she said. ""Law school was actually an interesting means to study and research the internet.""  Stark was busy honing debate skills and graduating from Harvard Law School in 2008, the year Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper. After law school Stark went into academia, teaching human rights and computer science courses at universities like Yale, Stanford and Harvard.  It was at Stanford, in 2010, where she first heard about bitcoin from a teaching assistant.  By the time she met with Dryja in 2015, developers had started to theorize what would later become the lightning network, which was then little more than a concept on slide decks and whiteboards. Yet, Stark was ready to lead a startup.  ""From the beginning she was clear, she wanted to be the CEO,"" Dryja recalled. ""She’d seen a lot of ideas that never got anywhere, not because the idea was bad but because there’s a big difference between an idea ... and getting it so that millions of people can use it.""  Dryja, who co-founded Lightning Labs with Stark then left the company in 2016, credited his former colleague for prioritizing quality over quantity. Despite being a rookie businesswoman, she lined up prominent investors like Charlie Lee, the creator of litecoin, former PayPal COO David Sacks, and Dorsey. But Stark raised a modest $2.5 million from these investors and avoided the lucrative token sales that were then becoming fashionable.  ""Even in 2016, you could have raised a ton of money and gotten a fancy office, but she didn’t want to,"" Dryja said.  Stark said she's driven by a desire to create ""significant technology that will have effects on the 10-year horizon and beyond."" In her mind, lightning is a key part of ensuring bitcoin's longevity.  ""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" she said.  Subtly persuasive  Perhaps thanks to her legal background, Stark has the uncanny ability to disagree without being combative and guide decisions without barking orders.  Her presence is unassuming, yet irresistible. The raven-haired CEO is often spotted beside Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo at meetups with her omnipresent smile and cypherpunk black wardrobe.  ""She’s very socially equipped in terms of networking, something that I don't do well and don't enjoy,"" Mallers said. ""Writing the code isn’t the hard part. It’s aligning the direction, limiting the scope, organizing.""  No matter where you go in the tech industry, someone in the room probably considers Stark a friend and wants to hear what the level-headed extrovert has to say. This nonchalant charm makes her an anomaly in a field teeming with bombastic personalities.  Although there may be some professional rivalry with bitcoin-focused startups like Blockstream, Dryja said Stark’s approach is to listen to everyone and observe how users interact with a protocol instead of ""trying to dictate what people do with it.""  Another sign of her personality: no matter how busy she gets, Stark is generally responsive to chats in the LND Slack group, where developers and fans around the world collaborate, and which now has more than 2,870 members.  ""I think it speaks to who she is as a person that she is fostering this community. And it speaks to her savvy as a business owner,"" Mallers said.  Referring to Lightning Labs, he added, ""all their software is open source and they are very grounded, sticking to their original vision.""  Diversity and mentorship  Another way that Stark distinguishes herself is by deliberately creating opportunities for minorities to contribute to an industry predominantly led by white men.  Stark co-organized the Crypto Springs conference in October, where more than half of the speakers were women, and scholarships for women to attend Bitcoin Core contributor Jimmy Song's programming bootcamp.  Mir Liponi, an Italian vlogger and co-founder of Blockchainlab, said meeting Stark at a Consensus conference in 2015 inspired her decision to take a more active role in Italy’s bitcoin community.  ""The fact that she was so young and respected as a CEO and as a woman was something almost new to me,"" Liponi told CoinDesk. ""One of the greatest contributions Elizabeth [made to] bitcoin is her constant work and ability to connect experts, projects, people.""  It was Stark who helped Liponi arrange bitcoin hackathons in Milan, with people working on a variety of distinct solutions related to lightning. In part, these meetings helped set the ground work for the lightning interoperability standard called Bolt, which allows lightning-enabled bitcoin nodes to route transactions.  ""If you want to design this for people to actually, use, we can't just design it for ourselves,"" Dryja said, adding Stark is one of the leading figures getting ""all different kinds of people"" involved with building up the bitcoin ecosystem.  Like many young developers in the space, Mallers credits Stark with mentoring him as he went from obscure hobbyist to internet-celebrity entrepreneur.  Speaking broadly to how her mentorship encourages programmers across the ecosystem to connect and ship complementary code, he added: ""I give that credit to Elizabeth.""  Patient scaling  Stepping back, to fully grasp Stark's work to bitcoin, it's important to remember that the lightning technology was conceived, and Lightning Labs founded, in the midst of a long-running and contentious debate within the bitcoin community over how best to scale the network.  Over the years, as bitcoin's network volume increased, rising transaction fees and slowing confirmation times had cast doubt on the currency's suitability for use cases that were touted early on, such as micropayments for web content or prosaic retail purchases (the proverbial cup of coffee).  While few in the community questioned the so-called digital gold's ability to serve as a store of value, its utility as a means of exchange was now at issue.  One camp, led by CEOs of venture capital-funded startups, wanted to quickly boost the network's capacity by increasing the size of transaction blocks that are added to the ledger every 10 minutes or so.  The other camp, represented by developers and hard-core users like Stark, resisted such proposals, arguing, among other things, that a hastily implemented change to the software would present a security risk.  (Stark was often outspoken during these debates about how important she believes it is to prioritize security as one of bitcoin’s core principles.)  Lightning, as conceived by Dryja and Poon, offered an alternative. Small payments would be handled off the blockchain, through a mechanism called payment channels. Users could send bitcoin back and forth to each other through these channels, and the blockchain would be reserved for final settlement.  Still, the scaling debate raged on. After a game of chicken, in which the big-block camp tried to push through a software update that might have split the network into two competing currencies, the controversial plan was called off at the eleventh hour in November 2017.  The slow-and-steady camp had prevailed, and the stage was set for layer-two solutions like lighting to flourish. Four months later, in March 2018, Lightning Labs released the beta version of LND.  Today, Stark said there are now hundreds of developers making Lightning apps and contributing to the network's open source infrastructure. Meanwhile, the number of channels has increased 16-fold over the past year.  Regardless of the so-called crypto winter, Stark's 11-person company shows no signs of slowing down.  ""If anything, the calming of the hype and frenzy helps us because there are fewer distractions and it's a better time to keep on building,"" Stark said. ""There's a lot left to do, but this year has very much exceeded my expectations with the speed of growth and adoption.""  This further distinguishes Stark from many other CEOs of her ilk: She is patient. Speaking to what sets Lightning Labs and its vivacious leader apart from other crypto startups, Mallers concluded:  ""It’s very comforting, owning bitcoin and being an investor in the asset knowing that people like her, who stay focused, grounded and mature as a business owner, are trying to accomplish something like scaling.""    ––––––––––––––––––––––––    Art by Cryptopop!

42430074,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0Zh,1546275300,In Bed With Brenna Sparks: Porn’s Rising Star Might Be Crypto’s Best Advocate,"Brenna Sparks wills herself to try new things.  Equal parts adult star and crypto evangelist, she's not the kind of Las Vegas denizen who never hits the strip. But when asked if she wants to take the High Roller, the city's 550-foot tall Ferris wheel with a serious view, the thought clearly petrifies her.  Still, she insists we go.  It’s fitting, as Sparks embraces the highs and lows – both in life and in crypto. In an email following our meeting, she writes about how she believes crypto is getting stronger and stronger.  She writes:  ""Traveling upwards doesn't require the path to be linear. The path can be paved on hills, too.”  That said, Sparks is admittedly a bit of a newcomer to crypto, best known as an advisor for SpankChain, one of a handful of projects that have raised funding via an initial coin offering and released tokens designed to power a protocol in a bid to disrupt the adult industry.  But her work has since taken her to unexpected places.  Take the promotional stunt she took part in this year that involved the bitcoin price and a body part that’s not known for its role in crypto conversations. Let's just say that she encourages others to try new things.  That applies broadly, too. Sparks boosts what's known as the decentralized internet, a term that’s come to refer to a time when the intermediaries we know today – think Google, Amazon, Facebook – have been replaced by code owned by no one and operated by users.  ""I don't believe in the current ideas people are pushing for adoption. I'm hoping to go and do my own thing and focus on mass adoption,"" she tells us.  But we're going to have to wait to see what she wants to do.  If there’s a plan, Sparks is shy about saying it. ""Right now, it's all about keeping crypto people in crypto. Many just want to leave,” she says.  For example, she’s shot one sexy-but-educational video aimed at helping viewers buy their first cryptocurrencies, but she still hasn’t published it. She's convinced her work can do more good when the market gets out of this funk.  She adds: “It's only when things have calmed down that you focus on bringing new people in.”  The downside of the down  Still, when she does, it’s safe to say Sparks just might bring the very thing that’s made her such a compelling figure in crypto in 2018: a message about what it means to be a real user.  Sparks will be the first to tell you she's not a trader, but she's acutely aware of aspects of blockchain that go beyond the technical. When the price goes up or down, that impacts Sparks, who holds roughly 75 percent of her wealth in crypto.  ""I do earn a good living outside of crypto. ... I think this enables me to really be aggressive with investing and not get shortsighted by Lambos and tickets to the moon,"" she wrote CoinDesk. ""I don't drive and rockets scare me.""  But it’s not just skin in the game (and in the crypto videos she plans to make) that yields Sparks' crypto fandom, it’s the way that she uses both experiences to truly connect with followers.  Just before meeting me, she posts a video of herself in a black, ethereum-emblazoned onesie on Twitter with the message: ""Probably the cutest thing that’s happening in ETH right now.""  Half-playful boast, half-trolling, it’s an example of how Sparks is able to connect with the sentiments of a community and channel that into her work. At the time, the price of ether was hanging perilously above $100, the threshold seen by many as what opened the floodgates to its meteoric rise – from just a few dollars to over $1,000 – over the course of 2017.  In that sense, she's showing solidarity.  But if fans are feeling down, Sparks has had a year that resembles our Ferris wheel ride, one that began on the up and ended on the down: SpankChain is closing the year amidst layoffs. It's sad, but unavoidable in her mind.  Still, Sparks doesn't seem rattled by that, at least compared to her reaction to the Ferris wheel.  As we got ready to board she looks up; she’s very clearly scared. (The High Roller is basically a bunch of small orbs attached to a giant machine. The orbs rotate on the wheel as it turns, but so slowly that, from the inside, you can't tell.)  Like the blockchain, thinking about how this cleverly engineered ride works can be painful. Also, like the blockchain, the High Roller doesn't stop for you to figure it out. You get on board while it's still moving, as we do, with maybe a dozen tourists, as the prior group exits out the other side.  At first, Sparks was the only one to avail herself of the small bench in our compartment. We sit there talking about crypto and, unlike everyone else, she is studiously not looking out the window.  But by the time we got about a quarter of the way up, she starts to peak. We reach the top just as night has fully fallen and Vegas looks like the Milky Way pressed into the earth, and soon Sparks is tweeting out a video about the view.  That's how she said she always is, though. When something scares her she's terrified before she does it. Then, it’s as if she's been doing it her whole life.  Origin story  But what about Sparks’ life? Certainly, we don’t get much of a glimpse of it in her videos, though we see everything else, or in her tweets, most of which are a mix of travel, life and crypto, though never in a way that’s (and this is a little ironic) revealing.  It turns out, we have her ex-boyfriends to thank for bringing Sparks into its ranks.  ""The type of guys I typically go for,"" she tells us, ""are typically nerdy.""  This is early in our conversation, at a shop for toast and coffee that Sparks picks because of its pink interior. We started our day together there. When she showed up, she had no idea we'd go over 50 stories up riding a glass-enclosed bubble on a wheel.  She shows up exactly on time for our 1:30 p.m. meeting, arriving in a red baseball cap and a t-shirt under a light space-themed jacket, solo, in an Uber. Her eye makeup is 100 percent on brand but otherwise... Sparks does porn, but she doesn't front like a star.  That’s no doubt because she wasn’t always one, at least back when the first crypto boyfriend showed her bitcoin in 2009. Another one showed her ethereum, in 2017.  For more about those guys, just hunt the internet. She talks about them in several interviews. Just be sure to add ""crypto"" or ""ethereum"" to your search terms.  In past conversations, though, she says that she's never had the problem with banks that other adult stars have had, but that changed this spring.  ""I believe we shouldn't have banks,"" she told us.  It's not hard to understand why. One day, her bank accounts were shut down because bankers found out she was doing porn.  ""I was up front that I was a stripper,"" she says, when setting up the account. Then later she got into doing adult video and that's what they didn't like, she said.  She tried to withdraw her money as soon as they shut it down, but they wouldn't give it to her immediately. Not until she took it to Twitter and her fans brigaded the bank on her behalf.  ""I posted on Twitter and they gave me money back in 48 hours,"" she said.  But she connects her experience with the bank to other roadblocks she's hit.  For example, she's currently on her third Instagram account, because she keeps getting kicked off for posting stuff that's too sexy. She knows other stars who have been kicked off of Twitter, too, because they failed to understand the nuances of its rules around adult content.  So, Sparks has become one of those rare non-technical people who really dig decentralization.  She wrote:  ""It is a lot like an animal spreading itself across the Earth. Decentralizing gives it the ability to survive as a species and evolve into something that wasn't possible before.""  Woman of the people  But if that’s why she believes in crypto, Sparks has her own theories on why she’s made such a connection to the industry, too.  ""Crypto needs a face. They need someone who can be general,"" she said.  She says this several times as we speak and in a follow-up email. Satoshi's facelessness turns her off. She likes Vitalik, but she only sees him reaching techies.  She wants someone who can speak to the masses and for the technology. As she put it, she wants kids to be accidentally buying crypto when they are playing with mom's cell phone – because it's that easy.  She also wants the technology to fix some of its weird gaps. ""One of my biggest fears in using crypto (especially in the earlier days) was sending transactions. There were times when something happened and the money just never went through and got lost,"" she writes.  Neat new applications that give people better ways to make money are great, but Sparks' insight about normal people is that they want to know they aren't going to stupidly lose money before they try a new way to use it.  And in the developed world, the current system works fine for most.  ""A lot of normal people don't know what it feels like to have your bank close on you,"" she told us. Sex workers do, but they're still reluctant to try crypto's solutions. She feels consciousness needs to be raised before minds can really change.  “Before a sex worker can even begin to look into cryptocurrencies, they first need to see what's wrong with the current setup and need to grow to hate it before they can be passionate about the solution,” she says.  So, could Sparks parlay her people-first insights into a bid to be that relatable face for crypto?  She's cagey on that point. Instead, she gives a nod to Andreas Antonopoulos, who she believes starts in the right place with his critiques of the present system. But could she be a leader later on, when the market's ready for her to make her move?  ""Maybe,"" she tells us as we ride into downtown Vegas in a Lyft, but she looks away, reluctantly.  It’s tough to tell again if she's distracted by the impending Ferris wheel ride still ahead.  Crossover star  Whether or not it’s something she’ll harness, it’s clear there’s an opportunity.  Her pro-crypto message has distinguished her from the ocean of adult performers out there, no doubt helping her earn her a nomination for ""Crossover Star of the Year"" in the XBiz Awards (up against Stormy Daniels, who has also had quite a year, to say the least about the most).  Her ventures into new experiences were not limited to the blockchain: She did a bunch of new varieties of porn this year. She did porn in VR (she got an award nomination there, too). She did her first ASMR video (talking softly for people turned on by girls talking softly).  Looking ahead, she wants to satisfy her fans desire for Web3 inspired content. For example, crypto cosplay, but she just has to figure out what that means first. She might start simple and troll some crypto Illuminati with racy tape, she told us. All that remains to be seen.  But her big crossover moment culminated this summer, with the stunt we mentioned above: Sparks invited an engineer for Via, a micropayments cryptocurrency, to visit her in Vegas from the Netherlands and – there's not really a euphemism for this – eat her ass.  The engineer, who just goes by Romano, had never done it before, and the internet had decided that crypto markets would pump if he did. It quickly became referred to as a ""prophecy.""  The so-called prophecy of Romano doing this thing he did not find appealing managed to become part of the Smimem vs. Bogdanoff YouTube meme – which, for anyone who doesn't know about this, is pretty fun. Wade in.  Romano told CoinDesk the whole thing started with a conversation on Twitter where other guys dared him to go there with someone – anyone. He told CoinDesk via Twitter direct message:  ""At some point I said I would maybe try it if people stop talking about it. Bitcoin suddenly rallied up. Later on I said 'Uh not going to do it,' and bitcoin went down again. That's when everyone in their hearts knew I had to do it.""  Unrelated to the dare, Romano became Twitter friends with Sparks because he and others had convinced her to buy some via. ""She checked the viacoin block explorer to see if it arrived, which impressed me,"" he told us.  So as she got pulled into the dare, he asked her if she knew a Vegas denizen he could engage in the act in question with. She told him he might as well do it with her, because they were friends and, to paraphrase her telling, having some guy eat her ass a bit was basically just another day in the life of Brenna Sparks.  She doesn't just will herself to do new things. She gets others there, too.  When it went down, the act lasted a few seconds. He did it, fellow porn star Bobbi Dylan witnessed it and it was done. Then they all hung out in Vegas.  Brock Pierce's San Juan clan may have a monastery, but Sparks has fulfilled a prophecy.  Just Be Real  In other words, Sparks will go where few might venture to sell the world on this new technology.  She’s long crypto, but refuses to shill for any particular coin – not in this market. She really seems to buy this vision; crypto isn't just her porn niche. It's her niche. She told us about coins she's promoted, but she asked us not to repeat them – Sparks wants people to make their own picks now.  We spent about seven hours with Sparks, talking about porn, crypto and life. As far as we can tell, the Sparks in her videos is the genuine Sparks. She's really that bubbly. She laughs all the time. And she really wants crypto to disrupt everything.  She likes her fans. She's bummed out by haters, but she's quick to point out that no one ever talks smack to her face.  ""It turns out that there are a ton of misogynists in the crypto space, which I found to be very disappointing. Aside from that, the overall popularity has benefited me far more than it hasn't,"" she told us.  Despite the negatives, she thinks bridging porn and crypto has been rewarding.  ""I went from being a homebody girl to someone surrounding themselves with very influential people trying to change the world and trying to get my input on matters. My growth has been demanding more from me faster than I can keep up with,"" she confessed.  All we asked is that she ride on a giant Ferris wheel, a huge metaphor in the heart of her adopted city for the process that made her one of 2018's most influential in cryptocurrency.  At first, she was terrified. Halfway through, she was totally into it and by the time we got off? She was talking about where we could go get dinner.  She faced the idea, embraced the experience, and she was over it before we were through. Will it be the same for Sparks with crypto?  Probably not. Unlike the ride on the Ferris wheel, Sparks has made it through the fun part and she's still here. As she later wrote:  ""Until I see no more opportunity to obtain a bunch of power and wealth, my mind will remain this way. The game is the same. We are just on a crappy part of the board.""    ––––––––––––––––––––––––    Art by ChibiFighters (@chibifighers)  Photos by Brady Dale for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/in-bed-with-brenna-sparks-porns-rising-star-might-be-cryptos-best-advocate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41d41ceb3c31f2d4cbf871471d48810027082d3e-1720x861.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430092,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0Vh,1546275281,Ethereum's New Radical: Glen Weyl Isn't Vitalik But He's Its Next Best Hope,"Dr. Glen Weyl speaks with the calm of a man who has history on the mind.  With an unbroken gaze and an unambiguous delivery, the author, economist and Microsoft researcher calmly espouses a clear and revolutionary vision: that the world's hierarchies can be challenged and reconceived with the power of markets.  But if his theories were trapped before in the pages of academia, in 2018, Weyl has captured the imagination and devotion of the leading minds in ethereum, and, by extension, what is likely the world’s largest cryptocurrency community. It has so far been the perfect match for the co-author of ""Radical Markets,"" whose collaborations with developers may soon enable his ideas to escape the page in ways he never conceived.  It was no surprise then to see Weyl at Devcon4, the annual ethereum conference in Prague in October, where he was running on three hours sleep.  At the time, Weyl reported to having given 73 talks in the previous six months alone. Just in from the UK, his trip had brought him to Belgium, Denmark, Norway and France – a series of dates he jokingly compares to a Rolling Stones tour.  Still, they don't all get the fanfare of his Devcon talk – which he defined as a ""rally cry"" against individualism; here it's met with blustering applause from the audience. As a speaker, Weyl has no shortage of charisma – a trait he brushes off as ""an unfair advantage"" among developers.  This charisma is no doubt helpful given Weyl's sometimes obscure ideological inspirations. He sees himself as seeking to resurrect a liberal tradition from the 19th century; combining it with modern mechanism designed to displace entrenched power structures. According to Weyl, this enables his preferred school of thought – sometimes referred to as liberal radicalism – to break the left- and right-wing dichotomy he sees as having stagnated change in the world’s most essential systems.  In the place of traditional hierarchies, then, Weyl promotes new, democratic structures – markets that are diverse, inclusive and decentralized.  Some of his ideas go even further. In an email to ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, one he republished on Medium, Weyl went so far as to suggest a tax to penalize ""using standard white English."" Elsewhere, he's tweeted about ""tax[ing] masculinity to subsidize femininity."" And following his talk at Devcon, he explicitly asked for questions from female or minority groups first.  ""Sorry for not being a woman,"" said a male audience member who took the microphone.  Within ethereum, however, the enthusiasm for Weyl's ideas is at times evangelical. Even in communities that espouse the benefits of decentralization, there's a tendency to elect icons – and Weyl has undoubtedly become one of them.  His work has inspired blockchains, artworks, science fiction, game designs and political agendas. When he spoke to CoinDesk in September, he claimed “billions” of dollars worth of capital has been pumped into exploring the ideas worldwide. He‘s even been asked to design the social rules for a potential Mars colony.  ""It’s getting hard to keep track of what is going on,"" Weyl said in Prague, ""I’m getting like five requests every day.""  Tipping Point  To cope with the growing hype, Weyl and others have spun up a non-profit foundation as a convening point for their ideas.  Named RadicalXChange, the foundation will culminate in a conference in March that seeks to bring together the various thinkers that are broadcasting Weyl’s methods. According to Weyl, the conference is the locus of an entire social movement that's bent on saving the world from an imminent political crisis.  ""If you ask for a single goal that I have, I think that we were on a trajectory where we were headed for 1930s style global conflict and totalitarianism, and I think that RadicalXChange as a movement can stop that,” Weyl said.  But if Weyl is venerated for his focus on macroeconomic issues, he’s a product of conditions in the smaller world of cryptocurrency as well.  In a way, the enthusiasm for Weyl’s ideas can be said to stem from an absence of purpose that had been palpable since ethereum was trading at all-time highs and spawning viral applications at the tail end of 2017.  At the time, single CryptoKitties were trading for hundreds of thousands of dollars – yet the blockchain itself was burdened with the husks of failed or abandoned projects. With ethereum facing new technical and social challenges, the market mania was coupled with a queasy tension.  ""The public clearly has very very high expectations of us, and this makes me feel worried and uneasy inside. We need to try harder to make this actually work,"" Buterin tweeted in December 2017.  Amidst this atmosphere, the ideas expressed by ""Radical Markets"" seemed to introduce a renewed faith that positive social change could be achieved with a system like ethereum, whether that took months or years. Armed with this emphasis on a bright and far-off future, Weyl's ideas lent the project a regenerated sense of direction.  Weyl sees it similarly, although he argues his ideas may have also helped free the project from the belief that money was an indicator of its success.  Ethereum’s nouveau riche are Weyl’s case and point. He gave Blockchains L.L.C., a startup operated by an early ethereum investor Jeffrey Berns that is seeking to build a blockchain utopia in Nevada, as an example of this.  ""I don’t think the Blockchains L.L.C. people are badly intentioned, but I do think they don’t really know what they are doing, and if you just drop a lot of resources in a completely arbitrary way, on someone who doesn’t know, it’s just really not a good social experiment,"" he said.  Because decentralization is, in Weyl’s words, ""the fundamental principle that animates what is going on in the blockchain space,"" enthusiasm for his message stems from the framework he provides to protect it.  ""There’s all people like Blockchains L.L.C. where there’s all this power that has landed on someone in a completely arbitrary way and people are like, 'This is bizarre.' And so they ask, 'Is that really going to lead to a liberal society? A decentralized society?'"" Weyl said, adding:  ""I think that that is what people are looking for an answer to. They are looking for an answer to, 'How do we build institutions that will achieve our values?'""  Power bubbles  Matters of the present, however, aren’t always on Weyl’s mind; he has a tendency to flit between different time periods when talking.  In our conversation, he traveled from 600 BC up to the Age of Enlightenment, and circles consistently back to 1930s, believing that its proto-fascist political climate isn’t dissimilar to our own.  Hitler, Weyl said, ""had no power.""  ""All power is a bubble,"" he explained. ""All Hitler had was the beliefs of other people about the beliefs of other people about the beliefs of other people.""  Yet power and its mechanisms, Weyl said, are usually hidden from view. Distinct from this, ethereum and other blockchains stand out for their transparency, which shows the verifiable legitimacy of the system in real time.  ""It’s like you can feel the legitimacy or illegitimacy, you can almost measure it, of a system. There’s no historical period where that was so palpable,"" he said.  According to Weyl, then, ethereum can be seen as having encountered the pitfalls of centralization. The sell-off, through this lens, is an opportunity, a chance to get it right next time, a chance that maybe systems like the Web never had.  With this second chance, Weyl believes the project needs to overcome its attitude to private property. In particular, he believes that because ethereum combines a formal notion of private property – immutable, cryptographic ownership – with informal governance, it risks leading to nefarious consequences.  ""The problem is they formalized private property in an incredibly rich way, and yet they didn’t formalize democracy. And private property without democracy is an incredibly dark and scary thing,"" Weyl said.  He pointed to Mencius Moldbug, the infamous neoreactionary author, to illustrate the extreme view of what occurs when private property exists without democratic protections in place.  In Moldbug's vision, democratic structures are replaced by all-powerful corporations, elected by property holders. And Weyl has a word for governance of this type when coupled with ethereum: Skynet, referring to the villainous artificial intelligence from the Terminator film series.  ""The existing system formalizes private property and it doesn’t formalize human beings, and if property exists but humans don’t exist, you will get Skynet,"" Weyl said, going on to add:  ""That is precisely the opposite of what people want. We built this to avoid Skynet. But if you don’t formalize human beings and only formalize property, skynet is the only thing that you come out with.""  Hope for ethereum  Weyl’s ideas address what he has defined as the crisis of the liberal order – the abandonment of democratic liberalism globally in favor of new forms of nationalism, conflict and economic secession. To protect against this, Weyl argues that ethereum – and the ideology of its leading figures – can play a crucial role.  In his words, ethereum enables new forms of ""social technology"" that can enforce previously unimaginable democratic structures. Coupled with the powerful ideology of its community, Weyl says, ethereum can help society sidestep emergent totalitarianism.  ""What is a good application of ethereum? Avoiding nuclear winter,"" he posited.  And with a new problem to address – one that wasn’t purely due to its trading price or immediate technical aims – word about Weyl began to spread.  Vitalik Buterin, the creator of ethereum himself, first publicly discussed Weyl’s work in April.  Writing in a blog post, Buterin broke down the scope of ""Radical Markets"" and cited the ""multifaceted and plentiful"" crossovers between the book and the ethereum community. Buterin predicted that ""blockchains may well be used as a technical backbone"" for the ideas.  Later in May, Buterin and Weyl made their first written appearance together, in a blog post titled ""Liberation through Radical Decentralization,"" written in the style of a manifesto.  With a heavy emphasis on quadratic voting, the post urged that combining ideas from the ""Radical Markets"" canon with blockchain tech could help challenge oppressive power and generate a ""free, open and cooperative world in the 21st century.""  Effectively, quadratic voting is Weyl's answer to ethereum's informal governance system. What it does is re-engineer the ""one person one vote"" democracy envisioned by bitcoin so that minorities have a higher say, achieved through using a clever math technique called quadratic scaling.  Collaborations between the two have since culminated in a research paper authored alongside Ph.D. of economics Zoë Hitzig, titled ""Liberal Radicalism: Formal Rules for a Society Neutral among Communities,"" which provides a distilled description of the quadratic voting mechanism.  Titled ""Liberal Radicalism"" (LR) after the duo’s emerging social philosophy of the same name, the paper expanded the notion of quadratic voting outward, such that it could apply to funding.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Buterin said that what Weyl had achieved was a reactivation of some of the more politically aligned blockchain applications that were being touted back in 2014 – ideas such as universal basic income based on the blockchain.  As Buterin put it:  ""[Weyl] came along and offered some really interesting and novel ideas backed up by solid mathematical reasoning that could actually be a substantial improvement on the status quo.""  ""So, naturally there’s a lot of interest,"" he added.  Science fiction  Indeed, it was a common theme in interviews conducted by CoinDesk, with ""Radical Markets"" supporters regularly citing Weyl's work as the best hope in a world they see as faced with growing inequality and atomization.  For example, Mark Housley from the quadratic voting-powered political signaling platform WeAreThePeople told CoinDesk that ""no one has come up with a better way,"" to address widening income gaps and the rise of populism and democratic participation more broadly.  Still, beyond a tight clique of starry-eyed enthusiasts, there's evidence that for some, Weyl's ideas remain too high-risk, and perhaps too esoteric, for implementation in the immediate future.  To discover why, it helps to look to Buterin’s April blog post, which for a large part was structured as a critique.  ""I love this vision. So, let me be a good intellectual citizen and do my best to try to make a case against it,"" Buterin wrote at the time.  Buterin argued that some of Weyl’s ideas, perhaps, demanded too high a complexity to become livable market structures. He cited the ""mental transaction costs"" involved with moving people to such models, maintaining that while well-engineered, the complexity of the ideas may render them less feasible to implement.  Giving an example from inside the blockchain space, Buterin warned that some of the Weyl's economic models might not be able to sustain the hostile, scam-fueled landscape of the cryptocurrency industry. Beyond these critiques voiced by Buterin, there have been other, more philosophically rooted reactions to Weyl's thought as well – in particular, his belief that economics can cure all social ills.  And that's because, in Weyl’s view, the rise of movements like right-wing populism is fundamentally an economic question – rooted in wealth inequality – and not, as others might argue, a result of more slippery, irrational inclinations, such as romanticism.  Confronted with this observation, Weyl defended his position, stating that at its heart, economics is no different to disciplines such as sociology, philosophy or politics.  ""We all worship the same god,"" he said. ""They are just ways of allocating resources.""  Still, Weyl differentiates this view from the mainstream economics community, which is rife with he calls ""weenie supremacy"" – in his words, ""the view that any form of intelligence that is not perfectly correlated with a SAT score contains no value.""  To correct the ills of his community, then, Weyl incorporates the views of other disciplines, regularly working alongside philosophers, artists and post-colonial theorists that complement – and at times contradict – his economics-centric worldview.  Artists and writers are heralded by Weyl as a way to provide critical feedback prior to implementation. For example, blockchain researcher Primavera De Filippi‏ is amassing a sci-fi anthology of Radical Markets ideas intended to speculate on the outcome of the models if applied.  ""It’s harder to do it in the real world right now, so instead of trying something in practice and then having to wait and see what happens, science fiction gives you the opportunity to discuss the different ways that it could be implemented,"" she told CoinDesk.  Another project that critically extrapolates on Weyl's ideas is ""Radical Bodies,"" a concept conceived by ethereum developers Lane Rettig and Dean Eigenmann at a hackathon in Prague, in which rolling auctions are applied to advertising space on people’s clothing.  Based on an idea from ""Radical Markets,"" the advertising space – such as t-shirts – would be under permanent auction. At any stage, an owner can be outbid by someone else – an action which would force a sale.  Rettig described the idea as a political statement, telling CoinDesk that ""Radical Bodies"" exposes the market dynamics that are already active within much of the data-driven economy.  ""We're selling ourselves to Google, Facebook and the others all the time, so why not be explicit about it and receive some compensation?"" he said.  Still, the idea provoked some criticism at Devcon4. Weyl himself described the idea as ""dystopic."" One attendee, who wished to remain anonymous, speculated on what would happen if the same market logic was applied, not to clothing, but to body parts.  Implying that there were areas of life in which such markets structures can be dangerous, the attendee asked: “How much do you value your eyes? And what would happen if I value them more than you?”  Changing the world  Still, in spite of philosophical differences, Weyl claims his ideas are attracting serious dialogue among governments and politics internationally.  For example, he's optimistic some of his ideas will be tested in Europe during the next couple of years. Within this, Weyl says ethereum – and blockchain more broadly – have the opportunity to gain a level of legitimacy that the technology has yet to achieve.  ""This could a way of explaining to the broader community and forming links with artists and real politicians and policy makers and so forth,"" he said in the interview.  But there are other ways that the two disciplines can enforce each other as well. Blockchain, for example, is frequently being touted as a way to test Weyl’s ideas in small environments that won't cause any damage if the experiments don't go according to plan.  And that’s notable because, perhaps predictably, ideas like rolling auctions as an alternative to private property have been met with some backlash, with many arguing that the model fails to offer the stability required by some members of society, such as families.  And there are other ideas that have been met with suspicion as well.  For example, each idea proposed by Weyl requires digital identity, possibly one of the most coveted and contested ideas within the cryptocurrency industry due to the potentially totalitarian consequences that such information could have if concentrated.  ""It is absolutely dangerous to try to build political and technical systems which demand a single identity,"" Harry Halpin, the scientific advisor to Panoramix, warned.  Still, Weyl is aware of the problems of building identity solutions and is taking steps to address the idea hands-on. Today he's in the process of designing a solution that he thinks can sidestep some of these concerns. Within it, Weyl swaps out the idea of a self-sovereign identity for a new kinds of community-based identity systems.  ""We are fundamentally social beings,"" Weyl remarked.  According to Weyl, a distributed identity system with a strong concept of collectivity could minimize the risks inherent to the technology. The specifics of this solution are still being teased out, and are expected to be published in a white paper alongside Stanford professor Matt Jackson and Microsoft researcher Nicole Immorlica in the coming months.  Arguably, the heavy reliance on identity that is demonstrated by ""Radical Markets"" is emblematic of Weyl's unique coupling of humans with market structures.  And while the combination is distasteful for some, it’s worth noting that it is precisely this blend, and its ability to link tech to social justice, that appeals to the ethereum community.  ""We're building what we're building in order to make the world a better place, to right a lot of the wrongs we perceive, but most of us are engineers, not economists or social scientists, so sometimes it can be hard to understand how tech can actually change the world,"" ethereum developer Lane Rettig told CoinDesk.  Rettig concluded:  ""'Radical Markets' presents one vision for how ethereum can change the world, and for why our work matters – it can be the connective tissue between the tech and society.""    ––––––––––––––––––––––––    Art by Chibi Fighters (@chibifighters)  Photos by Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/ethereums-new-radical-glen-weyl-isnt-vitalik-but-hes-its-next-best-hope,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5b23941c493fc770a66e1aa77bdb8a5a5dd1080-1720x861.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42430076,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0dh,1546275251,"Crypto's King Midas: Backstage With CZ, the CEO Who Can't Be Stopped","Cameras, flashlights, tweets – when Changpeng Zhao takes the stage these days, a kind of mania seems to ensue.  Of course, that's perhaps to be expected when you're known to the world over by just two letters, but ""CZ"" has arguably achieved something greater in 2018 — a celebrity status that's equaled by his clout as an entrepreneur.  On a sweltering December day in Singapore, Zhao is quick to show why — he has a surprise that’s not so much up his sleeve as under it. ""I’m gonna show this to the crowd later,"" he says, grin on his face, ear-to-ear.  By the time he takes the stage, the attendees at Forbes Asia Forum in Singapore have shifted from a scattering of somewhat bored businesspeople, some heads down, headphones in, into an excited mass that can almost be felt moving forward.  It's a testament to Zhao's crossover appeal — many in the audience are members of a financial establishment that are (at least publicly) still somewhat skeptical, if not derisive of the technology. Onstage, however, those divides melt away as Zhao raises his arm to unveil his first tattoo — a newly minted logo of his exchange Binance.  The move goes to show the root of CZ's appeal; if he sometimes seems to skirt an outlaw status, what makes him such an effective ambassador for the crypto movement is that he exudes its core beliefs so effortlessly.  Come on in, his smile says, the future is waiting.  But if Zhao has come to embody the current state of cryptocurrency – its runaway growth and newfound cultural appeal – he also matches the industry with an outsized ambition. ""I hope someday I can become as influential as Elon Musk,"" he tells CoinDesk.  Backstage later, CZ is already showing signs of that kind of celebrity status, where he fields at least a dozen requests for selfies, all under the condition his right arm is held high. (Zhao would go on to write an entire blog explaining how he talked himself into getting his new ink.)  The post spotlights another key component to Zhao's charm, his ability to connect with people. That might be one reason he's also quick to push back on assertions that he is an extremist, or that his work in cryptocurrency represents a political agenda, arguing himself that his appeal stems not from any ideology, but from a love of freedom.  Zhao says:  ""I do think we need rules for society to function well. But at the same time, I'm also very freedom driven. I believe we can increase the level of freedom.""  Money Moves  Still, if Zhao is well-equipped at winning people's hearts and minds, he's equally adept at capturing their dollars.  While Western media outlets tend to tout the ascent of Coinbase, even their rise to millions of users is tepid compared to how, in just over 12 months, Binance has gone from white paper to $15 million ICO to an exchange that sees billions of dollars in trading daily.  As of the end of 2018, Binance has eight lines of business – Binance Exchange; Binance Labs; Binance Charity; Binance Academy, Binance Research; Binance Info, Binance Launchpad and Trust Wallet, as well as a ninth, a decentralized exchange, set for launch in January.  That's not to mention Binance Coin (BNB), the nearly $1 billion cryptocurrency network that the company uses as a de-facto currency for its exchange fees.  Impressive as the list may be, it's even more so when you consider some – in particular, Binance Coin, as well as Binance Exchange's crypto-only trading policy – were radical at the time of their launch. Add up the number of businesses that have since followed Zhao's lead, and it's easy to see why he is lauded as a visionary.  Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Kenetic Capital, whose firm passed on investing in Binance, now believes that was a mistake, and that's largely because of Zhao's competencies in expanding the company.  ""What's worked really well is his ability to adapt to the changing market and come up with the type of innovations that the market didn’t even know that they want it,"" Chu says. ""They were the first to come up with an exchange token. I think that's what's most impressive about CZ: his vision to just try different things, iterate and then execute.""  There's also, of course, his impeccable timing. It's easy to forget Zhao's swift ascent came after nearly two years in a kind of exile, a period in which he was rumored to be working on a new project, but in which emails from CoinDesk often went unreturned.  Zhao was, by his own account, laying low following a departure from OKCoin, a China-based cryptocurrency exchange. Jack Liu, a former colleague of Zhao's at OKCoin, now with Circle, shared a recount of the man who he sees as a mentor that hired him in 2014.  ""Product-market fit is his number one skill,"" Liu says. ""CZ has gotten to be really good at absorbing whatever he's seeing and learning, and incorporating into what he does.""  Indeed, Binance is neither the first crypto-to-crypto exchange, nor is it going to become the first decentralized exchange. ""But he's good at putting together synthesis of his background, his team, with initiatives he wasn't able to execute at OKCoin,"" Liu says.  And part of the reason for his ability, according to Liu, is that CZ is ""very much a people person."" ""He has a great sense of humor ... and is always just a little bit of like a 'smart-ass,' just a little bit ahead of the mainstream, but very relatable."" Liu says.  Still, what might be unique about Zhao is that he was always expected back. When he left OKCoin in 2015, CZ wrote an email to CoinDesk, saying:  ""I am pretty sure I will still be in the bitcoin space. I think we have entered a winter phase with the bitcoin industry, but I strongly believe it will pass.""  In retrospect, he was right. The 2015 winter did pass, and when spring emerged, he was ready, having refined and built exchange engines that were ready to serve an upswell in demand.  Walk the line  Still, Binance's meteoric rise has been greeted with skepticism by those who feel Zhao might be moving too fast given the state of global regulation.  Take a report earlier this year by the New York Attorney General's office, which ultimately referred Binance, along with two other exchanges, for investigation. (This in and of itself didn't indicate any wrongdoing on Binance's behalf, though it undoubtedly raised suspicion).  Cited at the time was the inability of regulators to assuage concerns over manipulative or abusive trading, as well as a lack of clarity over whether the firms were operating in New York.  At Consensus: Singapore in September, Zhao's main stage appearance coincided with the release of the report, and onstage and backstage, he declined to comment on the inquiry.  A core criticism of Zhao, then, is that he's been perhaps too willing to engage in regulatory arbitrage, moving his exchange to jurisdictions he believes will give his now global business – he says it operates in over 190 countries – the best chance to offer its services.  For example, Binance left China, where it was initially based, after the country’s central bank banned crypto trading in September last year, and it later moved operations to Tokyo. Then in March, however, the Japanese regulator the Financial Services Agency issued a warning letter that Binance was operating in the country without a license.  Binance is now based in Malta, though Zhao has also made notable appearances with other regulators, including Bermuda and Uganda, that are decidedly outside the financial mainstream.  However, others, like Chu, believe that could be a challenge for the company. ""I think playing jurisdictional hopscotch is not a game. You can't play it for very long,"" he says. Yet still, Chu thinks that if anyone can find his way out of these issues, it's Zhao, adding:  ""While no exchange may emerge to take on incumbents like the NYSE or NASDAQ, I think out of all of them, CZ has the best chance, with the exception of the regulatory angle. I think that could prove to be his Achilles' heel.""  Zhao, for his part, pushes back on these claims, even as he seems to acknowledge how his biases might lead to these assumptions.  ""I have a very worldly mentality, but of the countries I live in, I follow the law to the letter. I never do anything dodgy and I never put myself into those kinds of risks,"" he says.  Later on, he continues to describe his approach as more tepid than it may appear, noting how Binance left China because it didn't ""want the trouble.""  ""In countries that are not crypto friendly, we don’t do any advertising, we don’t do any events, we don’t make a lot of noise,"" he says.  A smart shortcut  Others back up Zhao's story, and it's notable that this group includes at least one regulator.  Jason Hsu, an entrepreneur-turned legislator in Taiwan who is pushing for crypto-friendly laws on the island, got introduced to Zhao when the exchange was on an expansion early this year, and within a week, the two had a sit-down meeting.  At the very last minute before their supposedly close-door private chat, the two even decided to make it a live broadcast. ""That was spontaneous. If we are both so committed to this new technology, why not make a stance and show it publicly?"" Hsu said.  ""I didn’t know CZ before the meeting,"" Hsu recalls. ""But it turns out he's a straightforward and no bullshit entrepreneur.""  Hsu says Binance is still yet to open up a shop on the island, given that financial institutions and regulators in Taiwan had taken a conservative approach to the industry. However, his time with Zhao has left with the impression that Zhao's strategy is more nuanced than simply hopping from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  In comparing Binance with Coinbase, Liu says the latter still takes a rather traditional internet company approach to regulation in the sense that it chooses to offer services based on the world’s largest markets step by step, i.e. first the U.S., then the Europe and the U.K.  ""CZ doesn’t think about which country is the biggest market and therefore I’m gonna set up a team there. He starts with what crypto needs – a wallet and an exchange."" Liu says. ""He's building for a world where once the users go onto the blockchain, the users are the same.""  ""He’s like one of those smart people that enjoy taking shortcuts – not shortcuts to do something bad – but to be efficient,"" Liu adds, stating:  ""To me, going to Uganda or Singapore first is a shortcut from going towards the regulated markets first. ... He’s a blockchain-first person.”  Iron Man  So, if others may see 'CZ' as a kind of Robin Hood, how does he see himself? It turns out, Zhao prefers comparisons to Tony Stark, the billionaire superhero of Marvel comics fame.  ""Tony Stark is very resourceful,"" Zhao says in explanation of the comparison. ""He builds a lot of things. It’s about technology behind, all the tools he builds that he uses to do good things.""  In his eyes, he's simply trying to do as much good as he can, and if that means challenging the establishment in the process, that's just a byproduct of his mission.  ""We should always provide people with more options to choose. The more options there are, the better. People can choose to use a bank and people can choose to use crypto. We are not perfect either, we are not saying crypto is perfect,"" he says.  Though, Zhao is doing his best to further the crypto ecosystem and to avoid banks when possible. In interview, he claims he ""doesn't have to deal with fiat at all"" anymore – partially thanks to a team handling his expenses – and that he pays for hotels and flights in cryptocurrency whenever possible – even if with a premium.  It's a personal mission that has trickled down to his staff as well, where he estimates that ""95 percent"" of the Binance team gets at least part of their salary in crypto. (As it doesn't handle cash, he says the company works with a network of over-the-counter traders to pay out fiat).  In this way, Zhao identifies as a HODLer, the cryptocurrency enthusiasts who believe that, no matter whether the market is up or down, the best investment strategy is simply to buy, hold and wait for the world to wake up to the asset class.  That apartment he sold in 2013 for just a little over $1 million, before putting the proceeds into bitcoin? He says he hasn't sold any, even after last year's run-up.  ""Actually, I still have 100 percent of those coins because I don't really need them,"" he says. ""I’m not very greedy. I have more than enough money than I need.""  Other attributes of his, he says, have permeated through the Binance team. He describes his overriding mantra as ""be fair, be ethical, don't do crazy shit."" Still, there are differences between the superhero and his team of crypto-Avengers.  One of the most notable is he doesn't encourage others at the company, except several co-founders and spokespersons, to be as active on social media, citing security reasons. (""We don’t encourage our people to be public. They have a very minimal social profile. It’s basically a guideline we do,"" he says.)  As such, he says he sometimes feels his team doesn't get enough credit for the work they do in carrying out his vision and translating it into action.  Opening the gate  So, where does crypto's Iron Man go from here? And will Binance's star continue to rise?  That remains an open question. For one, it's unclear how the decline of the cryptocurrency market so far will impact Binance's business, and whether that will put it at a disadvantage against peers operating with more regulatory clarity and institutional clientele.  That, however, appears to be something Zhao is looking to rectify as the exchange is working on opening a shop in Singapore that would accept fiat currency, a company first in one of the largest Asian economies.  ""Fiat is still where all the money is in. … And we’ve got to open that gate,"" he said at CoinDesk’s Consensus Singapore event in September.  To Zhao, then, Singapore is a major hurdle for Binance, as it still needs to convince a bank to fully back its operation. (Notably, Singapore does not currently regulate cryptocurrency exchanges, though it is close to passing such laws.)  And while domestic regulators in the region remain open to blockchains and cryptocurrency, it's to be seen how exactly they'll choose to see Binance and Zhao, whether as a potential asset for the local economy or a possible liability.  And besides, if blockchain is what allows CZ to become so successful so quickly in so many countries, the same technology could, too, allow others to build a Binance knockoff in one or two months at every other domain.  As Liu puts it:  ""Just like other exchanges might have been caught napping and couldn’t follow Binance, Binance may get caught napping too no matter how good CZ is. The test will be whether he can decentralize his businesses even further so that his own staff are the ones that own the next Binances.”  So, too, it's unclear how Zhao will adjust, as he says he wants to wade back into sectors of the industry that may prove less palatable. For instance, the firm intends to reboot Binance Launchpad in 2019, a listing service for entrepreneurs looking to raise funding via token sales, albeit with what the company claims is a more rigorous review process.  Whether or not the establishment chooses to embrace him, though, for now at least, he still has the backing of the cryptocurrency faithful, and he, in turn, has embraced them at every step.  ""Just because I’m not against banks, that does not prevent me from presenting other people another option that could be potentially viewed as a competition to them,"" he says.  At a backstage dinner party following the Singapore event, Zhao ends the conversation by focusing on what might be the final and best way to summarize his ethos – his belief that those who believe in crypto, and who help advance the technology toward mainstream, will be rewarded.  Zhao concludes:  ""Interestingly, it’s the real believers that make much more money.""    ––––––––––––––––––––––––    Original art by CryptoKitties (@cryptokitties)  Photos by CoinDesk & Wolfie Zhao",POSITIVE,BNB,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | BNB,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/cryptos-king-midas-backstage-with-cz-the-ceo-who-cant-be-stopped,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03d81fb84777bae6d6236e0c7015135181b9aa33-1720x861.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round, which is Bakkt's first, included 12 partners, according to a Medium post by CEO Kelly Loeffler. The crypto startup is owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is best known as the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  Investors in the funding round included Boston Consulting Group, Galaxy Digital, Goldfinch Partners, ICE, M12 (Microsoft's VC fund), Pantera Capital and Protocol Ventures.  Loeffler wrote:  ""We are focused on opportunities to provide new infrastructure, including the industry’s first institutional grade regulated exchange, clearing and warehousing services for physical delivery and storage.""  In a separate announcement Monday, Bakkt disclosed that its planned bitcoin futures market has been delayed again. CoinDesk had previously warned that such a delay was likely. It had been expected to launch on Jan. 24. A new date has not been announced.  Loeffler first announced Jan. 24 as the target launch date in a previous delay announcement issued in November.  The release ascribed the delay to consultation with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, estimating a new launch date should be announced early in the new year.  While these delays may engender impatience on the part of bitcoin holders who had hoped a new institutional-grade product could relieve some of the pain of crypto winter, today's fundraising announcement leans heavily on a message of patience.  Noting that the Bakkt team has been built from veterans of other new and nascent financial markets, Loeffler wrote, ""The path to developing new markets is rarely linear: progress tends to modulate between innovation, dismissal, reinvention and, finally, acceptance.""  Moving too soon, she notes, has its own dangers:  ""While access to information as technology innovation occurs is extremely valuable, the risk is a 'marking to market' of innovations before they have a chance to mature. Few innovations reached their full potential in their first decade of development.""  Bakkt declined to give additional comment.  ""Pantera is excited to support Bakkt in its journey to provided needed infrastructure for both institutional and retail investors,"" Pantera Capital partner Paul Veradittakit told CoinDesk.

42430060,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR05h,1546272056,"Bitcoin Exchange Paxful Sees 20% 2018 Growth, Driven by Africa","Regardless of bitcoin’s price volatility, 2018 saw an explosion of activity among African users.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange Paxful increased its transaction volume by 130 percent since January 2018 with an average of $21 million a week, compared to $8.5 million in 2017. The growth was driven in part by Paxful’s user base almost tripling in Ghana, with 41,243 accounts, and more than doubling in Nigeria to 321,476 accounts.  According to Paxful CEO Ray Youssef, African bitcoin traders accounted for 41 percent of all of the platform’s new users in 2018. On average, their transactions are worth less than $90 each. African users now make up roughly 35 percent of accounts on Paxful, a platform with 160,000 monthly users.  “Amazon, eBay, all these big companies won’t send there [Nigeria] because of the huge fraud rates,” Youssef said. “What [new users] want to know is: How can I use this to do business outside the area where I’m living?”  Paxful isn’t the only exchange platform benefiting from growing awareness of peer-to-peer finance in Africa. The rival P2P exchange LocalBitcoins also saw significantly more Nigerian usage in 2018, albeit without sudden peaks like the market boom brought in December 2017.  Indeed, according to a Google Trends tally of global internet searches for “bitcoin,” Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa were among the top five nations with the most interest in “bitcoin” throughout 2018.  Meanwhile in East Africa, Binance opened a subsidiary in Uganda and promptly signed up 40,000 users in its first week. Paxful’s East African audience is relatively small, with 4,289 accounts in Kenya and just 298 users in Rwanda, for example. So, Youssef said Paxful is looking to hire aggressively in 2019 and establish distinct offices on the ground in East Africa, West Africa and Southern Africa.  “We want to triple the size of the company,” he said of the 97-employee team with offices in Hong Kong, Estonia, Manila and New York. “The bottlenecks we’re dealing with now are trying to find the best people to help us.”  Throughout 2018, Paxful hired its first on-the-ground staffers in Venezuela, which Youssef worries might soon get added to the sanctions list of the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. In order to hedge their regulatory risks, the exchange will also dedicate an on-the-ground team to learning about African use cases in addition to Latin American expansions.  So far, the company has learned cross-border payments are a popular use case. Youssef said that many of the users in Ghana are actually expat-Nigerians using bitcoin to send remittances back home. Remittances are an enormous market in Nigeria, with the World Bank estimating the nation received remittances worth $22 billion in 2017.  Kevin James, the Nigerian-American head of operations at the bitcoin payments startup OpenNode with business connections in Ghana, told CoinDesk remittances and combating local inflation are two leading value propositions for bitcoin in Africa, adding:  “Ghanaians are very interested in bitcoin. … I see this year as net positive because of the development and the teams that are coming into the space.”  Growing awareness  Although many skeptics describe the current market as a “crypto winter,” the opposing argument is that the craze of late-2017 brought many newcomers into the space who aren’t deterred by volatility.  Such was the case with Usman Abiola, a Lagos-based product lead at the blockchain startup Ellcrys Network who bought his first bitcoin in early 2018 using a site called BuyCoin.  “I just wanted to understand how the wallet/exchange system worked,” Abiola said. “Bitcoin as a store of value is a key value that resonates well here. Also, its incredible cross-border use case is very viable. Cross-border remittance is a headache here.”  So far, Abiola is just experimenting. He’s heard of Paxful and said the market is ripe for any exchange willing to invest in educational outreach inside Nigeria. Luckily, that’s precisely what Youssef, Paxful’s CEO, has planned.  Youssef said Paxful will partner with schools and universities across Africa to improve educational resources, so that prospective users know what bitcoin is and how to manage their own personal wallets. They’ve already started by sponsoring two new schools in rural Rwanda, including the purchase of several tablets and mobile phones so that teachers will be able to directly manage bitcoin donations.  ""The huge challenge is educating the educators,"" Youssef said. “We want to build our next school in western Africa, preferably Nigeria. We are now looking for build partners on the ground.”  Speaking more broadly to the rampant growth in Nigeria, Youssef added:  “The Nigerian people have shown an business acumen and ability to mobilize around crypto that is inspiring and we see them as leading the world in true use cases of crypto.”  Market image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/31/bitcoin-exchange-paxful-sees-20-2018-growth-driven-by-africa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92044016f97c79006a87384dded7319ded80db60-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430086,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR09h,1546269326,Bitcoin's Next Halving Rally: Coming Soon in 2019,"Pascal Thellman is CMO at Bounty0x, a simple service for earning crypto, and an advisor at PolyGrowth, a crypto PR firm.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  2012 and 2016: What do they both have in common?  Bitcoin underwent what is referred to as the ""halving,"" where the yearly bitcoin inflation was algorithmically reduced by 50 percent. This is part of bitcoin’s deflationary monetary policy and why Austrian economists refer to bitcoin as ""hard money.""  If you look at the bitcoin price chart, you will notice that these two years have one more thing in common. The bitcoin price increased significantly the year leading up to the halving. Furthermore, the rally leading up to the halving was in both cases followed by a brutal parabolic move just a few weeks after the halving.  With the next bitcoin halving expected to happen in May 2020, the time has come for investors to start paying attention to this pattern. Historically, the halving starts getting priced in approximately one year before it happens, which would result in bitcoin bottoming out in early 2019 followed by a rally starting in May 2019.  But what if this time is different? It won’t be, let’s explore why.  Bitcoin, Gold and Hard Money  Gold is the oldest form of money in existence.  Unlike ancient money like cattle, seashells or salt, gold can be said to have a hard-coded economic policy: there is a finite gold supply, and only a small portion of the gold supply can be extracted on a yearly basis, effectively setting a cap on its inflation.  This inflation has historically been oscillating between 2 and 3 percent, and the entire global gold supply can fit within the confines of an Olympic Swimming Pool, thus making it a relatively scarce asset. The scarcity, combined with an established history and durability are some of the main factors why it has become the reserve asset of the world, ballooning its market capitalization to $7 trillion.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s inflation rate is ~3.8 percent, and it will be reduced to 1.8 percent in the third block reward halving somewhere around May 2020. This will make bitcoin the first asset in the world to become a harder form of money than Gold, while at the same time improving on all of the downsides of gold, mainly portability, divisibility and verifiability.  The brutal algorithmic deflationary model of bitcoin, coupled with its other advantages over gold, will start turning it into an interesting asset for large institutions and eventually central banks. As bitcoin’s deflationary curve becomes more aggressive after the 2020 halving, it will inevitably start evolving into an asset with all of the qualities that large institutions and central banks look for in a reserve asset.  Buy the Event  'Buy the rumor, sell the news' is decades-old Wall Street wisdom that works across all markets.  A particular event, like for example a hyped press conference by a public company, gives speculators a date to speculate on, often pushing up prices leading up to the event. After the event concludes, even if the event was positive, the price usually falls because there are no short-term price catalysts for speculators to look forward to.  Due to the inefficiency of cryptocurrency markets, this effect can be observed even stronger in bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices.  A beautiful example of this phenomena was the launch of bitcoin futures by the CME Group. The narrative in late 2017 was that the launch of regulated bitcoin futures would open the gates to institutional investors and elevate bitcoin to unprecedented highs. This narrative was one of the main catalysts that propelled bitcoin to nearly $20,000 at the end of the year.  However, as we know now, the launch of the CME bitcoin futures on December 17, marked the exact top of the 2017 bitcoin bubble.  As data of the last two bitcoin halving clearly shows, the same “Buy the rumor, sell the news” pattern can also be observed in the 12 months prior to the halving. In November 2011, one year prior to the first halving, bitcoin initiated a rally that ended the day of the halving after a 300 percent price increase.  Then again, in July 2015, one year prior to the second halving, bitcoin also started a rally that ended the day of the halving after a 178 percent price increase.  Like it or not, this is how markets work. Speculators will speculate leading up to an important date, the same will be true for bitcoin’s third halving.  Panic Buy the Fundamentals  Miners are currently earning 12.5 bitcoins per block, or approximately 1,800 bitcoins per day.  Although some miners hold a portion of their mined coins, most sell the coins immediately at market price to cover electricity costs and to lock their profit. After the halving in May 2020, miners will now only earn 900 bitcoins per day, reducing the daily bitcoin supply on the market drastically.  As decreasing supply meets constant (or increasing) demand after the halving, prices will inevitably rise to find equilibrium again. The combination of market inefficiency together with the supply reduction shock is what has caused two of bitcoin’s largest parabolic moves.  After the 2012 bitcoin halving, it took the market two months to start feeling the effect of the inflation halving and for bitcoin to initiate a parabolic move that propelled its price from $12 to $142. Interestingly, after the 2016 halving the market felt the inflation reduction even sooner, this time bitcoin started a rally that would bring it from $582 to $20,000 just one month after the halving.  With the third halving less than 18 months away, It’s time to start paying attention to bitcoin’s killer application again: algorithmically enforced monetary policy. The disruptive power of this monetary policy will start getting priced-in in 2019, and when it does, you want to be here.

42430062,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMR0Dh,1546233947,2018 Was the Reality Check. 2019 Starts the Crypto Comeback,"Micah Winkelspecht is CEO and founder of Gem, a crypto portfolio app company based in Los Angeles.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  If 2017 was the year of irrational exuberance, 2018 became the year of reality checks when the market sputtered and crashed. I predict that this year will see a return back to first principles as we rethink many of our assumptions about how this is all supposed to go down. The truth is, we just don’t know yet.  I also believe that 2019 will see the return of bitcoin dominance, although it may take a major world market downturn to spur it on.  As the global markets deflate, that will also bring down the price of bitcoin and keep them low because the deflation will cause investors to move out of perceived risky investments into more stable investments, and bitcoin is currently still considered a very risky investment.  But when governments begin to do helicopter drops of freshly printed money to try to recover their failing economies, that's when bitcoin will begin to be seen as something more akin to gold.  1. The Real Promise of ICOs  The crazy bull market of 2017 and early 2018 and the glorification of initial coin offerings (ICOs) had such a disorienting effect. We had a great migration away from the principles and values of a decentralized economy to a get-rich-quick scheme across the board.  People got really sucked in.  I believe that ICOs are actually very promising when done right. The most exciting and powerful thing we have learned from the success of Bitcoin is that crypto has the unique ability to align all stakeholders (users and investors alike) around a common mission through shared incentives and direct participation.  Crypto makes users feel invested in the success of a project, and it creates a powerful network effect. The challenge is that we’ve seen more speculators than actual users.  2. The First Breakout Killer App  This is the year we will make that difficult transition from speculation to use as the industry matures from adolescence into adulthood. And I don’t mean adoption for the sake of adoption but instead, real products delivering real value.  We will see the first proof point of a project, that breakout killer app where users are aligned within the token economy, so that they actually feel like they own a piece of the project. And I think that it will probably come from a place we didn’t expect, like gaming. I think we'll see a really interesting breakout dapp in games, like a Tamagotchi.  And then we'll see a couple more breakout successes out of it, because games really bridge the gap beyond just the technical users into a much larger class of early adopter users that span beyond this very insular technical crowd. They're already used to this idea of digital assets.  They're already spending hours and hours trying to collect digital goods. It’s a natural fit.  3. The Emergence of Stablecoins  We’ll start to see stable coins really bridging that gap to mass adoption.  We’ll see a class of Venmo style payment applications and other kinds of creative new financial products that leverage stable coins to counteract the perceived volatility problems that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have. It’s not necessarily the original vision of crypto, but it is a great gateway to getting people comfortable with digital assets, and the tools are the same.  So it will also have a very positive effect on the increased adoption of Bitcoin and other networks.  4. Finding a Middle Ground  We are reaching a bit of a hybridization point where projects are finding success in the middle ground, where they're not so much the Libertarian dream of total decentralization, and they’re also not the highly centralized systems that run the world today. And that’s ok, because neither of those extremes serve businesses or users very well.  But we are seeing an emergence of a hybrid with things like delegated proof-of-stake and Hashgraph which has a known set of validators and is more decentralized than a centralized system, but not as decentralized as a proof-of-work network like Bitcoin.  There are clear tradeoffs in these networks, but they have a good chance of success in reaching businesses who need to be able to scale, who need to have a dependable framework to work on and they’re decentralized enough for those needs.  So, I think EOS, HashGraph, or even Stellar can start to serve that need.  There's no clear winner here yet. And until there is a clear winner, it’s unlikely that you’ll see large organizations move serious money into the space. They'll dabble.  What Will it Take?  Something in this industry needs to drive the demand. You can have all the supply in the world, but if you don't have the demand, it's not going to get us anywhere.  I'm bearish on the short-term outlook for enterprise adoption of blockchain technology. For all of its potential (and there is incredible potential), most large companies would rather play innovation theater than invest serious capital in reinventing their businesses. Real change in the enterprise is a long game.  The exciting stuff that's going on right now is the innovation and competition that's happening on the public networks and on dapps.  People are trying a little bit of everything. And nobody has any idea what's going to work. And that's great because we'll find the answer much faster that way than waiting around for a Fortune 500 company to figure it out.  We're much more likely to discover use cases that we didn't even think about because of the permissionless nature of public blockchain systems and permissionless development.  Crypto gives us an open platform where anybody, anywhere around the world can write a program that will potentially change the world.  That is the ultimate dream of crypto.
