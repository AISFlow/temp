Further, the company claimed that ""ShipChain is not aware that SHIPs were even offered in South Carolina or to any South Carolinian during the private sale.""

Banco de Espana governor Luis Maria Linde discussed cryptocurrencies during a recent speech organized by auditing firm Deloitte, saying that they ""present more risks than benefits."" That being said, Linde believes that blockchain technology in general may improve efficiency and reduce costs, according to a local news report.  In his speech, Linde stated:  ""[Cryptocurrencies] have low acceptance as a means of payment, suffer extreme volatility, present multiple operational vulnerabilities and have been related to fraudulent or illicit activities in many cases.""  He referred to crypto tokens as ""those spurious novelties that do not provide significant improvements and that should be tackled as soon as possible,"" during his speech.  Blockchain technology, on the other hand, offers ""interesting possibilities"" and has the potential to reduce costs, he said. However, he indicated that the technology is ""still not quite mature.""  More broadly, Linde argued that digitization in the financial sector can signify ""great opportunities"" to increase the efficiency of financial services and meet users' demand, provided the technologies are ""well-used and managed.""  That said, he also warned that ""the move to a more digital economy is accompanied by greater cyber threats and it is necessary to develop new measures to protect processes, assets and customer data.""

Once operational, Hut 8 will own 57 BlockBoxes, representing a 335 percent increase from current mining capacity, securing our position as one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners in the world, with a total of 66.7 MW of power capacity and 448 PH/s. With this increase in BlockBoxes from 17 to 57, we expect that our daily mining production will increase significantly. We believe our City of Medicine Hat Facility will represent operational excellence and set a new global benchmark for industrial scale cryptocurrency mining operations.""  At existing costs, Hut 8 spends approximately $2,615 CAD per bitcoin mined, according to the report. However, due to bitcoin's dropping price, it is recording a loss of nearly $4 million CAD on its profit margin. Excluding depreciation, its gross profit is nearly $9 million, the company said.

In a blog post Tuesday, the antivirus software developer revealed that an innocuous Mac process called ""mshelper"" was being abused on infected machines to mine monero for an unknown attacker. Malwarebytes director of Mac and mobile Thomas Reed wrote that along with a combination of other malicious processes, mshelper utilized large amounts of central processing unit (CPU) power, but was ""not particularly dangerous"" to Macs.  ""Affected users saw their fans whirring out of control and a process named 'mshelper' gobbling up CPU time like Cookie Monster. Fortunately, this malware is not very sophisticated and is easy to remove,"" he wrote, adding:  ""The malware became public knowledge in a post on Apple’s discussion forums, where the “mshelper” process was found to be the culprit. Digging deeper, it was discovered that there were a couple other suspicious processes installed as well. We went searching and found copies of these files.""  There are three main components to the malware, he wrote: the dropper, which is a program which downloads the malware; the launcher, which installs and launches the malware; and the miner itself, which is based on XMRig, an open source monero miner.  Malwarebytes has not yet discovered what the dropper program is, but past examples include fake Adobe Flash Player installers and other downloaded software, Reed said.  However, it installs something called ""pplauncher,"" which installs the miner. Notably, it is written in Golang, which Reed says is an odd choice. He added that ""using this for what appears to be simple functionality is probably a sign that the person who created it is not particularly familiar with Macs.""  His final assessment is that the miner, while annoying, is not complicated, and can be easily removed. He noted that there are an increasing number of Mac cryptominers, saying ""  Mac cryptomining malware has been on the rise recently, just as in the Windows world. This malware follows other cryptominers for macOS ... I’d rather be infected with a cryptominer than some other kind of malware, but that doesn’t make it a good thing.""

Thyssenkrupp transferred 500,000 euros using R3's Corda platform through a EUR/PLN FX Forward deal, or a contract locking in an exchange rate between the euro and the Polish zloty at some point in the future. Because the blockchain used will store the entire transaction as a single immutable record, neither the corporation nor Commerzbank need to worry about transaction reconciliation, the news organization said.  That is because confirmation of the deal was sent immediately to Thyssenkrupp, according to the report. Future deals conducted on a blockchain will similarly be confirmed immediately, which will cut down on both delays and manual errors caused by the current reconciliation process.  Commerzbank manager Nikolaus Giesbert said in a statement that reconciliation is ""a major issue for banks"" when it comes to foreign exchange trading. He continued:  ""Significant resources are dedicated to resolving the issues that occur during the matching process.

In a release issued Thursday, MAS says it has cautioned the exchanges to seek authorization if trading digital tokens that are regulated under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA).  The authority states:  ""If the digital tokens constitute securities or futures contracts, the exchanges must immediately cease the trading of such digital tokens until they have been authorised as an approved exchange or recognised market operator by MAS.""  MAS has further cautioned an initial coin offering (ICO) issuer to cease selling its tokens in the country. It states that the project breached the SFA because the tokens – as they represent equity ownership in a firm – are considered securities.  The issuer has now ceased offering the token in Singapore and returned funds received from local investors, according to the statement.  There has been an increase in the number of digital token exchanges and digital token offerings in Singapore, according to Lee Boon Ngiap, assistant managing director at MAS.  ""If any digital token exchange, issuer or intermediary breaches our securities laws, MAS will take firm action,"" he said. ""The public should be aware that there is no regulatory safeguard if they choose to trade on unregulated digital token exchanges or invest in digital tokens that fall outside the remit of MAS’ rules.""

Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) announced on Thursday that it is working with Sberbank CIB, the bank's corporate and investment banking arm, to test an ICO issuance platform launched by the Bank of Russia – the country's central bank – in April.  According to an announcement, in the testing environment, a company named Level One will launch a token sale, for which Sberbank will act as the ""issuance coordinator and anchor investor."" The NSD, on the other hand, will serve as the custodian, recording and settling transactions, as well as safeguarding the assets.  The firms say the platform will ultimately provide transparency that would reduce risks for traditional investors in the token issuance process. It's hoped the test, along with feedback from the central bank, will help improve the platform before it can be scaled up for real-world use.  Igor Bulantsev, senior vice president of Sberbank and head of Sberbank CIB, said:  “Sberbank CIB considers the Russian ICO market to be very promising. Many Sberbank clients are interested in this type of investment, and we plan to promote this service proactively once the appropriate legislative framework comes into effect; we will be one of the drivers to institutionalize and popularize this type of transaction.”  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance have already resolved a disagreement over one draft bill covering ICOs, and the country has now slated in a summer deadline for introducing two relevant pieces of legislation.  Eddie Astanin, chairman of the executive board at the NSD, said the end goal of the project is to allow ""the emergence of a new type of asset for investors"" and the circulation of digital assets on the secondary market.

According to a report by Bloomberg on Thursday, citing anonymous sources familiar with the probe, the investigation is being conducted together with the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  One area of the investigation targets so-called spoofing – a technique that has been used in traditional financial markets to affect price movements by making large volumes of fake orders – that possibly influenced trades of bitcoin and ether, according to the report.  In addition, DoJ is probing crypto traders who may have cheated the system by sending themselves large volumes of orders to create a mirage of increasing demand in order to tip other investors into making a move.  The news marks the latest effort by U.S. authorities to ensure a fair cryptocurrency market since the CFTC gave the green light to domestic exchanges to list bitcoin-backed futures and derivative products late last year.  Today's report also comes just weeks after a commissioner from CFTC made comments on the agency's growing scrutiny over cryptocurrency activities that may have violated the law.

42401579,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd05mx,1527154236,Bitcoin Faces Drop to $7K as Bull Defense Crumbles,"Bitcoin (BTC) is trading on the defensive today, having dropped 16 percent over the last three days.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,270 on Bitfinex, down 6.5 percent in the last 24 hours, and could extend the slide further to $7,000 in the next 24 hours.  The cryptocurrency closed (as per UTC) at $7,494 yesterday – its lowest daily close since April 12 – and looked oversold as per the relative strength index (RSI) in the hourly and 4-hour chart.  A resulting corrective rally ran info offers above $7,700 earlier today and prices fell to a 6-week low of $7,352 at 08:30 UTC. The failure on the part of the bulls to produce a notable corrective rally despite oversold conditions indicates that bearish sentiment is currently strong.  Hourly chart  The downside break of the bear flag, a bearish continuation pattern, indicates the minor corrective rally from the low of $7,402 has ended and BTC could drop to $7,000 (target as per the measured height method).  The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are biased to the bears. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped close to the oversold region (30.00), but is holding well above the lows seen yesterday, indicating there is enough room for a drop to $7,000.  Daily chart  BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) in a convincing manner, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change. Note that a break below the 61.8 percent Fib is widely considered a final confirmation of a bearish trend reversal.  The chart also shows a bearish downside break of the falling channel, while the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, also in favor of the bears.  The relative strength index is holding below 50.00 – well above 30.00 (oversold zone), signaling scope for further losses.  View  BTC will likely find acceptance below the immediate support seen at $7,188 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement seen in the daily chart) and drop to the $7,000 mark in the next 24 hours.  By then, the RSI in the hourly and 4-hour chart will likely have dropped below 30.00, indicating oversold conditions, meaning BTC may defend the psychological support level of $7,000.  On the higher side, only a daily close above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $8,111, would abort the bearish view.  Only a daily close above $8,644 (May 21 high) would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

According to an announcement on Wednesday, the firm said it is launching the new B2 miner on June 6 with mass production to follow and shipment starting by the end of October.  The launch comes following a months-long testing period since the firm initially revealed it was researching and developing the new ASIC processor in September 2017. While the device should provide high-levels of hashing power with lower electricity demands, the firm said it will provide details of the B2's price and performance at the June launch.  According to the announcement, in addition to selling the B2 to other miners, GMO also plans to utilize the new product at its existing mining facilities.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the publicly listed Japanese firm made a notable leap into bitcoin mining business last year with a $90-million budget to back explorations in the space, including chip making and its own mining farms.  GMO's mining facilities have been up running since the end of 2017 and, as per a report released earlier this month, the firm has already mined 906 bitcoin and 537 bitcoin cash as of last month.  While the cost of production remains unknown, the total value of those mining rewards amounts to nearly $8 million based on the latest CoinDesk prices.  Meanwhile, GMO isn't the only one major tech firm planning to carve out a slice of the bitcoin mining industry by introducing more advanced mining chips. Notably, Samsung is also starting a ""risk production"" of 7nm chips in 2018, according to a report by CoinDesk in February.  In addition, GMO announced in October of last year that it would sell its bitcoin mining equipment in 2018 via an initial coin offering.

42401574,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd05h3,1527148839,Manufacturing and Blockchain: Prime Time Is Yet to Come,"Maja Vujinovic, a member of CoinDesk's advisory board, is the CEO of OGroup LLC and a former Chief Innovation Ofﬁcer of Emerging Tech & Future of Work at General Electric.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 event.      Since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, manufacturing has exponentially increased in volume and demand; supply chains have grown ever more complex, and industry has progressively required less direct manual labor.  To add even more complexity, we now have a need not only for supply chain management (SCM) but also for business process outsourcing, as well as for corporate social responsibility and sustainability. To succeed, one must continuously innovate and keep up with a rapid technological change.  One outcome of this radical uncertainty for businesses is that they face an increasingly wide and diverse cast of counterparties, which is forcing them to rethink their trust infrastructure. Existing, time-consuming approaches to compliance and on-boarding can't keep up.  Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, consensus-based approach to proving the veracity of each users claims and statements, offers a promising solution – with the added bonus that it might also foster a more equitable world. Manufacturers cannot depend on blockchains alone to make their operations more manageable -- no one technology or business model will singlehandedly solve these issues – but they should all be looking closely at their potential.  A challenging environment  If we applied the 20th-century logic of the corporate bottom line to the current outlook, it would seem bright, with population growth pushing the manufacturing industry into a constant quest for efficiency, reliability, seamlessness and speed. Some 27% of manufacturers across the globe estimate an increase in revenues of 10% or more per year in the next five years, according to Industry Week. Thirty percent of manufacturers expect revenue growth between 5 and 10%. The problem is that this growth comes with major challenges, especially in the face of resource shortages and environmental and efficiency imperatives.  Companies are catching on to the fact that their SCM must be anticipatory, adaptive, and environmentally aware to achieve business sustainability. And even then, there is still friction and waste from time lags, price arbitrage, and opacity. All these challenges must be solved within the context of an ever-widening array of possible business relationships as supply chains become increasingly complex in a dynamic, rapidly changing environment.  Businesses that can't adapt will be surpassed as their competitors deploy new tools, such as the Internet of things, predictive analytics, satellite data, and blockchain itself. These technologies drive efficiency but are also forcing transparency. And change is happening fast.  IHS forecasts, for example, that the IoT market will grow from an installed base of 15.4 billion devices in 2015 to 30.7 billion devices in 2020 and 75.4 billion in 2025. Fleet management in transportation, security and surveillance applications in government, inventory and warehouse management applications in retail and industrial asset management in primary manufacturing will be the hottest areas for IoT growth. All of this will require faster, more transparent processes and transactions throughout the supply chain.  Today, manufacturing companies are investing heavily in trusted supply chain networks, which involves on-boarding new suppliers through a laborious due-diligence and compliance process. They do this to meet some of the core needs in any manufacturing supply chain, including the responsiveness of chain partners to changing production needs, the traceability of goods and processes along the chain, surveillance of counterfeiting, and protection of IP and assets. In investing in these exclusive relationships, companies develop strong bonds of trust and centralized asset control based on individual enterprise solutions.  These relationships provide a sense of security, and yet that security is typically only as reliable as the firewall each partner has in place. As demonstrated by data breaches at Home Depot and JP Morgan, all firewalls are eventually hackable – both your own and those of your business partners – which means your business is still at risk. There's a dire need to find additional, comprehensive enterprise solutions to security, ones that go beyond simply building an ever bigger wall to keep the attackers out.  Blockchain technology seeks to address these problems via a common data architecture that lets non-trusting parties more securely share information. Blockchains are designed to permanently record transactions – not merely currency transactions but, importantly, also in exchanges of data – in such a way that the record cannot be tampered with. This stands in contrast to centralized databases, which can be altered after an entry has been made.  This unique design means that blockchains can enhance trust among organizations and add another layer of security and reliability to a supply chain's information system. By deferring questions of trust to a decentralized algorithm that no one party controls, they promise to both advance transparency along existing supply chains and allow for more fluid, dynamic supply chains in general. For producers and consumers alike, the gains could be manifest in improved traceability of goods and work processes and, ultimately, in greater efficiency and lower costs.  Blockchain's benefits  A much-discussed facet of blockchain-based SCM is that tamper-evident distributed ledgers can potentially improve traceability and establish the provenance of goods from start to finish. Tracking of the sourcing of raw materials, the countries of production, inspections, transit methods, duration and environmental factors can all be updated instantly to a blockchain that is transparent and trustworthy.  For the potential benefits consider just one problem facing the global economy: that of pirated goods, which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates account for nearly half a trillion dollars a year. In the automotive industry alone, it has been estimated that counterfeiting costs $12 billion dollars in lost sales annually, impacting up to 200,000 jobs. And in pharmaceuticals, there's an epidemic of drug overdoses that is in part attributed to counterfeited drugs.  But the potential benefits go beyond provenance. Blockchains may also become a vital enabling component of moves to enhance automation along supply chains, since they can directly help to automate the agreements upon which automated transactions will be based. Here the answer is likely to lie in blockchain-based ""smart contracts,"" which ensure that pre-agreed obligations can be executed in an entirely programmable manner.  Under a smart contract, all parties to an agreement can be satisfied that payouts are delivered legitimately without the adjudication of a time- and cost-consuming middleman. And since blockchain-secured smart contracts trigger transactions only after prescribed criteria are met by signatories to the agreement, they can mitigate the risk of relying upon other parties to deliver on their commitments.  In one example, the shipping company Maersk it testing a blockchain-based approach through a partnership with IBM to put all documents involved in bulk shipping into a single template based on workflow; this workflow is then triggered when a producer submits the packing list for whatever commodity or good is being delivered to the shipper.  As subsequent steps in the supply chain are sequentially completed, the documents are obtained and distributed, allowing all participants in the process to see what has been submitted, who submitted it, and when it was submitted. No one participant can alter a record without consensus from other parties on the network.  Another exciting supply-chain advantage of blockchains lies in how businesses can manage ever-more-valuable data. In today's 4th Industrial Revolution, where data is becoming the true gold, it will increasingly need to be exchanged in efficient and collaborative ways.  Much of it will be generated by automated devices, ensuring that the Internet of Things will need an accompanying ""Ledger of Things"" to keep track of machine-to-machine exchanges of valuable information. In other words, it will need a blockchain.  When information is protected through this secure, multiparty system, ""data collateralization"" is made possible, giving lenders and big companies the confidence to inject financing and other forms of liquidity into supply chains. This could in turn help smaller suppliers overcome their persistent working capital challenges.  In a related field, blockchain systems could also enhance predictive analytics, by which firms can collect data, model it, generate statistics, and then use those statistics to make data-driven business decisions. Since blockchains record each point in a process, they can provide verifiably accurate data to determine statistical patterns in anything from customer behavior to risk exposure.  When combined with rapid developments in IoT, this technology will eventually lead to full transactional autonomy for machines. They will manage their own digital wallets, loaded with cryptocurrency or specialized supply-chain tokens – something I got GE to do in a pilot during my tenure there.  Consider this scenario: A machine could run its own predictive analytics, conclude that a replacement part is needed by a certain time and then automatically place an order and pay for the part through a pre-established smart contract with a parts supplier. Imagine the cost and time savings that would afford.  Adoption? Not so easy  So far, much of the potential for blockchain solutions for SCM remains theoretical. The jury is still out on whether blockchain technology actually is the fix it promises. We're awaiting the results of pilots by IBM, Maersk, GE and others. Blockchain advocates talk enthusiastically about reducing waste, increasing efficiency and providing greater control over supply chains, all because the technology can boost business partners' capacity and willingness to share information.  Yet while SCM experts often decry the fact that supply chains are overly complex and inefficient, many companies tend to view the status quo as acceptable, repeating the mantra, ""If it's not broken, why fix it?"" In reality, the problem is that innovation is difficult for established players, especially when it threatens to disrupt existing work processes in which many jobs and incomes are connected.  So, regardless of what evidence the pilots provide, a challenge will continue to lie in enticing firms to use it. Several practical considerations will dictate how quickly companies adopt this technology and transform their processes. It is easier to implement blockchain for intangible goods then for material ones, for example. And for tangible goods, it's relatively easy to apply the technology's provenance-tracking where a single material – such as diamonds or fish – is being traced along a chain.  But as my colleagues and I discovered with GE's highly complex supply chains for large industrial assets such as airline engines and wind turbines, it's much harder to track the iterative delivery, processing and assembly of raw materials and parts into intermediate goods that eventually become finished products. Paradoxically, although a blockchain could make information-sharing much easier across such a complex set of actors, overcoming the trust challenges across so many parties makes it hard to implement the technology in the first place.  We should also note that blockchains, which depend upon multi-computer networks, are inherently slower than centralized databases. As such, some argue that a distributed ledger that feeds into a centralized database is all that is needed to maximize a supply chain. This overlooks the public verifiability, integrity and transparency that blockchain provides, but it also argues for nuanced decision-making around technology choices.  The bottom line is is that blockchains are best suited where robustness, disintermediation, security, proof of source, and proof of the chain of custody are priorities. If speed is a greater priority than any problem of mistrust in the database manager, a blockchain may not be the best fit, at least within the technology's current state of development.  Still, as the cryptographic layer advances, with new ""off-chain"" solutions such as the Lightning Network promising to greatly improve transaction speed, processing capacity and cost-effectiveness, and as new IoT solutions improve the security and speed of machine-to-machine communications, blockchain solutions will become increasingly more viable. And the more that big IT service providers such as IBM and Microsoft implement blockchain business solutions, the more scalable and necessary the technology will become.  Looking to the future  According to a recent report published by Tractica, enterprise applications of blockchain across the globe will see growth in annual revenue from $2.5 billion in 2016 to $19.9 billion in 2025.  Separately, A 2015 World Economic Forum Report stated that approximately 10 percent of GDP will be stored on blockchain technologies by 2025. Are these forecasts too optimistic? Too pessimistic? It is, of course, impossible to answer those questions in a multipolar world that makes it ever-harder to predict the future.  What we can say is that widespread adoption of blockchain ledgers could have widespread benefits for the global economy, especially if it helps establish new standards in trade and manufacturing.  We could achieve much higher levels of security protection for sensitive data, with a model that's superior to both firewalls and non-disclosure agreements. And, by extension, if we can create a more secure environment for communicating with each other, greater cross-business collaboration and engagement become possible, which accelerates innovation and opens up new business opportunities.  What's also certain is that there is an unprecedented speed of change in this and other technologies aimed at the manufacturing industry. The question for any company leader confronting this environment is: how to ignite urgency within their organization and incentivize their employees to be entrepreneurs within, so that they keep up with technological and business changes.  Customers today are requiring faster, safer delivery, consistency, security, reliability, accountability and quality and if not received, they will go somewhere else. Blockchains have significant potential to help businesses comply with those demands.

The order, first issued by the State Council on May 4 to provincial and municipal governments, addresses a variety of strategies required to continue the reformation of the Guangdong Pilot Free-Trade Zone.  One area of focus is to accelerate the development of financial technologies, which includes the expedition of ""developing and implementing blockchain applications under existing regulatory frameworks,"" the document states.  Authorized by the State Council in 2014, the Guangdong Free-Trade Zone is a designated region within China's Guangdong province that integrates with Hong Kong and Macau to build a more internationalized free market.  While the order does not contain fine detail on how and to what extent blockchain should be used in the free-trade zone, it is nonetheless notable as it marks the first time that the central government has pushed to scale up blockchain use in a top-level official document.  Currently, according to data released by China's Ministry of Information and Technology this week, the Guangdong province has 71 blockchain startups, a number that accounts for 16 percent of industry players in China.  Yet this isn't the first time that the blockchain has been brought up in China's central government documents.  In 2016, the State Council introduced the concept of blockchain as part of an information technology reformation strategy in the country's 13th five-year economic development plan from 2016 to 2020.  That official order saw blockchain initially mentioned as one of the many emerging technologies that should be taken into consideration as part of the economic reform.

42380697,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8z5r5,1527134516,Bet vs. Buy? The ICO Market Has a Serious East-West Divide,"In the U.S., initial coin offerings (ICOs) are about ideas. In the Asian market, they're about returns.  ""At the very beginning, the information coming from Asia to the US was very limited. We didn't know what's really going on,"" Zhuling Chen, co-founder of Aelf, a cloud computing startup out of Singapore, told CoinDesk.  So the Asian market took off on its own, informed by the ecosystems around bitcoin and ethereum but also distinct from them, such as when major Asian banks launched distinct efforts starting in early 2016. Some of the differences between the two markets became clearer as CoinDesk spoke to investors and entrepreneurs during Blockchain Week in New York City.  If one common theme ran through our conversations about Asia, it was this: retail and institutional investors all want returns to realize much more quickly than investors do in the U.S., which may help explain why it has always had a vigorous ecosystem of exchanges.  Said more frankly, Jason Fang, managing partner at Sora Ventures, put it this way during a panel at Token Summit III: ""Asians love to gamble.""  As he told CoinDesk, they don't want long lockup periods like so many Western projects expect. Instead, they want to see tokens get released, listed and realize some of the gains that come from retail investors and market makers buying into a new coin.  Investors in Asia move fast into getting coins listed and sell them as they go up, because they know there is going to be an uptick after listing as market makers enter new tokens, but his firm avoids exiting to fiat.  ""We're money in, money out in crypto,"" he said.  But Fang wasn't alone in saying Asian investors want a good shot at a quick return.  Ricky Li, a co-founder of the new blockchain asset management company Altonomy (and an alum of one of the largest crypto funds in Asia, FBG Capital) agreed. He told CoinDesk that one of the Asian market's problems is a tendency for investors not to diversify their portfolios over time.  ""U.S. and Europe ICO project teams are more well invested in terms of financial knowledge,"" Li told CoinDesk. Chinese companies and their neighbors will raise funds in ether and largely maintain those positions, sometimes failing to lock in gain or riding volatility through their whole portfolio, he said.  His company helps funds adjust their portfolios so that if there's a massive loss in one asset it doesn't threaten their solvency.  Entrepreneurs also illuminated other facets of the East-West divide in crypto, such as why Asian projects mirror Western protocols and the China ICO ban. Still, there was a strong willingness for both camps to find common ground.  Nick Tomaino, of VC firm 1confirmation, told Token Summit attendees:  ""It could be argued that Asia is kind of the most important part of the world in terms of cryptocurrency.""  Local technology  Language helps to explain another point of relativity in the crypto space: the fact that the market has copied existing protocols from the U.S. market that could theoretically work everywhere.  During the panel, Fang argued that as buzz grew around ethereum, there wasn't documentation for the software in languages like Chinese or Korean. So, Asian-facing protocols launched and now they have strong communities built around them.  Community is key to all these early efforts and localizing can help some projects get there.  ""The best way is to have your own project that's local,"" Li concurred. ""That's very appealing to investors in China culturally.""  In China, the web has history of localization. The state banned the Western internet which enabled the Chinese entrepreneurs to create a mobile business that largely started out by imitating Western products that were a proven success.  Now, though, with the Chinese ban on ICOs, Chinese firms have been forced to take a different approach.  ""There's no domestic market in China so all the companies learned to do globalization,"" Chen explained. He called it something of a mixed benefit of the ban.  But still the companies remain focused on business results.  ""The whole thing about tokenization, is you create incentives,"" Li explained. In other words, a project raises money to do its work. It has those funds to support its staff and an incentive to deliver a product that people want to use so the tokens price will rise again after that first sell-off, as people start to use it. ""I wouldn't call the shorter turnaround necessarily a bad thing,"" he said.  What it does mean, he granted, is more ""paper projects"" in Asia and more work for those interested in ICOs to discern which ones are real and which aren't.  Fang agreed that shorter horizons can still work over time. ""It will always be relative, not absolute,"" he said. Plus, Asian tech companies are less hesitant about getting into tokens. Multiple Asian investors told us they liked ""reverse ICOs,"" where existing tech companies sell a token.  And sometimes entrepreneurs in one country will launch a localized version of another country's creation for more structural reason. Abhishek Pitti, founder of Nucleus Vision, a $40 million ICO out of India that's making what he called the ""Neo of India"" explained that it localized for a more structural reason.  ""The Indian government doesn't want to use any international protocols for security purposes,"" he said.  New markets abroad  At a certain point, though, a mature project has to expand beyond the geography where it originated, and that reality is part of what brought so many entrepreneurs to New York for Blockchain Week.  ""The most important thing to us is trying to hire the most talented guy you can find,"" Chen said. Beijing he said, is strong on entrepreneurs, but needs other skills, particularly good cryptographers. ""Most of them, I think they are in the U.S.,"" he said on the panel.  ""The general view is that a lot of American companies are pushing the boundaries of technological advancement,"" Chen said. ""In China, it's slightly more balanced. More companies are looking from a business point of view.""  Fang summed up the West more succinctly: ""I think right now people are betting on professors.""  Plus the U.S. has a giant pool of liquidity. ""It's about the community engagement,"" Li argued. ""If they want a project to be successful, you have to be global. Even NEO is very well received globally.""  Pitti made the same argument for India, saying that blockchain is still basically unknown there. If Asian capital comes online, it will be another massive pool of liquidity to stabilize the industry with. Still, there's even more liquidity in the U.S., so more firms seem to be expanding here first.  But it's not the only place. From the panel, Vansa Chatikavanij, managing director of OmiseGo, said her firm's mission is to smooth financial frictions, which makes the West a lower priority. She specifically mentioned Vietnam as an opportunity, for example.  She said, ""We are providing a wallet SDK as part of our solution. What we need local partners to do is actually implement it themselves,"" because of national laws about money transmission.  But everyone is looking for users, wherever they can best be found; it's a numbers game, Li explained:  ""The retail customer is key to the success of the project. The key to the pricing. The key to opinion.""  ""The Asian Crypto Landscape"" panel at Token Summit III in NYC.

42380690,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8z5kn,1527129041,UN Division Looks to IOTA Ledger Tech for Higher Efficiency,"The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) is teaming up with the IOTA Foundation to see how the project's distributed ledger technology can help the UN streamline its workflows.  The UNOPS announced the partnership on Tuesday, saying the two organizations are looking into increasing the operation efficiency of the UN office using IOTA's tangle technology.  The startup notably does not use a blockchain the way networks like bitcoin and ethereum do - yet this is one reason the UN division chose to work with the foundation, said UNOPS special advisor on blockchain technology Yoshiyuki Yamamoto.  He told CoinDesk that IOTA's distributed ledger in particular ""can be operated on battery power or alternative connectivity networks,"" which can be extremely useful in areas with ""sporadic access to high-speed internet connections or even electricity.""  Further, IOTA's ledger is easily compatible with Internet of Things devices, which do not have high computing requirements.  That being said, the partnership is largely about learning how IOTA and the UNOPS can best utilize the technology, Yamamoto said, adding:  ""We are working with the IOTA Foundation to identify the most appropriate use cases for the first [proof-of-concept], to help address some of the challenges that UN as a whole faces when working in the field. It’s very much a collaborative process.""  ""As we identify gaps in the proposed test solution or additional elements that need to be added, we’ll work together with IOTA to identify and involve suitable other partners as well,"" he continued.  Because the collaboration is educational in nature, Yamamoto could not predict how long it might take to move from a pilot phase to fully implementing IOTA's technology.  ""It depends entirely on the complexity of the problem being tackled and how many different parts the solution entails need to be integrated: hardware, software, user experience, etc. It is difficult to know in advance what the sticking points will be,"" he told CoinDesk.  Nor is IOTA the only technology that UNOPS is working with. Yamamoto noted that the organization has already started working with ""a number of start-ups and incubators from across the DLT spectrum"" and continues to look for better solutions.  He also noted that the UN sees the technology as promising, saying the entity would not experiment with the tech if its members did not see real-world use cases.  ""We don’t do blockchain for blockchain’s sake. We have limited resources and personnel, so we have to focus our efforts on solving real-world challenges. Our priorities stem from our mission as an organization, not from the fads of the crypto space,"" he concluded.
