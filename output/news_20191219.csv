According to a letter written by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jessica Fender and Sheb Swett on behalf of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, ""it is anticipated that defendant Reginald Fowler will enter a change of plea at the next court conference.""      U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter, who is overseeing the case in the Southern District of New York, endorsed the letter on Thursday, canceling a hearing set for Jan. 8, 2020 and setting one for Jan. 10, 2020.      Fowler, one of the alleged co-founders of payment processor Crypto Capital, was indicted and arrested earlier this year on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and operation of an unlicensed money transmission business, alongside Israeli national Ravid Yosef. According to an indictment, the pair opened bank accounts at various financial institutions to store funds on behalf of cryptocurrency exchanges, but told the banks they would process real estate transactions.      While Yosef was also charged, she has not yet been arrested.      Fowler pled ""not guilty"" to all four charges during a hearing in June 2019.    Crypto Capital    Crypto Capital is otherwise known as the payment processor used by Bitfinex, QuadrigaCX, CEX.io and other exchanges in the past, after these firms had difficulty securing banking services.      Bitfinex famously stored close to $1 billion with Crypto Capital, which it lost access to after the company's bank accounts were frozen by law enforcement authorities in multiple countries.      All told, Bitfinex lost $850 million, as revealed by the New York Attorney General's office in an ongoing inquiry begun in April.      Bitfinex filed for a subpoena to depose individuals associated with Crypto Capital in an effort to regain its funds.      According to the subpoena, Bitfinex was unaware that Fowler had opened the bank accounts holding its funds in his name, rather than Crypto Capital's.

Announced Thursday in a press release, the addition will utilize Britain's Faster Payments Service (FPS) to let Blockchain.com’s U.K.-based users buy cryptocurrencies almost instantly.      The company framed its dual announcement as a bet on Britain at a tenuous time. With Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s recent landslide victory all but ensuring Brexit by Jan. 31, the nation is streaming towards an uncertain future.      That uncertainty, Blockchain.com said in the release, coincides with a surge in British interest in its site.      ""As the country we've called home for almost a decade undergoes considerable changes, it's imperative for us to provide the British people – our friends and families, co-workers and countrymen – new options to insulate their financial futures from the political scuffles that have destabilized the country's economy,” Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO, said in a statement.    Faster payments    Blockchain.com Executive Vice President of Product Xen Baynham-Herd did not provide details around FPS, a U.K. banking initiative that drastically reduced settlement times between member banks. Asked which bank Blockchain.com was utilizing, he declined to answer.      “We partner with multiple banks, but cannot disclose which,” he told CoinDesk.      Other cryptocurrency exchanges with UK customers have also turned to FPS over recent years. But those partnerships between traditional banks and sometimes global exchanges have had mixed success.      In 2015, Swedish crypto exchange Safello lost its FPS access after an undisclosed partner bank severed ties – just six weeks after the service launched. Safello was unable to set up ties with other banks.      More recently, Coinbase, one of only four exchanges who now have FPS access, temporarily disabled FPS service. Its institutional banking partner, Barclays, had pulled the plug too. (Coinbase now banks with the U.K.'s ClearBank).      Though it is not clear which banks Blockchain.com has partnered with, Baynham-Herd said the FPS service is already gaining traction among sterling-centric users.      “We’re already seeing GBP deposits come through and clear in minutes via FPS,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/19/blockchaincoms-new-gbp-gateway-creates-a-crypto-hedge-against-brexit-uncertainty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f3718da0b28939cf33c2a268c53de4753e8a686-1155x710.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Thursday by the Maker Foundation, the $27.5 million raised will fund the foundation's efforts to promote dai adoption in China and the broader Asia region. It's expected Dragonfly and Paradigm, who already have a strong presence in the region, will advise on the expansion.      ""Dai continues to be the stablecoin of choice in all global markets for its decentralization and overall stability,"" said Rune Christensen, CEO of the Maker Foundation, in a statement. ""The support and expertise of Dragonfly Partners and Paradigm will give Dai an unparalleled advantage in driving innovation and adoption in Asia.""      The joint purchase means Dragonfly and Paradigm now control approximately 5.5 percent of the total MKR token supply. Combined, the acquisition makes Dragonfly and Paradigm the second-largest private holder of MKR tokens. VC firm Andreessen Horowitz remains the single largest private holder with the 6 percent stake it acquired in September 2018.      Dragonfly and Paradigm intend to play an active role in maker's onchain governance. This will include participating in executive votes – the process that approves proposals that determine the ecosystem's direction.      Stakeholders recently participated in one such vote to ratify the Foundation's multi-collateral dai proposal in mid-November before it could be implemented.      Both Dragonfly and Paradigm will operate their own stakes independently of one another. It is uncertain yet whether one VC has acquired a larger share of maker tokens than the other. A Foundation spokesperson declined to comment.      The price of MKR jumped 3 percent on the announcement, according to data from CoinMarketCap.      The MakerDAO ecosystem is the market leader in decentralized finance. Nearly $320 million worth of assets are already locked in dai smart contracts, according to DeFi Pulse. In comparison, the second-largest protocol, derivatives provider Synthetix, currently has just under $168 million locked in smart contracts.      In a statement, Dragonfly Capital managing partner Alexander Pack said, ""Asia is the most important market for crypto in general. It is also home to the largest concentration of the unbanked and underbanked around the globe, which we believe represents an enormous pent-up demand for decentralized financial products.""      Both VCs focus on investing in the cryptocurrency space. Dragonfly participated in the seed round for ethereum scaling solution Matter Labs.

Levine:      On Today’s episode, it’s Bitcoin’s BIg Bounce, DEX’s and CEX’s, and a look at our Most Influential of 2019 list.      Adam B. Levine: It’s December 19, 2019, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here At Coindesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      Adam: We kick things off with Brad, who’s been watching the action in the overnights.      (MARKET UPDATE) SEGMENT 1      Brad Keoun: December is often a key month in the bitcoin market - it was Dec 2017 when BTC reached its all-time-high of $20k, and it was in Dec of last year that the market bottomed at $3000.      For the past couple weeks, bitcoin’s price charts have been sending bearish signals, with the market trending lower      Piling on, Arcane Research of Norway wrote that the market was registering ""extreme fear""      But then on Wednesday, the price suddenly jumped more than $600 for a 10% gain, the most seen in two months      Today, the bitcoin price appears to be down just a touch, currently around $7200      CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole writes that Wednesday’s spike has neutralized the immediate bearish case, in terms of the signals from price charts, but bitcoin would have to jump another $770 to pass $7,780 to confirm the start of a bullish trend      Adam: Turning to the news, there continues to be a stream of negative pronouncements about digital assets emanating from U.S. officials and regulators      U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard warned Wednesday in a speech that the Facebook-led Libra project has a “core set of legal and regulatory challenges” ahead.      She said more clarity is needed about the basket of currencies underlying the stablecoin and that its model is still unproven.      And Internet startup Blockchain of Things Inc. (BCOT) agreed to pay $250,000 to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for launching an initial coin offering without registering the token as a security with the regulator.      Brad: Even so, the traditional financial industry continues to show keen interest in blockchain technology      Accounting multinational EY on Thursday released new code that it claims can reduces the cost of transacting on the ethereum blockchain by as much as 90 percent, by batching multiple transfers into a single transaction      Adam:Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, a key player in Wall Street’s clearing of bond trades, predicts digital assets will have a big year in 2020      Mike Bodson, the company’s CEO, says next year will be QUOTE dominated by the impact of geopolitical events, digitization and tokenized securities END-QUOTE      And an executive with Fidelity, the money management giant, envisions a future where cryptocurrency custodians will work behind the scenes, whitelabeling services in the way that supermarkets put brands on generic food packaging      Brad: Finally, CoinDesk reports that the privacy coin Monero’s lead maintainer is stepping down after five years at the helm      Riccardo Spagni, better known by his alias “Fluffypony,” plans to continue his association with Monero but will turn the day-to-day leadership over to a longtime contributor to the community      Spagni’s other business ventures include no fewer than three crypto startups, and he told CoinDesk more than a year ago that the monero leadership left him feeling exhausted      Spagni says he’s making the change now to QUOTE better streamline developments and collaborations END QUOTE      Adam: For today’s featured story, we’re joined again by CoinDesk’s Markets Reporter Sebestian Sinclair for a look into Centralized, and Decentralized exchange       Sebastian Sinclair: Thanks Adam…      For the first time in history, cryptocurrencies allow us to control our assets without having to rely on third parties such as banks or brokers.      This has been achieved through blockchain technology, offering participants a way to tap into decentralized networks via peer to peer connections.      However, despite this new tech, nearly 99 percent of crypto trading takes place on centralized exchanges, which seems at odds with the new era of digital money that should be utilizing blockchain’s trustless capabilities.      Centralized exchanges have a lot of advantages, they're fast, cheap and in some ways quite private. On the other hand, to get those benefits, traders must give their tokens TO the exchange, and trust that they'll not only be honest, but resistant to the sectors notorious if not ubiquitous exchange thefts.      It's easy to see that even without downplaying the advantages, the disadvantages should give any trader pause.      After all, mistrust in middlemen, ie banks, brokers and centralized exchanges, is essentially what led to the success of blockchain tech in the first place.      History has shown us that placing our faith in these middlemen tends to be unwise and one consistently runs the risk of having funds stolen, such as what occurred this year as CoinDesk previously reported, up to 7 different exchange hacks valued at over $157 million US dollars were siphoned off.      Adam: So what’s the solution then?      Sebastian: Well, this is where decentralized exchanges come in.      Decentralized exchanges can circumvent the issues of custody by building its infrastructure on the blockchain with the use of smart contracts to coordinate trades from a users’ own wallet. These smart contracts must be implemented correctly with appropriate withdrawal controls, but ultimately a decentralized exchange should never require a user to give up control of their assets.       Adam: Decentralized exchanges must have a downside?       Sebastian: Of course, decentralized exchanges face their own inherent problems. Blockchains are generally slow by nature, reducing the number of possible trades per second thereby limiting volume and liquidity. What’s more, decentralized exchanges generally result in unfriendly user interfaces that are based around block explorers such as etherscan making it difficult for new users in the space to pick up and understand right away.      Adam: So what’s out there and what’s worth using?      Sebastian: Well, Binance for example, opened its decentralized exchange to the public back in April this year while OKEx, another major exchange, announced plans way back in March, but still has plans in the works. From my research, most decentralized exchanges lack the liquidity and volume I previously mentioned. More work needs to be done to attract traders away from the centralized model to a decentralized one in order for them to function optimally and as intended.      While the solutions to custody continue to be hashed out (pun intended) there are still a ways to go before users can begin experiencing the same user-friendly interactions, liquidity and volume they get from a centralized exchange. But we need to start looking into blockchain tech as a solution to these issues of centralized custody, otherwise, what are we all doing here?      Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re giving you the rundown of what has become an annual CoinDesk tradition - the Most Influential people in the crypto industry of 2019      Brad: That’s right, Adam -- we’re getting closer to the end of the year and that means it’s time for the Most Influential list, a project that’s led by CoinDesk Features Editor Ben Schiller but features some incredible profiles written by CoinDesk staffers      The list highlights people who have had a big year, made significant contributions to the industry in 2019 or simply even been at the center of a big story. I picked a few of the most fascinating.      Brad: First on the list isJACK DORSEY - Twitter's co-founder, who emerged as bitcoin's biggest ally in Silicon Valley. Dorsey invested heavily in the networks' future, and says he hopes one day that the interent will have a native currency, and he hopes that will be bitcoin      Next is Caitlin Long, a former Morgan Stanley banker who has established Wyoming as the most crypto-friendly jurisdiction in the nation. She's helped pass a series of bills designed to attract crypto startups to her home state.      Andrew Yang, the presidential candidate, came from nowhere to be a top-tier presidential candidate, with his brand of sophisticated tech-bro intelligence and ideas like basic universal income. More to the point, Yang is the only Democratic contender with a fleshed-out crypto policy,      David Marcus - the French-born co-founder of Libra, the Facebook stablecoin project, became the face of the effort as he went to Washington to testify in high-profile hearings, where he experienced backlash from lawmakers and U.S. regulators. With big corporate partners like Mastercard peeling away from the effort earlier this year, the big question is whether he can convince Americans to trust Facebook with the future of money      Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, testified in Washington in July that while Facebook’s Libra was getting all the attention, it was bitcoin that should be getting the attention, with its track record of more than a decade, saying that the world’s largest and oldest cryptocurrency had already been tested      Ted Livingston - founder of the messaging app Kik Interactive, which was accused by the SEC of running an illegal securities offering when it sold digital tokens in 2017. He’s attracted notoriety and attention, along with some support from the crypto industry, for pushing back against the regulator      Gerald Cotten, former CEO of the now-defunct QuadrigaCX exchange, wasn’t even alive during 2019, if you believe his death report out of India from December 2018, but he was at the center of controversy from creditors who say he might not have actually died, and they’re now asking for his body to be exhumed      But wait, there’s meow. The last on the list is Hodlonaut, who publicly is a cat in an astronaut costume who emerged on Crypto Twitter as a folk hero representing the freedom to speak the truth and maintain one’s own privacy, challenging, among others, Bitcoin SV backer Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin. Hodlonaut became one of the biggest memes of the year in the crypto industry.

Tor Bair is the Head of Growth for Enigma, an open-source, decentralized protocol for secure computation that allows smart contracts to use private, encrypted data as inputs.      After a dizzying year for our industry – one full of twists, turns, and tumult – it’s time to get our bearings and see where we stand. Has the acceptance and adoption of blockchains and digital currencies leapt forward, or have we taken a giant step back? Have we reached a new level of technological and cultural understanding, or are we more confused than ever? Is our industry finally overcoming critical technical challenges, or are we at risk of completely losing our way?      If you’re feeling like the pace of news in 2019 has given you whiplash, you’re not alone. Depending on who you are and what you believe, the same developments might lead you to very different conclusions. Is a project like Facebook’s Libra a massive validation of the value of its underlying technologies, or is it an alarm bell that is still ringing in regulators’ ears? As central banks embrace development of their own digital currencies, does that mean permissionless alternatives are gaining relevance or facing extinction?      If we’re going to find answers, we need to reorient the conversation – and ourselves. With all these swirling questions, there’s only one that truly matters: are we closer to solving real problems for real people? Or are we only making things worse?      To help us answer this, we need to focus on one problem at a time. I want to focus on perhaps the largest problem facing our world: the privacy crisis.      At first, the relationship between privacy, decentralization, and digital currencies may be unclear. But as you will see, these ideas are deeply linked in relation to our current global economic model of surveillance capitalism. We are standing at a critical tipping point in human history, and blockchains and decentralized networks will have a critical role to play in the near future. If we don’t tread cautiously, we will fall into the abyss.    The Existential Threat to Privacy    Privacy is rarely top of mind for most of us. Like many long-running crises, the privacy crisis doesn’t always make daily headlines. Mark Zuckerberg’s frequent testimony before Congress has given way to impeachment hearings. Breathless reporting of data breaches has abated somewhat, even though the breaches themselves continue at the same rapid pace. The privacy crisis is like a distant war – severe consequences for many, expensive and destructive, but often just far enough out of view to be forgotten.      Things didn't have to reach this stage of urgency. Decades of weak regulation allowed tech industry leaders to “move fast and break things,” inevitably leaving those same things broken as the companies continued sprinting by. In the race to capture users and new markets, privacy and security have been afterthoughts.      We should not be surprised. As technologist Bruce Schneier remarks in his recent book, Click Here to Kill Everybody, “everyone favors insecurity.” Companies want more data. Governments want more control. Criminals want more money. And it turns out that carelessly hyper-connecting systems and people is the surest way to create all kinds of vulnerabilities – for our privacy, for our internet, and even for our democracies. (Facebook, of course, now threatens all three.)      And with everything from phones to toasters becoming a connected computer, security risks are rapidly increasing. It’s one thing to accidentally give Google access to your contact list. It’s another when a nuclear power plant is hacked or a hospital is shut down. As Schneier warns: “There is a fundamental difference between crashing your computer and losing your spreadsheet data, and crashing your pacemaker and losing your life.”      This is why we face an existential crisis. Not just because Cambridge Analytica knows our favorite television shows, but because of a lack of substantial regulation and a paucity of caution from corporations have created all manners of critical vulnerabilities that now threaten the stability of our world – from our economy to our governments.      Once you know where and how to look, the pattern behind these vulnerabilities is obvious: they all resulted from the systematic creation of single points of failure and control.During the 2008 financial crisis, these were the banks that were “too big to fail” (but failed anyway, save for massive bailouts at taxpayer expense). In the context of data privacy, these are the insecure data silos at organizations like Equifax or Marriott that were breached, compromising millions of people’s sensitive information. In the broader tech industry, these are the multi-billion user companies like Facebook or Google who have wielded an inconceivable amount of power while bearing very little responsibility. We’re just beginning to comprehend what that might cost.      These risks – and these failures – have been the result of over-centralization. Centralization is defined as “the concentration of control of an activity or organization under a single authority.” In our primarily capitalist world, the pressure for companies or individuals to concentrate power, wealth, access, and control is enormous. And while this has created impressive value, with the rise of the internet, the ability of single entities to accumulate power has become truly unprecedented. Everything now plugs into everything, all the time. For the companies (or governments) controlling our information and communication, that means nothing is off-limits or out of reach. The resulting economic system has been termed the surveillance economy – and it has massive consequences for the people who rely on that system.    Resisting the Surveillance Economy    Once you understand the surveillance economy and its insatiable demand for more data and control, it is very difficult to unsee. And through this lens, we can see how many developments in 2019 are more terrifying than they might otherwise appear.      On the surface, Libra may seem like a positive development for blockchain and digital currencies. Bringing together some of the world’s largest companies and institutions to support a borderless economic system could create significant value for individuals and businesses. But looking at what Libra means for the privacy crisis, we do not see a solution. Instead, we see an existential threat to user privacy – and an example of Facebook’s well-documented anti-competitive behavior that would perpetuate and extend their role in the surveillance economy. As I noted before the announcement of Libra, “Facebook’s future use of decentralized technologies may just be ‘security theater’ – supposedly for the benefit of users, but instead further cementing Facebook’s centralized control.”    Looking at what Libra means for the privacy crisis, we do not see a solution.    Similarly, the announcement of China’s push to establish a government-backed digital currency – and the expectation of other governments following suit – could be seen as a validation of existing cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But as China simultaneously cracks down on the cryptocurrency industry, including exchanges and mining, it’s clear this conclusion is backwards. Governments, just like Facebook, primarily see digital currencies and blockchain as an opportunity to extend their control and surveillance of data, commerce, and people. China, obviously, is no exception. Of course, corporations and the governments who attempt to regulate them are often at odds themselves – but when it comes to protecting the privacy of individuals, neither is incentivized to care much at all.            Let’s return for a moment to the 2008 financial crisis. Again, this was caused by the creation of single points of failure within the global economy. Bitcoin was originally proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in reaction to this crisis – a decentralized solution to a problem caused by over-centralization. His (her?) vision was to use decentralized technologies to create a more sustainable and secure financial system – one that worked better for the individuals transacting within it, not just over-leveraged institutions. Bitcoin was not a “solution searching for a problem.” It was deliberately designed.      Fast forward a decade, and the problem has only grown. Negative interest rates have become the new normal. Global debt is surging. And despite the growth in the market capitalization of digital currencies, not much has been done to solve the underlying problems of over-centralization that contribute to the fragility of the global economy. Stopping to celebrate the growth of awareness and price appreciation is a dangerous temptation, but one we must resist to stay focused on the true purpose of decentralized technologies – to solve the problems and patch the existential vulnerabilities caused by over-centralization.      This means decentralized technologies can and should play a role in mitigating the privacy crisis. But we’re definitely not there yet. Blockchains are facing their own privacy crisis, since their nature is to be public and auditable. That’s one reason why the technology has been co-opted by corporations and governments as a tool of surveillance and oppression. And if we’re not careful, that’s all blockchain will be remembered for: perfecting the surveillance economy. In 2019, the signs are already there.      So, instead of figuring out what the past year has meant, let’s think about what 2020 needs to mean. We must keep our focus on how we build decentralized technologies and networks that solve the real problems the world faces. We must keep our focus on preserving privacy and censorship resistance as we pursue mass adoption. And we must keep our focus on creating the world we truly wish to live in - not the one we hope might make us rich.

42403722,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgapi,1576771200,James Ferguson on Decentralized Gaming’s Next Moves,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. James Ferguson is CEO of Immutable, the creators of Gods Unchained.      Growing up, CEO of Immutable James Ferguson’s favorite game was Runescape (a fantasy game). He said he found ways to run arbitration schemes in the MMORPG's medieval economy and amassed a horde of virtual gold. After spending thousands of hours on game play, however, he realized his new-found wealth couldn’t be traded outside the game ecosystem.      It was this experience of investing time and effort without being able to fully reap the economics rewards that spurred Ferguson to decentralized game development. His studio’s creation, God’s Unchained, uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as game pieces appended to the ethereum blockchain to ensure players maintain ownership. Described as Magic: The Gathering meets Hearthstone, the fantasy-themed cards have real-world value.      In 2018, one of these NFT’s sold at auction for 146 ether, worth more than $60,000 at the time. This year, Immutable raised $15 million from investors including Naspers Ventures and Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital EOS VC Fund.      Ferguson emailed his thoughts on what it's like running a decentralized game studio as well as the crypto industry in 2019.      Why do you think investor interest sparked for crypto games and NFT this year?      There’s a compelling argument that gaming will be the first vertical within the crypto industry which achieves mainstream adoption. Gamers have historically been first-adopters, and they are accustomed to interacting and valuing digital assets. We're reaching a state where blockchain games like Gods Unchained are compelling for their gameplay alone, with expert teams from the games industry and veterans like Chris Clay, taking the games to new heights. Crypto simply allows new mechanics and forms of ownership to exist, such as ownership of the cards in Gods Unchained. With more of these examples popping up, crypto gaming has begun to separate away from the noise and prove product-market fit.    There’s a compelling argument that gaming will be the first vertical within the crypto industry.    What are the problems unique to developing decentralized games?      The stakes for designing and building out in-game economies is greater in decentralized games. Considering these assets have real value and live within an immutable environment, developers need to ensure the underlying economic mechanics and the way in which players can generate assets is done in a sustainable manner and resistant to bots and sybil attacks. We've hired some of the best meta designers and economists in the world for this reason, economic impact is something that underpins most of the decisions we make within game design.      What were some of the things you've learned about the crypto community and gamers while developing God's Unchained?      One of the largest differences we've found between the crypto-natives and gamers is the requirements in marketing to them. Unlike crypto-natives, gamers have a general aversion to anything blockchain-related given the turbulent past of the industry. At the same time, they love the trading and benefits that blockchain gaming offers and understand the value of it once effectively explained. Getting them to a stage where they understand and believe in what we're doing before placing judgment is an art, and requires a completely different approach compared with someone who already understands and believes in the fundamentals of the technology.      Do you envision God's Unchained being brought back on-chain?      With a game as complex as Gods Unchained, it doesn't make sense for the gameplay to be on-chain. Nearly all of the benefits you get from introducing blockchain into games can be accomplished simply by decentralizing the underlying assets. By approaching development this way, we can move faster and build a far better user experience than if the entirety of the game's logic was developed into a smart-contract. That being said, the best mechanics and features for Gods Unchained have yet to be introduced, so we will continue aggressively investing in the development of the game. We're also hyper-focused on improving the touchpoints users have with the blockchain, aiming to make the experience of interacting with decentralized assets noob-proof.      What do you think is next for the crypto industry?      While protocol development continues its slow and steady pace, there have been some breakthrough improvements at the application layer this year, with significant milestones taking off in the decentralized finance space. As these building blocks and infrastructure continue to be built out, the possibilities at the frontier continue to expand and I think we’ll see some big developments here as defi liquidity and functionality continues to improve.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/19/james-ferguson-on-decentralized-gamings-next-moves,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6006d96e38ca19be7236946b36f2628fa17bca3-1110x824.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403726,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgate,1576767600,Is Blockchain the Shot in the Arm Healthcare Needs?,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Dr. Alex Cahana is head of healthcare and blockchain consulting at Genesis Block.      At the end of 2018, while awakening from the Crypto Winter, a group of noted healthcare professionals led by Mayo Clinic’s John Halamka predicted that 2019 would be a pivotal year for blockchain in the healthcare industry. They said blockchain would become an essential part of consent management, improve remittances and enhance the monetization of personal data. It would tokenize non-cash assets, like patient outcomes, as an incentive to improve health.      How much of this agenda was actually realized? The answer is some, but not all. We have seen blockchain deployments in supply chains and for physician credentialing, but not yet implemented as an architecture of electronic health records intended to transform them into self-sovereign, patient-driven digital assets.      Why is that, or more fundamentally, why use blockchain in healthcare at all?      Healthcare is problematic all over the world. From a patient point of view, healthcare is not always readily accessible and in many cases too expensive. From a healthcare professional’s perspective, there is too much paperwork. For hospital executives, unchecked job growth rate has not translated into better patient outcomes. The future of pharma and digital therapies is fraught with uncertainty. And even insurance brokers have experienced reduced or eliminated commissions on the sale of individual health plans.      At least, we can all agree that the healthcare ecosystem is a multi-stakeholder, mal-aligned, friction-full, opaque, heavily-regulated, lacking-of-trust, data-rich environment. From there, we can agree on the need for new responses and approaches, including the use of blockchain. It turns out that blockchain-based platforms are ideal for dealing with the characteristics that plague healthcare.      Robert Miller, of ConsenSys Health, produced an excellent report this summer summarizing major trends in the blockchain health space. These include the formation of major new business networks around healthcare use-cases, greater VC funding, and as already mentioned, the use of blockchain for credentialing.      This year, half a dozen consortias (like IBM’s Health Utility Network [HUN], Coalesce Health Alliance and MELLODY) announced projects to exchange healthcare and life science data on using permissioned distributed ledgers. That’s a big deal. Together, these consortia touch the lives of millions of customers (HUN covers 80 million beneficiaries) in a multi-billion dollar market (MELLODY includes pharma companies with a collective value of more than $300 billion).    Venture capital flows have actually slowed, reaching $25M in VC funding this year ($16M of them for Chronicled). This amount is still lower than the $100M-plus raised in 2018 and represents a ridiculously miniscule fraction of the $6B VC funding for non-blockchain digital health projects. As for STOs, the nearly $1B raise in 124 deals included only seven healthcare projects (like Healthbank, Healthereum, Verseonhttps://www.verseon.com/media-1/news/202-verseon-announces-security-token-offering and Agenus), with no significant reported raises.    Supply chain applications and physician credentialing are the most common use-cases in healthcare blockchain. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) of 2013, which mandated the creation of an electronic, interoperable system that can trace and identify distributed prescription drugs, catalyzed the development of a few large scale blockchain-based platforms (like IDLogiq, MediLedger, Rymedi and TraceLink).      As for physician credentialing, we’ve seen a multitude of DLT credentialing solutions emerge (like ProCredX developed by HashedHealth, Blockcerts used by the Federation of State Medical Boards, IntivaHealth that maintains records for continuing education and Truu, used by the UK National Health System). But currently these solutions (except Truu) are exclusively business-to-business and do not address the problem of physician identity or improve professional mobility.      So what can we expect in 2020?    As Nikhil Krishnan correctly predicted in his CB Insight report, the growing blockchain and healthcare landscape (48% CAGR till 2027) is currently dominated by closed consortia, where patient data is minimally used, under strict HIPPA or GDPR regulation. The idea that personal health information in the hands of patients are part of an immutable, master health record has been implemented in Estoniahttps://e-estonia.com/solutions/healthcare/e-health-record/. But it looks like US adoption will be impeded due to a lack of political, regulatory and social appetite to change healthcare from a centralized, corporate, for-profit system into a self-sovereign, decentralized, doctor-patient-driven one.    Whether 2020 will be an incremental or transformational year depends on three factors in my opinion.      First, will we educate healthcare professionals by using a better, refined language? Already we shy away from using the words “crypto” and “blockchain,” associated with hacking and greed (thank you Mt. Gox and ICOs) and use the term DLT. But if we really want to recruit the public, we also need to talk about re-intermediation instead of disintermediation, coopetition (collaborative competition) instead of competition and distinguish between a sustainable “open” market (open to producers) vs. a non-sustainable “free” market, that includes also non- and counter-producers that manipulate and destroy the market (for details, read about Radical Markets here). In other words, the story shouldn’t be about technology, but what technology can achieve for healthcare and its stakeholders.      Second, will we start to explain why we should use blockchain and stop just describing it? Yes, for blockchain to work it must be, as Toufi Saliba, CEO of the TODA Network says: SECSI (Secure, Efficient, Confidential, Scalable, Interoperable). But doctors don’t care that blockchain is a ledger and are not interested in explanations about PoS, PoW, sharding and DAGs. Healthcare professionals need to understand that the “secret sauce” behind using Blockchain in their practice is that their relationship with patients has an inherent value. By promoting patient health, doctors actually engage in a peer-to-peer economic activity and can reward patients and be rewarded for healthy behaviour. Patient outcome is thus an invested asset (store of value) that can be traded not only by companies (Google, FitBit, 23andMe and ZocDoc) but also by patients and professionals themselves.      And third, the 2020 US election outcome. As institutional trust erodes (think government, certain media outlets, Facebook), distributed trust has emerged as an attack-, collusion- and censorship- resistant model to procure, curate, store, manage and analyze data and information. But the public doesn’t understand the difference between universal access to healthcare, which is enhanced when using a distributed, decentralized economic model, and Medicare-for-All (or Amazon-for-All) which is a centralized, friction-full monopsonistic system. Resolving this confusion will be important for blockchain’s future prospects in the healthcare space.      As healthcare remains the top issue on voters' minds this year, the country remains evenly split on whether we should have a very centralized system (Medicare-for-all), a somewhat centralized one (ACA or “Obamacare) or state-based “distributed” (but not decentralized) healthcare. I doubt DLT will be horizontally integrated this year or leveraged as a tool to transform healthcare’s business model and looking ahead to 2020, that future seems some way off given the largely centralized, corporate, for-profit healthcare system in the United States.      Nonetheless healthcare provides a very strong, if not perfect use-case for blockchain software solutions. It uses a shared repository (EHRs) with multiple writers (doctors, nurses, staff) and it has transaction dependencies (adherence to treatment plans, payments, regulations) with multiple intermediaries (professionals, patients, payors, regulators) that have no or minimal trust between them. Blockchain is poised to remedy many of these shortcomings.    Finally, instead of pointing out what blockchain is missinghttps://blockchainatberkeley.blog/4-things-missing-in-the-blockchain-industry-50f97bec098c, or fret that its purpose is unclear and changing, or hedge on what blockchain will become, let us state clearly what blockchain does. It is an attack, collusion and censorship-resistant solution that facilitates peer-to-peer economic activity. And in a world that suffers from a fear of fake products (fake posts, fake news and fake data), the role of DLT as solving the problem of social “fakes” is salient.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Alex Cahana,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/19/is-blockchain-the-shot-in-the-arm-healthcare-needs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4126977395bcdbb76ba741a055f326d237fca72f-1370x844.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403730,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgaud,1576765256,Coinbase CEO Armstrong Wins Patent for Tech Allowing Users to Email Bitcoin,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstronghas been granted a U.S. patent for an invention that makes sending bitcoin as easy as email, literally.      The patent, granted on Tuesday and filed in March 2015, details a system for users to make cryptocurrency payments with email addresses linked to corresponding wallet addresses. The sender makes a request to send cryptocurrency to an email address, and the system automatically transmits the agreed amount – so long as they have the required balance – from the sender's wallet to the wallet corresponding to the receiver's email address.      The system takes 48 hours for the transaction to clear, once the receiver has confirmed the payment. Cryptocurrencies not in use would be stored in a secure vault that can only be accessed by the email address linked to the corresponding wallet.      While Coinbase has made more than $2 billion in transaction fees since 2012, the proposed email system will not charge users fees. According to the patent, mining fees will be paid for by the exchange itself. Transactions to external wallet addresses would be possible, but may not be free-of-charge.      The patent specifically mentions bitcoin and doesn't say whether the system could support other cryptocurrencies, but presumably that wouldn't be a major hurdle. There also appears to be no restriction on email providers, meaning users could use existing email addresses should they wish to.      The email system would also include a featured exchange facility for users to make in-app bitcoin trades using fiat currency from a linked bank account.      Whether the exchange plans a new service based on the patent isn't clear. CoinDesk has reached out to Coinbase for comment.      Two other patents were granted to Coinbase on Tuesday. One is an application for ensuring user accounts comply with international and local law, the other an enforcement protocol for closing non-compliant accounts.      The email transaction system would potentially make cryptocurrency transactions easier for less advanced users. In August, Armstrong said he wanted to create an inclusive financial system: ""The vision for Coinbase is creating more economic freedom for every person and business in the world over the next 10 years.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/19/coinbase-ceo-armstrong-wins-patent-for-tech-allowing-users-to-email-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23a1a29dbcd3fd05ff51d267bda06c5a2969f374-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hence, “I expect that custodians that do really well at this--whether it’s Fidelity or Coinbase--they will act as sub-custodians to other custodians,” she said. “It means they partner with other institutions and say, ‘I’m happy to custody this and you manage the client experience.’”      To be clear, Sandler was talking hypotheticals and not announcing any new plans for FDAS. The roughly one-year-old business acts as a broker and custodian of bitcoin for institutional investors and is one of the most significant forays to date into the crypto market by an established financial services provider.      This month, Fidelity Digital Assets announced that it would open up a new entity in Europe to serve European institutional investors. In November, FDAS obtained a trust company charter from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), allowing it to custody bitcoin for institutional investors in New York. Right now, the unit sources its liquidity primarily from over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, but it plans to sign up its first crypto exchange by the end of 2019.      At the New York event, Sandler added that a theme of 2020 will be clients expressing interest in digital assets in many different ways.      “Clients come to us and say ‘I want to expose 1 percent to 2 percent of my portfolio to bitcoin.’ That’s a big lift in terms of accessing that liquidity,” she said. “But it’s also a big lift in terms of how they are incorporating that into their portfolio, what evaluation tools are being used … what happens if the asset forks?

Announced today, the ""Big Four"" financial services firm awarded Fidelity-backed Fireblocks a Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type II Certification following a six-month security audit into how the company manages, processes, and protects customer data.      Fireblocks describes itself as an enterprise-grade solution for blockchain-based transactions. Effectively, it provides a service allowing institutions to securely move digital assets.      The platform, which came out of stealth in June, currently supports 22 different exchanges and 180 different cryptocurrencies. Existing clients include Galaxy Digital and Genesis Global Trading.      A month after launch, the firm announced a $16 million Series A funding round with Investors including Eight Roads – the investment arm of Fidelity International.      To receive a SOC 2 Type II certification, auditors must review a company's cyber-security controls and recovery protocols, as well as how a company encrypts its users' data.      EY's report said Fireblocks either met or exceeded the SOC 2 Type II criteria. The auditor will carry out reviews on a yearly basis to ensure Fireblocks continues to comply with security standards.      Commonplace in traditional finance, few cryptocurrency businesses have this accreditation, according to Michael Shaulov, Fireblocks CEO and co-founder. Fireblocks can now court clients from outside crypto, including financial institutions dipping their toes into the asset class.      ""It is a required accreditation for any service provider in the traditional finance space because big banks and financial institutions will refuse to engage with a SaaS or PaaS provider that doesn’t have SOC 2 Type II,"" Shaulov told CoinDesk. ""The SOC 2 will allow us to extend our services to the bigger set of financial players like Wall Street banks and asset managers that are getting involved with digital assets.""

42403723,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgaoj,1576757502,EY Open-Sources Tech It Says Slashes Cost of Private Ethereum Transactions,"Accounting multinational EY has released blockchain technology that it claims greatly reduces the cost of private transactions.      In an announcement on Thursday, the firm said the third-generation of its zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) tech for the ethereum blockchain – originally dubbed Nightfall – is now available in the public domain (the documentation can be seen on GitHub).      In the updated code, EY said it's made additions that allow private transactions at scale by batching up to 20 ZKP transfers in one transaction – a factor it says ""significantly"" reduces costs. One 20-batch transaction would cost around $0.05, according to the announcement.      ZPKs enable the sharing of information proofs between parties without revealing the information itself and, thus, removing the need for trust. The latest additions to EY's ZPK tech include batching tools and an enhancement that cuts the size of on-chain Merkle trees – a data structure fundamental to blockchains.      A key factor of the advance, EY said, is that lowering the costs of transactions in this way makes the public ethereum blockchain more competitive with private blockchain networks.      The third-gen code is ""the most important EY blockchain milestone in making public blockchains scalable for [enterprises],"" said Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY.      ""In the prior iteration released in April 2019, public blockchains were already getting competitive with private networks,"" he said. ""With this iteration, we cut the cost per transaction by more than 90% again, making private transactions more accessible for mainstream business application.”      However, the new release isn't restricted to use on the public chain, but can also be deployed on private versions of ethereum.      ""On private blockchains, it provides a second layer of security and privacy, supporting more complex privacy models across multiple organizations within industry consortia,"" EY said.      Going forward, the company said it has ""several"" more batching functions that are expected to be added in ""coming months."" These will further boost scalability, it said.      “I believe we will look back upon the industrialization of ZKPs as a key milestone in the wide enterprise migration from private to public blockchains,"" said Brody.      Just yesterday, EY also made its token and smart contract review service available in public beta.

42403731,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgawb,1576756800,Mind-Bending Narrative Shifts in 2019,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Nathaniel Whittemore is an independent strategy and communications consultant for leading crypto companies as well as the curator of Long Reads Sunday and host of the Crypto Daily 3@3 video podcast.      When it comes to crypto, narrative shifts represent shifts in mindshare.      Take, for example, the ethereum narrative between the beginning of 2018 and the end of that same year. That year kicked off in the middle of ICO mania. Tokenize the world! Tokenize everything! The rallying cry rang out. For a while, it looks like the markets believed it too.      By the end of the year, no one wanted to be caught dead near a “tech crypto” token project. No, by the time 2019 kicked off, it was all about decentralized finance – a brave new world of permissionless, programmable money.      For the cynical, this type of narrative shift can suggest a certain insincerity of purpose. I believe something different.      Narratives are the way we make sense of the world happening around us and place ourselves in it. They shift as we take in more information and better figure out what matters to us as individuals and as an industry.      Narratives are also a battleground. Boosters of ideas scrap to convince the limited attention, talent and capital available to see the world as they do, in a way that benefits their area of focus. This is true in all industries, but particularly in such a young, high-stakes space like crypto.      For that reason, trying to understand what narratives dominate any given period is a way of understanding where the attention of the industry was focused during that time.    Peak narrative    With that lens, 2019 has a number of contenders for the title of “Most Important Narrative.”      DeFi, mentioned above, has to be considered, given how much it became the mainstream focus of the ethereum community, led by projects like MakerDAO and Uniswap.      Another narrative worthy of consideration is the ascendance of bitcoin maximalism. As ICO projects crashed and burned and lagging regulatory scrutiny followed, bitcoin broke out, and it wasn’t just the price but mindshare that came with it.      To me, however, these lag far behind what I believe is the (nearly) indisputable narrative of 2019: the emergence of a true global digital currency war and the way it has raised the perceived stakes on the crypto industry as a whole.    The emergence of a true global digital currency war is the most important narrative of 2019.    Historians are fond of pointing to pivotal events within big pattern-shifts and saying “that’s when everything changed.” When it comes to Facebook’s announcement of Libra, it really was an “everything changed” moment.      Libra was like a starting gun for the governments of the world to take seriously the prospect that the future of money wouldn’t come from them and their central banks, but from private actors. While many hadn’t been particular fans of bitcoin, none seemed to take it seriously as a true threat to fiat currencies. Indeed, around the time of the Libra announcement, both Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued bitcoin in practice was much more like digital gold than a dollar competitor.      Maybe it was the backing of Mark Zuckerberg, who had shown so much willingness to smash the rules, rather than work within them. Or maybe it was the threat of 2.3 billion potential users right out of the gate. Whatever it was, governments from the US to the EU and beyond immediately took the threat of Libra more seriously.      In the US, both Congress and the Senate called special hearings within weeks of the announcement. In the EU, defiant pols declared that Libra would never be allowed there.      China, meanwhile, had a different response. Almost immediately, it announced the acceleration of what they called five-year R&D efforts into a digital yuan, indicating that the first pilots could be seen before the end of the year. In certain communiques, they even referenced Libra explicitly.      In turn, in a second round of Congressional hearings in the US, Zuckerberg himself brought the threat of a China-led digital currency future as the boogeyman of the proceedings, effectively arguing that if Facebook wasn’t allowed to do this, China would.      The year ends with the digital currency wars in full effect. China seems poised to launch trials imminently. The US government seems no more decided than before about Libra, but some US Congressmen have called on the Fed to explore creating a digital dollar. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney called for the creation of a “Synthetic Hegemonic Currency” to replace the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Other governments, including France and Germany, have launched their own digital currency explorations. And this is all to say nothing of the corporations like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, which are building their own internal currencies that may eventually have larger ambitions.      The net of all of this is a fundamental leveling up of the significance of the cryptocurrency industry. For governments and enterprises around the world, the questions aren’t just around potential criminal applications on the one hand or business opportunities on the other.      Instead, the stakes are now seen as a question of the future of the global reserve currency and of the future of money as a whole. When this year began, not many government officials anywhere would have imagined a future much different from the present. The year ends with teams of officials racing to at the very least understand new potentials and in many cases actually implement new technologies.      The emergence of a true global digital currency war is the most important narrative of 2019.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Nathaniel Whittemore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/19/mind-bending-narrative-shifts-in-2019,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61a63d445aeb438de9c14645a0e9d79556a35e03-800x600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403737,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgb0X,1576753711,"Bitcoin Price Jumps 10%, But Bull Reversal Still $700 Away","View  Bitcoin logged double-digit gains on Wednesday, neutralizing the short-term bearish view.  A close above $7,870 (Nov. 29 high) is now needed to invalidate the lower-highs set up and confirm a short-term bullish reversal.  That looks likely, as one daily chart indicator is flashing a bullish divergence and Wednesday's engulfing candle signaled seller exhaustion.    Bitcoin surged by over 10 percent on Wednesday – the biggest single-day gain since Oct. 25, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Notably, prices had slumped to seven-month lows below $6,500 around lunchtime (UTC), but the breakdown was quickly undone and the cryptocurrency was trading above $7,400 before midnight.      The rebound from multi-month lows is a tell-tale sign of seller exhaustion – especially, as it erased the losses seen in the preceding eight days.      Wednesday’s spike has neutralized the immediate bearish case. That said, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only if and when prices rise above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870. That would invalidate the most basic of all bearish patterns – a lower-highs setup.      With bitcoin currently trading at $7,170, the bull reversal is still $770 away.    Daily chart    Bitcoin has charted (price via Bitstamp) a series of lower highs (arrows) and lowers lows over the last five months.      The last lower high at $7,870 was printed on Nov. 29 and is still intact. A UTC close above that level is needed to confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, as noted above.      A move above that level shouldn't be ruled out, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has diverged in favor of the bulls. A bullish divergence occurs when an indicator prints higher lows, contradicting lower lows on price, and is considered an early warning of an impending corrective bounce.      Additionally, Wednesday’s big bullish engulfing candle is indicating seller exhaustion and would gain credence if prices find acceptance above $7,450 (the candle's high) in the next 24 hours. That would further strengthen the case for a test of resistance at $7,870.      Both patterns would be invalidated if prices drop below $6,428, although that looks unlikely at press time.

In a blog update on Wednesday, ""Murch,"" a software engineer at the firm, said the Genesis hard fork scheduled for Feb. 4, 2020, would usher in a new consensus mechanism making BitGo's BSV wallets unable to receive payments.      Specifically, the post stated:    ""This consensus rule change will make Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) outputs invalid. Since BitGo’s BSV wallets use P2SH-based multi-signature addresses, the protocol change will render BitGo BSV wallets unable to receive funds.""    This means that, following the hard fork, funds in these wallets will still be spendable and BSV can be sent from the wallets. However, sending BSV to a wallet will produce an invalid transaction – even if it's a BitGo wallet sending ""change"" back to itself, said Murch.      Customers holding the cryptocurrency – itself a fork of the bitcoin blockchain – are advised to either exchange their BSV into bitcoin, or withdraw their coins to an external wallet before the fork.      ""If you continue holding BSV in your BitGo wallet after February 4th, you will only be able to sweep the wallet and most functionality will be disabled,"" Murch wrote.      BitGo stores billions of dollars in cryptocurrency for clients such as institutional investors and exchanges.

42403725,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgarg,1576749600,Snowball: The Effort to Bring Privacy to Every Bitcoin Wallet,"Developer Ben Woosley was watching the Hong Kong protesters when he saw something interesting: They were using Bluetooth technology to dodge the internet, allowing them to create a mesh network for organizing and messaging while avoiding intrusion.      To create their mesh, the protestors used an app and software development kit, or SDK, called Bridgefy to bypass normal Internet connections. Woosley wondered about the implications of this decentralized, disconnected technology for bitcoin. The problem, he found, was that even though crypto was theoretically resistant to censorship, in practice it was easy to knock out the network by turning off the internet.      To solve this, Woosley created a Bluetooth-based network, Snowball, to make it easier to make private bitcoin transactions, and based his technology on the concept of CoinJoins.    CoinJoins?    CoinJoins are one of the main bitcoin privacy technologies. They are used to scramble several transactions together to hide all parties' tracks. The Wasabi bitcoin wallet makes CoinJoins easy to use but, since CoinJoins are more difficult and expensive than normal bitcoin transactions, they only make up a small portion of the total bitcoin transactions despite having been around for years.      Woosley wants to try to make privacy easier with a variant of CoinJoins called PayJoins.      ""That's the main element of the project, making PayJoins easy, where you don't need to need to know that they're occurring,"" he said.      The goal is to get the technology to ""snowball"" ensuring that every transaction will at least have the option of traversing the mesh network if the internet is unavailable.    How it works    It all started in a blockchain hackathon in Wyoming. Woolsey was there because of a ""fascination with cowboy culture."" Woosley and fellow bitcoin developer Justin Moon teamed up for the multi-day event and explored what kind of product they wanted to make.      ""Bluetooth is the most commonly available wireless technology, in every phone. The ubiquity of Bluetooth makes it a good target for this,"" Woosley said.      The pair considered other technologies but abandoned them after a bit of research. Another wireless technology, NFC, wasn't as widespread because it's only supported in Android smartphones. But once it has Bluetooth in a stable place, the team might try to work on making Snowball compatible with these other types of technologies, Woosley said.      In the end, Woolsey and team used a tech called Pay to EndPoint or P2EP., a year-old idea for achieving bitcoin privacy. Instead of requiring a bunch of people to make a transaction at the same time, as is done with CoinJoins, the tech only requires the sender and the receiver to mix transactions.      They chose to use P2EP because it improves security in two ways. First, users don't have to find another person trying to make a transaction at the same time. Second, it might be even more private than regular CoinJoins since it makes the fact that you're using a mixer to hide transaction history much less obvious.      For developers like Woosley, it's important to make private transactions easier for a couple of reasons.      ""It's a property that impacts everyone. But it's a public good in a sense. As more people make private transactions, it increases the privacy of everyone else,"" he said.      Plus, Woosley wants to ""undermine Chainalysis people."" Right now, it's not so hard to figure out what transactions are owned by which people by using ""blockchain analysis,"" or looking through the history of bitcoin transactions to find patterns.      Further, experts worry bitcoin's transparent transaction history could hurt its chances of becoming a serious currency. One crucial property of money is ""fungibility,"" the idea that every coin is worth the same amount as every other coin.      The risk with bitcoin is some coins could become tainted by a past crime and be rendered useless.      ""The coin might be associated with some event that happened a long time ago,"" Woosley said. ""It's possible to scrutinize coins to see if it's gonna be spendable based on outside rules like what the government thinks. It undermines using bitcoin. It's a significant risk to any user.""    Hurdles to adoption      However, it might not be so easy to make private bitcoin transactions simple. One big hurdle with P2EP, as well as Snowball, is that both the sender and the receiver need to adopt the technology in order to communicate.      In addition, some experts question whether it's the best way forward for private bitcoin transactions. P2EP has been around for a year, but it hasn't gained much traction.      ""It's not hard to see why P2EP and PayJoin doesn't really see any adoption. Every implementation is limited. JoinMarket only for JoinMarket users, BustaPay only for merchants, Snowball only for smartphones,"" said Adam Fiscor, developer of Wasabi, a leading privacy-minded bitcoin wallet that uses normal CoinJoins. He went so far as to say privacy wallet Samourai's technology is for ""idiots."" He and Samourai were involved in a public spat earlier this year about the different approaches in privacy technologies they've taken.      Woosley hopes Snowball will expand into a more pliable standard. He argues the key ingredient it has that other projects don't is they're trying to make it ""effortless"" for wallets to implement.      As such, the team is looking for a developer to help build out an app that works for Android devices.      Once they're done with that, they'll open ""pull requests"" to wallets to try to help them to adopt the changes. ""The integration effort should be pretty modest,"" Woosley said. In all, his hope is that adoption to start with a flurry and roll into a storm.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/19/snowball-the-effort-to-bring-privacy-to-every-bitcoin-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/251ff090f69d96aced345c56123a97b8d75fd342-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

(BCOT) agreed to pay $250,000 to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for launching an initial coin offering without registering with the regulator.      The federal securities regulator has long held that ICOs are a form of security and thus must be registered.      In an order dated Wednesday, BCOT agreed to refund investors who notify the firm they want their money back. It must make efforts to inform token buyers individually and on its website of the potential claim.      According to the SEC, the firm raised nearly $13 million from the ICO in December 2017 even after the regulator warned the firm its token sales could be considered securities offerings, citing its investigation of another company, DAO, in 2017.      BCOT sold its digital tokens to U.S. investors and engaged four “resellers” to serve as the exclusive sellers of the tokens in foreign countries where it can resell the tokens to U.S. investors, according to the SEC’s findings.      In its pre-sale white paper, BOT said part of the funding from the ICO would develop a blockchain-based platform to allow third-party developers to build applications for message transmission and logging, digital asset generation, and digital asset transfer, the firm said in the statement.      Under the settlement, BCOT will register its tokens as securities and file periodic reports with the SEC.      A slew of crypto startups launched ICOs to raise money for their tokens amid the bitcoin market boom at the end of 2017, running afoul of the SEC, which considers token sales securities that should be subject to federal securities laws and information disclosure.      Earlier in December, the SEC charged crypto startup Shopin and its CEO Eran Eyal with fraud involving a $42 million unregistered ICO.

In prepared remarks for an event in Germany on Wednesday, Lael Brainard said more clarity is needed about the basket of currencies underlying the stablecoin and that its model is still unproven.      The risks ""could be exacerbated by the lack of clarity about the management of reserves and the rights and responsibilities of various market participants in the network,"" she said.      The Libra Association has previously said the token would be backed by collateral consisting of the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, British pound and Singapore dollar, with USD taking up the biggest proportion. The association is comprised of firms and other entities that put up the assets backing the coin.      The sheer size of Facebook's reach has had U.S. and other global regulators worried about the impact of the project should it take off in a big way.      “What would set Facebook’s Libra apart, if it were to proceed, is the combination of an active-user network representing more than a third of the global population with the issuance of a private digital currency opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies,” Brainard said.      If ""requisite safeguards"" are not in place, global stablecoins pose a risk to consumers, she said. ""It is not even clear how much price risk consumers will face since they do not appear to have rights to the stablecoin's underlying assets.""      She contrasted the nascent stablecoin scenario with the ""strong safeguards"" developed over decades that consumers now expect on their bank accounts and related payments.      “Given the stakes, any global payments network should be expected to meet a high threshold of legal and regulatory safeguards before launching operations.""
