42426210,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk4Fh,1418338534,Industry Views: What Does Microsoft Mean for Bitcoin?,"Microsoft took the bitcoin world by surprise late last night with the sudden announcement that it would allow consumers to purchase its digital content with the digital currency.  The move, which opened its Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox platforms to a new payment method, provided a notable uptick in attention to the industry, as the price of bitcoin rose roughly 4% in its aftermath on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index.  While volatility in the markets declined over the day, interest in Microsoft's decision held strong. Major tech and finance publications, from Forbes to Gizmodo, all profiled the announcement, and conversation about the company's decision had a strong presence on social media.  Characterizations of what the news meant for Microsoft were varied. BitPay suggested in an interview that the Washington-based Internet pioneer is seeking to move aggressively to court innovation, and that bitcoin is high on this agenda.  However, a Microsoft spokesperson was less enthusiastic when speaking to The Wall Street Journal, stating: ""We are dipping our toe in the water, we are not going guns blazing on this yet.""  Regardless of what the move means for Microsoft, this vote of confidence from a tech industry giant could have a wide range of effects on the bitcoin industry.  For more on what this impact will be, CoinDesk sought comment from a wide range of industry participants.

42426207,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk41h,1418335535,Reddit's Cryptocurrency Engineer Hints at Secret Bitcoin Project Plans,"Given Reddit's status as perhaps the most prominent social network for bitcoin discussion, it is unsurprising that the wider community took notice when former BitPay developer Ryan X Charles was brought on board as the site's first 'cryptocurrency engineer' this September.  Interest was further piqued with the announcement that, fresh off $50m in new funding, Reddit would go beyond simply embracing bitcoin as a currency, seeking instead to give 10% of the round to users through a cryptocurrency backed by its own shares.  Since then details about the project have been scarce. However, Charles took to the social network yesterday to respond to community questions following his formal introduction as a Reddit employee.  The resulting conversation shed new light on Reddit's plans for its cryptocurrency project, while providing a broad overview of how Charles sees developments in the bitcoin space.  Throughout his remarks, Charles was bullish about the potential of bitcoin, affirming that he sees his upcoming work with Reddit as part of a long-term investment for the company; the first of what he expects will be many similar projects to be embraced by global businesses.  Charles wrote:  ""Bitcoin technology will ultimately become integral to Reddit. We've had some internal brainstorming about ways we could integrate – the possibilities are enormous.""  The full conversation covered a variety of topics, from the newly proposed sidechains white paper to the recent rise in the use of micropayments tools on the platform.  A perfect match  Overall, Charles stressed that he sees himself as a long-term member of the Reddit team, and feels there are myriad opportunities that could result from the integration of the social network and the emerging technology.  He said that when he was hired by Reddit earlier this year, this long-term plan was less clear. Even so, he suggested he felt a synergy with the company from an early point.  In particular, he shared an anecdote from his interview with the company, in which he said he would seek to decentralize Reddit should he be hired.  ""Turns out this plan was literally already on the table!"" he remarked. ""However, [...] I'm completely focused on bitcoin and don't exactly have the spare time to decentralize Reddit.""  Charles went on to characterize Reddit as the best community to help spread bitcoin and showcase its ability to usher in a new wave of decentralization. ""It's a perfect match,"" he added.  Sidechains and colored coins  As for how the project will look on a technical level, Charles was less clear. For example, he explained that when he first took his position at Reddit, even he was in the dark about its plans to launch a crypto 2.0 project.  ""I didn't really know anything about bitcoin 2.0 stuff like colored coins – I was an expert in plain-old bitcoin 1.0,"" he wrote. ""I spent more than a month just researching the options.""  Charles indicated that Reddit has a number of options for releasing its crypto shares – including Counterparty, Ethereum, Mastercoin, NXT, Open Transactions, Ripple, sidechains and Stellarhttps://stripe.com/blog/stellar.  However, he said that colored coins, which allow users to alter a bitcoin to represent an asset, and sidechains, the conceptual multi-blockchain project helmed by VC-backed Blockstream, are perhaps the company's ""best options"".  Still, Charles cautioned that Reddit will remain blockchain-agnostic until it releases its product.  ""We are not committing to any protocol today, because it is not necessary yet, and things in bitcoin change so fast that they may change before we actually launch,"" he said.  Tipping, dogecoin integration possibile  In another query, Charles was asked if Reddit might seek to integrate digital currency tipping into its core user interface (UI), an idea he said was on the company's ""list of options"".  However, he suggested Reddit may not seek to integrate with the tipping platforms it already uses most commonly – comments that are notable given the recent surge in popularity of platforms like ChangeTip.  ""Note that security is absolutely paramount with this stuff,"" he wrote. ""But integrating that into the reddit UI while simultaneously guaranteeing security is non-trivial.""  Charles went on to mention Copay, BitPay's multisig wallet, lauding its security and calling its key signing service ""an excellent model"". Further, he suggested that bitcoin may not be the only digital currency supported alongside Reddit's new offering.  ""I think there may be a way to integrate dogecoin,"" he said. ""I will have more say about this after some of the upcoming announcements.""

42426201,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk3vh,1418319195,BitPay: Microsoft Has Aggressive Global Vision for Bitcoin,"""Our industry does not respect tradition – it only respects innovation.""  It was with those words that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sought to prepare his team for fiscal year 2015, the remarks following a lengthy period of decline in prestige for the global brand as it fell out of step with reigning tech giants like Facebook and Google.  To BitPay chief commercial officer Sonny Singh, Microsoft's decision to embrace bitcoin is part of the company's campaign to change this perception. While the Washington-based company has only added bitcoin as a payment option for US digital goods consumers, Singh suggested Microsoft is already preparing to move aggressively to support the emerging technology.  Singh told CoinDesk:  ""Microsoft has a long-term vision for bitcoin, BitPay and the blockchain. Starting with digital goods in the US is the logical first step, however, they want to expand to Europe and globally and add support for other products as part of that rollout.""  Singh indicated that the Microsoft team has made it clear that they are serious about supporting bitcoin through both words and actions. Microsoft is reportedly enthusiastic about bitcoin ""from the top down"", according to Singh.  ""They already have a global plan rolled out for us,"" Singh said. ""They've already thought four steps ahead of this whole rollout, so they are very innovative, very aggressive and very strategic in how they work.""  The former VP of sales at Jumio further indicated that Microsoft moved fast to integrate bitcoin in time for the holiday. Microsoft accounts can now be funded with bitcoin and used to purchase apps, games and videos on its Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox platforms.  Singh's remarks are further supported by a blog post issued by Microsoft today, in which the company indicated that by allowing consumers to use bitcoin for purchases, it hopes to be ""at the front edge"" of the technology's proliferation.  Live by Christmas  Singh indicated that the BitPay executive team first met with Microsoft in Seattle three months ago, where they conducted a two-hour conversation with its executives, product specialists and engineers.  ""They already did their homework on bitcoin, and were more interested in BitPay,"" Singh explained. ""After that, they really felt comfortable and wanted to start proceeding as soon as possible.""  He went on to suggest that integrations were completed directly following the meeting, ""before the contracts were even done"". Work then proceeded through the November holidays, with contracts being signed and KYC due diligence completed.  Singh stressed that he was impressed with Microsoft's speed, calling its drive to follow through on the initiative ""very impressive"".  ""They wanted to get the digital goods piece out for the holidays, Xbox is obviously a big holiday gift item,"" he said.  Interest in blockchain tech  While Singh indicated that Microsoft intends to integrate bitcoin as a payment method as part of ""phase one"" of its larger plans, he suggested the company is also interested in the underlying innovations that support bitcoin and its global transaction network.  ""They obviously already have what they think they can use it for,"" he said, ""and they realize with our tech they can figure out what's possible in the next year or two.""  Singh affirmed his team intends to work closely with Microsoft as it seeks to expand its interest in the space, noting BitPay's presence in Europe, North America and South America.  As for how the company was able to keep the information secret until the launch, Singh cited the professionalism of his team, concluding:  ""Everyone was working so hard and it was so fast, no one had time to leak anything out.""

42426203,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk43h,1418309909,CoinJelly Exchange to Close Customer Bitcoin Accounts Within 24 Hours,"UPDATE (12th December 16:59 GMT): CoinJelly has announced via Twitter that customer accounts will remain open for a further seven days. The company said 98% of users had already withdrawn their bitcoin and confirmed that it had a ""small fund"" for those who miss the deadline.      Bitcoin exchange and wallet service CoinJelly has announced it is to close all user accounts within 24 hours.  CoinJelly's founder and director Ash King said the closures have come about because ownership of his company has changed hands. However, he declined to make further comment about this claimed acquisition, other than ""we were not purchased for our customer base"".  The Australia-based company, which launched earlier this year, emailed its customers today stating: ""We will need you to remove your coin from your wallet within the next 24 hours.""  The email revealed the CoinJelly site would be taken offline at 12:00pm (AEST) on December 12th. The email continues:  ""After that point, your coin will not be accessible, by us or you, should it be left in the system.""  King told CoinDesk, however, that CoinJelly would not ""take the wallet down"" until the company has exhausted all avenues over the coming days to contact users.  He said that, already, 95% of the bitcoins owned by the company's users have been withdrawn, with no one wallet now containing more than 2 BTC.  ""We have a small fund to cover any people who may be occupied this week or cannot access their email or phones,"" he added.  The CoinJelly website currently displays no information about the account closures on the home, FAQ or support pages.  Disgruntled customers  One CoinJelly user told CoinDesk he was less than pleased with the way CoinJelly had handled the situation.  ""24 hours warning 'or else lose your coins' is not really great. What if I didn't check my mailbox for 24 hours? As it happened I was able to transfer the coins, but not great,"" he said.  CoinJelly apologised to a user on Twitter for the short notice:    @maxycoin Apologies for the surprise news, and yes we have changed hands. You will need to move your coins as soon as possible.      — CoinJelly (@CoinJelly) December 11, 2014      Services offered  CoinJelly marketed itself as ""The world's first insured bitcoin wallet"", but this has proven difficult to verify.  CoinDesk viewed a policy document detailing an insurance agreement between CoinJelly and Zurich Financial Services, but was unable to obtain a confirmation or verification from Zurich.  As well as offering a wallet and bitcoin storage service, the company enabled users to buy, sell and send bitcoins on its platform, with a flat fee of 1%.

42398049,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVtD,1418305870,CFTC Chairman: We Have Oversight of Bitcoin Derivatives,"The chairman of the US derivatives regulator has told a senate committee that digital currency derivatives fall within his agency's remit.  Timothy Massad, who chairs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), testified before the US Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry yesterday, noting that while his agency does not have specific rules governing digital currencies, it would oversee futures and swaps in any commodity. This includes digital currencies, he said.  He added:  ""While the CFTC does not have policies and procedures specific to virtual currencies like bitcoin, the agency's authority extends to futures and swaps contracts in any commodity ... derivative contracts based on a virtual currency represent one area within our responsibility.""  Massad noted the CFTC defines commodities ""very broadly"" and the term is not limited to agricultural commodities like metals and energy, but also includes derivatives linked to stock market indices, currencies and electricity.  Bitcoin is innovative  Massad framed digital currency derivatives as a form of innovation that his agency wants to encourage, although he noted his agency is also tasked with enforcing consumer protections and preventing manipulation and fraud.  The CFTC chair referred to TeraExchange's bitcoin swap as an example of a digital currency derivative that fell within his agency's oversight. New Jersey-based TeraExchange received approval for its swap from the CFTC in September.  ""Innovation is a vital part of our markets, and it is something that our regulatory framework is designed to encourage. At the same time our regulatory framework is intended to prevent manipulation and fraud, and to make sure our markets operate with transparency and integrity,"" Massad said.  Some market participants welcomed Massad's comments. Joe Lee, who runs digital currency derivatives platform BTC.sx, said regulation could encourage greater adoption of digital currencies.  Lee also said Massad's comments could improve clarity on regulations around digital currencies in general. He added:  ""Regulation, when done correctly, is a great tool for ensuring fair play across the markets and ensuring consumer protection ... I welcome the comments from chairman Timothy Massad in acknowledging the role of the CFTC in bitcoin and virtual currencies.""  Christian Martin, chief executive of TeraExchange, also welcomed Massad's comments. He said regulators and lawmakers were paying increasing attention to digital currencies and he viewed this as a positive development. He pointed to Massad's remarks at a Senate committee hearing as evidence that digital currency is being taken seriously.  ""The topic of [digital] currency being present in such a critical – arguably the most critical yearly process [for the CFTC] – is an observable indication of mindshare being dedicated to the topic throughout [Washington, DC] generally,"" he said.  The less oversight the better  However, other players in the bitcoin derivatives world were less positive. Arthur Hayes, who runs BitMEX, a Hong Kong-based firm that offers its own bitcoin-linked derivatives, said Massad's statement was too broad to be interpreted clearly.  More specific comments from the regulator would be required before market participants could be sure about the impact of possible regulation, Hayes said.  ""I would say the less regulators are involved, the better. What [regulators] do will drive behaviour, whether or not that is favourable depends on the details,"" he said.  In November, a CFTC commissioner said that the regulator had oversight over bitcoin and digital currencies because it could be defined as a commodity. He made the remarks at a conference on bitcoin organised by Bloomberg.  The regulator also organised its own event to discuss bitcoin and digital currencies, holding a meeting in October that concluded with largely positive sentiment about the sector.  Massad was testifying to the Senate committee as part of an oversight hearing. He was updating the Senate on the CFTC's progress in fulfilling its responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The regulator was given the job of overseeing the $700tn swaps market under the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, Bloomberg News reported.  Much of Massad's testimony to the Senate committee focused on his agency's ability to fulfil its new responsibilities within its budget. The committee's chairwoman Senator Debbie Stabenow issued a statement after the testimonial calling for increased funding for the CFTC.

42398044,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVqG,1418302244,Estonia: VAT Should Apply to Full Value of Bitcoin Trades,"Estonia has reaffirmed its view that Value Added Tax (VAT) should be applied to the full amount of bitcoin trades, rather than to merely the commission or service fee.  The opinion was submitted as part of an ongoing bitcoin tax case currently before the European Court of Justice (ECJ), according to a report, and is in line with a previous statement by the country's tax authority.  The ECJ case was launched in June, after Swedish regulators decided they could not address the issue on their own. The regulators asked the ECJ to arbitrate a dispute between the Swedish tax authority (Skatteverket) and private defendant David Hedqvist.  Opposed views  The case revolves around a basic question: whether or not VAT is applicable to bitcoin under the union's VAT directive, which outlines which transactions should be subject to VAT.  Hedqvist, a moderator of the Scandinavian section of bitcointalk.org and a member of several bitcoin online communities, is of the opinion that bitcoin should be exempt.  The Swedish tax authority, however, maintains that bitcoin is not VAT exempt under the provisions of Article 135 of the Council Directive on The Common System of Value Added Tax.  However, Hedqvist says the European Commission is against the idea of imposing VAT on digital currency transactions and is hopeful of his chances in the ruling.  Fundraising appeal  In his latest update published on Bitcoin.se, Hedqvist said the case is progressing and described Estonia's decision to submit opinions as bad news.  ""The good news is that the European Commission shares our view. Included in the submission from the European Commission is also the 'preliminary view' of the United Kingdom and they are also in favour of VAT exemption,"" he wrote.  While there is possibility of an oral hearing before the court, Hedqvist indicated he will only request one if he manages to secure funding for legal representation. Crowdfunding was ruled out as a funding option, but he appealed for financial help in a separate post.  Hedqvist told CoinDesk he does not know whether he will be able to raise the necessary funds, but that he is optimistic about the outcome of the case:  ""I'm quite optimistic about our chances – ie: that there will be no VAT on commission/fee – and it is great to see that the EU commission supports that view, but everything is just speculation at this point obviously. VAT on the full bitcoin amount (like Estonia seems to want) would obviously be catastrophic, as it would make bitcoin pretty much unusable as a currency. That outcome seems very unlikely though, not even my counterpart, Skatteverket, wants that.""  Support at home  Mathias Sundin, a Swedish member of parliament who was elected on a pro-bitcoin platform, told CoinDesk that VAT on bitcoin transactions would be a blow to the Swedish cryptocurrency industry.  ""It's positive this is now being tested at the highest EU judicial level. It is also very positive that the European Commission has the same view as David Hedqvist. I hope someone steps forward and helps David with the financing for the oral hearing before the court,"" he said.  The Swedish Parliament, Sundin added, will host a discussion on bitcoin next week and that he had personally invited leading Swedish banks to attend.  He explained:  ""The banks have rejected bitcoin companies as costumers, so we will get them in the same room – banks and bitcoin companies – and discuss the issues. This is new ground for the banks and they are very cautious.""  See the official Estonia opinion document below (Estonian language).

42398053,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFVy8,1418274045,Ex-JPMorgan Transactions Exec Joins Bitcoin Startup Circle As CFO,"Circle Internet Financial has hired a veteran banking industry executive to serve as its new chief financial officer (CFO).  Paul Camp, who formerly held the title of global head and managing director at JPMorgan’s transactions services unit, will act as corporate treasurer and executive vice president of financial operations as well as CFO at Circle. Camp was chosen after a year-long process, according to the company.  Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said that Camp will be a key member of the leadership team, overseeing the company’s financial architecture and acting as an ambassador to investors, regulators and the wide range of industry participants Circle will seek to enroll in its platform.  According to Allaire, Camp brings a wealth of knowledge from his years serving in the banking system, which included time at Deutsche Bank during the birth of the euro.  Allaire also pointed to Camp's unique perspective on digital currencies, telling CoinDesk:  “Paul is a very intelligent person, a very smart person. I think the vision of an Internet platform – a common Internet platform for value exchange – really captured his imagination. I think he’s also at the point in his career where he’s grown these businesses within big companies and was really excited to build something from the ground up.”  Camp is also the latest executive to migrate from the traditional banking and finance world to the cryptocurrency industry.  In October, former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Arthur Levitt joined the advisory boards of BitPay and Vaurum (since renamed Mirror), while last month finance veteran and banking family scion Matthew Mellon took on a volunteer leadership role at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.  History as transactions architect  Throughout the interview, Allaire cited Camp’s 20-odd years in the banking and finance industry, which, in addition to time at JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, includes a stint at Bank of America. Camp left his position at JPMorgan earlier this year.  In particular, Allaire noted Camp’s role in building Deutsche Bank’s euro settlement business into the largest firm of its kind. From the time of the euro’s development in the mid-1990s and through its growing pains in the early 2000s, Camp was in a position to see a new currency system taking shape.  Allaire continued:  ""He got to watch the establishment of a new, multi-country currency with a new electronic, transfer protocol – SEPA – that was built to facilitate that, and all the regulatory issues that emerged with a new, common currency.""  The CEO added that “there’s a pretty good chance” that most businesses that conduct global transactions with a company or consumer in the eurozone are relying on the platform that Camp had a role in developing.

42398063,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFW6z,1418273507,Microsoft Adds Bitcoin Payments for Xbox Games and Mobile Content,"Updated (11th December 14:15 GMT): Additional information from Microsoft's formal announcement added.      Global computing giant Microsoft has added bitcoin as a payment option for a variety of digital content across its online platforms.  According to the company’s payments information page, US-based customers can now use bitcoin to add money to their accounts, which can then be used to purchase content like apps, games and videos from its Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox platforms.  The surprise announcement, which is the result of an integration with Georgia-based bitcoin processor BitPay, adds yet another major tech player to the bitcoin ecosystem – Microsoft boasts a market cap of more than $380bn and annual revenue in excess of $86.8bn in 2014.  Eric Lockard, corporate vice president of Universal Store at Microsoft, later addressed the news in a full blog post that sought to convey to a general audience why it believes the move could be part of a long-term strategy that finds it embracing digital currency.  Lockard said:  ""The use of digital currencies such as bitcoin, while not yet mainstream, is growing beyond the early enthusiasts. We expect this growth to continue and allowing people to use bitcoin to purchase our products and services now allows us to be at the front edge of that trend.”  The integration is only partial, however. Microsoft said it will not accept the digital currency as a direct payment method, though a broader integration could take place in the future.  Microsoft explains:  ""You can only use bitcoin to add money to your Microsoft account and then purchase digital goods at select Microsoft online stores. You can’t use bitcoin to purchase Microsoft products and services directly at this time.""  $5,000 maximum  The page also contains instructions for adding bitcoin to user accounts, including steps for desktop and mobile users. Microsoft outlines consumer considerations for using bitcoin as a payment method, noting the irreversibility of transactions.  The page goes on to explain that customers who add money to their accounts using bitcoin will not be eligible for refunds after transactions are conducted. Customers who believe they have sent an erroneous transaction are encouraged to reach out to the company.  Customers can add up to $1,000 to their Microsoft in a single day, with a $5,000 maximum in place for each account registered by a given individual.  Microsoft builds ties to bitcoin  Microsoft's integration follows a slow but notable progression of events that suggested it would potentially seek to embrace bitcoin.  In February, Microsoft launched an update to its Bing search engine that allowed users to generate bitcoin price conversions. At the time, co-founder and current technology advisor Bill Gates remarked in a Reddit Ask Me Anything that his nonprofit organization, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was interested in digital payments technology in general.  Gates later commented on bitcoin during an October appearance on Bloomberg’s “Street Smart” segment, where he voiced support for the idea of digital money and said that bitcoin was an ""exciting”, though perhaps problematic, solution to ongoing financial pain points.  CoinDesk has reached out to Microsoft for comment and will update this article with more information as the story develops.  Additional reporting provided by Pete Rizzo.
