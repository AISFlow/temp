42382986,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9th7n,1573765515,Wyoming's New Crypto Banking Law Could Defang New York's BitLicense,"There's a way cryptocurrency businesses can get around New York's notoriously hard-to-get BitLicense, and it runs through Wyoming.  At least, so say members of the team that drafted the 13 crypto-friendly laws enacted by the Western state this year. One of those laws allows Wyoming to charter Special Purpose Depository Institutions (SPDIs), a new type of fully-reserved fiat bank that can also custody crypto assets.  With an SPDI, crypto exchanges and other startups could operate in New York without going through the state's licensing rigmarole, under the same legal principles that exempt banks from needing state money transmitter licenses, Wyoming advocates said.  ""We are fairly confident that the Wyoming SPDI will be able to operate in New York without a BitLicense,"" Chris Land, general counsel of the Wyoming Division of Banking, said Tuesday at CoinDesk's Invest: NYC event in New York.  The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which created the BitLicense in 2014, did not answer requests for comment by press time.  The BitLicense was one of the earliest regulations specially crafted for the blockchain industry. But many firms have complained that it is onerous and has driven entrepreneurs and innovators away from New York, the U.S. financial capital.  Only 18 BitLicenses have been granted in the rule's five years of existence. Getting hold of one is known to be a slow and expensive process, and that's if you are in full compliance with all the requirements, which amount to a heavy-duty version of a money transmitter license. Some companies that fell short of NYDFS' expectations have publicly bemoaned the process.  Banking balm  In addition to addressing the BitLicense problem, an SPDI could ease a longstanding pain point for crypto businesses: the difficulty of obtaining banking services.  Once approved for the charter (the statutory minimum capital requirement to apply is $5 million), firms would have master accounts with the Federal Reserve and the own ability to clear their own wires.  In other words, they could literally be their own banks, to use a familiar motif from crypto-land.  ""Some companies might choose to partner with unaffiliated SPDIs and others might choose to create their own affiliated SPDI,"" Caitlin Long, the gubernatorial appointee to the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force, told CoinDesk.  ""The significance is that crypto companies won’t need to rely anymore on the few traditional banks that have been willing to bank the industry,"" she said.  The handful of crypto-friendly banks in the U.S. includes Silvergate in California and Signature and Metropolitan Commercial in New York. Long said one of the best-known of these banks (she wouldn't say which one) employs 65 compliance officers, making the whole business very expensive.  History repeats  If the Wyoming SPDI works out as suggested, it could be seen as an interesting parallel to the way Citi found a clever way to sidestep New York's tough usury laws. The bank made a landmark decision in 1981 to move its credit card operation to South Dakota, where legislators were won over by Citicorp's promise of jobs if that state lifted its usury ceiling.  And as part of the ""far-reaching impact"" of the SPDI, Long said she is optimistic the NYDFS will view the bank charter as trumping the BitLicense since banks have higher capital and regulatory requirements than money transmitters do.  ""The Wyoming SPDI would need to apply to NYDFS to open a branch in New York and NYDFS would need to approve the application, but there’s a lot of favorable case law precedent,"" said Long, a former Morgan Stanley executive. ""So if NYDFS denies the application, I think it would go to litigation and the Wyoming bank would likely prevail.""  Long also sounded optimistic about lawyering up if need be. After she spoke alongside Land on Tuesday's panel, she said, ""multiple New York attorneys came up to volunteer pro bono to help the Wyoming Banking Division litigate if it ever comes to that.""

According to a press release  , the U.S. Department of Justice has charged Eric Meiggs, 21 and Declan Harrington, 20, on counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, computer fraud, abuse and identity theft for allegedly targeting cryptocurrency company executives and other individuals ""who likely had significant amounts of cryptocurrency,"" as well as those ""who had high value or 'OG' (slang for 'Original Gangster') social media account names.""  The two allegedly sought to steal more than $550,000 in cryptocurrency from 10 different individuals, and apparently secured access to two social media accounts.  The victims were not identified, though the indictment briefly described several of their connections to the crypto space. One victim owned a bitcoin teller machine, while another ran a ""blockchain-based business.""  A number of individuals in the cryptocurrency space have fallen victim to SIM swapping, when attackers pose as the owners of a cell phone number, convincing cellular service providers to give them access to the victims' accounts. By taking control of a cell phone number, attackers are able to log into social media and sometimes crypto exchange accounts, giving them access to users' holdings and digital presence.  Messari's Ryan Selkis, Coin Center's Neeraj Agrawal and VideoCoin's Seth Shapiro have all reported facing such issues in recent weeks.  Michael Terpin, a prominent investor in the crypto space, has filed lawsuits after being SIM swapped, taking on both his mobile provider AT&T and the alleged perpetrator. While his case against AT&T is ongoing, he won $75 million in a case against Manhattan resident Nicholas Truglia, 21.  Similarly, Seattle-based Gregg Bennett is suing Bittrex, claiming the exchange failed to act in time to protect against a SIM swap targeting the angel investor.  The DOJ has previously charged another individual, Ohio resident Dawson Bakies, 20, alleging he targeted more than 50 individuals to SIM swap.

The move shows Northern Trust’s continued interest in the technology after it developed then sold its private equities blockchain, which shortens the time to market for new high-tech private equity funds.

42403531,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgG0s,1573755627,DeFi Startup Compound Finance Raises $25 Million Series A Led by A16z,"Lending protocol Compound Finance just raised $25 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z crypto fund, marking one of the largest venture capital investments in a decentralized finance (DeFi) startup to date.  According to DeFi Pulse, Compound has nearly $103 million worth of crypto locked up in its automated system, which can generate returns for users comparable to interest. Today's announcement of the Series A follows Compound’s $8.2 million seed round in 2018.  Much like MakerDAO’s loans, users can take collateralized loans with ethereum-based tokens, with the locked assets automatically liquidating if an independent “oracle” determines the price has dropped too low.  Unlike MakerDAO loans, however, the Compound protocol supports multiple assets and allows people to lock up assets without borrowing. Because these assets are stored in a shared pool, even someone with liquidated collateral could claim tokens if they are able to repay the general pool.  Compound founder Robert Leshner said that so far “teams in crypto that have stockpiles of DAI and crypto” are the most frequent protocol users. This appears to correlate with investors’ interests.  Leshner said this recent round will help the San Francisco-based company further “decentralize” the protocol by setting it up so that crypto exchanges and custodians, like Coinbase, can maintain the protocol going forward.  “We’re planning to integrate Compound into as many custodians, exchanges, wallets, and brokers as we can,” Leshner said, “to allow exchanges and custodians to be the interface of the protocol.”  Leshner said Polychain Capital also participated in this recent venture round along with Paradigm Capital and Bain Capital Ventures.  For now, Leshner said the 12-person Compound team is focused on building this public infrastructure for institutions to tap into, rather than finding a unique business model for the startup itself.  “Our goal is to slowly transition the very limited functions that we control to the community over the next two years,” he said referring to exchanges and custodians. “Our highest priority is building something that is sustainable. … From there we could probably build on top of the protocol.”  Whether the startup’s future is to eventually build its own monetized service or exchange, Leshner said the next focus will be on supporting multi-collateral DAI in late November.

The digital yuan is officially called the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DECP) and the central bank’s announcement came on the heels of a website DECPAPI.com, featuring an API with a countdown indicating that the national stablecoin would launch on November 20.  “Anything that is trading in the market under the name of DC/EP or DCEP is not the national digital currency, and any launch time suggested on the Internet is inaccurate,” the central bank said on Wednesday in the statement.  The bank also warned potential investors of the rise of scams and ponzi schemes being offered in the name of the digital currency.  “We did not authorize any platform to trade DCEP,” the bank said. “Investors should be aware of companies that pose as the central bank to attract people to ‘trade’ the digital currency, which could be fraught with misleading information.”  The PBoC is running the develop of the stablecoin via its Digital Currency Research Institute, established in 2014 under the supervision of the bank’s payments department.  After a relatively quiet five-year development period, the central bank began releasing more details about DCEP following Facebbok’s unveiling of Libra in June.  Forbes reported in August the national digital currency would be launched on Nov.11, citing an unnamed official from the Chinese government.

Ignatov pleaded guilty to multiple counts including money laundering, according to the BBC. The deal was reached Oct. 4, but released publicly Tuesday following his arrest at Los Angles International Airport in March 2019.  He is the brother of OneCoin co-founder Dr Ruja Ignatov, colloquially called “Cryptoqueen"" for her actions in the alleged scam and subsequent disappearance.  Under the terms of the plea, Ignatov will not face further charges as they emerge against OneCoin and its constituents, with the exception of possible tax violations. Still, Ignatov faces up 90 years in prison, the BBC said.  OneCoin raised some $4 billion for its cryptocurrency and proprietary ecosystem in funding, in what multiple governments have called a Ponzi scheme. OneCoin denies those allegations and continues to operate.  The BBC said Ignatov could be moved into the U.S. witness protection program depending on the longevity of his sentence. Court documents say individuals have come forward with threats against him.  While testifying in another ongoing case against Mark Scott, a U.S. lawyer accused of laundering funds $400 million from OneCoin, Ignatov revealed more details about his sister, the BBC said. A warrant for her arrest from the DOJ is currently outstanding.  The BBC said Ignatov told the court that his sister acquired a passport and tickets to Vienna and Athens from her home in Bulgaria. She called OneCoin critics “haters” and was wary of being given up to authorities, he said. Although Ignatov hired a private investigator to find her, he has not spoken to her since her disappearance, according to the BBC.

The device, looking like the love child between a monochromatic cyborg and an Xbox, was made to allow anyone to run a full node without the fuss of downloading an entire blockchain or even having to understand the command line.  The device, which we profiled here a year ago, is now adding more tricks to its arsenal. First, the miner is $100 cheaper, down from $799, and the system now offers 6.5 percent APR on earnings held in Coinmine wallets.  The goal? To get Coinmines into more (early-adopting) homes.  ""As more people purchase Coinmines, the better pricing we can get from our supply chain,"" Coinmine CEO Farbood Nivi told CoinDesk in a video interview in New York. ""Our philosophy is to make things better, faster, and cheaper.""  The company doesn't exactly want a miner in every home, although Nivi as said he wants to expand the market. Instead, he sees the device as a gateway into the world of crypto.  ""Crypto actually creates a single financial world for everyone in the world to live in,"" he said. ""I think you'll have a ton more control over your actual wealth.""

42403539,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgG5n,1573740023,Ledger's Vault Scores $150 Million in Crypto Insurance From Lloyd's Syndicate,"Ledger, the creator of the iconic Nano hardware wallet, is wooing institutional investors to use its technology to custody cryptocurrency for themselves with the help of big-name insurance broker Marsh.  Marsh has arranged a $150 million insurance policy from Lloyd’s of London syndicate Arch for users of the startup's Ledger Vault technology platform, the companies announced Thursday.  The move is another sign that the insurance industry is gradually becoming comfortable writing coverage for digital assets – widely considered a prerequisite for institutional investment.  In the past year, quite a few crypto custodians have trumpeted insurance cover in the hundreds of millions. Unlike those firms, Ledger Vault is not a custodian; rather, it provides tools for investors to store their own crypto.  “We didn’t have to do this. We are buying insurance for the Vault platform at no additional cost to customers of our platform,"" said Demetrios Skalkotos, global head of Ledger Vault.  Ledger’s policy covers third-party theft of private keys in the event of a physical breach of a hardware security module (HSM) in one of its data centers. Also covered is the entirety of the on-boarding process for clients which involves the generation of private keys within the company’s HSMs, as well as collusion within Ledger leading to insider employee theft.  The policy does not, however, cover theft via a third-party remote hack of the type reported fairly regularly at crypto exchanges around the world. The Ledger Vault solution itself is meant to prevent this type of hack by isolating private keys from the internet.  Firms using Ledger Vault set up their own transaction controls and governance procedures. The firm is trying to move away from the frame of reference of online ""hot"" wallets and offline ""cold"" ones, calling itself “temperature-agnostic.""  On top of the new insurance policy, Ledger Vault clients will be well-placed to arrange their own dedicated primary insurance facilitated and “fast-tracked” by Marsh and Arch, the companies said.  “Clients that are part of this insurance program for Ledger Vault have the ability to obtain a dedicated limit that is dependent on the assets held on the Ledger Vault platform,"" said Jennifer Hustwitt, senior vice president at Marsh & McLennan Companies, the insurance broker's parent. ""It would be separate from the $150 [million] that Ledger is purchasing.”  James Croome, vice president of specie at Arch, said in a statement that the syndicate ""spent over six months working with the Ledger Vault team to develop a customized offering for their clients.”  Ledger has sold 1.5 million units of its flagship consumer product, the Nano, a device for storing private keys to crypto wallets.

42403555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgGJZ,1573732803,Bitcoin Hovers Near Price Support as Long-Term Bear Cross Looms,"View  BTC is on the defensive and may face selling pressure in the run up to the bearish crossover of the 100- and 200-day averages.  Prices will likely breach the 50-day average support near $8,550 and extend losses toward $8,000 in the short term.  Confirmation of the bear cross may mark an interim bottom in BTC, according to historical data.  A high-volume move above a three-month descending trendline, currently at $9,200, is needed to revive the bullish view.      Bitcoin risks falling below key support near $8,550, with a widely followed bitcoin price indicator teasing its first bearish turn in over a year.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $8,610 on Bitstamp, having bounced up from the 50-day moving average (MA) support at $8,543 earlier today.  The 50-day MA has been restricting downside since Nov. 8, but may be breached soon, courtesy of a looming bearish crossover between major price averages.  Bitcoin’s 100-day MA (now at $9,436) is now beginning to trend south and looks set to cross below the 200-day MA (at $9,290) in the next couple of days. That would confirm a bearish crossover – the first of these MAs since April 17, 2018.  Seasoned traders would argue that MA crossovers are based on past data and are lagging indicators. While that's true, BTC is already on the defensive, having repeatedly failed to break above a 3.5-month bearish trendline in the last three weeks.  The cryptocurrency has also found acceptance below the 200-day MA – a barometer of long-term trend. As such, the impending bear cross will likely bolster the bearish sentiment and give prices another nudge down.  Daily chart        The cryptocurrency has pulled back from $9,300 to $8,600 in the last few days, validating the bearish view put forward by the multiple rejections at the trendline connecting June and August highs.  The relative strength index is hovering below 50, indicating a bearish bias, while the MACD histogram is producing deeper bars below the zero line – also a sign of strengthening downside momentum.  So, the 50-day MA support at $8,543 could be breached ahead of the bear cross. Below that level, the next major support is seen at $8,000.  The bearish case would weaken if there is a strong bounce from the 50-day MA, but that seems a tall order right now. A high-volume UTC close above the descending trendline hurdle at $9,200 is needed for bullish reversal.  Note that confirmation of the bear cross, however, could mark an interim bottom in BTC, as has been seen historically.  BTC sell-off ran out of steam near $275 two days ahead of a bear cross confirmation on Oct. 7, 2014, following which prices jumped to levels above $400 by mid-October, according to Bitstamp data. Another bear cross on April 29 the same year was followed by consolidation in the range of $420-$450 and a rally to $680 by early June.  And in 2018, prices rallied from $7,900 to levels near $10,000 in the 2.5 weeks following the bear cross in mid-April.  Back then, BTC was better bid in the days leading up to the crossover with prices rising from $6,500 to $8,500. In such situations, looming bearish crossovers barely receive any market attention.

42403536,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgG2q,1573728369,PayPal's Axing of Pornhub Model Payments May Boost Crypto Conversions,"Top adult entertainment site Pornhub may expand the range of cryptocurrencies it offers to pay performers for their work after PayPal abruptly cut off service.  ""We currently pay out in verge and are evaluating adding other cryptocurrency payout options,"" Corey Price, a vice president at Pornhub, told CoinDesk Thursday.  More than 100,000 performers who relied on PayPal ""for their livelihoods"" were affected by its decision to discontinue the service, Pornhub said in a blog post earlier in the day.  The company said it was ""devastated"" by the move and called on those models with PayPal options selected in their accounts to use one of its other provided methods of paying out. These include direct deposits, checks and the verge cryptocurrency.  Pornhub announced it would accept verge payments in April of last year, saying it offered users privacy and convenience. The site also said it would accept tron and zcash last June, although these options weren't passed on as payout options to performers.  With PayPal now withdrawn, it may be that Pornhub performers will increasingly turn to the cryptocurrency option, especially as bank accounts may be frozen if banks get a hint that porn is related to the payments.  At press time, the price of verge (XVG) had risen 2 percent on the day to $0.003860, according to CoinMarketCap.  However, that possibility maybe be somewhat dampened by a lack of knowledge of how to use cryptocurrencies and convert them to more widely usable fiat currencies.  In Pornhub's Twitter announcement of the PayPal block, performer Shyla Jennings reflected that hurdle with the tweet:  ""Crypto, personal portal... LOL. I don’t understand what that even is. I’m cool with just direct deposit into my bank account.""  The thread is further littered with crypto community members calling for Pornhub to widen its payment options to other coins such as bitcoin, litecoin and others.  Dedicated adult industry crypto project SpankChain also made a twin promotion/PayPal criticism with the tweet: ""Clearly somebody deserves to be Spanked.""

42403545,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgGDf,1573722053,Samsung SDS Beefs Up Privacy on Its Business-Grade Blockchain,"Samsung SDS, the enterprise technology arm of the South Korean behemoth, is enhancing privacy on its Nexledger blockchain with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).  The company said Thursday it had formed a partnership with Israel-based QEDIT to record and authenticate the transfer of assets on a shared ledger without revealing underlying confidential information.  The step underscores one of the challenges facing companies adopting distributed ledger technology: broadcasting transactions to a network puts them at risk of exposing sensitive client data and tipping their hands to competitors.  Zero-knowledge proofs, a branch of cryptography that can authenticate data without revealing any details about it, are a common strategy for squaring this circle. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase and ING have used ZKPs in their blockchain forays.  The catch is that ZKPs often require considerable computing power and can gum up the works. But Samsung SDS says this one outperformed.  “The performance of QEDIT’s private asset transfer solution has been exemplary during the rigorous series of testing and trials we conducted,"" said Jeanie Hong, Senior Vice President, Leader of Blockchain Center at Samsung SDS, said in a statement. ""The QEDIT team has consistently demonstrated the ability to horizontally scale ZKP cryptography in a blockchain environment.”  QEDIT co-founder and CEO Jonathan Rouach said his firm’s solution will be useful to Samsung SDS’s Nexledger in areas like banking and supply chain.  “Samsung SDS is very active in supply chain and insurance,” said Rouach. “For instance, Nexledger is used by an 18-bank blockchain consortium in Korea.”  QEDIT has been on something of a tear of late, announcing a close working relationship with professional-services giant Deloitte at the ZKProof Community Event in Amsterdam late last month.  Samsung SDS, which employs about 35,000, many of them software engineers, has been working in the enterprise blockchain space for several years.  Last month at the Blockchain Seoul 2019 conference, Samsung SDS said it had been piloting a blockchain-based medical claims processing system since August. The firm also said it had invested in Blocko, also based in South Korea.  While Samsung SDS' R&D is designed for business-to-business uses, and not the parent company’s mobile phone business, Rouach said the firm is “very interested in privacy-enhancing tech and ZKPs can, of course, be used in many contexts.”  Samsung image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/14/samsung-sds-beefs-up-privacy-on-its-business-grade-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5ca9f2f49d3b404593bf8f6dd24f3aa746e5abb-1500x1143.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403541,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgG7l,1573720334,Crypto.com Grows Offerings With New Exchange and Fundraising Platform,"Crypto.com announced the launch of a new exchange Thursday, in an expansion of the Hong Kong-based firm’s list of crypto services.  The exchange opens up to beta testers Nov. 18 and to the wider public in December, according to a press release. The three-year-old company has also unveiled a fundraising platform for crypto startups.  Previously known for issuing custodial wallets and crypto-backed debit cards, the new exchange bolsters CEO and co-founder Kris Marszalek’s vision of creating full services experiences for his one million wallet holders. Marszalek said the launch is tactical – necessary for Crypto.com’s future.  “In the next bull run, the companies that will surely thrive are those that manage to build an entire ecosystem,” he said. “It's very hard for a company that offers only one type of product to compete with companies with much broader distribution that cover each of the use cases.”  At launch, the exchange will offer three trading pairs, matching CRO – the Crypto.com token – tether (USDT) and bitcoin (BTC) against BTC, ether (ETH), stellar (XLM), XRP, EOS, litecoin (LTC), MCO, CRO and USDT. The company expects to add more assets over time.  It also plans to expand user access points. While the exchange is available via desktop exclusively at launch, Marszalek said mobile users – already accessing Crypto.com’s other services via a consolidated app – will get app access in early 2020.  Also launched Thursday is a blockchain fundraising platform called The Syndicate that gives project builders an avenue to raise capital while keeping equity, Marszalek said. Digital asset issuers provide a certain number of their tokens to Crypto.com for a discounted pre-sale open to holders of the exchange’s native coin, CRO.  “It’s a win win,” Marszalek said. “We pass on all the proceeds from such a token sale back to the project so they have a little bit of capital from this exercise.”  The exchange will add margin trading in 2020 too. Marszalek said other expansions may bring a crypto collateralized “credit card/debit card hybrid” to market as well.  Each works into Marszalek’s wider goal: build a Crypto.com ecosystem so comprehensive, so “sticky,” that new users sign up – and the old ones stay around.  “We think we've nailed the customer acquisition piece and the stickiness of the product before we actually launched the exchange,” Marszalek. “This is the absolute key element.”  Kris Marszalek image via Flickr/RISE",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/14/cryptocom-grows-offerings-with-new-exchange-and-fundraising-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be7752e9f6c560cecc67cb3cce5515acebbe447d-1500x1008.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403551,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgGHb,1573719278,Swiss SIX Exchange Lists Tezos ETP With Staking Rewards,"New financial products are coming to tezos (XTZ), one of a handful major proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains up and running today.  On Thursday, crypto startup Amun AG launched the Amun Tezos exchange-traded product (ETP), tracking the tezos cryptocurrency under the XTYZ ticker on the SIX Swiss Stock Exchange, according to a statement.  Zurich-based Amun’s Tezos ETP is the firm’s ninth crypto-based ETP issued to date on SIX and the firm claims to have some $70 million in assets under management. The product's underlying asset will be held by Coinbase Custody, Amun said.  As a PoS chain product, Amun’s newest ETP will also issue staking rewards – termed ""baking"" in the Tezos system – by Coinbase, which will be automatically reinvested into the holder’s ETP shares. In other words, the longer you hold the product, the larger your underlying share becomes.  “Some staking services initially began as being secluded to a specific blockchain,” Amun CEO Hany Rashwan said in the statement. “Via our ETP, [investors can] participate in the associated rewards for contributing to the security and stability of the Tezos blockchain – without the need to ever have to set up a crypto wallet or taking care of a private key.”  Why Tezos?  Amun and others choosing of tezos speaks to the underlying asset's stability, according to data provider Messari research analyst Wilson Withiam.  “Tezos is quietly becoming a viable option for the issuance of tokenized securities. There’s a growing confidence among security token issuers that tezos can provide the tools and security necessary to facilitate similar efforts,” Withiam said.  Tezos' edge comes down to its consensus mechanism, Withiam said. While other cryptos are transitioning to PoS, Tezos' protocol is up and running. For example, Alliance Investments recently employed Tezos for tokenizing real estate contracts amounting to nearly $650 million this October.  Ethereum is slated to transition to PoS in its next iteration, Ethereum 2.0, in Q1 2020, as is blockchain platform Cardano. How capital will flow onto the newly transitioned PoS platforms is a story yet to be told, however.  “Tezos’ on-chain governance also gives it an interesting dynamic. Security token issuers can participate first hand in the future direction of the protocol,” said Withiam.

The firm plans to list its American Depository Shares on NYSE or NASDAQ with the ticker ""OCFT.""  OneConnect's filing with the SEC today called for a target raise of $100 million, though that figure could go higher.  Reuters reported in September that the company was looking for a New York listing after it failed to go public in Hong Kong with a higher valuation. According to the report, the company had hoped to raise $1 billion through the IPO with a valuation of $8 billion.  OneConnect reported $217.5 million in revenue and net loss of $147 million for the first nine months of 2019, according to the filing. The IPO’s underwriters include Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, HSBC.  The company is a unit of Ping An Insurance and directly backed by Japanese private equity giant SoftBank, which led a Series A funding round valuing OneConnect at $7.5 billion in 2018, according to Ping An's 2018 annual report.  Ping An has filed for the second-most blockchain patents in China, with 274 at the end of the first half of 2019, according to its annual report, which said that OneConnect will dedicate 1 percent of its annual revenue to blockchain development.  OneConnect has eight dedicated research institutes and 50 technology labs working on blockchain projects across financial services industries. Its FiMax blockchain network is said to improve data-sharing and privacy processes, according to a OneConnect white paper.  Grand ambitions  The white paper detailed both its existing and future projects across trade finance, asset securitization and supply-chain financing, as well as 14 use cases that can be applied to sectors outside of banking – including healthcare, real estate and smart-city management.  OneConnect was the first member of the R3 enterprise blockchain consortium in 2016, while exploring some of its applications with the Hyperledger-based technical infrastructure.  Blockchain is one of the company’s four major business lines along with artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services that could use blockchain technologies, according to OneConnect’s website.  Two of its projects were included in the latest blockchain projects registration list filed with the China Cyberspace Administration in October. They included a data analytics platform and a blockchain-based voting and decision-making system.

It's aiming to offer 10 million American depositary shares (ADS) with each at a price of between $9 and $11.  If Canaan receives enough investment interest, the offering would rake in $100 million, making it the first major bitcoin miner maker to go public in the traditional stock market.  With that offering size, it would also mean Canaan commands a diluted market value of about $1.5 billion with about 2.3 billion outstanding ordinary shares after the offering. Each ADS would represent 15 Class A ordinary shares of Canaan, according to the updated filing.  In Canaan's initial IPO filing from late October, the company set a placeholder amount of $400 million for its IPO ambitions. The latest figure may still be revised prior to its final listing.  Previously, Canaan revealed on Nov. 5 that it brought home a profit of $13 million on revenues of $95 million for the third quarter of 2019. It reported a net loss of $45 million for the first half of 2019.
