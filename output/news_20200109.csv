42403782,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgkAE,1578612175,"Is SardineCoin Real? The Sardines Are, At Least","It smelled fishy from the start.      On Wednesday, MY Sardines, a Luxembourg-based company, announced its intention to launch a cryptocurrency backed by – are you sitting? – vintage sardines.      Word of the unconventional initial coin offering (ICO) prompted piscine puns, stimulated discussions about fractional reserve banking and ""flummoxed one hack,"" according to Decrypt Media.      Between the novel collateral, a white paper thin on details (who is the unnamed external auditor for the stock of sardines?) and an April 1 (April Fools’ Day) end date for the sale, crypto commentators suspected SardineCoin was an elaborate prank.      This much is clear: It’s not a fluke.      CoinDesk found the MY Sardines booth at CES 2020, the long-running consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas. And the company did present actual sardine tins and mySardines.com cards to casual passersby and attendees.      “It’s an investment [that’s] really safe,” said co-founder and CEO Charlotte Ripetti. “There’s no speculation. We have the stock of sardines and then we’re going to create the coin based on the stock.”      The firm says it’s working with a French distributor called Pearl of the Gods to supply the sardines. The company would purchase the tins on Sept. 1, create and distribute the tokens on ethereum shortly after and allow investors to redeem their tokens for cans (1:1, just like tether!) any time over the next 10 years. According to the white paper, investors will not be able to redeem tokens for cash.      It turns out this isn’t the first token sale the company’s run. It ran a test ICO late last year, ordering 3,600 tins from the 2016, 2017 and 2018 vintages with a token distribution planned for the end of this month.      Roughly 75 percent of the funds from the ongoing sale raised would go to buying cans, with the remainder covering operating expenses.      Ripettisaid the company expects the cans to appreciate 20 percent in value per year (though, again, tokens cannot be redeemed for cash). Those looking to acquire the sardine cans can either go to Luxembourg and visit MY Sardine’s secure fish facilities (giving “cold storage” a whole new meaning) or pay for shipping (and insurance, should they want it).      But why back the stablecoin with sardines?

42403780,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgk9F,1578608717,MakerDAO Pitches DeFi to the Masses at CES 2020,"LAS VEGAS – There's a ""digital money"" section on the show floor of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, but MakerDAO is the only digital money with a booth there.      There are a couple of other crypto wallets, security firms and a bitcoin ATM company, but ethereum's favorite stablecoin is the only cryptocurrency directly represented.      MakerDAO Foundation Head of Business Development Gregory DiPrisco had a straightforward answer for why the organization chose to take a space in Vegas.      ""It's about opening doors to companies that otherwise we'd have to put a lot of effort into accessing. Obviously, everybody is here,"" DiPrisco told CoinDesk.      In other words, CES is the kind of place where the MakerDAO Foundation is able to meet executives that would otherwise be hard to reach.      MakerDAO is a protocol that allows people to stake ethereum and borrow a portion of its value in DAI, a token designed to maintain its value at parity with the U.S. dollar. There is $376 million in ETH locked in MakerDAO right now, according to DeFi Pulse.      It's worth noting that right now there are two kinds of DAI in existence as the community transitions to multi-collateral DAI.    Outreach    As one example of the kinds of companies the MakerDAO Foundation is trying to reach in Las Vegas, DiPrisco said he had a conversation with someone setting up an online bank in the Philippines.      ""We could make great alternative infrastructure to the legacy banking system in the country,"" he said. The most obvious benefit, according to DiPrisco, is that the bank could offer a much higher savings rate on deposits. MakerDAO’s governance-token holders voted to raise the DAI Savings Rate to 6 percent on Wednesday, up from the previous 4 percent.      More broadly, DiPrisco said, ""We're going to try to meet people at this conference who can offer access to the DAI Savings Rate through their distribution channels.""      Steve Becker, chief operating officer at the MakerDAO Foundation, said that when he asks people if they trust their bank, they tell him they don't really have a choice in the matter. When he tells them that decentralization gives them another option, he said he tells them:    ""'You have sovereignty over your own money, what do you think about that?' It takes a while to think about it and ask, 'What does that really mean to me?' It means that if your bank fails, your money still stays pretty safe.""    Becker said MakerDAO came to CES because it is focused on finding where crypto derives its value. ""For us the value is in the intersection of the blockchain world with the analog world,"" Becker said.    Making the case    On the show floor, MakerDAO staff are talking to people about how DAI is actually usable.      For example, the company is showing off its integration with Pundi X, which makes a special card and point-of-sale system that allows users to pay merchants directly in DAI, without any conversion to fiat. These units, DiPrisco said, have mostly been taken up in developing-world countries with unstable fiat currencies.      More salient to an American audience, MakerDAO staffers are showing off their recent integration with the OKEx crypto exchange. The exchange is running a promotion right now where DAI holders can earn an extra 1 percent on their DAI holdings.      MakerDAO introduced the DAI Savings Rate in November. Holders who choose to stake their DAI can earn a portion of the “stability fee” that borrowers pay, earning a much higher return than they would on fiat savings in a U.S. bank, for example.      ""We just haven't seen these kinds of returns on U.S.-dollar-based deposits in this decade,"" DiPrisco said.      As to the reception he’s faced at the MakerDAO booth, DiPrisco said it’s been generally positive.      ""I haven't seen anybody say, ‘I'm going to go to the bank and take out all my money,’ but I do think they are pleasantly surprised to hear about it,” he said. “I think it's really the first time we're interfacing with this crowd and it's very new to them, so I think they need a little time to digest.""",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MKR | DAI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/09/makerdao-pitches-defi-to-the-masses-at-ces-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d38829efdafa413bdaed6e814a6699eca57b662c-2167x1625.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Unveiling a vision for 2030, the Facebook CEO unveiled a laundry list of decade's-end aims for his social media Goliath, including an extensive ""opportunity"" for Facebook to ""decentralize"" finance and business.      “Over the next decade, we hope to build the commerce and payments tools so that every small business has easy access to the same technology that previously only big companies have had,” Zuckerberg said in the post.      That vision includes Instagram storefronts, Messenger-based customer support, remittances via WhatsApp – technologies that Facebook has already been pursuing. Zuckerberg hopes his company's efforts will ""go a long way towards creating more opportunity around the world.""      One project he does not mention: Libra, the controversial stablecoin Facebook formally announced last summer.      To be fair, Facebook's crypto subsidiary, Calibra, is only one of 20 or so consortium members supporting the stablecoin. Facebook claims it will be hands-off with the cryptocurrency it created.      The Libra Association, the governing council for the project, touts itself as on a mission to “empower billions of people through the creation of a simple global currency and financial infrastructure.”      Zuckerberg has formally kept some distance from the Libra project, and he does not run the association. However, he has still testified before Congress about it, as has his deputy David Marcus.      It may be that Zuckerberg sought to speak to Libra without invoking its name. As TechCrunch notes, in other parts of his 10-year plan he alludes to virtual reality without mentioning Facebook's Oculus subsidiary.      But while Zuckerberg neglects Libra, he does seem to address the hail of criticism regulators around the world have lobbed his way. Many policymakers and economic bureaucrats have harped on Libra as a potentially catastrophic danger to the financial world order.      Those critiques are in addition to Facebook’s rhetorical war on other regulatory fronts, including data privacy and election tampering.      Here, Zuckerberg allows that the company should work in tandem with governments – at least as long as those governments stay afloat.      “As long as our governments are seen as legitimate, rules established through a democratic process could add more legitimacy and trust than rules defined by companies alone,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/09/facebooks-zuckerberg-highlights-digital-commerce-but-not-libra-in-2030-vision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/824fd01d76d0f3b4a607ce4dd804d24999642a39-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Thursday, the Amsterdam-based crypto derivatives exchange will operate out of Panama as DRB Panama Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of current platform Deribit B.V., beginning Feb. 10.      The company claimed the Netherlands’ presumed adoption of “very strict” anti-money laundering (AML) regulations applied to cryptocurrency firms spurred the trans-Atlantic voyage.      “If Deribit falls under these new regulations, this would mean that we have to demand an extensive amount of information from our current and future customers,” the exchange wrote in a blog post.      Rumors concerning Deribit’s position within the Netherlands began in October 2019 following CEO John Jansen’s appearance on the Flippening podcast. Over the winter months, numerous Dutch crypto firms engaged in a back and forth with Dutch regulators over the nation’s self-guided implementation of the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD 5).      “We believe that crypto markets should be freely available to most, and the new regulations would put too-high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise,” Deribit wrote.      Surprisingly, additional know-your-customer (KYC) regulations were also announced by the exchange Thursday. U.S. customers are still barred from operating on the exchange, which does not process fiat currency.

42403762,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgjtV,1578598315,Illinois Legalizes Blockchain Contracts,"With the new year Illinois became the latest state to recognize smart contracts and other blockchain-based records as legal instruments.      The state’s “Blockchain Technology Act,” sponsored by Rep. Keith Wheeler (R), took effect Jan. 1, opening a slew of potential new legal scenarios for blockchain-based contracts. These contracts are now admissible as evidence in court, recognized as a viable alternative to paper-based records and statutorily exempt from local taxation.      “A smart contract, record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because a blockchain was used to create, store or verify the smart contract, record or signature,” the law reads in part.      Illinois joins other U.S. states in recognizing smart contracts in legal settings. Vermont led the charge with its 2016 move to make blockchain records admissible in court. One year later, Arizona passed similar legislation recognizing blockchain signatures.      The Illinois law extends the same legal recognition already enjoyed by paper contracts to blockchain contracts and agreements so that they are recognized as legally binding in the eyes of the state.      It also shields the blockchain industry from local government interference, meaning cities and towns cannot impose taxes and regulations or require licensing or permits on blockchain systems or those who use them.      “The law ensures that businesses and individual community members will not have to navigate a patchwork of local blockchain regulation,” said Alison Mangiero, president of blockchain technology company TQ Tezos and a proponent of the bill.      Its backers in the Illinois State legislature hailed the bill when it was passed as a means of providing companies and businesses with a legal framework for embracing new technologies. Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the measure into law in August.      Mangiero agrees. She said legal certainty and stability will allow firms to focus their efforts on developing new uses for the technology, including facilitating transactions.      Tatyana Ruderman, counsel at InfoLawGroup’s Chicago offices, said the law may well bolster companies looking to utilize blockchain-based records systems. But she said the law’s wording is vague in places, enough so that she predicts it could face a legal challenge.      “The law is likely to be tested in courts by parties who later want to try and invalidate a blockchain transaction, she said.      Ruderman added the Illinois law’s success may be hindered by its borders. Just because Illinois recognizes blockchain and smart contracts doesn’t mean a different state, like neighboring Indiana, will do the same.      “It may not make sense for businesses who operate outside of Illinois to implement blockchain-based contract management only in Illinois and not elsewhere,” she said. “This may be an area where it makes sense for industry to come together and agree on some standards to fill the gaps.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/09/illinois-legalizes-blockchain-contracts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d5877d4c51309d60a12f6597ba4a1e031d8da77-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

WisdomTree was the lead investor in the $17.65 million Series A funding round announced Tuesday. Other investors include the state-backed Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), Japanese financial services giant Monex Group and venture capital firms RRE Ventures, Strawberry Creek Ventures and Panthera Capital Investments.  As the lead investor, WisdomTree put some $8 million into the round, WisdomTree founder and CEO Jonathan Steinberg told CoinDesk in a phone interview.  WisdomTree recently launched its own bitcoin ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange. So far, U.S. regulators have yet to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), rejecting over a dozen proposals in the past two years. The WisdomTree product competes with a similarly physically backed bitcoin ETP on SIX from Amun AG.  WisdomTree says the investment in Securrency came down to the focused use of blockchain technology in a sea of misapplications. Regulatory compliance and adaptability was a must for the firm, Steinberg said.  “The financial services industry is created explicitly around know-your-customer and anti-money laundering and these are not going to be softened,” Steinberg said. “Know-your-customer is literally the foundation of regulated financial services.”  ETF disruption  WisdomTree’s Steinberg said tokenized financial products could be to ETFs “what the internet was to newspapers” in terms of disruptive force. During the mid-2000s, WisdomTree took a forward position on the initiation of ETFs over typical mutual funds and is looking to do the same with blockchain-wrapped financial products, Steinberg said.  “Is there a wrapper potentially coming down the pike that could do to ETFs what ETFs did to mutual funds?” Steinberg said he told his strategy team. “I believe that it could be the blockchain wrapper.”  Securrency intends to use the new funding to further develop blockchain-based ETF services, according to a press release. Additionally, the startup will continue building relationships with tangential firms such as the government-backed ADIO.  Securrency’s “Compliance Aware Token” platform offers a blockchain-agnostic program for exchanging real and financial assets, particularly global digital securities, according to publicly available trademark details. WisdomTree’s liquidity, as a Nasdaq-listed firm with $64 billion in assets under management, will help spread the technology to new users, said Securrency CEO Dan Doney.  WisdomTree operates branches in the United States, Canada and the European Union, according to the company’s website. The firm launched its first ETF in 2006 and claims to be the only publicly traded asset manager centered on the exchange-traded product (ETP) sector.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/09/etf-giant-leads-177m-series-a-for-blockchain-compliance-startup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e03be4a47aeac17a172645b3eb3a124a25a422ca-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Levine: It’s JANUARY 9, 2020, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      DAILY NEWS ROUNDUP      Brad Keoun: Bitcoin down today for the second straight day, slipping just below $8,000 about halfway through the trading day      The market apparently taking a breather after a pretty dramatic rally at the start of the year, but prices still up about 10 percent so far in 2020      Adam: Now there’s a raging debate among investors over whether bitcoin should be considered a risky asset that trades like U.S. stocks, or a safe-haven asset that trades like gold.      Bitcoin’s price surge, in the wake of the U.S. killing earlier this month of Iran’s top commander, lent credence to the safe-haven narrative.      And one thing that’s interesting here, Brad, is that as we see a de-escalation of some of the tensions between the U.S. and Iran, we’re seeing bitcoin trade off a little bit.      Brad: Turning to the news, the appointment of Kelly Loeffler, former CEO of the crypto exchange Bakkt, to serve as the new U.S. senator from Georgia is raising some thorny questions about conflicts of interest.      That’s partly because her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is CEO of Bakkt’s parent company, the Intercontinental Exchange, whose biggest competitor is the Chicago futures exchange CME, which also operates in the crypto markets.      Many crypto industry advocates were thrilled when Loeffler was appointed to the Senate, believing she would serve as an informed voice in the U.S. Congress.      And on Wednesday the news emerged that, indeed, Loeffler will serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the primary regulator that oversees U.S. futures exchanges, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.      But amid concerns the appointment might create a conflict of interest, Loeffler told the Wall Street Journal she would recuse herself if needed on a case by case basis.      Adam: And - in the closely watched market for stablecoins, the competition seems to be getting more fierce.      Circle’s USD Coin, a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, recently surpassed $500 million in deposits, only the second stablecoin to do so after Tether, and it’s now getting a listing on Kraken, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange.      On Wednesday, Kraken enabled USD Coin trading pairs with bitcoin, ether and tether, as well as the U.S. dollar and euro, and the exchange said USD Coin enjoys unparalleled support from more than 100 companies and 60 exchanges across the crypto industry.      But the rival exchange Binance, which is trying to promote its own stablecoin, said it would delist certain USD Coin trading pairs.      Binance’s colorful but controversial CEO, known as CZ, tweeted that it’s “nothing personal, just low liquidity. No one’s trading it.”      Brad: Finally, in the latest twist in the mysterious case of QuadrigaCX, a crypto exchange that collapsed last year after the death of its founder, a New York hedge fund is seeking to buy claims for pennies on the dollar from users who are still hoping to get their money back.      The effort by Argo Partners, which also has offered to buy speculative claims in the case of another defunct crypto exchange, Mt. Gox, comes as some creditor groups are so suspicious of the circumstances surrounding the missing funds they want to exhume the reportedly buried body of Quadriga founder and CEO Gerald Cotten.      Cotten’s widow reported that Quadriga held more than 180 million Canadian dollars worth of crypto at the time of the collapse, but an investigation by Ernst & Young indicates that most of it is gone.            Segment 2 - Featured Story      Adam: Turning to today’s featured story, we’re taking a look at the rise and, I’m not sure if you’d call it a fall or a temporary setback, of the newly launched, high-profile crypto journal Nakamoto.com. Initially there was excitement about the project, with its Jan. 3 launch having all the hallmarks of rapid growth, big name contributors and general interest that outweighed the newness of the outlet.      From its Twitter announcement, the outlet described itself as      “a new general interest journal for the crypto community.”      Our goal with Nakamoto is to create a venue for technical, philosophical, and cultural writing that is of interest to the community as a whole, for beginner and expert alike. We want to discuss what is important even if not new, and avoid what is new yet unimportant.      All Nakamoto contributors are pro-bitcoin (BTC) for the long term. We believe a commitment to the success of bitcoin reflects core values of our community. Beyond that, we are ecumenical and publish a variety of points of view.      (source) https://twitter.com/nakamoto/status/1213336796379205632      Pretty quickly, though, things changed and the response from some parts of the bitcoin community went negative, with takes ranging from @iamnomad’s      “this seems like virtue signaling via tha nakamoto name so far. hope you can prove me wrong.”  With many others demonstrating a lot less patience.      “First article I read here shilled both #Ethereum and #XRP.      I'll pass. The time to ""tolerate"" scammy failed projects as useful is in the past.”      Things degraded further in Nakamoto.com’s Telegram channel, whose membership immediately ballooned into the thousands and quickly grew out of control, at least from the perspective of the moderators.      With all the attention, some high-profile contributors including Tuur Demeester resigned as a way to avoid “the drama” that, in its first week at least, has surrounded and to a lesser extent defined how the project is being perceived.      The complaints being lobbed against Nakamoto.com are, to simplify, that by talking about things other than bitcoin yet by naming its journal after the mysterious bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, it is either misleading people who are there to read about bitcoin or effectively taking the Nakamoto name in vain.      This basic idea is known as Bitcoin Maximalism. It's a form of fundamentalism like you see in just about every religion or movement once it grows past a certain size. If bitcoin were a traditional company, it could have fans but it would also have a clear leader who defines and may even change the goals, and who ultimately is responsible for the project.      But bitcoin is not like that. It’s creators publicly abandoned the project in 2011, and that lack of structured, rigid leadership is a defining characteristic. But it also means that to its strictest fans, bitcoin needs to be protected from others who would take its name in vain or try to co-opt the movement with other projects, technologies or interests.      Does bitcoin need such protection? That’s up for debate. Actually it sounds like a perfect debate for Nakamoto.com to host, if it survives.      (Transition to Spotlight - SEGMENT 3)      Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at a new report from the data provider Messari on bitcoin’s upcoming halving expected in May, shaping up as one of the year most hotly anticipated events in crypto markets - and also one of the most hotly contested.       One of the biggest debates among crypto investors and analysts as we enter 2020 over what will happen to the price of bitcoin this year as the world’s oldest and largest digital asset undergoes the once-every-four-years process known as the halving.      This will be just the third halving in bitcoin’s short 11-year history, so there’s a raging debate among investors and analysts on whether this time will be the same or different.      The halving is a key event in the life cycle of the bitcoin blockchain, encoded into the original programming set more than a decade ago.      It was designed as a way of providing hard limits to the inflation possible in this new type of money, sort of baked into the monetary constitution, if you will - contrasted with government-issued currencies, where humans appointed to run central banks make decisions every couple months or even on the fly on how much new money to print.      With bitcoin, the new supply comes from the data blocks mined roughly every 10 minutes on average, and when that happens the computer or pool of computers that wins that block gets a mining reward, currently set at 12.5 bitcoin.      But this reward gets cut in half every four years, and sometime in May the reward will get cut to 6.25 bitcoin.      Some analysts say that bitcoin’s prior halvings contributed to the big rallies we’ve seen over the past decade, and a big German bank predicted last year bitcoin’s price could jump to $90,000 this year because of the halving.      But some analysts say this time it might be different, ostensibly since the market is more mature and since more investors now understand how the economics work around these halvings.      A new forecast from analysts at the data provider Messari fit into the latter camp.      Messari analysts Ryan Watkins and Jack Purdy argued in a post on Wednesday that some of the popular bull theories for the halving "" have little fundamental basis and that the event is a self-fulfilling prophecy at best "".      The analysts argue bitcoin markets are generally efficient, but that there still may be a what they call a “hype supply cycle” that causes traders to ""trade the narrative anyway"".      In summary, the Messari analysts are essentially arguing that the key to the halving cycle might not be an understanding of economics of bitcoin, such as the mining-rewards reduction, or even a question of whether savvy crypto traders have already accounted for this known event in their pricing models, but rather simply an exercise in mania and ""another four-year cycle of silly models"" that takes bitcoin prices to new highs.

42394019,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsTUMJ,1578583706,"Bitcoin Sign Guy Is Back, Bringing Sound Money to Urbit's 'Sound Computer'","If bitcoin is digital cash and ethereum is digital law, Urbit is digital land.  The highly ambitious cloud computing project imagines nothing less than a rewiring of the internet, allowing users, not corporations, to own their online identities and data. While most blockchain projects rely on Amazon Web Services and other behemoths for essential infrastructure, Urbit goes back to first principles.  And 2020 could be Urbit’s big moment. After years of trickling development, and not a little controversy owing to its connections to an online fringe movement, the project finally plans to ship.  Urbit quietly has built bitcoin integrations and added an iconic crypto personality to its roster of developers: Bitcoin Sign Guy. B.S.G., also known as Christian Langalis, made headlines as a 22-year-old holding up a “Buy Bitcoin'' sign behind then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Captured on C-SPAN, a screenshot became a widely circulated meme across the crypto space, and Bitcoin Sign Guy an inadvertent hero.  After years of laying low, Langalis wants to see bitcoin gain mass adoption and thinks his work with Urbit is the way to do it.  “Sound money deserves a sound computer,” Langalis is fond of saying.  Urbit enables anyone to run his or her own server, with far more ease than current available options. Instead of handing personal data to Facebook and Google for the privilege of using their platforms, users maintain ownership for themselves. It’s built as an alternative to the centralized web, where nearly all activity is managed by a handful of monoliths.  Online citizens  At its core, Urbit is a way of marrying all online services – including a user’s social graph, messages and photo collections – to a stable identity.  “We've built Urbit to be a cloud-native computer that you can use for your whole digital life,” Galen Wolfe-Pauly, CEO of Tlon, the startup primarily responsible for developing Urbit, said in an email. “To really satisfy that, Urbit users have to be able to transact with one another.”  Sound money deserves a sound computer.  Langalis is a project lead at Tlon, where his main remit is to integrate bitcoin into the ecosystem. If Urbit needs a currency to fulfill its aims of complete digital citizenship, Langalis thinks bitcoin needs a decentralized platform to be used “safely and effectively.”  Bitcoin and Urbit, he thinks, form a symbiotic pair (and a nice portmanteau), representing a move towards a fully realized, decentralized existence. At the heart of both bitcoin and Urbit is the notion of digital sovereignty, meaning users aren’t beholden to the coercive effects of a higher authority.  “Much as bitcoin seeks a return to neutral monetary systems, Urbit seeks neutral computing infrastructure,” Langalis said in a phone call.  Though Tlon is moving slowly with the integration – the firm placed a single bounty to add bitcoin to the Urbit wallet on Dec. 9 – bitcoin will ultimately serve as “money primitive” for the ecosystem looking to out-compete the internet. After the wallet will come a node implementation, lightning capability and user-designed apps denominated in the cryptocurrency. There will also be an Urbit storefront page.  “The litany of bitcoin stuff we’re working on is growing by the day. It started with a bitcoin node and is moving to custodying keys like MacOS and creating an atomic swap between bitcoin and Urbit address so you won’t need to own anything but bitcoin to purchase an Urbit address,” he said. The features should ship in Q2.  Bitcoin or bust  Langalis approached Tlon over the summer and suggested its developers integrate bitcoin. At the time, Langalis had been attending Urbit Meetups in San Francisco for a year and half. His interest in the operating system stemmed from his obsession with bitcoin.  A self-defined “bitcoin maximalist,” Langalis fell down the rabbit hole searching for virtual liberty. He started using virtual privacy networks (VPN) to cloak his internet activity but was frustrated by their unreliability. He invokes American whistleblower Edward Snowden when saying, “Privacy protections might have a minor effect, but you’re still being tracked.” After failing to spin up his own email server – it was beyond his technical knowledge – Langalis searched and found that “all the things I wanted to do, that I couldn’t, are possible with Urbit.”  Namely, Langalis wants to own his data and make sure it never leaks.  “People have strong affinity with Urbit if they value digital sovereignty, demand secure and robust systems, and prefer that systems are as simple as possible from a ‘dev’ perspective,” he said.  In this sense, Langalis said bitcoin proves itself again and again to be the most secure chain. “It’s the only credible option for cryptocurrency being money.”  Signing off  Money – at least on the internet – is just another form of data. One of bitcoin’s major breakthroughs was in solving the double-spend problem, removing the need for a trusted third party to verify if a sequence of bytes is legitimate. That means bitcoin is as the code says.  However, a decade after the protocol was first released, bitcoin is rarely used as the peer-to-peer payment system for which it was theorized. Bitcoin exists on exchanges, in custodial wallets, and on platforms that run on third-party servers. This reintroduces the risks – of security and coercion – that bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, sought to mitigate.  “Bitcoin itself is quite hardened, but all of the tools we use to interact with it are questionable,” Nic Carter, co-founder of the VC Castle Island Ventures, said in a Telegram exchange. He's said previously he knows of a number of exchanges that run on centralized cloud servers but wouldn’t name them.  Langalis, too, is skeptical of bitcoin infrastructure that relies on a centralized server or service, which could theoretically expose users to “state coercion.” “Feds will limit the control you have over your BTC, enforce KYC, expropriate it, etc,” he said.  Urbit and bitcoin are only the beginning of the mouse war against the cat called the authoritarian internet.  In this sense, Urbit, as a decentralized computing system, is a way to return security to bitcoin, by returning it to its peer-to-peer state. “The less systemic we can make bitcoin usage, the more stable it is,” he said. “Making it easier for people to run Bitcoin nodes, sign Bitcoin transactions, and engage in online commerce is part of how Urbit will address this objective.”  Still, Alexander Bard, the Swedish cyber-philosophist, sees a bumpy road ahead for such endeavors.  “Urbit and bitcoin are only the beginning of the mouse war against the cat called the authoritarian internet, exemplified by Xi Jinping's idea of himself as the Chinese Messiah and the NSA as its infantile mimicry,” he said.  The webs we weave  There are 13 servers that run the domain name system (DNS) hierarchy, the backbone of the internet as most know it. Like other components of the web, this decision was a contingency of the internet’s haphazard development over the past half century.  “We’re inundated by a technical debt of large mainframe computers and networks that were bolted together,” said Kenny Rowe, a consultant for Tlon, working on integrating ethereum to Urbit, and early contributor on MakerDAO. The history of the internet is essentially one of rapid development being outpaced by growing demand. Protocols like Unix and HTTP, the foundational blocks of the web, are arguably ill-equipped to meet the strain of modern computing. These systems have been patched and hacked over time, leading to inefficiencies and vulnerabilities, he said. And the problems will only compound as more and more of daily life goes digital.  Urbit’s designers made the choice to throw everything away and build a new stack. “A reboot was needed because you can’t reform the centralized system. You can only build on top of it,” Rowe said. The new stack starts with a bespoke programming language, Hoon. They also built a virtual machine, an operating system, and a peer-to-peer network. “This is like inventing the personal computer, the internet, email, and FTP [File Transfer Protocol, a way to send files] all at the same time. The goal is nothing less than a complete overhaul of the personal computer and internet,” Rowe said.  Though Urbit is a complete reworking of personal computing, there are parts that closely mirror the conventional web. Urbit’s routing system is composed of 255 galaxies, 65,000 stars and four billion planets, with 4.3 trillion moons, which, in turn, function similarly to DNSs, ISPs, personal computers and devices that connect to them. The difference “is that Urbit IDs are owned cryptographically by many different people,” according to a company blog.  In other words, there’s not a centralized unit that distributes network participants. Galaxy Urbits distribute star Urbits, and star Urbits distribute planet Urbits, forming a communication and identification layer over the network of personally run servers. But it’s not an immutable arrangement; each Urbit is free to move to other parts of the universe if it wants. And, despite the cosmological address hierarchy, communication between network participants is designed to be peer to peer.  Individual Urbits are represented by a human readable namespace and have a cryptographic passkey to log in to the operating system. These Urbit IDs are stored on the ethereum blockchain. Like other cryptographic assets, Urbit IDs have value. Users are expected to pay a nominal fee for them so the network isn’t inundated by low-effort trolls or spammers.  Reputation is highly valued by the developers. Though bad actors cannot be kicked off the platform at large – as is possible in a centralized client/server relation, like Twitter disabling an account associated with making threats – Urbit’s galaxies or stars can refuse to validate these users, essentially leaving them floating in space. Isolated, but not deplatformed, these users will still maintain complete ownership over their data. And unlike the traditional internet where namespaces, URLs and webpages are mutable, a user’s Urbit preserves an immutable record of their communications, similar to how reputations follow you around in meat-space.  “C. Guy Martian”  Urbit was conceived in 2002 by Curtis Guy Yarvin, a contentious figure in the tech scene for his political writings, under the nom du plume Mencius Moldbug, that argue for the replacement of democracy with an authoritarian, neo-monarchist order. Yarvin’s sprawling, esoteric blog posts are thought to have inspired the alt-right, and have been read by some as supporting race science and slavery.  For the next 11 years, Yarvin built the guts of Urbit, all while blogging about CEO-kings ruling a patchwork of nations. In 2013, he raised $1.1 million from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and launched Tlon (named after a parallel universe in a Jorge Luis Borges story). A team of five began turning Yarvin’s vaporware into an operational cloud computing system.  Then, in early 2019, shortly after Urbit ID was deployed to the ethereum blockchain, Yarvin announced he would step down from the corporation and project. “I'm a thinker, not a doer; an explorer, not a leader; an author, not a maintainer. My goal was always to fire myself at the first possible opportunity. I'm super happy to reach it,” he wrote at the time. Unlike Satoshi, who also walked away from a functioning system, Yarvin left behind a divisive legacy that still follows the project.  “Curtis had the audacity to try to tackle the problem of building the whole stack,” Wolfe-Pauly, who came to the project in 2013, said. “Most of the people who have come to work on this project, myself included, had dreamed about doing this. Curtis' original designs worked well to motivate other people to actually realize them. He was never the guy to actually see it through.” In Yarvin’s own words, “For me, there are always two Urbits: the Urbit that exists, and the Urbit that should exist.” Yarvin did not respond to a request for comment.  “Urbit has evolved quite some distance from Curtis' original sketch. It's sort of like Urbit in 2013 was a PhD thesis — and we've taken it from a paper to a reality,” Wolfe-Pauly said. According to him, the system has been almost entirely rewritten by the current Tlon team, in preparation of onboarding the general public. Under Yarvin’s stewardship, the working directive was to ship a basic model and encourage only the technically proficient to begin playing with the system.  Reboot  In the first quarter of 2020, Tlon plans to ship the first complete release of Urbit. The designers have called it the “Nokia 3310 of cloud computers,” perhaps an oblique reference to Yarvin’s work developing microbrowsers for cell phones, early in his career. At launch, the system will essentially function like Slack, a place for communities of people to chat and share links. Tlon has been using this feature day to day, and is working on a G Suite-like service for Urbit.  This version of the operating system will exist on an internet browser, until an app is launched as a part of OS 2 in the second quarter. It’s with this second upgrade that peer-to-peer cryptocurrency payments in bitcoin and ethereum will be possible. “Think CashApp for Urbit,” Langalis said.  Considering the slow pace of development and that Urbit has yet to be audited, not everyone in the early ecosystem is convinced this is a good thing. “Urbit is definitely not a sound computer, and won't be for a while yet. I'll trust it with my bitcoins after I trust it for everything else. It has to succeed at its own mission before it can succeed as a wallet,” said Brenton Milne, an Urbit hobbyist or “Martian.”  Disempowering the deepcloud  Urbit is often explained as a digital homesteading experiment. It’s a way to drop off the grid and return to the basics of computing. Today, a handful of corporate entities control most of the activity online. MEGACORP, as these commercial entities are called in Urbit’s parlance, set the parameters of discourse and often have total say over a user’s experience. Platforms like Facebook, Google and Medium offer users a tradeoff: use our servers in exchange for your data, often without limits on what they can do with it.  “I think it's been very damaging to society to have our means of communication be optimized for the profit of platform owners rather than the interests of their users, and I think that this has led to mass psychology being damaged – outrage and conflict keep people clicking,” said decentralized web enthusiast Dave Kammeyer, CEO of Mentality.io, a machine learning startup.  Rowe, the Tlon consultant, doesn’t think the traditional web is going anywhere, but that Urbit offers users a chance of setting up a geodesic dome insulated from some of the more pernicious features of the “surveillance web.” Milne thinks Urbit has a ""long-shot potential to upend the internet,"" but another likely scenario is it merely develops into a sustainable ecosystem for geeks and hackers.  “What bitcoin is to paper money, Urbit is to land,” said Justin Murphy, an author and political scientist interested in internet subcultures. “The more bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies penetrate our everyday lives, I think, the more people will want their entire computing experience to be similar.” Carter sees the circle running in the opposite direction: If Urbit provides a meaningful identity ""disentangled from meatspace"" it will become ""a vital tool in catalyzing the closed-loop bitcoin economy.""  Speaking to his years of pseudo-anonymity as Bitcoin Sign Guy, Langalis said he never wanted his reputation to overshadow his work for bitcoin. “It was an identity I enjoyed being, but I didn’t want to get typecast as that guy.” Two years on, he’s just as tenacious about building bridges and evangelizing for bitcoin. “Urbit is the way I can contribute.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/09/bitcoin-sign-guy-is-back-bringing-sound-money-to-urbits-sound-computer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eeae30438575a7445e418a23d3f6f357a9e7dbdd-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Moscow-based Kaspersky Labs has been analyzing new attacks from the Lazarus Group, a cybercrime group with links to North Korea, to determine how its techniques have developed since the AppleJesus attack on several cryptocurrency exchanges in 2018.      In research published Wednessday, the cybersecurity firm said there have been ""significant changes to the group's attack methodology.""      One case study involved what appeared to be a software update for a fake cryptocurrency wallet that, once downloaded, began to transmit user data to hackers. Another example involved creating a backdoor for Mac software that bypassed security mechanisms without the computer ever being aware it was under attack.      A seemingly new attack vector has been to deliver malware via files distributed on the Telegram messaging app. Researchers found computers downloaded manipulated software, which originated from the group's website, with embedded malware that would send sensitive data to hackers without the victim even being aware.      Many of these channels were for fake cryptocurrency companies, presumably set up by the hackers themselves. One recently detected fake site was for a ""smart cryptocurrency arbitrage trading platform."" Kaspersky researchers found these websites were often incomplete and filled with broken links, aside from the ones that took visitors to the Telegram channel.      Kaspersky said it was able to identify ""several victims"" from Poland, Russia, China and the U.K., most with links to cryptocurrency businesses.      But Lazarus itself remains a mystery. By running malware through computer memory rather than a hard disk drive, the group generally avoids detection. Although the group is widely believed to be affiliated with North Korea, the secretive regime has repeatedly denied responsibility for its attacks.      Cybersecurity firm Group-IB estimated the group stole nearly $600 million worth of cryptocurrency in 2017 and most of 2018. Because its attacks are so successful, Kaspersky researchers are convinced the group will continue stealing cryptocurrency. ""This kind of attack on cryptocurrency businesses will continue and become more sophisticated,"" the report reads.      The U.S. Department for Treasury placed the Lazarus group on the U.S. sanctions list in 2019, meaning that any financial institution found dealing with it faces sanctions.

42403769,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgk1N,1578578400,AT&T's Cybersecurity Branch Breaks Down Crypto Miner Threat to Email Servers,"AT&T's Alien Labs is dipping its toes into cryptomining malware analysis with a new technological breakdown of how a monero miner infiltrates networks.      Released Thursday, the report by security researcher Fernando Domínguez provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how one rather low-profile cryptojacker infects and spreads across vulnerable Exim, Confluence and WebLogic servers, installing malicious code that mines monero through a proxy. Exim servers represent more than half of all email servers, according to ZDNet.      The worm first injects target servers with a BASH script that checks for, and kills, competing mining processes before attempting to infiltrate other known machines in the network. Crypto-miners often kill off competing miners when they infect a system, and for one very simple reason: The more CPU a different process hogs, the less is left over for others, according to the report.      Breached servers then download the script’s payload: an “omelette” (as the downloaded executable file variable is termed) based on the open-source monero miner called XMRig.      Available on GitHub, XMRig is a malware hacker favorite and a common building block in cryptojackers’ arsenal. It has been retrofitted into MacBook miners, spread across 500,000 computers and, in 2017, became so popular that malicious mining reports spiked over 400 percent.      This modified miner does its business via proxy, according to AT&T Alien Labs. That makes tracing the funds, or even discerning the wallet address, nearly impossible without proxy server access.      Frying this omelette is hard. When it downloads, another file called “sesame” – identical to the original BASH script – downloads as well. This is the key to the worm’s persistency: it hitches onto a cron job with a five-minute interval, enabling it to withstand kill attempts and system shutdowns.

42383162,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uIvZ,1578574819,"Australians Won't Use Libra, Believes Central Bank","The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has expressed doubt over whether cryptocurrencies, including Libra and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), will ever become viable solutions.      In a submission (pdf) to the Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology just before Christmas, RBA officials were skeptical that cryptocurrencies, in their current and future forms, would ever replace government-issued money.      Although newer initiatives like Libra and CBDCs could promote financial inclusion, the bank's current assessment is that innovation in the broader fintech space will make these solutions redundant.      ""In Australia, it is unclear that there will be strong demand for global stablecoins even if they do meet all regulatory requirements, particularly for domestic payments,"" reads the submission. ""Australia is already well served by a range of low-cost and efficient real-time payment methods, such as the NPP [New Payments Platform] that utilize funds held in accounts at prudentially supervised financial institutions.""      In 2018, the RBA established an in-house research team to better evaluate new technologies for the country's payments system. That includes central bank digital currencies, where the team has trialled a ""wholesale settlement system"" on a private ethereum network, to better understand whether tokens could create efficiencies in issuing currency to commercial banks.      CBDCs have seen support from some central bankers, including Christine Lagarde and Mark Carney. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is currently putting its ""digital yuan"" through real-world tests ahead of public issuance sometime in the future.      But the RBA believes a ""digital Australian dollar"" would be an unnecessary disruption to the existing financial system, particularly for retail use. The bank cites research by accounting firm Ernst & Young that also found a CBDC would be the ""least effective"" solution for promoting growth in the Australian fintech sector.      Following years of watching the asset-class, the RBA remains unconvinced about the future of cryptocurrencies. Most are rarely used or accepted as payment, despite some being around for nearly a decade; their price volatility makes them popular with speculators, rather than with ordinary citizens. This ""explains why [cryptocurrencies] have not become widely used in Australia as a means of payment,"" reads the RBA submission.      Although the Australia government has trialled various solutions, including a token by its bullion mint that allows investors to trade and settle gold in real-time, it has adopted a fairly skeptical view to cryptocurrencies overall.      The chief digital officer of the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) said last year that although blockchain was ""interesting,"" it had been overhyped by the industry. The RBA's governor, Philip Lowe, said last summer he didn't see what role the newly launched Libra project would fill in a country that already has an efficient electronic payment system.      Conventional systems include the NPP, which launched in 2018 to provide Australian citizens with a real-time solution that allows users to send transactions using a phone number or email address. Although it had been backed by the central bank, uptake has been low with only a handful of commercial banks currently support the platform. An RBA report in June 2019 described the rollout as ""disappointing.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | RESEARCH,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/09/australians-wont-use-libra-believes-central-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b817a5eaf29fda70004ae3eee031475764e3ab2-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383158,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uIo1,1578569878,Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith Indicted Over North Korea Event Appearance,"Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith has been released on bond shortly after being indicted over allegations relating to a conference appearance in North Korea last April.      In a court document filed in the Southern District of New York on Jan. 7 (see below), Griffith is charged by a grand jury with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.      Griffith was released on bail on Jan. 9, Inner City Press reported.      A DOJ spokesperson previously told CoinDesk that Griffith's release had been delayed until he could satisfy his bail conditions.      The defendant and others had conspired to breach the prohibitions of the act when Griffith provided services to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea without obtaining approval from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, according to the indictment. The developer is also alleged to have attempted to evade U.S. legal requirements during his actions.      The document adds that one or more of the alleged co-conspirators is expected to be brought to New York and arrested.      Griffith was arrested on Thanksgiving for allegedly attending a cryptocurrency conference hosted by the North Korean government and sharing his expertise in using cryptocurrency.      According to a complaint brought against Griffith on Nov. 21, he had sought approval to attend the conference, which was denied. He then traveled to the conference anyway.      “Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,"" John Demers, an assistant attorney general for national security, said at the time.      After the indictment was released, prosecutors requested that Griffith be sent to his parents in Alabama immediately after being released on bond, rather than be allowed to stay in a New York hotel room until his arraignment. They also asked that Griffith not be allowed to keep his passport card while traveling, claiming that this ""poses a serious risk"" that he may flee the country in a letter.      Griffith's attorneys, Brian Klein and Sean Buckley, responded that they disagreed with the government's characterizations and ""were very surprised"" by the letter. It was not immediately clear whether Griffith will be allowed to remain in New York through his arraignment.      ""Virgil should not have been indicted. We are going to vigorously contest the charge and look forward to getting all the facts in front of the jury at trial,"" said Klein in response to the indictment.      If found guilty, Griffith faces up to 20 years in jail. The U.S. Attorney's Office also wants Griffith to forfeit any property or money obtained for his appearance in North Korea.      Griffith had served as the head of special projects for the Ethereum Foundation but has been suspended since his arrest, according to a previous report.

42383170,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uJ37,1578567603,Bitcoin's Bull Bias Intact Despite 6 Percent Price Pullback,"View    Bitcoin has pulled back from seven-week highs above $8,400, but the bullish breakout confirmed on Jan. 6 is still valid.  The price drop was backed by low seller volumes and may be reversed.  The bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance under key support at $7,567.    Bitcoin has pulled back from multi-week highs but is still hovering in bullish territory above key support near $7,600.      The number one cryptocurrency is currently trading at $7,910 – down 6.5 percent from the seven-week high of $8,463, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).      The pullback began during the U.S. trading hours on Wednesday with gold and other safe havens losing ground on easing of geopolitical tensions.      ""Bitcoin's price dropped down to $8,100 (from $8,300-$8,400 range) right as President Trump announced at 11 a.m. ET that the U.S. will not escalate the conflict with Iran,"" Hong Kim, co-founder and chief technology officer at Bitwise Asset Management tweeted Wednesday.      Popular analyst Ran NeuNer also put out a tweet, drawing attention to the fact that both bitcoin and gold moved lower following President Trump's speech.      Bitcoin has moved in tandem with gold since Friday. The cryptocurrency turned higher from lows near $6,850 on Friday after the U.S. attacked Iran and clocked seven-week highs during the Asian trading hours on Wednesday. During the same time frame, the yellow metal rose from $1,530 to 6.5-year highs above $1,611.      So, it appears as though markets are beginning to treat the cryptocurrency as a haven asset, as noted by NeuNer.      That makes bitcoin vulnerable to a deeper pullback in gold, which is currently trading at $1,547 per Oz, representing a 4 percent drop from Wednesday's high of $1,611.      The yellow metal could slip further, possibly dragging bitcoin lower, as the European equities (risk assets) are flashing green and the futures on the S&P 500 are adding 0.33 percent.      That said, bitcoin's short-term bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above key support near $7,600.    Daily chart    Bitcoin is flashing red for the second day. However, the former resistance-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders, currently at $7,567, is intact.      So, the bullish breakout confirmed on Jan. 6 is still valid and the path of least resistance remains to the higher side.    Healthy pullback?    Markets usually crowd out weak hands (traders with limited 'HODLing' power) by revisiting former hurdle-turned-support before building on a major breakout.      Bitcoin jumped 5 percent on Tuesday, confirming an upside break of the six-month-long falling channel. The channel breakout signaled a revival of the bull market from lows near $4,100 seen in April 2019.      Therefore, the 6 percent pullback could be the market's attempt to shake out weak bulls. Also, trading volumes have dropped over the last 18 hours.    Hourly chart    The price decline is accompanied by a slide in volumes. The red bars, representing selling volumes, have been small compared to the green bars or buying volume witnessed earlier this week.      A low-volume price drop is often short-lived.      The probability of a slide to the crucial daily chart support of $7,567 would increase if prices find acceptance below the 100-hour average at $7,825 on the back of strong volumes.

According to a Wednesday blog post from TrendMicro, which assisted the operation, Interpol's Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI) in Singapore led a five-month effort to tackle the epidemic of the Coinhive cryptojacker that was installed by cybercriminals exploiting a vulnerability in MicroTik routers.      Dubbed Operation Goldfish Alpha, the action saw Interpol work with experts from national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and police across 10 nations across Asia to identify infected routers and help victims remove the malware.      A release from Interpol identifies the countries as Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. TrendMicro said it had prepared a guidance document that was used to guide victims in patching the vulnerability and uninstalling the miner.      At least 20,000 infected routers were found, a number that was reduced by at least 78 percent by the collaborative action when it ceased in November. Efforts are still continuing to remove the malware.      Private entity Cyber Defense Institute also assisted the operation, said Interpol.      “When faced with emerging cybercrimes like cryptojacking, the importance of strong partnerships between police and the cybersecurity industry cannot be overstated,” said Interpol director of cybercrime Craig Jones. “By combining the expertise and data on cyberthreats held by the private sector with the investigative capabilities of law enforcement, we can best protect our communities from all forms of cybercrime.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | MINING | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/09/interpol-leads-operation-to-tackle-cryptojacker-infecting-over-20000-routers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8570988cb920f258989d9a0c8c8c786402c9f181-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
