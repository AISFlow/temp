42380184,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MMwN,1514414743,Former FDIC Chair: Bitcoin Policies Shouldn't 'Feed the Frenzy',"Sheila Bair, the former chair of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is arguing bitcoin shouldn't be banned just because it doesn't have ""intrinsic value.""  In an op-ed article published on Yahoo Finance this week, Bair instead contends policies should be in place to protect investors. In the post, Bair elaborated that currency itself was once just like bitcoin — an idea assigned value by societies because people needed a medium to trade and that depended ""more on psychology than physical attributes.""  She added:  ""Instead of making its own value judgments about bitcoin, what government should do is first make sure our policies don't feed the frenzy.""  While Bair's view in supporting bitcoin is not entirely surprising given her roles as an independent advisor and director to several blockchain and cryptocurrency related projects, it is nonetheless notable given her previous capacity serving as the chair of FDIC, an agency created by the Congress to ensure financial confidence and stability.  She led the agency from 2006 to 2011.  ""Since the beginning of commerce, humans have assigned value to things of no readily-apparent intrinsic worth. Particularly in the case of mediums of exchange, a.k.a. currency, we assign value simply because those with whom we transact do so as well,"" Bair added.  Citing historical examples where the government had failed in maintaining the value of its fiat currencies, Bair said she believes the role of the government should be focused on ensuring a fair and well-informed market, one free from fraud, manipulation and outsized speculation.

42380191,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MN2f,1514408132,Privacy on the Blockchain: Where Are We Headed?,"Arianna Simpson is the founder and managing director of Autonomous Partners, a fund focused on cryptocurrencies and digital assets. She is also a venture partner at Crystal Towers Capital, a venture capital fund, and previously spent time at Facebook and BitGo.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      For all the claims that have been made over the years about bitcoin being a safe haven for criminals, it’s becoming increasingly clear that capital flows on the blockchain aren't private.  Bitcoin itself indexes poorly on both the anonymity and confidentiality fronts, as addresses offer pseudonymity at best, and balances are completely public. Companies like Elliptic and Chainalysis are building businesses around blockchain forensics, and as the network increases in value, incentives to track flows of capital only become stronger.  The rising tide of awareness about this is largely responsible for the growth in privacy coins in 2017, many of which experienced meteoric price and transaction volume increases.  To those new to the field, getting up to speed can feel like an onerous task, but it's important to remember we're still in the early days, and catching up on the cutting-edge is as easy as familiarizing yourself with a handful of key issues and projects likely to be of interest in the months and years ahead  Practicality vs. ideology  There’s never a shortage of ideological differences in the world of cryptocurrencies.  As it relates to privacy, one of the biggest is whether or not techniques that keep data from being shared should be default. Emblematic of this issue are two of the sector's biggest coins – monero and zcash.  Of the two, monero offers private by default, a feature its core developers and community value highly. However, zcash’s model includes allowing for either shielded or transparent transactions.  And there's reason to want to see both models continue.  While privacy by default may seem like an obvious solution , we see that zcash may be well-suited for use cases such as personal or business banking situations in which privacy is generally desired, but auditability is required. Indeed, JPMorgan recently went so far as to implement zcash's zero-knowledge security layer on its Quorum blockchain, and we may yet see more trials as enterprise interest in confidentiality advances.  Beyond ideology though, practical considerations still figure prominently.  Most transactions that enable heightened privacy require far more space on the blockchain than those that are public, and with concerns about scalability already front and center, it’s hard to justify further adding to that burden.  Advances in cryptography  Fortunately, developments are being made at the intersection of math and cryptography that will likely continue to cut down on the trade-offs between privacy, efficiency and trust.  And make no mistake, there are big trade-offs today.  Zk-snarks, the zero-knowledge proof technology currently implemented at the core of zcash, may be heralded as the most advanced blockchain privacy tool, but even it has drawbacks. Namely, researchers have taken issue with that fact that it requires a somewhat elaborate trusted setup in order to function correctly.  Alternatives are now emerging that aim to tackle the issue, and they're likely to continue to warrant interest and attention next year.  Zk-starks  , for example, developed much more recently, don't rely on public key cryptography at all, but rather use hash functions that are unpredictable, allowing for the elimination of the trusted setup. Still, the technology is in its earliest stages at present.  More immediate might be ""Bulletproofs,"" a paper published in late 2017 by a notable group of leading cryptographers. But aside from the big names involved, the concept is believed to offer a substantial reduction in the size of rangeproofs needed to make transactions private.  This is seen as a major step forward in enabling space savings, faster verification times and lower fees.  Monero has already announced it is enabling the feature on testnet, with the eventual goal of bringing them to its blockchain, though that, too, may still be a ways off.  2018 and beyond  At this point, it’s still hard to predict how these technologies will advance.  Key questions include whether advances from these cryptocurrencies will continue to necessitate the existence of dedicated blockchains (with unique tokens), or whether they will simply serve as testing grounds for features that will migrate to dominate coins.  So far, it appears that the leaders of major blockchain ecosystems are hoping the outcome might be the latter.  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin's recent blog post about zk-snarks and zk-starks suggests that the blockchain's community of developers is thinking through the problem. Yet, it’s unclear how far in the future we might have to go to see a full suite of privacy features live on ethereum.  As for bitcoin, implementing changes that are beneficial for privacy looks even less likely in the near future – if we’ve seen anything this year, it’s that reaching consensus for any major change to the protocol is non-trivial.  But though there might not be answers, it seems a safe bet to project that privacy coins will continue to see their heyday in 2018. The interest and enthusiasm may just be beginning.

42380180,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MMop,1514402104,ATB Coin the Latest to Face Class-Action Suit After ICO,"Following similar suits against Tezos and Centra, another initial coin offering that opted not to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces a class-action lawsuit alleging its cryptocurrency should be considered a security.  On December 21, Raymond Balestra filed a class action suit in the Southern District of New York against ATBCoin LLC, Edward Ng (CEO) and Herbert W. Hoover (co-founder). Seeking a jury trial from the court, the plaintiffs alleged that ATBCoin had violated the Securities Act by issuing unregistered securities with the expectation of profit in the form of the ATB coin and the placement of all remaining funds invested into a trust, in the interest of investors.  The complaint alleges:  “The ATB ICO was a clear offer and sale of securities because, inter alia [among other things], Defendants touted, and Plaintiff and other ATB ICO investors reasonably expected, that the ATB Coins received in exchange for their investments would be worth more than the ETH, BTC, LTC or other currencies invested.”  Offered as a fast and inexpensive blockchain-based payment system, ATB's initial coin offering launched on June 12, to run through July 12, according to a blog post. The plaintiffs alleged that the offering effectively continued into September, with a second phase in August and a press release on September 11 announcing it was still open to investment. On the ATB blog, the company announced that sales were closed on September 8 and that distribution would take place on September 14.  The plaintiff invested 2.1 ETH on August 12 (approximately $621.62 at the time, according to CoinDesk's Ethereum Price Tracker). It is not known how many people invested or how much was raised, but the complaint estimated the total to be somewhere ""between $20,400,000 and $24,210,000” in bitcoin, ether and litecoin.  The case made similar allegations to those of other investors against other ICO projects such as Tezos and Centra Tech, in which similar arguments from plaintiffs were made that tokens offered by these ICOs should be seen as securities.  In addition, legal experts also weighed in arguing that private complaints against initial coin offerings may force the courts to define which cryptocurrencies are considered as securities before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Drinker Biddle's Jim Lundy, a veteran of the SEC who represents clients in securities cases, told CoinDesk, that the complaint is ""following a typical securities class action format for a public offering.” He said, “This theory is that item itself, the ATB Coin, is a security. I don’t doubt that the defendants will move to dismiss that, and the judge will have to rule.”  Participants in the crypto-economy have been waiting for greater clarity from the courts or the SEC on which kinds of coins are securities under U.S. law. Even getting to that ruling is likely to take months, however.  Another SEC veteran, Timothy Peterson, now of Murphy & McGonigle, agreed that a motion to dismiss should come shortly, adding that ""it’s likely the court will look at the SEC’s 21(a) report on DAO for guidance, but it’s important to note that the 21(a) report is not controlling. That is, the court can come to its own conclusions about what is and what is not a security for purposes of federal securities law.""  Peterson concluded:  ""I think we can expect to see more of these complaints in the future, especially once courts begin to carve out tests to define how cryptocurrencies should be regulated or examined. More facts will need to come out before it’s fair to comment on the merits of these particular allegations.""

42428327,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7GTh,1514398554,Israeli Finance Watchdog Seeks to Ban Public Firms from Bitcoin Trading,"Bitcoin trading companies in Israel may soon face tighter rules imposed by the country's finance regulator.  According to Reuters, the head of the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) Shmuel Hauser said in a business conference on Dec. 26 that a proposal will be presented to the ISA board next week, which seeks to ban any company that has a major involvement in bitcoin trading from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE).  Hauser told the news agency:  ""If we have a company [and] their main business is digital currencies, we would not allow it. If already listed, its trading will be suspended.""  According to Hauser, if the proposal is approved, it would go through a public hearing before the domestic exchange is required to abide the new laws.  Such a move is perhaps seen as a follow-up to the ISA's decision in late August to probe into regulatory laws on initial coin offerings (ICOs). At the time, the organization was said to be planning to release a report for recommendations before the end of December.  The regulation proposal may also be seen as a response to the market trend where public companies have seen their stock price spike after rebranding to something related to the blockchain and cryptocurrency – a trend also reflected on the stock exchanges in the U.S.  As identified by Reuters, at least one public company Blockchain Mining (BLCM.TA) has seen a 5,000 percent surge of its stock price within months after announcing to shift from mining gold to cryptocurrencies. However, the company later changed its name Natural Resources on Sunday, according to the news outlet.  Hauser's comment also follows a volatile market for cryptocurrency, particularly, last Friday on Dec. 22, when the market saw perhaps the largest single-day correction. The cryptocurrency market capitalization first hit as low as $418 billion, nearly 30 percent down from its all-time-high earlier last week. But it soon bounced back over $500 billion and reaching $584 billion as of press time currently.

According to the SEC filing, Seven Starts Cloud Groups (SSC), publicly listed on NASDAQ, made a transaction on Dec. 20 to acquire 27 percent of the shares of the Delaware Board of Trade (DBOT), making SSC the largest shareholder in the company. DBOT launched in May 2017 to provide a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform compliant with new legislation in the state seeking to boost the use case.  For Seven Starts, the deal notably comes two months after Bruno Wu toke over the role of CEO at the company. What draws attention, however, is perhaps the high-profile status of Wu himself. He has gained large public attention in China through his media business the Sun Seven Star Entertainment, as well as his marriage with the Chinese TV personality Yang Lan.  According to the announcement, DBOT's technology will be used to power the SSC's blockchain-based NextGen X platform. It is said to be a solution that brings liquidity to trading ETF-backed digital assets for countries including the US, UK, Germany, China, Korea, Africa, Singapore, UAE and Japan.  Yet this is another instance of Chinese investors exploring opportunities overseas to tap into the business related to cryptocurrency and blockchain amidst a regulatory uncertainty domestically.  In September this year, Chinese regulators issued a ban on initial coin offerings, which was followed by all domestic exchanges shutting down trading between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.  As reported previously, once the largest exchanges in China, Huobi and OKCoin both shifted the business model to over-the-counter for crypto-to-crypto trading. While the operations are based in overseas markets such as in Hong Kong, trading is still available for Chinese retail investors using mobile payment or bankwire services.

42428332,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Gbh,1514382356,Why Crypto Looks A Lot Like Wall Street,"Jill is an independent advisor and consultant working on everything from early-stage token ventures to initiatives at large institutions.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review opinion series.      I first seriously heard about cryptocurrency while I was working on Wall Street.  This was in 2013. I was trading Argentine credit. One of my local brokers in Buenos Aires wanted to know if I knew anything about bitcoin. Argentina, at the time, had been locked out of capital markets for over a decade. The peso, ostensibly pegged to the US dollar, traded at a discount on the ground, leaving locals hungry for other stores of value. Capital controls meant that getting money offshore often involved suitcases and ferries to Uruguay. The country was on the brink of another default.  The promise of bitcoin, in this context, was a store of value that would not be captive to the ineptitude or harm of a single, central authority.  As I dug further into bitcoin, more promises of an alternative, improved financial system presented themselves. The European debt crisis, and specifically the asset seizures in Cyprus, highlighted the significance of a digital store of value that could be owned directly – that could not be compromised by an external actor.  Here was an asset that did not demand an intermediary. Sitting on a trading desk at the time, the removal of rent-seeking middlemen from the system was particularly compelling. This technology could allow counterparties to interact directly, without having to disclose the details of their transactions or identities to third parties.  This was also an asset that was programmable. As a derivatives trader, I spent a lot of time thinking about counterparty exposure, collateral and capital requirements. Could smart contracts provide an automatically enforceable means of accounting for this sort of systemic risk?  It had not taken me long to grow disillusioned with the old financial system. Insider trading went on at scale. Reckless risk-taking was often rewarded. Market manipulation, under the guise of many different names, remained rampant.  Cryptocurrency promised an alternative to this system.  For many, 2017 will be the year that they first seriously heard about bitcoin. As I consider the state of cryptocurrency today, however, I don’t see many fulfilled promises.  Instead, we have constructed around crypto a warped version of the legacy financial system, with all the familiar players: issuers, broker dealers, exchanges and custodians. Along with these players come the legacy problems of centralized control, intermediation, systemic risk, market malpractice and – importantly – short-term greed.  We may think that we are down the crypto rabbit hole, but really we are through the Wall Street looking glass.  Issuers  Cryptocurrency tends to be marketed as ""trustless."" A truer way of thinking about it is that it can replace the necessity of trusting a single, central authority with the ability to trust a network of decentralized actors.  Many of the tokens that have emerged in the last year, however, have been issued by small teams of entrepreneurs, who must be trusted to get the project off the ground. Thanks to the cryptocurrency community’s emphasis on open source development, later-stage work often proceeds in a more decentralized manner.  Nonetheless, investors and consumers need to reconcile the dissonance between the sales pitch of decentralization and the reality of how these projects are often run in their early days.  The paradox of centralized cryptocurrency creation is perhaps nowhere so clearly on display as in Venezuela. The Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, announced a few weeks ago his intent to issue a cryptocurrency, presumably in order to evade sanctions. This is unlikely to work, but it also misses the point. A promise of bitcoin is to act as a store of value that would not be captive to a central authority.  A new Venezuelan cryptocurrency, if issued by Maduro, is just as likely to be mismanaged as the bolivar.  Other assets also make this point. Tether is an example of a centrally-mismanaged token. It claims to be a fully-collateralized, dollar-backed asset. The fact that it is not redeemable, coupled with the opaque and problematic accounting practices of its issuers, however, makes it as questionable as any of Wall Street's financial creations, if not more so.  Decentralization is a transformative concept in finance and technology. But if the source of value for these products still relies on a central issuer, then how different are they from the financial products that Wall Street has been devising for decades?  Intermediaries  Cryptocurrency is also talked about as a disintermediating technology. The peer-to-peer nature of blockchain-based assets is perhaps their most interesting feature.  The reality of how these assets are generally being transacted and custodied, however, is highly intermediated.  The professionalization of the issuance process is one example of cryptocurrency markets replicating the legacy system. The services provided by investment banks in equity capital markets are now getting packaged and sold to teams of entrepreneurs looking to do token sales.  These services include running diligence on investors, book-building, addressing compliance concerns and handling the legal process. On the one hand, this marks an important initiative in maturing the market. On the other, it is recreating Wall Street's system around this new asset class.  The platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies and tokens also fit this category. The development of over-the-counter trading desks in cryptocurrency feels particularly ironic for me, given I first really understood bitcoin’s value proposition while sitting on a trading desk myself. These desks and exchanges undoubtedly play critical roles in providing liquidity to the market, but in many ways they are replicating what we knew from the old system.  For this reason, decentralized exchange is one of the most compelling areas of research in the space. Rather than rebuild the legacy exchanges, decentralized exchange seeks to enable a new way of transacting that is truer to the value proposition of the technology.  Wallets, like exchanges, have been significant in driving adoption of, speculation on and use of cryptocurrency. Interaction with private keys remains a real user experience challenge. While many do choose to self-custody their cryptocurrencies, and the very option to do so is one of the important features of this asset class, we have yet to see a product enable secure and reasonable private key custody without reliance on third parties.  In place of this, the industry has again created mirror images of the legacy system: professional custody services using everything from safe deposit boxes to Swiss bank vaults.  These mirror images of Wall Street have a distorted quality. Not only do they imprecisely (or immaturely) resemble the old financial infrastructure on which they are based, but they also bend and corrupt the original intent of the product. Cryptocurrency has created more intermediaries than it has displaced.  The intent was to give people direct control of their funds, free from seizure from banks and governments. Instead, people are handing over that control to a new class of actors--who are frequently even less accountable than their old school counterparts.  Institutions  The question of institutional accountability speaks directly to another promise of cryptocurrency. With its capacity for programmability, crypto can enforce financial contracts. This could solve issues of collateral management and guarantee compliance with capital requirements. The 2008 financial crisis was exacerbated, in part, by a lack of clarity about exposures among counterparties. Auditability and enforceability inherent to crypto should help mitigate, or at least reveal, this kind of systemic risk.  However, the third parties that have been created around cryptocurrency are as equally exposed to each other as banks, exchanges, and custodians were in 2008.  Commingling of funds within wallets and exchanges, opaque accounting, cross-exchange exposure and unclear margin requirements are a few of the sources of institutional risk in the market. The relative lack of standards in cryptocurrency means that these risks are poorly studied and understood. Disclosures on the subject have yet to be widely demanded by customers and are far from commonplace.  The nascent infrastructure growing up around cryptocurrency reflects the institutions of Wall Street. It’s little wonder that the same risks persist.  Integrity  The parallels between the old and the new are not limited to issuers, infrastructure and institutions. The parallels also permeate the integrity of the players in the system.  Market manipulation, insider trading, shilling, spoofing, pumping-and-dumping and conflicts of interest abound in cryptocurrency markets. This comes as no surprise to anyone who has sat on a Wall Street trading desk, especially considering the relative immaturity of crypto markets.  When I was a trader, I found myself acutely aware that Wall Street might be the hub of it all, but somewhere – on the other end of all the Bloomberg screens, and broker-dealers, and custodians, and clearing houses, and asset managers and mutual funds – were individuals and their retirement money or their college savings.  The same is becoming true of cryptocurrency as retail consumers buy in.  Initiatives and standards are starting to emerge within the industry. Like so much else in crypto markets, these initiatives largely reflect lessons learned by Wall Street. Disclosures by journalists, pundits, and fund managers are starting to become commonplace. Messari, an open source EDGAR-like database, is offering transparency to investors on newly-issued tokens. The Brooklyn Project, launched by Consensys, focuses on consumer protection and setting standards for tokens, encouraging self-regulation by issuers.  Even Coinbase's probe into employee insider trading demonstrates that it is taking its role in the market – and setting standards for it – seriously.  As Wall Street learned for itself, accountability is an important market practice. These are important developments not just for consumer protection, but also for the growth and longevity of the market as a whole.  Long-term greedy  If the hype in 2016 was all about replacing Wall Street's infrastructure with blockchain technology, then 2017 was all about replicating Wall Street’s infrastructure around crypto.  This has led us astray from many of the original promises of cryptocurrency: promises about the roles of issuers, of intermediaries and of institutions. The level of integrity in the market, unfortunately, also reflects that of the old system, exacerbated by general market immaturity and a lack of agreed-upon standards.  ""Long-term greedy"" is a notion that crypto would do well to borrow from Wall Street. The idea is that certain behaviors, while they may benefit you less in the short term, will pay off in the long run.  These behaviors include having a steady hand in volatile markets, something cryptocurrency investors are well familiar with. More importantly, though, these behaviors also entail respecting other market participants.  I think 2018 will see cryptocurrency markets continue to grow up and self-regulate. 2018 will teach us that being long-term greedy is about more than holding – it’s also about maintaining integrity.  Finally, 2018 may return us to some of the original intent of cryptocurrency as the market awakens to remember that the real value lies not through the looking glass, but in the original promises of decentralization and disintermediation.

A vocal supporter and critic of blockchain technologies, San was also a pioneer in real-time, 3D games.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review series.      As a long time investor in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, 2017 has been remarkable. But it's important to remember, this is really just the beginning.  Despite the valuations, major protocols remain deficient in delivering value to users.

While there's no shortage of old and new believers to keep the party going, along with plenty of developers working to create better, forked versions of bitcoin, I’m betting my chips on a more flexible alternative.  The door is wide open for blockchains that use smart contracts, like ethereum, and I believe their potential market dwarfs that of ""store of value"" chains. Platforms like ethereum are an operating system for decentralized finance and commerce.  They power applications – lots of them.  A comparison  Think of bitcoin as DOS and ethereum as Windows or Mac OS. There is nothing wrong with DOS. It came first and was an essential part of the computer's success.  Us geeks grew up on DOS, but computers only went mainstream when Windows and Mac OS appeared. DOS is difficult to learn, tricky to program and few applications ever ran on it. Windows and Mac OS support and encourage applications to be built and are ultimately easier for people to use.  Ethereum is like Windows and Mac OS, and as a result, developers are creating applications in the thousands.  It feels like the internet boom in 2000. Thousands of new companies are sprouting up with highly innovative business models and bleeding edge compliance with regulation, and new methods are being found to finance them. Most, like Pets.com and Webvan, will fail. But some will be the next Amazon, eBay, or Google of the blockchain generation.  But with its proven stability and exceptional immutability, don’t bitcoin’s developers deserve the reverence that the rocketing price implies?  I wouldn't be quick to yes to this. They are so resistant to change that they’d rather give up all hope of serving the common man. Let's face it, bitcoin today is a product for an elitist few that can afford the high transaction fees. They have chosen a path to a technical dead end.  A better way  Last month’s DevCon3, an ethereum developer conference, may be evidence of a contrasting approach.  With 2,000 developers in attendance, each paying $1,000 plus expenses to collectively push the boundaries of blockchain innovation, ethereum’s future seems secure. But what of other smart contract-enabling technologies?  Sure, there are a few new pretenders out there claiming to be ethereum 2.0. None have yet demonstrated anything like the innovation or rapid improvement of ethereum, nor do they have the developer mindset.  You can’t write any of them off just yet, but ethereum has shown a dedication to innovation at all costs and an effectiveness that leaves no doubt that it will be the main platform for blockchain application development for years to come.  Those guys are already working on privacy and scaling, the likes of which the other blockchains can only dream. To me, you must evolve or die. In 2018 and beyond, ethereum and other technologies will continue to evolve and power applications will drive the next technology age.

42428335,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7Ghh,1514340001,Bitcoin's Real Bottleneck,"Ariel Deschapell is a full-stack javascript developer teaching at the Ironhack coding bootcamp, and a Henry Hazlitt fellow in Digital Development at the Foundation for Economic Education.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      After a year of explosive price growth, forks, failed forks and more, there is much that can be said about bitcoin in 2017. Massive strides were taken, and much has been learned. However, as we push further into uncharted waters, what happens from this point onward continues to be just as divisive a topic as ever.  Underlying both much of the year’s drama and continued future uncertainty is a simple question: Can bitcoin scale as it continues to capture mainstream attention, or will it become a victim of its own success, with alternative cryptocurrencies waiting in the wings to overtake it?  Of course, no one can honestly answer this question with total certainty. Predicting the future is a messy business, because the future is constantly in flux. It is not and cannot be fixed or predetermined. Rather, the future is being shaped and created gradually in the here and now by those unsatisfied by the present.  As George Bernard Shaw wrote:  ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.""  So, as we reflect on a breathtaking year and ponder what challenges the future may hold, it’s worth paying special attention to those unreasonable men and women who are doing the creating.  Scaling bitcoin  At the beginning of November, one of the longest running and recognized technical conferences in the blockchain sector hosted its 2017 conference in partnership with The University of Stanford: Scaling Bitcoin.  For the fourth time, Scaling Bitcoin brought together academics, developers and entrepreneurs from across the blockchain ecosystem, many of whom have been in the thick of cryptocurrency ideas and development for years. With this long and deep experience comes a sense of perspective and order of priorities that shouldn’t be ignored.  For those looking to the future of cryptocurrency and wondering what’s preventing us from getting there, there’s no better place to start.  Immediately notable to CoinDesk Editor-in-Chief Peter Rizzo was that despite this rare concentration of industry veterans, discussion largely ignored much of the latest hot button drama dominating the cryptocurrency news cycle.  While the conference stayed true to name with presentations focusing on possible Bitcoin Core optimizations and layer 2 proposals, the controversial topics of forks and block size were seldom touched on during the course of the conference. Participants showed little apprehension for seemingly pressing controversies such as the Segwit2X fork, and most attendees, including myself, were confident that it would be dead upon arrival.  A belief and attitude that was quickly validated when 2X was canceled the very week after the end of the conference.  As a result, and for better or worse, bitcoin would not increase its base block size. The incompatible vision of much larger block size limits for bitcoin would for now embody itself only in the bitcoin cash blockchain. This has led to many predictions that bitcoin cash and other alternative cryptocurrencies will overtake bitcoin as its block size limit becomes a bottleneck for adoption.  With only a few notable exceptions, the majority of Scaling Bitcoin’s attendees did not indicate that they found this to be a notable concern. However, that is not to say that attendees were not vocal about any pressing technological challenges. If the wide ranging topics of presentations were of any indication, far from it. But one way or another all participants did agree on a single, much wider, and more fundamental concern for scaling this still nascent ecosystem: a drought of quality developer talent.  As developer and attendee Jimmy Song puts it plainly:  ""Training more developers is the biggest bottleneck in the ecosystem.""  It is very appropriate then that besides the location of Stanford, also unique to this year’s Scaling Bitcoin was a new attempt by its organizers to directly tackle this problem.  Bitcoin Edge Dev++  The Dev++ workshop was established by the Scaling Bitcoin organizers with the sole mission of educating and helping to onboard aspiring blockchain developers, and it accomplished this with studded star power.  For the inaugural Dev++ program, dozens of participants attended presentations and guided demonstrations from well-known names from across the industry. These included the aforementioned Jimmy Song, Bitcoin Core contributor John Newberry, MIT's Thaddeus Dryja, and many others.  This ensemble of technical experts delivered a crash course covering everything from the cryptographic fundamentals of bitcoin, to the theory and implementation of second-layer networks. The latter featured a live and interactive demonstration of the Lighting Network software on testnet by Dryja himself, co-author of the original white paper.  Perhaps as insightful as the Dev++ demonstrations themselves, however, was an off hand comment by Dryja which surprised some attentive students, and told them all they needed to know about the need for the event in the first place.  When asked whether a minor Lightning Network feature had been implemented yet, Dryja responded:  ""No. I had the idea over a year ago and just haven’t had the time to implement it... But it’s all open source so if anyone wants to make a pull request, like, please. That would be awesome. I just haven’t had the time.""  This playful yet earnest response reveals the true bottleneck for scaling bitcoin and blockchain technology. Like all things it is time, the scarcest of all resources. We have no control over the passage of time, but what we can do is better leverage it. Finding, encouraging and developing more of those unreasonable individuals whom all progress depends upon is the only way to bring the future closer and faster.  As Lightning Network developer Jack Mallers writes on reddit ""... I can say that the only thing that can speed up Lightning is more engineers. I am the only dev behind Zap and I only spend time I can afford to spend. One more dev on Zap and myself officially full-time would make a world's difference.""  This sentiment is echoed by the CEO of Lightning Elizabeth Stark who says: ""Time! We need more hours in the day.""  Indeed, the number of full-time developers working on such a widely anticipated technology may surprise you: ""There are 10 or fewer full time developers working across all implementations of Lightning,"" says Stark. ""Getting more contributors and people building out the protocol would certainly help move things along.""  Time and talent  Given the central importance of layer-two development in the ongoing scaling debate, the fact that there are only 10 full-time developers working on the Lightning Network should be a dramatic wake up call for many. But the problem of unmet demand for developer talent in the cryptocurrency ecosystem runs even deeper.  Conferences such as Scaling Bitcoin are hallmarked by their uninterrupted lineup of presentations on some of the latest areas of research and development. It’s common and tempting to come away overly enthusiastic regarding so many of the innovations seemingly on the cusp of realization.  However, many know better. Those in the space longest know to temper their expectations, but it’s those with experience developing software especially who understand first hand that forward progress is usually much slower and more tedious than anyone would like.  Take Segregated Witness, which despite extensive support from the open-source developer community, took three years to implement and activate on the bitcoin blockchain after its initial proposal.  For those with any coding experience this shouldn’t be a shock. When it comes to any level of programming ideas are easy, it’s implementation that’s hard. Building even the seemingly simplest program or feature always reveals hidden complexities and subset problems which must be painstakingly addressed and solved. So when it comes to building anything in this unprecedented ecosystem of distributed and security critical financial software, this tedious reality is multiplied by orders of magnitude.  As if this doesn’t complicate forward progress enough, there’s yet another problem facing developers: deciding what to work on in the first place.  Cryptocurrency and blockchain is a burgeoning field with vast unknowns. With those vast unknowns comes spiraling possibilities, but also endless disagreement.  As Scaling Bitcoin showcased, there's a plethora of competing ideas being explored at any given time, many of which attract public attention. What is rarely noticed by the public, though, is the majority of these ideas being marginalized later on for more promising efforts, or tossed into the waste bin altogether.  While this may at first seem problematic, it is a necessary and desired consequence of exploring uncharted frontiers. Sometimes it is obvious whether an idea can or cannot work, but many times it is not.  After all, as Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd told me: ""You can never really know if something is secure. You only know when it’s been exploited and no longer secure.""  This dynamic leads to many debates regarding not just what technology is possible to implement, but what should be implemented, and where efforts in the space should be most focused when various threat models are taken into consideration.  The result of all this is the impossibility of finding any identical appraisal of the same proposal or idea from any developer in the space, let alone any consensus on where additional research and implementation efforts are most worthwhile. Extensive trial and error is thus the only option left to us to determine what ultimately works and what doesn’t. This of course, requires even more qualified developers.  A difficult road  This is exactly what Dev++ and other programs such as Chaincode's residency program and Jimmy Song's Programming Blockchain attempt to address. But while these efforts are gradually growing the educational tools, resources, and courses available, becoming a blockchain developer is a long and difficult road with many challenges.  Most however, are psychological.  For aspiring blockchain developers, it is easy to be intimidated by the necessarily steep learning curve that the field naturally presents. As both a former student and subsequent Teaching Assistant at the Ironhack Fullstack Bootcamp, I know first hand that intimidation is the single largest barrier for any student looking to master any kind of software development.  Paradoxically, such feelings can even be enhanced by the depth of knowledge of instructors like those at Dev++, and the perceived futility of reaching the same level of mastery on the part of students. It may even be reinforced in some by the perceived attitudes of Bitcoin Core contributors that comes with the repositories well known and extremely critical peer review process.  This was illustrated when I asked Bitcoin Core maintainer Pieter Wuille what the easiest way for a developer to contribute to the repository was. ""Definitely code review."" he responded, before quickly qualifying his statement.  He continued:  ""However it’s inaccurate to call it easy. It's not. The standard for contributing and reviewing Bitcoin Core code is very high.""  There is very good reason for Bitcoin Core's rigorous approach to code quality, and achieving the knowledge level of contributors like Pieter Wuille and John Newberry may indeed seem daunting. However every programmer has to start somewhere, and it’s a massive mistake for aspiring blockchain developers to confuse the high bar of this single repository with the level of ability needed to make meaningful contributions to the larger ecosystem.  Countless projects besides Bitcoin Core could benefit greatly from additional talent, and can provide an avenue for less experienced programmers to begin getting their feet wet.  As Elizabeth Stark notes:  ""Luckily it's a lot easier to learn how to build Lightning apps than to learn how to get involved in protocol development. That said, getting into Lightning app development can actually be a good entry point to learning more about the protocol.""  The extensive development and testing that remains to enable and fully explore mainstream Lightning Network adoption is just one example of a possible starting place for greener developers. But there are other, even lower hanging fruits to seize on.  As a web developer myself, I was approached and solicited for feedback regarding no less than three separate APIs while attending Scaling Bitcoin. APIs in the space allow other developers the ability to utilize blockchain features, such as proof of existence, without the intricacies of running a full node.  Building and contributing to this type of digital infrastructure is not only essential for the growth of industry in the ecosystem, but provides an excellent low hanging fruit for developers with little blockchain experience. Such opportunities provide a way of making meaningful and necessary contributions to the ecosystem while familiarizing developers with the deeper technology. There is simply no shortage of such work if one simply looks.  Securing the future  As we progress into 2018, all attention will be focused on the exciting and easily visible.  Price movements and industry drama will dominate headlines and mainstream attention as they always have, and will be the catalyst of many clicks, tweets and comments.  But the real and under-appreciated story will as always will be the tinkerers, and not just those contributing to Bitcoin Core or the Lightning Network. The ones outside of the limelight grappling with nuanced and esoteric problems are just as important.  They are ones who despite hurdle after hurdle and no fanfare, are struggling to slowly alter the state of the world and create a better one. It’s they who make the incremental and so often seemingly inconsequential advancements that, when taken together, drive an ecosystem forward.  Regardless of how it plays out, 2018 is not a make it or break it year for bitcoin or cryptocurrency at large.      The most important and foundational work has time horizons and payoffs far beyond the next year. These efforts are focused not on drama, PR stunts or even the technology itself, but on the people who are and who will be developing it.  As Jimmy Song again plainly puts it:    ""I believe bitcoin to be an anti-fragile thing, but its anti-fragile not because the software code is so smart but because there are really smart developers that are strengthening the network… and I believe that the more really good developers we get into the system the better it will be and the better store of value it will be.""    While traders may move the markets, it is the tinkerers that will truly determine the future. As we begin a new year, what we need is many more of them.
