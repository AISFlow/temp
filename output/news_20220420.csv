Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin was higher for a third straight day, changing hands around $41,500. But the headiest (and most ridiculous) crypto-markets action was in ApeCoin.  Insights: Bitcoin ""minnows"" might be small, but don't doubt their resolve.  Technician's take: There has been a loss of downside momentum on bitcoin's daily chart, which could keep short-term buyers active.

One thing that was clear: ApeCoin (APE) was pumping, though even that move was panned as ridiculous, entirely speculative and based on unconfirmed tweets.  Bitcoin was holding near the $41,500 price level after a three-day price increase of nearly $3,000. Analysts said the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was benefiting from optimism that a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund might win approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  “I don't think there's any one major catalyst for price movement up or down right now,” Jason Deane, bitcoin market analyst at Quantum Economics, told CoinDesk's Angelique Chen.  In traditional markets, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks ended the day slightly down, while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.2%; Netflix (NFLX) stock tumbled more than 30%. The U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yield slid 0.07 percentage point to 2.84%.  In other crypto news, the giant crypto exchange Binance unveiled its new Twitter emoji Wednesday, and soon took it down after users pointed out its resemblance to a swastika.  Markets  S&P 500: -0.1%  DJIA: +0.7%  Nasdaq: -1.2%  Gold: $1,958 +0.1%     Insights  Research: Bitcoin Minnows Are Fierce Fish  After January’s price correction, which seemed dramatic by many standards but par for the course for crypto traders, bitcoin ""minnows"" (which we are calling those who hold 0.1-10 BTC) began accumulating crypto at record speed.  All the while, the number of wallets with a bitcoin balance of 100-1,000 declined, suggesting a sell-off by larger holders.  According to a new report from Glassnode, these ""minnows"" also have a fierce appetite for pain and are hodling their crypto through some intense volatility and price compression even though their coins have yet to experience a breakout.  For its part, Glassnode is defining long-term holders as those who bought before bitcoin’s all-time high in October 2021, while anyone who bought after that date is considered a short-term holder.  Those who bought after the all-time high – regardless of portfolio size – didn’t like the ride.  Glassnode points to a massive sell-off by those who bought at the top (short-term holders) at around $50K-$60K.  “What we can see is that the recent correction pushed a historically significant volume of LTH coins into an unrealized loss. This means that the amount of buying between August and November, which has now become underwater HODLing, is some of the most significant of all time,” Glassnode wrote.  Glassnode notes that investors who bought the top, those active between August 2021 and January 2022, have seen prices plunge beneath their cost basis and have dumped bitcoin, causing a “large-scale redistribution of the bitcoin supply to new hands.”  And these new hands aren’t necessarily long-term holders picking up additional supply.  At the same time, Glassnode observes that those who purchased bitcoin in the last week of January – the minnows – are still hodling.  “Much of the volume profile from [Jan. 22] remains intact. Despite an additional 2.5 months of sideways consolidation, a large proportion of the market appears unwilling to spend and sell their coins, even if their coins are held at a loss,” Glassnode wrote.  A big part of the bitcoin ethos is testing your faith, or conviction, in the asset class. Crypto has sustained immense periods of volatility, bear markets and a bull market as well, yet there still are investors willing to dive in.  “This correction has been historically significant, suggesting the confidence and conviction of bitcoin investors has been thoroughly tested,” Glassnode wrote. “What we have seen over the last [five] months is a 50%+ correction that appears to have significantly reshuffled the ownership structure of BTC. A great many long-term holders with coins above $50K appear completely unfazed, whilst others have been totally shaken out, at a historically significant rate.”  Some whales may have been shaken out but the minnows keep on swimming.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support With Higher Price Lows; Resistance at $46K  Bitcoin (BTC) has maintained support above $37,500 over the past month, indicating a loss of downside momentum.  On intraday charts, however, BTC appears to be overbought, which could briefly stall the current upswing in price.  A series of higher price lows since Jan. 24 suggests continued buying interest around the $32,000-$37,500 support zone, which is the bottom of a year-long price range.  The next major resistance level is seen at $46,700, which has capped price rallies over the past few months. Typically, price rises begin to stall after retracing roughly 38% to 50% of the prevailing downtrend, similar to what occurred in September of last year.  Still, the significant slowdown in BTC's long-term uptrend suggests upside could be limited over the next few months.

Since then, there have been a total of three halvings that have seen block reward cut down by half each time. The next bitcoin halving will happen in 2024 which means that the market is halfway there. As this fourth halving draws close, we take a look at how this affects the supply of BTC and in turn, the value of the cryptocurrency. Fourth Halving Coming Up The bitcoin halving is scheduled to happen every 210,000 blocks and the estimate for the next halving is put at May 4th, 2024, going by the current rate at which BTC is being mined. Currently, there have been a little over 19 million BTC mined, which only leaves an additional 2 million BTC that is left to be mined. With the halving cutting block reward by half, presently sitting at 6.25 BTC per block, it helps to predict the supply mechanics of the digital asset.

The equity offerings may include ordinary shares, preferred shares (including convertible preferred shares), warrants and units comprised of any combination thereof, according to the filing.  The company said the proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, buying new mining equipment, other potential acquisitions and general working capital.  H.C. Wainwright will act as the underwriter if Bit Digital sells ordinary shares and will offer to sell about 181.8 million shares, implying a roughly 241% increase in outstanding shares, if all of the $500 million worth of shares are sold.  That being said, the prospectus is a “shelf” registration, meaning there is no present intention to immediately sell all the securities being registered.  Bit Digital migrated all of its bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs in North America from China last year amid China’s sweeping ban of the industry. Almost 40% of its machines have came online in North America as of March 16.  The rest of the miners that are awaiting installation in the U.S. are expected to be installed at sites operated by Compute North and/or at the new facilities to be operated by Digihost and Blockfusion in upstate New York this year, the company said in the filing.  Bit Digital’s offering comes shortly after one of the largest bitcoin miners, Riot Blockchain (RIOT), filed a similar prospectus to sell up to $500 million shares in an ATM offering. And another miner, Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI), also announced this month it was looking to raise up to $500 million in equity offerings.

Even more astounding was the ability to create Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), billed as one of the best enablers of blockchain&apos;s mass adoption. Being a very young innovation, the current range of uses for NFTs and blockchain at large are just a scratch on the surface. The applications are bound to increase over time with the potential to touch on people&apos;s everyday activities. Can those with ill intent utilize the unique features of NFTs to evade tax? Read on to find out. Understanding the Nature of NFTs An NFT is a unique unit of cryptographic data or asset stored on a blockchain that can&apos;t be interchanged with a unit of another crypto asset. Unlike other types of digital assets on the blockchain, the underlying metadata can&apos;t be replicated and is therefore always unique to a specific NFT. This uniqueness makes NFTs so different from cryptocurrencies and other tokens. For starters, it can&apos;t be used as a currency or unit of exchange since currencies must be fungible (interchangeable) with units of each other. However, it is perfect for use as a digital representation of unique assets due to its non-fungibility.

42421175,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd56z,1650491564,Derek Edward Schloss: Unlocking the Art Market,"When Derek Edward Schloss graduated college, during the last recession, he had wrapped up 15 odd jobs.  It was time for a vacation. Surfing up and down the West Coast with a close friend would give him a much needed buffer.  Wanting to live in Eugene, Schloss moved there and later attended the University of Oregon’s law and business programs. But after passing the bar in 2014 he opted out of practicing law. Instead, Schloss tried his hand at a consumer products company with a few classmates.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  Yet, he felt like he was missing the mark. Looking for something bigger and with more value, he was drawn to the digital world and found that Twitter and everyday video games were just stepping stones to the FOMO-led trend we see today: digital marketplaces.  But he needed to pay the bills, and a part of him still liked working with people in the real world. He became interested in consumer purchasing behaviors and, by extension, how and why people trade assets on blockchains.  Curiosity has driven him ever since, enabling Schloss to eventually become a leading venture capitalist in the non-fungible token (NFT) and creative crypto space, investing in music, fashion, art and gaming.  In 2017, the conversations Schloss and his friends were having centered around protocols and initial coin offerings (ICO) while at parties or at the beach. ”I remember having these conversations and being like, ‘It doesn’t make any sense.’ That only meant getting under the hood to figure out what was happening.”  Schloss later started writing about it, advising a couple of projects in New York and Los Angeles around that intersection of Web 3 and digital art. Later, he reconnected with Stephen McKeon, his former finance professor and now partner at Collab Currency, a crypto-focused venture fund.  The two looked to find answers as to why the intersection of Web 3 and digital art was happening at all. They ran a think tank for a brief period of time, launching the venture fund shortly after, in early 2020.  Initially, they raised $50 million, followed by a second fund that raised $65 million. Schloss and McKeon are planning to raise a much larger fund at an undisclosed amount.  In the last few years, the fund has invested in a number of layer 1, or base, blockchain projects. Schloss is a founding member of FlamingoDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that caters to art and cultural objects, as well as gaming-based NeonDAO, fashion-focused RedDAO and music-based NoiseDAO.  In 2020, Schloss came across SuperRare, a curated marketplace for one-on-one crypto work. At the time “no one was really buying crypto art,” he said.  His “big unlock,” a thesis written with McKeon titled “You’re Sleeping on Crypto Art,” looked at the contemporary art market and, more importantly, what value it would unlock. Today, that big unlock is defined in mainstream media, with artists, social sites, sports and even banks, moving to find their own.  Since then he has invested in about 40 NFT projects. “We’re spending more and more of our time in digital environments,” he said. The trend isn’t so much about what people know about NFTs but the fear of missing out (FOMO).  In terms of investing, Schloss thinks about the types of people who are in these spaces, what they’re creating and why. He wants to invest in projects based in reality, purpose and potential.  Five years after his first venture into crypto, Schloss still considers whether or not projects in which he invests are playing it fast and loose. “You start to get a quick lens for what feels like a legitimate project that’s trying to create value in this new world,” he said, rather something that makes it look more like a cash grab.  “But sometimes it’s not binary,” he said. Sometimes it’s “‘Maybe I need to investigate and challenge my own biases to see if this is something worth pursuing in some way.’”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/20/derek-edward-schloss-unlocking-the-art-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec6670150a3c6812b59cd91f829627b8266c9a17-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After responses of shock over the new branding, Binance deleted its tweets with the emoji, as did CEO Changpeng Zhao. In a tweet, the exchange said a different hashflag would roll out imminently.  “Well that was obviously really embarrassing,” the world’s largest crypto exchange tweeted hours after the reveal.  “We’re not sure how that emoji got through several layers of review without anyone noticing,” the tweet continued.

The cryptocurrency is roughly flat over the past week, which could indicate some uncertainty among market participants.  Meanwhile, some alternative cryptos (altcoins) are starting to outperform bitcoin. For example, AAVE, EOS and CAKE all rose by more than 3% over the past 24 hours. Also, on Wednesday, a pair of tweets from the pseudonymous profiles ignited a 24% rally in the price of ApeCoin (APE), a token linked to the non-fungible token (NFT) project Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).  Trading volumes in the NFT market ticked higher last week, albeit at a far lower level than last year's peak. The uptick could reflect an increase in speculative behavior among crypto traders, which typically occurs when market sentiment is bullish.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Stocks were also mixed on Wednesday, while gold, a traditional safe haven asset, ticked higher.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  DeFi performance mixed  Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens have continue to underperform bitcoin and other large-cap cryptocurrencies.  The chart below shows the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DFX) compared with the CoinDesk Large Cap Index (DLCX). Typically, during market rallies, DeFi and other altcoins outperform BTC because of their higher risk profile.  The current downtrend in the DeFi index appears to be slowing, which could point to a brief rise in bullish sentiment among crypto traders.  A deeper look, however, shows mixed performance for some DeFi tokens such as AAVE, AMP and COMP. For example, over the past month, AMP has dropped 15%, compared with a 28% gain in COMP and roughly flat performance in BTC.  And the chart below shows net inflows to the 21Shares exchange-traded products over the past week. Positive figures could indicate a preference for alternative crypto products among investors.  For now, uncertainty remains, according to 21Shares. Bitcoin is a ""risk-on asset class, entirely at the mercy of the global macro outlook – as denoted via BTC’s continued correlation with the stock market,"" the firm wrote in a research report.  Altcoin roundup  Coinbase NFT marketplace: Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) launched the beta version of its long-awaited non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace on Wednesday, allowing a small group of users from a wait-list of 3 million to use the platform for the first time.

42423484,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aGHh,1650485960,Tesla’s Bitcoin Holdings Unchanged in Q1,"The value of Tesla’s (TSLA) bitcoin holdings remained unchanged at $1.26 billion for the second straight quarter, the electric car maker said in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday.  In both the first quarter and last year’s fourth quarter, Tesla did not buy or sell any bitcoin (BTC), nor did it record any impairments to the value of its holdings because the price of bitcoin was essentially flat from the end of the previous quarter to the subsequent one.  In last year's third quarter, Tesla did not add to or reduce its bitcoin holdings but was required to report a $51 million impairment to reflect the decline in the price of the cryptocurrency.  According to accounting rules for digital assets, if the price of an asset falls during a quarter, a company must report an impairment. But if the price increases, it is not reported as a gain on the balance sheet unless the asset is sold.  Tesla announced in February it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Later in Q1, the company trimmed its bitcoin position by 10%, a sale that boosted that quarter’s earnings by $272 million. Tesla didn’t buy or sell any bitcoin in the second quarter.  Overall, Tesla’s adjusted Q1 earnings per share came in at $3.22 versus the $2.26 expected by analysts, according to FactSet. Revenue came in at $18.8 billion against the $17.85 billion expected.  Tesla’s share price was rising by 3.6% to $1,012.01 in after-hours trading Wednesday. Shares have dipped close to 3% since the beginning of the year.

As of press time the largest cryptocurrency by market value was down 1% in the past 24 hours, wiping out some of its recent gains.  Bitcoin was changing hands at $41,064, off from a high of $42,209 reached earlier Wednesday.  21Shares and ETF Securities announced Wednesday they will both launch spot exchange-traded products for bitcoin and ether in Australia next week.  There’s also optimism for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of Teucrium Futures Fund. Teucrium’s application was approved under the “34 Act” (the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) instead of the “40 Act” (the Investment Company Act of 1940) under which all previous bitcoin futures ETFs were approved. With some spot bitcoin ETF applications filed under the 33 and 34 Acts, some analysts see the Teucrium decision as opening the way for a spot bitcoin ETF to win approval.  “I don't think there's any one major catalyst for price movement up or down right now,” said Jason Deane, bitcoin market analyst at Quantum Economics. “There are those who are trying to connect today's earlier jump with Australia's ETF announcement or Commerzbank's crypto custody application, but I think those are more of the steadily improving macro backdrop for bitcoin generally than reasons behind specific moves right now.”  “Medium- to long-term outlook remains very bullish,” Deane said. “Immediate to short term is uncertain and may well stay range-bound for some time yet.”  Investors appear to be confident in bitcoin’s long-term value.  “On-chain data shows long-term holders continue to accumulate and more bitcoin than ever is now 'locked,’” Deane said.  Among long-term bitcoin holders, “the BTC accumulation is not only a whales' game,” IntoTheBlock Insights wrote in a Telegram message. Blockchain data shows that “addresses holding less than 10 bitcoins have increased their holdings dramatically in 2022,” according to the firm.  “Bitcoin on-chain metrics continue to be bullish as bitcoin exchange reserves plummet further,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the UK based digital asset broker GlobalBlock in a newsletter. “This signals that the proportion of long-term holders are increasing as fewer people are willing to leave their Bitcoin on exchanges.”  Ether (ETH) fell 1.6% in the past 24 hours, still trading just above $3,000.  U.S. stocks were mixed, with the S&P 500 up 0.16% and the Nasdaq down 1.04%.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/20/bitcoins-quick-reversal-of-two-day-rally-leaves-price-back-at-41k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cedeac6698948cac98c09bd76ddf5e8c6aeae0eb-906x868.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Donations were made in toncoin (TON), the native currency of the ecosystem, over the course of 10 days starting April 7, according to an announcement Wednesday shared with CoinDesk.  A total of 527 million TON have been donated, worth just over $1 billion at the time of writing.  The funds came via 176 separate donations, with most coming from large holders.

""Treasury is also taking action against companies in Russia’s virtual currency mining industry. By operating vast server farms that sell virtual currency mining capacity internationally, these companies help Russia monetize its natural resources. Russia has a comparative advantage in crypto mining due to energy resources and a cold climate.

Unlike some crypto-related sanctions, OFAC did not list any bitcoin or other crypto wallet addresses associated with the sanctioned companies.  The U.S. has sanctioned various Russian oligarchs and key businesses after Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February, in the hopes that financial penalties might convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops.

42420818,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcUH,1650478033,Is Ethereum Staking Pool Lido’s Growth an Omen of Centralization?,"It has been a rollercoaster month in the world of Ethereum. On April 11, the first successful shadow fork of the Ethereum mainnet spurred optimism around a coming Merge, but expectations were tempered a few days later when core developer Tim Beiko speculated that the shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) is no longer likely to come in June as many had hoped.  Much has already been written about the delay, why it happened and whether proof-of-stake is still on the horizon for 2022 (Beiko says it is). But all of this speculation around timelines is a bit of a sideshow (in which I, admittedly, have indulged).  So on to what actually matters.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  New security, new problems  I wrote in last week’s newsletter that most Ethereum users won’t notice much of a change after the Merge. The network’s underwhelming network speeds (around 16 transactions per second, compared to Solana’s over 2,000 transactions per second) and high gas fees will remain mostly unchanged.  The Merge will, however, introduce an entirely new system for keeping the network secure, and with this new system come new threats of network centralization.  Enter, Lido, the liquid staking pool that might be on track to dominate the entire Ethereum staking ecosystem. If some skeptics are to be believed, the solution which makes it easy for anyone to stake on Ethereum might be the largest threat to the network’s security yet.  Centralization on Ethereum  Centralization can be interpreted in a variety of ways, but in this context, we’ll use it to refer to the ability for a small group of actors to sway a blockchain network in one direction or another – controlling anything from how the network is upgraded, to determining what transactions are or aren’t processed.  Blockchain centralization should be considered along a spectrum. It would be unfair to call Ethereum “centralized” just because there are fewer nodes operating the network (about 6,000) in comparison to Bitcoin (about 15,000). But at the same time, it’s difficult to call Ethereum completely “decentralized” when 20% of the initial supply of ether – 12 million ETH, or 10% of today’s supply – went to the Ethereum Foundation and a small group of early contributors.  There are many vectors by which a network like Ethereum might be considered “centralized,” but centralization is most pressing in the context of network security.  In today’s proof-of-work system, miners secure the network by devoting computer power to validating transactions. In return, miners get some of the fees generated whenever transactions are processed. They also receive a small amount of ETH that gets minted with each new block.  Cheating – e.g., sneaking in a fake transaction that moves tokens from one wallet to another – would require 51% of all of the network’s “hash power.”  Over time, Bitcoin and Ethereum have turned crypto mining into a multibillion-dollar industry, leading to the development of specialized computer hardware for the specific purpose of mining cryptocurrency (known as ASICs).  With so many expensive, highly specialized machines competing for network rewards, it is no longer profitable for most people to mine ether (or BTC) on their own computers.  Instead, a majority of mining activity has fallen into the hands of a small number of pools – groups of miners who work together to mine blocks in exchange for a share of all the group’s aggregate rewards.  While unlikely, just three pools on Ethereum could theoretically work together to sabotage the network by amassing more than 51% of its hash rate.  Proof-of-stake and centralization  In addition to dramatically decreasing the environmental toll of Ethereum, proof-of-stake has been framed as a way to improve decentralization.  Rewards will no longer flow to those with the most compute power. Instead, anyone who “stakes” 32 ETH is eligible to be randomly selected to verify each block and receive rewards. If a staker tries to sabotage the network, her stake can get slashed, meaning she loses some of her valuable ether.  Sabotaging the network via a 51% attack requires amassing more than half of all staked ether – a sum which, in today’s market, would amount to tens of billions of dollars. By the time a staker has managed to obtain that much ether, sabotaging the network wouldn’t make sense since it would (in theory) devalue that staker’s holdings. Even if an attacker's motivation is not financial, the upfront costs in Ethereum's PoS system are designed to render attacks infeasible.  PoS systems are not inherently less centralized than PoW. I wrote in this newsletter a couple of weeks ago about how the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) Ronin blockchain, which was exploited for over $600 million last month, was left vulnerable when a small group of stakers were left securing the entire system.  In Ronin’s system, five compromised passwords were essentially all it took to drain more than half a billion dollars into the hands of an attacker (controlled by North Korea, apparently).  But this is not an apples-to-apples comparison with Ethereum. Anyone will theoretically be allowed to stake on Ethereum’s PoS system, whereas Ronin’s small set of DPoS validators were handpicked by the chain’s creators.  Less centralized variations on the DPoS theme have been employed by other blockchains like Solana (DPoS holds a lot of advantages over PoS when securing a smaller network), but Ethereum’s developers say they are trying to make Ethereum as decentralized as possible by opening staking up to anyone.  Despite these ambitions, Ethereum’s PoS Beacon Chain – which is currently running in parallel with the PoW mainnet and will eventually merge with it – has shown that even more organic forms of centralization remain a threat.  Liquid staking on Lido  In the early days of the Beacon Chain at the start of 2021, it seemed as if centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken might be poised to dominate Ethereum staking by making it easy for their massive user bases to pool their ether and earn staking rewards.  While centralized exchanges are indeed playing a large role in the ETH staking game, the largest staker on Ethereum’s PoS Beacon Chain by far is Lido, a so-called liquid staking pool that has amassed a massive 30% share of all staking activity on Ethereum, according to Etherscan.  With over $35 billion staked on the Beacon Chain, how has Lido – a single staking solution – amassed $10 billion in ether?  Staking on Ethereum is costly and confusing for most users. Most people don’t have 32 ether (about $90,000) lying around to stake and setting up a node incorrectly (or even with shoddy Wi-Fi) can incur slashing, or the loss of one’s funds.  Staked ether is also illiquid. Until the Merge, ether staked on the Beacon Chain will be impossible to unstake, meaning it can’t be sold or used to earn interest via decentralized finance (DeFi).  Lido launched in December 2020 to make it easier for anyone to earn rewards for staking. If you give any amount of ether to Lido, the platform will bundle it up with ether belonging to others and hand the full sum (at least 32 ETH) over to one of Lido’s trusted node providers – a service that specializes in setting up validators. This enables you to earn some rewards (around 4% annually) for securing the network without the need for 32 ETH or any special expertise.  Lido is called a “liquid” staking solution because it gives out staked ether (stETH) – a 1:1 derivative of ether – to users who stake with the platform. This stETH accrues interest to match staking rewards, and although users will be unable to unstake ether until the Merge, they can sell their stETH back to the market if they’d like to cash out.  On top of earning staking rewards, it has become extremely common to use stETH to participate in DeFi activities like lending and borrowing to earn even greater yield.  As stETH has grown into a hugely popular DeFi primitive, or building block, more users have flocked to Lido. Although Lido started to see competition soon after it launched, it has dominated competitors, such as Rocketpool and Stkr, and now controls nearly 90% of the fast-growing liquid staking market.  A bid for decentralization  Over time, Lido has raised alarm bells among those who think it risks centralizing Ethereum’s PoS chain. By the looks of it, Lido might be on track to control over 50% of all staked ether, meaning the platform, which is governed by a community of LDO token holders, could have a stranglehold over the entire network.  By Lido’s own account, “75% of new stakers who joined in the last 30 days have done so via Lido.”  “While this validates our mission to democratize staking in Ethereum,” Lido said last week in a blog post, “some people have expressed concern that this level of success can make Lido a centralizing force.”  In the post and an accompanying Twitter thread, Lido explained how it is working to progressively decentralize its platform.  Most of Lido’s proposals center around reforming how the platform’s community delegates staking power to validator operators.  Although Lido doesn’t deploy validator nodes itself, it has spread staking responsibilities among about 20 handpicked node operators. Lido’s community could, theoretically, decrease this number should it so choose, though the community currently caps the max amount of ether a given partner is allowed to stake.  One of Lido’s proposed steps toward decentralization involves adopting “Distributed Validator Technology” (DVT) to group validators into independent committees that propose and attest to blocks together. According to Lido, this will “greatly reduce the risk of an individual validator underperforming or misbehaving.”  Lido also plans to introduce a scoring system to reward validator performance and says it plans to add governance mechanics to prevent changes from being rushed through the Lido decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO.  While Lido’s frank admission that it needs to decentralize will be welcomed by many, it is unlikely to appease critics who think the pool is little more than a rent-seeking monopolist – hoarding as much staking power as possible so it can mandate a cut for itself (a percent of staking rewards always goes back to the Lido protocol).  Others are concerned about what Lido’s massive growth might mean for network security, leading to calls that it pledge never to amass more than 50% of all staked ETH.  According to Hasu, a researcher at investment firm Paradigm who recently stepped in as a strategic advisor to Lido, such demands are misguided. In a blog post Hasu co-authored last year with Paradigm CTO Georgios Konstantopoulos, the pair argued that Ethereum staking is destined to become a winner-takes-all situation. Eventually, they say some giant will inevitably come along and amass a majority of the stake on Ethereum by making it easy for average ETH holders to secure the network in exchange for predictable rewards.  By teaming up with Lido, Hasu seems to think it is the pool best-poised to become this giant.  In their blog post, Hasu and Konstantopoulos note that a key strength of Lido is in the convenience of the stETH token. Why ever hold ETH when you can hold basically the same thing – stETH – and earn staking rewards at the same time?  José Maria Macedo, a partner at Lido investors Delphi Digital, struck a similar tone in a conversation with CoinDesk. “I think overall Lido wins just because of the network effects of the liquid staking derivative,” he explained.  “Ultimately you want to stake your ETH and have a derivative that has the most integrations possible, and I think [a centralized staking provider] is never going to get integrated into DeFi,” he explained. “If you stake with Binance and all you can do is have [ETH] locked in Binance – versus getting some stETH [from Lido] and being able to use it on Aave to lever up, or being able to use it to mint DAI on Maker – I just think [Lido] is always going to be a better product.”  Though Macedo isn’t as confident as Hasu that liquid staking will have a single winner, he agrees that Lido’s dominance is preferable to that of a centralized staking provider with no concept of community governance.  “Although there will always be a market for centralized solutions – since people will want simplicity – I think all things considered, [Lido] is better than the alternative,” Macedo said.

Validated takes  North Korean hacking group Lazarus is connected to the Ronin Network’s $625 million exploit, according to U.S. officials.  WHY IT MATTERS: The FBI linked Lazarus with the validator breach and the Treasury Department added an Ethereum address to its sanctions list on April 14. The attack on the Axie Infinity-linked Ronin bridge was the largest exploit in crypto history. The Treasury’s action to blacklist an alleged Lazarus-held crypto wallet highlights the U.S. government’s commitment to prevent money laundering with stolen funds and to disrupt malicious cyber actors.

Hence, their technology has become outdated compared to those created to improve features. In 2015, Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin created Ethereum, a decentralized platform that would allow anyone to create and distribute apps. In its whitepaper, Ethereum predicted decentralized finance and Web3 would be the most significant blockchain application. Developers of the Ethereum network have been working on a series of significant changes that will bring about many changes to the platform. The goal of the Merge is to maintain a stable and secure network while also improving scalability. The Shift to Proof of Stake Ethereum uses proof of work to validate transactions recorded on the blockchain. Computers race to solve puzzles and receive rewards in ETH as a result. However, this method has been criticized for the longest time for being energy-intensive, hence environmental degradation. Ethereum is looking to shift to proof of stake, whereby the consensus mechanism is 99% more energy efficient. Here, proof of stake validates transactions through the addresses that stake ETH. The higher the stake, the more the rewards. As you have heard, Merge hit the news last year, and it aims to make the Ethereum Network cheap and fast.

42394226,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaTEV,1650474061,Will Rising Interest Rates Sink the Crypto Ecosystem?,"Interest rates across the U.S. economy are beginning to tick up – and in some cases surge.  These rates obviously affect borrowers, but they also provide higher returns for lenders, including in some relatively safe assets. That competition for capital, among other factors, has already brought doom to speculative assets including stocks in “growth” technology firms. While crypto has held up surprisingly well by some metrics, it is stalked by the same dark horse.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The most notable spike in interest rates has come in the mortgage market, with 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages reaching an average of 5.3% on April 19, a 12-year high. On the same day, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bill hit 2.94%, still historically low but the highest rate seen since 2018. Most incredible – and for those holding speculative investments, perhaps most symbolically terrifying – the return on risk-free, inflation-adjusted U.S. savings bonds is expected to reach nearly 10% in May. Obviously, all of those rates are offset by current high inflation – but so is every other investment.  These are still somewhat tentative signs of the rising cost of capital. Broadly, that’s because changes to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s lending rate to banks spread into the wider economy according to complex human judgment calls about the future. For instance, a bank that thinks the interest rate spike is temporary might continue lending at a lower rate to steal volume from competitors that raise rates first. So changes starting to appear now, one month after the Fed began a series of planned rate hikes, could be just the beginning.  Rising rates are already changing the risk-reward calculation for investors, particularly larger investors like hedge funds. It’s a complex calculus, because a “safe” investment like a bond can easily attract money that otherwise would have gone to a higher-return but also higher-risk asset. Those higher-risk assets definitely include most if not all cryptocurrencies and other token assets.  There are already strong signs of a gradual but steady transition to lower-risk assets (though those impacts are hard to entirely untangle from an ongoing reversion for so-called stay at home stocks). The Nasdaq 100 is a basket of stocks topped by the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA), stocks that still have at least a bit of “growth” expectation built in – or, put another way, their price before the current slump implied significant future growth. The Nasdaq 100 is down more than 12% since January, compared to a 4.4% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is relatively heavier in slower-growing banking, retail and manufacturing stocks.  See also: Fed Chair Powell Says He Has 'No Intention' of Banning Crypto  Once you start looking at even more speculative groupings, the carnage gets much worse.  Risk off (way, way off)  The poster child here is ARK Innovation, the aggressively future-forward fund managed by Cathie Wood. Wood has bet heavily on truly speculative tech, fintech and biotech growth firms including Robinhood (HOOD); Shopify; Unity; Block (SQ), the former Squarew; Tesla (TSLA), ARK Innovation’s biggest holding; and Zoom. These are firms that either aren’t profitable yet (most of the biotechs), were expected to become much more profitable (Zoom) or are only profitable thanks to aggressive accounting (Tesla).  Wood’s basket of long shots has dropped a walloping 60% from its 2021 peak. Notably, that’s significantly worse than the performance of bitcoin (BTC), which is currently off about 38% from its 2021 peak. Ether (ETH) is off even less at 35%, while the total market cap of all cryptos is off close to 36%, according to data from CoinGecko.  It’s really stunning to see crypto hold up better than a more conventional technology growth fund. Certainly part of that is continuing investor optimism about crypto and blockchain, which can, to be clear, still trump granular considerations of risk and return.  But there are also significant structural and transparency differences in crypto that make an impact. Most of all, a conventional startup with high spending in excess of income, or “burn rate,” will see its equity value drop faster in a higher interest rate environment because “burn” implies future borrowing. But in crypto, the “burn rate” of a blockchain is not collated in a single place – arguably, it is instead spread out among the various maintainers and contributors in a way that’s hard to read. In other words, it’s more difficult to figure out the real financial picture of a blockchain ecosystem, particularly whether it’s somehow reliant on outside financing, than when it comes to equities.  However, there are specific situations where protocols are clearly dependent on external funding. Some of these are acute events, such as when the hacked Wormhole bridge was bailed out by Jump Trading. Much more worrisome are the obvious and ongoing deficits run by various staking or lending pools.  See also: Why Stablecoin Interest Rates Are So Damn High | Opinion  For instance, the yield on Terra’s Anchor protocol is heavily subsidized, with about half of returns to lenders coming from outside capital rather than borrowers. For now, the funders regard that as a worthwhile marketing expenditure, but rising rates elsewhere will almost inevitably have some crowding-out effect.  Buckle up  For now optimism may be supporting crypto through the big interest rate transition. But hopium has its limits, and crypto has significant tail risks that could make future drawdowns much more violent. In particular, those staking and yield pools often support other products that would become less stable if competition drew away capital.  Anchor ranks high among those risks: It forms a major pillar of the ecosystem supporting the fast-growing UST stablecoin. There is already near-frantic discussion of the internal fragility of UST’s “algorithmic” model.  Add external pressure from safer high returns elsewhere, and it’s not hard to imagine a perfect storm just over the horizon.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA,David Z.

There have been instances where they have broken out of this trend of low performance, but they seem to fall right back in. This does not spell all bad news for the futures premiums as it hints at exhaustion coming. This is attributed to the premiums trading close to yearly lows indicating that it is nearly a point of exhaustion across the board. Bitcoin Futures Premiums Down The reason behind the bitcoin futures premiums being down can be attributed to sell-offs that have rocked the digital asset in recent times. Not only have the sell-offs been apparent in investors who are directly exposed to the cryptocurrency but those who have exposure through traditional markets vehicles like ETFs have been selling off too. The most prominent of these have been the high outflows recorded from the ProShares BITO ETF, which is said to be one of the major drivers behind the low basis.

42423489,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aGTh,1650470400,Decent Labs Launches DAO With Crypto Investing Giants at $56M Valuation,"Last month, Web 3 venture studio Decent Labs launched Fractal, a developer framework to help companies scale their operations as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It turns out Fractal was the first project from Decent DAO, a new project formally announced on Wednesday with a $10 million on-chain investment at a $56 million valuation from top names in crypto investing.  Crypto native firms BlockTower Capital and GSR led the investment with participation from Cumberland DRW, Digital Currency Group and 1kx, among others (Digital Currency Group also owns CoinDesk as an independent subsidiary).  “We didn’t raise from traditional Silicon Valley or New York venture capital funds. We raised from funds that were started and grown in the crypto industry. That’s something that’s really important to us,” Decent Labs co-founder and CEO Parker McCurley told CoinDesk in an interview.  A venture studio builds companies rather than offering up a passive investment, a tactic that McCurley thinks has lost its competitive edge. Decent DAO is a shared decentralized studio for venture funds, builders and others to come together and build protocols.  Project building  Decent Labs has five years of experience developing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions on Ethereum. Decent DAO has only the broad mission of supporting open-source decentralized systems that involve tokenization as an economic driver.  “The good news is that we can actually remain nimble and flexible and build things as they’re needed,” said McCurley.  Read more: Why This 111-Year-Old Investment Firm Is Launching a DAO  How does Decent DAO choose the projects that receive capital and development resources?  “We will basically have a biannual cohort that allows proposed projects to be voted on and determined,” said McCurley. The projects will be “envisioned, tested, researched and determined by Decent DAO members.”  Decent DAO will staff each new project with core contributors in the areas of development, design, product and marketing to get it started.  DAO structure  The definition of a DAO, like Web 3, differs depending on who is using the term. At heart, a DAO is simply a collection of people working toward a shared goal with some type of token ownership involved.  Decent DAO will initially look more like “autonomous clusters of people that are working toward various parts of a shared mission,” said McCurley. The tight-knit community of experts also means that a decision can be made without consulting with the entire DAO first.  The DAO is fully remote and doesn’t employ full-time contributors for the projects. Interested contributors can either receive a set payment for a single defined task, or receive an income of sorts through a non-transferable NFT, which contains their job responsibilities and the ability to receive tokens on a regular basis.  “The number one goal I have is to make [Decent DAO] the most contributor-friendly organization in the world,” said McCurley.  Future plans  McCurley sees existing venture studios such as Atomic and Betaworks as having a three-legged approach: a high-risk, high-reward venture studio that’s building and funding projects; an accelerator that provides smaller amounts of funding to a larger group of founder-driven projects; and the relatively lower-risk, lower-reward passive funding model.  Decent Labs has experience on the accelerator front, and a number of Decent DAO members are venture funds. Decent DAO is focused for now on launching the studio side of the organization, but accelerator and venture funds could be launched as sub-DAOs in the future.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/20/decent-labs-launches-dao-with-crypto-investing-giants-at-56m-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/992342343051939f030239db3f0a9261a5fe5cab-3201x1801.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42423495,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aGfh,1650470400,"BlueYard, Sequoia Invest in Privy to Bring Secure Data to Web 3","Crypto has a user experience problem.  Investors find out their position has been liquidated on Twitter because there’s no email address associated with their on-chain account to send out an alert. A person with multiple non-fungible token (NFT) wallets has to sign into each wallet individually rather than having a universal login. Fixing the problem involves collecting user data, which makes some crypto natives anxious because Web 2 data collection has gone as smoothly as the Titanic’s maiden voyage, with a similar amount of leaks.  Data startup Privy hopes to bridge the gap between a smooth user experience and the importance of secure data and user consent. The company announced a $8.3 million seed funding round on Wednesday co-led by Sequoia Capital and BlueYard Capital.  Privy offers application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers can use to manage and integrate user data. The encrypted data is privately associated with on-chain addresses to allow developers to text or email users without directly handling their personal information. Projects requiring financial and compliance data, a common need in decentralized finance (DeFi), can take on that sensitive data without using local storage.  Privy knows the idea of collecting any data can be a hard sell in certain areas of crypto.  “My stance on privacy is that privacy isn’t about no data being shared,” said Privy co-founder Asta Li in an interview with CoinDesk. “Privacy is about control over that data. It’s about being able to revoke when you choose to and really putting that control in the hands of the users.”  Use cases  Among other participants in the funding round were Electric Capital, Archetype, BoxGroup and Protocol Labs. Privy plans to use the capital to build out its team – particularly on the engineering and research fronts – and to continue creating use cases that meet customer needs.  “Our fear is that developers start just dumping user data into databases and the promise of Web 3 as a sort of sovereign space for user data, where user control is paramount, goes away.” co-founder Henri Stern told CoinDesk. “So we’re excited to get in the hands of developers as quickly as we can.”  Stern said Privy has seen a lot of activity in the spaces of DeFi, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and “what we would call Web 2 serving Web 3,” which includes hardware, wallet providers, crypto exchanges and on- and off-ramps.  In other words, areas where compliance and communication are key.  Sequoia backing  Fresh off announcing a new $600 million crypto venture fund, Sequoia Capital participated in this funding with partners Shaun Maguire and Josephine Chen steering the investment.  Maguire highlighted the credentials of Privy’s “privacy-obsessed” founders. Privy’s Stern previously worked as a research scientist at open-source research and development hub Protocol Labs, which counted BlueYard Capital among its inventors.

The decentralization of data, attribution and peer review has been a long-term goal of many scientific scholars. Using decentralized platforms could revolutionize the production and dissemination of scientific publications. The current system is outdated, relies on publisher cartels and has resulted in poor reproducibility of published data and papers. The consequences are not only loss of public credibility but also decreased public funding. What Decentralization of Science Looks Like The decentralization of science is a paradigm shift in funding, sharing, and monetizing science. Currently, scientists spend most of their time competing for increasingly inadequate funds. Unfortunately, a substantial amount of those funds go to the most famous researchers. Furthermore, the hypercompetitive nature of academia saps individual creativity and contributes to systemic biases that drive many scientists out of the field. DeSci offers an alternative to current science and supports decentralization over centralized control. Creating a decentralized science organization will create more transparency and reduce redundancy-two key challenges of the scientific community today. For example, decentralized communities would enable peer review of scientific papers and award tokens to reviewers.

42411818,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDC7,1650468180,The Link Between Bitcoin and Inflation,"With inflation continuing to rise, people are drawn to anything that they can flock to as a hedge against inflation. Additionally, the recent turmoil hitting Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse, Silvergate and other banks has increased interest in ways to secure one’s wealth without a bank. With both these economic issues at play, there’s renewed interest in if Bitcoin is the answer to both problems.  See Also: Bitcoin Is a Clear Winner of the U.S. Banking Crisis  Despite arguments to the contrary, cryptocurrency is often considered an inflation-resistant asset, and advocates often tout it as an asset class that’s uncorrelated with real-world assets. But things quickly become complicated when you learn that cryptocurrencies are unique, and some are inflationary by design.  Read More: What Are Inflationary and Deflationary Cryptocurrencies?  What is inflation, anyway?  Inflation is an economic term that refers to periods when prices rise over time. Often, that’s because a currency devalues – when one unit of the same currency buys you less stuff than it used to. If you watch a documentary from the '80s and see someone selling a burger for 50 cents, while that same joint charges you 10 bucks – that’s inflation in action.  You might have realized the pinch of inflation when prices rise faster than your wages. You’re worse off if your $50,000 salary paycheck buys you 10% fewer goods and services than the year before. But if your employer boosts your salary to $55,000, you won’t have to change your spending habits and won’t feel the effects of inflation.  Economists think that a little bit of inflation is helpful to keep people buying, thereby stimulating the economy. But in times of economic crisis, like the coronavirus pandemic, inflation can get out of hand.  Economists disagree about the causes of the current bout of inflation – the worst in decades – which measures at around 6% in the U.S. as of this update, but hit as high as 8.5% in 2022. Some people point their fingers at the Federal Reserve for printing too much money, which in turn was used to stimulate the economy and handle the pandemic.  Others say that the Fed’s not squarely to blame – supply shortages caused by lockdowns were the main problem. Finally, corporations have been accused of opportunistically raising prices during a news cycle that allows them to blame inflation for rising costs when in reality, their profits are the thing that's rising fastest.  Bitcoin and inflation  Crypto advocates think that allowing central bankers to influence the economy through monetary policies, namely quantitative easing, leads to disaster. Rampant money printing from the central banks of Venezuela, Turkey and Zimbabwe have ruined their respective economies.  Crypto advocates often say that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) are resistant to the incompetence of central bankers and governments because they are decentralized, and cannot be shut down.  Another reason is that bitcoin’s issuance is determined by code – unlike the Fed, a central bank can’t just mint as much bitcoin as it wants.  Read more: Bitcoin and Inflation: Everything You Need to Know  While more bitcoin enters circulation over time, the rate at which new bitcoin is issued to miners is determined by the Bitcoin protocol. The supply is capped, and supplies of new coins are estimated to run dry around the year 2140. And unlike central banks, whose economists must respond to market events, the Bitcoin blockchain runs like clockwork.  Approximately every four years, the protocol cuts the issuance of new bitcoin by half – the phenomenon is known as the “halving”.  Bitcoin’s fixed supply has led some fans to consider it akin to “digital gold” – in reference to the yellow metal, another beloved inflation-resistant asset. So-called stores of value assets stand the test of time because they are uncorrelated with other assets and are resistant to entities that interfere with the market. But are cryptocurrencies like bitcoin really a hedge against inflation?  The argument against bitcoin being an inflation-resistant asset  While the U.S. dollar has fallen, bitcoin has far outpaced its value, rewarding early investors. But the cryptocurrency is highly volatile: Talk to recent investors who lost money when bitcoin cratered, and they might tell you that their investment has not outpaced inflation in the short term.  In the past few years, bitcoin has tracked the U.S. stock market, which performs well when the economy is stimulated and stutters when spending decreases – like in times of high inflation. When inflation reached 40-year highs in December 2021, bitcoin fell. The question of whether bitcoin is a long-term inflation hedge is difficult to answer without the benefit of hindsight.  However, not all cryptocurrencies work like bitcoin. Some cryptocurrencies are deflationary – meaning that the supply decreases over time, designed to increase the value of the coin over time (if the demand remained the same).  Other cryptocurrencies have dynamic supplies, and some tokens, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are one of a kind – like a piece of fine art, their value is dependent on their uniqueness.  In the end, Bitcoin is still a relatively new financial asset and it hasn't yet proven a consistent hedge against inflation, but as the asset class develops, it may hold a similar place to gold for investors in their portfolio.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/the-link-between-bitcoin-and-inflation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc347dcecebfd41f1ff72667e8776a963bb97af3-1546x1159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The figure, a sharp rise from the 6% reported in 2020, suggests the sector is overtaking more traditional foreign exchange scams among the issues that get referred to public prosecutors, the report by Marielle Cohen-Branche said.  French crypto investors were also warned they wouldn’t be able to complain about providers that aren’t registered with France's national financial markets authority, the AMF.  “The ombudsman is only able to act if the professional has actively solicited the investor in France,” the report said, noting the emergence of a “new type of dispute concerning crypto assets.”  Under French law, crypto providers that want to sell in France must register with the AMF, which checks governance and compliance with anti-money laundering norms.  But French clients who on their own initiative seek out foreign crypto providers might be left without any redress if there’s a problem, the ombudsman pointed out.

42411816,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgD2C,1650464628,"No Non-Fungible Tokens, No Entry: How NFT Social Clubs Work","To most people, non-fungible tokens (NFT) conjure up thoughts of digital artworks selling for eye-watering sums, or tradable items from online play-to-earn and metaverse-based games. But clubs, companies and creators are now applying them in a whole new way: as keys to exclusive members-only areas.  NFTs are tokens used to represent ownership of a unique asset located elsewhere on the internet – typically something non-physical – and are stored on a public blockchain like Ethereum, Cardano or Solana. Assets can include anything from concept artwork to virtual parcels of metaverse land.  By tokenizing these items, it makes transferring ownership and authenticating them much easier.  Read more: Decentraland For Beginners: How to Get Started  Taking this concept further, some have begun to use these types of cryptocurrency as badges that people must purchase and present in order to access certain social channels.  The emergence of NFT social clubs  Perhaps the most famous social club encoding membership with crypto tokens as of early 2022 is called Friends with Benefits, a group that attracted the attention of the New York Times in March. It describes itself as “a group of Web 3-focused thinkers, builders, creators, and friends”. It has more than 3,000 members already.  It is situated primarily on Discord, but it also organizes real-world events for its members. It’s a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that everything it does is a result of a vote by its members. Owning 5 FWB tokens gets you access to some local events and 75 gets you global access and voting rights in the DAO. You can swap for the tokens through the Friends with Benefits website, which uses the Uniswap protocol. But you’ll still need to be personally approved by a committee of existing members before getting true membership, giving the club a sense of exclusivity.  Read more: Crypto Discord: Where to Go, What to Know  Maxwell Tribeca will be an NFT social club much more similar to a traditional physical members club when it launches. It will offer members access to an 8,000-square-foot space in New York City at 135 Watts Street modeled after a Basque eating club, according to Bloomberg.  What you get with your membership is a personal or shared locker in which to store your own drinks, so when you get there, you just pour what you want for yourself, instead of queuing at a bar.  Media attention has also clustered around an upcoming restaurant in New York City that will be open only to the holders of certain NFTs. It’s called the Flyfish Club, co-founded by serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and set to open in 2023.  It offers two tiers of membership: The basic one gives you general access to the main restaurant; the more expensive NFT option additionally unlocks the omakase room offering diners high-end Japanese meals curated specifically by the chef.  Both types of Flyfish NFTs have sold out, so any hopeful members would now have to buy through an NFT marketplace. The basic tokens were originally sold at 2.5 ETH each, but by mid-April 2022 they could not be obtained for less than 3.5 ETH on NFT marketplace OpenSea.  So why haven’t clubs made memberships tradable in the past? One reason was probably the burden of checking the authenticity of a membership that could pass through any number of hands before reaching the one that presents it at the door. It was safer for a club to have a direct relationship with every member. Today, that’s where NFTs get to show off their moves, in particular their indisputably authentic ownership.  In the past too, an exclusive members-only club might have wanted to know who its members were before they turned up, in case of attracting an undesirable clientele. These days, those conventions may be unwinding.  But what’s the point?  The point of a NFT is its uniqueness. That makes them perfect tools for signifying things that are already special about their owners. For example, NFTs can be used to identify those who have the right to access certain online areas. In other words, they can work like an online membership card.  Not the mention, by virtue of being stored on a blockchain, NFTs are easy to verify meaning it’s impossible to counterfeit memberships or create duplicates.  For the clubs themselves, the most simple advantage of an NFT membership system is that it saves its members a small amount of mental and physical effort. If it’s a physical club, there is no need to remember a membership card or wait for staff to check your name on a list. If it’s an online venue, you don’t need to remember any login details.  Using NFTs as memberships can be an alternative to the password model. Most of us use different passwords for different services online for the sake of security, but this adds a complication to the user experience. Piggybacking off the security of your crypto wallet, all you have to do is connect your wallet, and the club or service can check immediately whether you have the required tokens.  In fact, any service you use could check all the NFT memberships that you hold, making it easy for you to take advantage of promotional offers and so on.  Another advantage of an NFT membership model is that the traded prices of the tokens show the issuer exactly how highly valued the membership is. Instead of trying to calculate the optimal price to set for newly issued memberships, they can simply be offered at the current market price. If there has been an influx of new interest in the service, it will be revealed by an increase in the traded price of memberships.  Of course, issuers can still profit from recurring payments attached to ownership of the NFTs if they want to. They can also collect a percentage of any resale price and therefore gather significant revenue from growing interest in what they’re doing, without even issuing any new memberships.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/no-non-fungible-tokens-no-entry-how-nft-social-clubs-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ab8fcfba0031484764b6771f0f69247bfcaf8b1-1989x1492.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394237,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaTyf,1650464197,6 Things You Should Know About Crypto Twitter,"Many people make general assumptions about the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. To cut through the noise, our team at Affinio analyzed 600,000 U.S.-based Twitter followers of the industry’s largest cryptocurrency accounts.  We wanted to know more than just their demographics or what they had to say. We wanted to determine their true affinities.  What do they love? To whom do they listen? What is unique about this group? Most importantly, what sub-communities exist within their larger collective?  Leanne Cochrane is the vice president, Product Management at Affinio, a division of NowVertical Group. She has been helping global brands better understand their audiences for the last six years. Prior to Affinio, she held product roles for various enterprise companies and start-ups, all from her home in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Between Dec. 29, 2021, and Jan. 27, 2022, our analysis helped confirm some previous assumptions about Crypto Twitter (for example, male dominance of the conversation, interest in Elon Musk) but also unearthed a few surprisingly deep affinities for both sports and gaming.  By looking into the behaviors, definitions and affinities of both active and passive users in the Twitter discussion, we found that this group is no monolith. In fact, the crypto community has different audience clusters, each with their own likes, dislikes and behaviors.  As part of our analysis, we applied an algorithm to look at the Twitter accounts followed and engaged with by every single member in our defined audience. Once the algorithm detected a common following pattern among a subset of users in the larger group, that pattern in turn became the ""fingerprint"" for the cluster and the signals against which sequential users were segmented. This effectively broke the audience into individual clusters based on those affinities, allowing us to dig in and discover the trends and actions most likely to move the conversation for each sub-community within the larger crypto discussion.  See also: Elon Musk Shouldn't Lead Twitter | Opinion  The clusters identified each have different interests in politics, culture and the cryptocurrencies that they follow. The Twitter crypto community remains highly diverse.  Crypto Twitter is male-dominated, gets its news from social media.  The majority of the U.S. Twitter crypto audience is made up of males in their early to mid-30s who largely reside in New York, Los Angeles and other parts of California. They self-describe not just as crypto investors but as fathers, husbands, engineers, entrepreneurs and business professionals, making up 70% of the audience. They source their crypto news from places like YouTube, OpenSea, Crypto.com, Medium and Reddit. Among their top categories of interest are finance, podcasts, cars and esports.  Top tech CEOs like Elon Musk of Tesla (TSLA) and Bill Gates, formerly of Microsoft (MSFT) influence this audience heavily, along with widely known crypto entrepreneurs like ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees and Coinbase (COIN) co-founder Brian Armstrong. Industry stars Cameron Winklevoss, Andreas Antonopoulos, Tyler Winklevoss, Charlie Lee and Roger Ver followed closely behind.  Members of this audience visit Twitter to discuss non-fungible tokens (NFT), sports and the metaverse. Coinbase is their preferred app to trade and invest. And their top brands include Tesla, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), PlayStation (MYPS), Apple (AAPL), Wendy's (WEN) and Nike (NKE).  Many people in the crypto Twitter community are big sports fans who love DOGE.  We grouped our analysis based on Twitter users’ affinities and defined interests. Users identifying as sports and football fans, gamers, university students and music lovers made up one particularly large cluster (17%). They love engaging on the platform to discuss sports news and events, tweet at sports broadcasters and share National Football League (NFL) memes. SportsCenter, ESP, and WorldstarHipHop are the top media accounts they follow.  PlayStation is their gaming console of choice, and Tesla, Nike and Netflix are among their favorite brands. Ben Baller (founder of Icee Fresh Jewels) and sports analyst Mike Clay heavily influence this cluster. This community bonds through their passion for the National Basketball Association (NBA), NFL and fantasy sports.  This group’s favorite cryptocurrency is DOGE, which dominates their general interests, even more than top accounts from the likes of Elon Musk and LeBron James.  Ethereum, Bitcoin and Web 3 hype…  The largest cluster with a crypto-specific affinity grouping (14%) focused primarily on Ethereum, Bitcoin and Web 3 hype. Most of them are 36-year-old males living in San Francisco, Denver and Miami. They use terms like bitcoin (BTC), blockchain, and cryptocurrency in their Twitter bio, which reveals their passion for crypto investing. Some offer crypto investing tips to their followers, and they often tag crypto analysts and stock brokers like Will Clemente and Peter Schiff in their tweets.  The cluster uses Twitter to discuss a wide range of Bitcoin, Web 3, and Ethereum-related topics. They favor Substack and Block Crypto among newsletters and often use them to source information. CCN, Stocktwits and both CNBC's ""Fast Money"" and ""Mad Money"" are among the group’s top media interests, and Apple, Adidas and Tesla are among their preferred brands. Crypto journalists and bloggers like Laura Shin and Peter Todd also influence them heavily. They love crypto education and reporting.  This community is the most crypto-dedicated cluster in the survey. You can also see them following many venture capitalists and CEOs in this space, and they were likely early adopters of cryptocurrency.  A large part of the Crypto Twitter community is interested in NFTs and less common currencies.  We found that 13% of Crypto Twitter is made up of DOGE and SHIB army fans, 11% Binance and AirDrop fans, and 10% non-fungible token (NFT) collectors and ADA traders. These hefty percentages show that there are huge crypto audiences outside Bitcoin and Ethereum, each with their own disparate interests and influences. For example, NFT collectors and Cardano fans are not just influenced by the biggest names and brands in technology and cryptocurrency. People marketing to the crypto industry should be aware of the power of niche influence.  A large part of the crypto Twitter community are political news junkies  A large chunk of Crypto Twitter (19% of our analysis) is made up of political news junkies in their mid-30s largely based in Manhattan, San Francisco and Seattle. We can infer, from how they describe themselves, that they work in tech and software and some are even founders of their own tech companies. This cluster keeps current on the latest political or sports news stories, and their top media outlets include CNBC, NBC News, and ABC News. When sharing articles on social media, they generally pull them from sources like ESPN.com and the Guardian.  The Political News Junkies cluster (19%) use Twitter to share their personal opinions on new tech, software and crypto coins – and they enjoy tweeting out their daily Wordle results. They commonly mention political operative Jon Cooper and former NBA player Rex Chapman or tag them in their tweets. They regularly listen to the National Public Radio and ""Daily Show"" podcasts, and they enjoy watching Ted Talks.  Some of their top brands include Tesla, Microsoft and Amazon. Venture capitalists and tech founders, including Semil Shah of Haystack, Michael Seibel of YCombinator and Stewart Butterfield of Slack, influence this cluster heavily, as do lesser-known figures such as Josh Elman, a venture partner at Greylock and John Collison, the co-founder of Stripe.  This community bonds over its passion for tech start-ups and their founders, venture capitalists, and U.S. political news. It also has a unique affinity for the venture capital firm Social Capital.  A sizable group is interested in right-wing media  The majority of the Fox News & MAGA cluster (7% of the analyzed group) is age 39, making them the ""oldest"" cluster of the full crypto audience. They largely reside in Texas, Pennsylvania and Michigan.  See also: 'Jack Dorsey's First Tweet' NFT Went on Sale for $48M  This cluster uses Twitter to express its dislike toward U.S. President Joe Biden, and it regularly tags public figures like Mike Cernovich and conservative radio talk show host Jesse Kelly. Their political information is significantly more likely to come from Sean Hannity, The Post Millennial, The Gateway Pundit, The National Pulse, PragerU, The Conservative Brief, social media platform Gettr and conservative comedy site The Babylon Bee. They have a great affinity for Manhattan Republican Chair Andrea Catsimatidis, TurningPoint USA’s Alex Clark, and Breitbart Pentagon correspondent Kristina Wong.  Smith & Wesson (SWBI) firearms and Wendy's are among the MAGA cluster’s top brand interests. Lawyer Ron Coleman and Dr. Robert Epstein are the top two niche influencers for this conservative community. People in the cluster are fans of Fox news host Tucker Carlson and of Ben Shapiro, host of the ""Ben Shapiro Show,"" and have a strong interest in conservative talk shows and podcasts.  The crypto Twitter community is not a monolith.  There is no one single crypto persona, but a series of sub-communities with different interests beyond their initial crypto bond. Some lean more heavily toward tech, others finance, and still others bend toward sports or art. They rely on different media outlets and influencers to source information, and favor different brands.  The concept of a monolithic cryptocurrency fan is outdated. The only way for organizations bent on joining the conversation to remain relevant is to take the time to learn more about these sub-communities, tailor content to them and consider meaningful partnerships.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Leanne Cochrane,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/20/6-things-you-should-know-about-crypto-twitter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8da931058d18552474f633d092f9b4a2b3e4157-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423501,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aGlh,1650463321,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Bid as Real Bond Yield Remains Negative for Main Street,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoinsteady as the U.S. real yield remains negative for Main Street.  Featured Story: Is rising real yield a blessing in disguise?  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Damanick Dantes, markets reporter, CoinDesk  Dr. Ryan Clements, assistant professor, chairman, business law and regulation, University of Calgary Faculty of Law  Steven Walbroehl, co-founder and chief information security officer, Halborn  Michael Safai, managing partner, Dexterity Capital  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Risk assets remained buoyant early Wednesday. In traditional markets, the real or inflation-adjusted yield on the U.S. 10-year bond flipped positive for the first time since early 2020. However, for the general population, facing an above-8% inflation, the real yield remains negative.  The 10-year real yield is considered the risk-free alternative to owning stocks and other risky assets.  ""Real rates are a clear tightening of financial conditions, and risk assets tend to face a higher risk premia in this backdrop,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, tweeted.  Even so, bitcoin and futures tied to the S&P 500 traded higher at press time. Perhaps investors have come to terms with the idea that the era of cheap money is passé or the real yield as represented by the yield on the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities doesn't paint an accurate picture.  The latter could be the case, as TIPS are bonds issued by the U.S. government that offer protection against inflation. So, the yield on TIPS is essentially a market-based measure of returns adjusted for inflation. It's the preferred tool on Wall Street.  On Main Street, inflation, as represented by the consumer price index (CPI), is at a four-decade high of 8.4%. If the nominal 10-year yield is adjusted for the CPI, the real yield comes to at least -5.5%.  In other words, while Wall Street may press the sell button for risk assets, Main Street still has a solid reason to diversify into perceived store-of-value assets like bitcoin and gold. Whether that comes to fruition and powers a fresh crypto bull run remains to be seen.  While speculation is doing the rounds that retail investors are bargain hunting, blockchain data shows otherwise.  ""The amount of BTC added to addresses grouped by size over a 7-day period. According to on-chain data from Coin Metrics, holdings in addresses with 10k-100k have dipped, but they are being mainly picked up by addresses with 1k-10k BTC – not exactly retail size,"" Genesis Global Trading, a CoinDesk sister firm, said in a daily newsletter dated April 19.  Dollar index drops  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, including the euro and the Japanese yen, dropped 0.5%.  The DXY is considered one of the biggest nemesis of bitcoin. The latest weakness, however, isn't necessarily bullish. That's because fears of an early rate hike by the European Central Bank and FX market intervention by the Bank of Japan have put a bid under the euro and the yen, driving the DXY lower.  Policy tightening is bearish for risk assets, in general.

Maybe Not: Bitcoin Gains  FTX Plan Said to Face CFTC Roundtable Next Month  Rising Real Yield a Blessing in Disguise?  By Omkar Godbole  The U.S. 10-year real yield (market-based measure) has risen over 100 basis points in four weeks to turn positive. A similar positive crossover was last observed in early June 2013, following which investors fled emerging markets (EMs), leading to EM currency volatility.  The jury is out on whether history will repeat itself, but if it does, EM investors may park their money into digital assets, especially stablecoins, Turkey's experience suggests.  Turkey has been facing high inflation and currency market volatility since at least 2018. Last year, the lira tanked a staggering 78% against the U.S. dollar and Turks turned to crypto assets.  ""In the face of a quickly devaluing local currency, Turks have increasingly turned to crypto assets. Trading volume on Turkish-lira denominated markets on Binance reached $160B in 2021,"" Coin Metrics' analysts wrote in a report published in January.  ""Dollar-backed stablecoins have been particularly popular with Turks. Over $7B of Binance’s stablecoin BUSD traded against the lira in 2021 while $36B of Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by total supply, traded against the lira last year. The lira’s share of all Tether volume has expanded to surpass the euro, British pound, and other major fiat currencies,"" Coin Metrics' analysts added.

Blockchain games attracted 1.22 million unique active wallets (UAW) in March of this year, with Axie Infinity being responsible for 22,000 of those in spite of the $615 million Ronin Bridge hack.  A rise in popularity of play-to-earn non-fungible token (NFT) games on Ethereum sidechains has been a big contributor to growth, with platforms like Crazy Defense Heroes, Pegaxy, Arc8, and Aavegotchi spurring a 219% increase in Polygon's gaming activity since the start of 2022.  Activity on the likes of BSC and Ronin, on the other hand, has dropped off since the end of last year as users attempt to minimize risk on more volatile chains.  Across the sector, a total of $2.5 billion of funding was raised in Q1 of 2022, up 150% from the year-ago quarter.

Can It Rival OpenSea?,"Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) launched the beta version of its long-awaited non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace on Wednesday, allowing a small group of users from a wait-list of 3 million to use the platform for the first time.  The marketplace, which was first announced last October, will support Ethereum-based NFT trading, with a social-media spin that could distinguish it from competitors.  The platform will allow users to showcase their personal profile and follow accounts whose content will appear in a “For You” feed, which is visually similar to social-media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Users will also be able to “like” and comment on each other's posts, a Coinbase representative told CoinDesk.  “This product is more than just buying and selling, it is about building your community,” Sanchan Saxena, Coinbase's vice president of product, told reporters in a press briefing on Tuesday. “It is about making sure that you can connect and engage with them on the platform. One other thing I mentioned in the beginning was that it’s a very social marketplace.”  Read more: Coinbase Jumps After Sign-Up Numbers for NFT Marketplace Revealed  The marketplace will support “all sorts of self-custody wallets” besides the official Coinbase Wallet, a decision the exchange made to create “an open NFT environment for everyone,” according to the briefing. The platform will also support fiat purchases via credit cards.  The marketplace will start off with zero transaction fees (besides Ethereum gas costs and creator-implemented royalties), but will eventually implement a “low, single-digit fee,” Saxena said.  Coinbase's NFT plans  Coinbase has a plan for what it’s calling “progressive decentralization” within the marketplace, where certain features will begin centralized but eventually move on-chain.  One of these features is user comments, where threads will initially be stored on Coinbase servers but eventually moved to the blockchain.  Another is what the exchange is calling a user’s “follower graph,” which they will be able to take with them from platform to platform.  A new direction for NFTs?  A social media-focused marketplace is novel in the current NFT landscape, but could become the norm as more players enter the industry.

The integration of MakerDAO with StarkNet will significantly lower the cost of DAI transactions and minting compared to the Ethereum mainnet. Other benefits include the ability for users to make faster withdrawals. As for reducing DAI minting time, users can execute transactions on StarkNet within one to two minutes, compared to three to eight hours on the Ethereum mainnet. MakerDAO Engineering Team Working Toward StarkNet Integration As of now, a dedicated MakerDAO engineering team is working on implementing a multiphase roadmap for the StarkNet integration. The first step involves building a simple bridge with a wallet interface. The next phases includes the release of fast withdrawals, slated for Q2 2022, followed by near-instant DAI withdrawals and, ultimately, MakerDAO&apos;s full-scale integration with StarkNet. StarkNet, developed by StarkWare, uses ZK-rollup, a Layer 2 technology that rolls off Ethereum transactions off the main chain to support a larger number of transactions at a lower cost.The post MakerDAO Integrates StarkNet as Part of Multichain Strategy first appeared on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.The post MakerDAO Integrates StarkNet as Part of Multichain Strategy appeared firs...",POSITIVE,DAI,ETH | MKR | TECHNOLOGY | DAI,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/makerdao-integrates-starknet-as-part-of-multichain-strategy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=makerdao-integrates-starknet-as-part-of-multichain-strategy,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

This is how the ROSE price has been moving within the trend growth channel since January 2022. And it doesn&apos;t just move, it bounces off its trend lines. Starting from September 2021, the middle line of the trend channel is working well, from which the ROSE price is constantly jumping. However, after a weak attempt to increase buyers on 14 March, the probability of a breakdown of the middle line of the downward trend channel and the beginning of a total decline in the ROSE market increased. In the weekly timeframe, we see the unwillingness of buyers to continue to grow from the $0.214 range. Low trading volumes without ambitious weekly candles clearly emphasize this. Therefore, the best scenario for buyers at the moment is to continue the consolidation in the range of $0.214-$0.31. Loss of control by buyers over the $0.214 mark will mean the collapse of the cryptocurrency and the probable fall wave by 60%. Therefore, after fixing the ROSE price below $0.214, we do not recommend keeping investments in this cryptocurrency.

42395526,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxbrZ,1650456000,Optimism for US Spot Bitcoin ETF Grows With Approval of Teucrium Futures Fund,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval in early April of a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Teucrium based on different laws has given hope to crypto investors and fund issuers that a spot bitcoin ETF will finally get the green light soon.  Many bulls had given up on the possibility of a spot bitcoin ETF getting approved this year given the SEC’s numerous rejections based on concerns about the lack of investor protections and appropriate market surveillance. Applications from Bitwise, WisdomTree, Fidelity and Ark 21 Shares, among others, have seen nothing but rejections or extensions of their applications.  But Teucrium filed its successful application under the “33 Act” (or the Securities Act of 1933) and the “34 Act” (or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), rather than the “40 Act” (the Investment Company Act of 1940) that the SEC approved all previous bitcoin futures ETFs under.  As CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De pointed out last week, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said last year he felt more comfortable with 40 Act funds because of the investor protections enshrined within the law, as well as the market surveillance tools overseeing the futures market. The bulk of the trading volume is on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a traditional exchange with well-established surveillance tools in place.  Given that the spot bitcoin ETF applications have all been filed under the 33 and 34 Act, however, some see the Teucrium decision opening the way for a spot ETF to win approval.  ‘A really positive step forward’  “The SEC is now not only comfortable with futures-based ETFs regulated under the 40 Act and all the investment protections there, but also futures-based ETFs regulated under the 34 and the 33 Act, the same act that these spot-based ETFs will be regulated under,” said Craig Salm, chief legal officer for Grayscale Investments, which is trying to get its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) converted into a spot bitcoin ETF. Digital Currency Group, Grayscale’s parent company, also owns CoinDesk.  “It’s a really positive step forward on the path of ultimately getting approval for spot-based ETFs,” Salm added.  Dave Abner, who is the head of global business development for crypto exchange Gemini and who previously spent 20 years focused on expanding the ETF industry, also said he was encouraged by the latest development.  “Approving Teucrium is a very clear sign that there’s no slowing this movement. I think one will be approved by the third quarter,” Abner told CoinDesk recently.  With over $25 billion in assets under management, GBTC is the most closely watched spot bitcoin ETF application. Grayscale is awaiting the end of a 240-day comment period issued by the SEC, in which the commission will decide by July 6 if its application will be approved.  For GBTC and its investors, an approval would be welcome news for its discount to net asset value, which sits at around 23%. The discount represents the difference between the price of the underlying bitcoin assets and the value that's implied from the price of the trust's shares. This has widened as the odds of it converting to a spot ETF have declined, while other avenues to gain bitcoin exposure have increased, including equities and spot bitcoin ETFs in Canada.  “We believe this discount should close decisively if/when GBTC converts to an ETF,” Michael Graham, an equity research analyst at Canaccord Genuity, told clients in a recent note.  ‘Crawl, walk, run’  Investment firm Bitwise also has a spot bitcoin ETF application pending review with the SEC, with a final deadline of June 29.  While declining to address the fund’s specific chances of being approved because the review is ongoing, Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, said “we’re making progress.”  “We’re sort of in a crawl, walk, run series,” Hougan said, adding that the Teucrium approval is no guarantee that the industry will see a spot bitcoin ETF approved soon. “But it doesn’t guarantee that we won’t either,” he said.  Others in the investment community see the need for a political shakeup before spot bitcoin ETFs come into play. Under that view, shared by George Sutton, institutional research analyst at Craig-Hallum, a spot bitcoin ETFs will eventually be approved but that may first require a change of administration.  “We believe pro-crypto politicians will appeal to a large number of single-issue, young, tech-centric voters, and that change will come, but it will likely require patience,” Sutton said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/20/optimism-for-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-grows-with-approval-of-teucrium-futures-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d77a9c944959ea8d2712c4dfdc41908482165778-1024x679.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

McLoughlin started her new position earlier this month, her profile shows. For the past two years she has been the financial-services regulator's supervision manager of crypto assets and digital markets. Prior to a one-year break, she had been at the FCA for more than nine years.  The FCA started searching for someone to lead the crypto division in March. It was looking for someone to build a new team and lead regulatory activities regarding crypto firms that may be involved in “scams and frauds,"" the job posting read on LinkedIn at the time. More recently, the regulator said it would be hiring 80 people to crack down on problem firms.  At the beginning of the month, the U.K. announced a series of initiatives toward its goal of making the country a global center for crypto technology and investments, with Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak saying he wanted the country to be a ""a global hub for crypto asset technology."" The government also reported on a consultation on regulating crypto assets such as stablecoins, saying it will work with the FCA, the Bank of England and Payments Systems Regulator.  The FCA became the U.K.'s authority for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism at the beginning of 2020, which meant that crypto companies that were residing and operating in the U.K. needed to register with the FCA. A few that have yet to be granted full authorization are on a temporary registration list that has allowed them to continue operating in the country.  The FCA declined to comment on the appointment.

Banks and financial institutions are still developing and enhancing an ecosystem where everyone can trade locally and internationally. Through this system, freelance workers can work remotely and earn a sustainable income. However, carrying out this process raises a bigger concern about the payment levies applied by financial institutions. The payment fees represent a certain amount of funds users need to pay for undertaking a transaction. Insights from the GoBankingRates Survey suggest that average Americans attract a $7 monthly transaction charge through banks. From the data, it is clear that the payment industry is somewhat strenuous to the transacting parties. Such conditions are pulling freelancers into the blockchain network with a common goal of leveraging cheaper transaction fees. Why Financial Institutions Charge Heavy Fees Hefty processing fees usually arise due to several reasons. Financial institutions have to charge their customers to complete a transaction successfully like any other service. The entire process involves parties such as credit card networks, banks, and payment processors. Credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard may charge freelancers for using their payment solutions.

It all depends on what the situation was before the total calm. The XEM market has been falling relentlessly since March 2021 and has not pleased investors with good rebounds. In fact, as of 21 June 2021, there was only one upward rebound, within which the XEM price corrected the fall wave from March 2021 by less than 23.6%. Such a weak correction clearly indicated the weakness of buyers, which we see happening on the chart. The main buyers support, thanks to which the XEM price has not yet fallen down is the range of $0.09. For almost a year, buyers keep this range. https://www.tradingview.com/x/C2c2lIQ7/ Beginning in January 2022, a narrow consolidation began above the $0.09 range, which is the last chance to change the course of events in the XEM market. On the one hand, the weak rebound of the XEM price in the liquidity range and low trading volumes indicate the unwillingness of buyers to start their trend. However, everything changed after the closing of the weekly candle on 11 April. On the weekly chart, we see that after several attempts by buyers to take control of the local mark of $0.125, the XEM price began to fall again.

The event is characterized by a decrease in the purchasing power of currencies. As such, inflation creates a significant difference in the value an individual spends today and in the future. As of February 2022, the USA recorded a 7.9% increase in its inflation index. In order to prevent this occurrence, governments need to search for other alternatives that can combat their devaluing currency. The common strategy that countries apply is hedging the fiat currencies against hard assets such as gold. By definition, hard assets are financial instruments that can maintain their value over time. Bitcoin, being a hard asset, could gradually become an appropriate hedge against inflation. This article will provide an insight into how Bitcoin can aid in reducing a nation&apos;s inflation level. 5 Ways Bitcoin Can Curb Inflation Bitcoin is currently the leading digital asset with a market cap exceeding $700B. Its ability to function in a decentralized peer-to-peer network is making BTC a favorable financial instrument. Asides from that, the digital asset offers several advantages such as security and transparency, which contribute to its popularity.

42395534,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxbzR,1650450600,Ethereum DeFi Staple MakerDAO Adds StarkNet Bridge in First Step Toward Multi-Chain,"Pioneering cryptocurrency lending and stablecoin platform MakerDAO is addressing the cost and congestion of its native Ethereum environment by bridging to a cheaper, faster overlay network in the form of StarkNet, the zero-knowledge (ZK) side chain built by StarkWare.  Ethereum’s pricey gas fees have driven more activity and users to other blockchains. Alongside its growth on Ethereum, MakerDAO plans to increase its product offerings and gradually move toward a multi-chain future by bridging to other platforms.  Rebuilding Maker on StarkNet’s system of ZK-rollups (a way of unburdening costly transaction settlement procedures from the main Ethereum chain using cryptographic proofs) will take place in four phases, starting with a simple bridge between the main blockchain and StarkNet’s layer 2 (L2), which will go live on April 28.  The second phase is the fast withdrawal which will allow users to withdraw from L2 to level 1 by leveraging Maker’s “Wormhole” design. Such transactions will happen “in a couple of minutes and even shorter in the future,” said Louis Baudoin, an engineer on the MakerDAO/StarkNet project.  The third phase is dubbed “teleportation,” which means being able to bridge between layer 2s – say you wanted to transfer 1,000 dai from StarkNet to Arbitrum, for example. The fourth phase will involve rebuilding multi-collateral dai (MCD) on StarkNet.  “With our Wormhole design, we are leveraging the fact that we have battle-tested oracles and we can mint dai as a DAO,” Baudoin said in an interview with CoinDesk. “That allows you to teleport dai from one layer to the other in minutes, something which would usually take much longer.”  Multi-chain Maker  In terms of timelines, the third phase of integration will be completed by the end of July, Baudoin said, and the fourth and final phase will be done by the end of this year or the first quarter of next year at the latest.  Blockchain bridging protocols have had their fair share of security challenges in the fast moving world of decentralized finance (DeFi).  “We have learned from the mistakes of the Solana Wormhole, and we learned from the hack of Poly,” Baudoin said. “Obviously, there’s been a lot of testing done. It’s sensible to increase the bridge limit slowly so that the amount of money at risk is manageable, and also to have some emergency mechanisms in place internally to mitigate if there was a hack.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MKR | SOL | ARB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/20/ethereum-defi-staple-makerdao-adds-starknet-bridge-in-first-step-toward-multi-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b525553460e801a6e3391f65b5c336ad8cb8afd2-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Digital assets undergo trading on the platforms to facilitate value exchange between users on different networks. Value exchange across the platforms depends on unique protocols that determine the compatibility of the assets. Despite the progress over the years, the DeFi projects are under continuous hacking attacks that define the present risk of such entities. The theft of up to $625 million worth of crypto assets from the Ronin Network underlines the consequences of the existing risks. Some elements make the projects susceptible to attacks. Smart Contract Bugs Smart contracts facilitate trading activities where the execution of trade terms occurs to the satisfaction of terms by both parties. The contracts facilitate the transfer of value in digital assets across user wallets to prevent fraud against creators. However, hackers exploit bugs in the exchange protocols to manipulate and jeopardize the transactions. Damaged exchange protocols give the hacker freedom to change the value of the digital assets. The hacker then spends a few tokens buying the creator&apos;s assets at a low value causing losses to targeted users.

42395536,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxc2O,1650447431,Bitcoin's 30-Day Volatility Slips to 17-Month Low,"There is a calm in the bitcoin (BTC) market, the likes of which we last saw before the beginning of the late 2020 bull run.  The leading cryptocurrency's 30-day volatility, which measures the standard deviation of daily returns over four weeks, has declined to 2.2%, the lowest since November 5, 2020, according to data provided by Arcane Research.  The gauge peaked above 6% in June 2021 and has been on a declining trend ever since, barring the temporary spike to 4.5% around the March Federal Reserve meeting.  The steady decline could be attributed to several factors, including dominant crypto exchanges Binance and FTX's decision to cut down leverage, declining interest in crypto-margined futures and, more recently, reduced speculative interest, as evidenced by the decline in trading volumes.  Data tracked by Kaiko Research shows that bitcoin and ether's (ETH) weekly trading volumes have slipped to the lowest levels since the summer of 2021.  ""Both bitcoin and [ether] trade volumes have declined significantly since December, as investors de-risked their portfolios amid growing macro uncertainty,"" Kaiko Research's weekly newsletter published on Monday said. ""The trend accelerated in early April with BTC and ETH weekly trade volume down by over 30% to $7 billion and $5 billion, respectively, relative to the end of March.""  While bitcoin is down 10% on a year-to-date basis, ether has lost about 15%, per charting platform TradingView.  The invisible force  There are technical factors at play, too, helping bring tranquility to the bitcoin market.  Market makers, who buy the out-of-the-money call and put options auctioned by decentralized option vaults (DOV) every Friday, hedge their bullish/bearish exposure through opposite positions in the futures and perpetual futures market, according to Two Prime, a digital-asset fund manager. In the process these market makers create a boundary for prices within each expiration cycle.  Market makers are individuals or entities with a contractual obligation to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on an exchange. They make sure there is enough depth in the order book by offering to buy or sell an asset, futures contract or a call or put option at any given point in time. These entities always take the opposite side of investors' trades and maintain a market-neutral book by buying and selling the underlying asset as the price swings.  The DOVs have grown exponentially since the second half of 2021 and now add over $100 million of notional exposure to the market each week. In other words, the sensitivity of market makers' books to directional moves is increasing. As such, their hedging activity could be helping arrest wild price swings in the market.  ""Holding larger open interest requires larger hedging activity. This acts as a natural price floor or ceiling for spot prices at short strikes [levels at which DOVs sold options],"" Two Prime said in a DOV explainer note published on April 8. ""By holding these options to expiration, as DOVs do, the gamma of the underlying option increases, thus requiring more delta hedging from market-makers, further intensifying this price floor and ceiling dynamic.""  Calm before the storm?  A prolonged period of low price turbulence often ends with violent price action on either side.  For instance, the previous low volatility regime lasted for over two months, from late September to early November, with the cryptocurrency trading mainly in the range of $10,000 to $13,000. The breakout happened on Nov. 5, with prices rallying well above the June 2019 high of $13,800.  Whether history will repeat itself is anybody's guess. That said, there are signs a big move could happen soon.  ""The seven-day volatility has climbed above the 30-day volatility, which could suggest that the market is waking up,"" Arcane Research's weekly newsletter published on Tuesday said.

To show how much crypto assets have permeated American society, a White House fact sheet states that more than 40 million Americans, which is 16% of the population, use cryptocurrencies to invest, trade, or make payments. However, there has been a lot of concern about how cryptocurrencies can be used to hide money, run illegal businesses, and abet corruption. Cryptocurrency has become even more critical because Russia tried to use it to get around sanctions from the United States and the European Union (EU) because it invaded Ukraine. Russia&apos;s actions have made the need to regulate the crypto space even more significant. Heading Towards Cryptocurrency Adoption? Regulators and oversight bodies such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have spent the last few years bootstrapping existing laws to regulate the nascent crypto market. Unfortunately, the half measures have proven woefully inadequate in policing the rapidly growing industry. On March 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that was the most comprehensive way the U.S. government had ever tried to regulate crypto.

The IMF openly addressed the potential use of crypto in Russia&apos;s sanctions evasion and its potential to jeopardize the stability of existing financial institutions through the shifting banking landscape in its Global Financial Stability Report released on Tuesday. According to the IMF, the global financial system has seen an increase in &apos;crypto&apos; as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the fact that this is mostly attributable to normal commercial activity, the IMF has warned that it might be exploited to avoid identity checks in financial flows, thus allowing people to deal anonymously abroad. Bad actors can dodge penalties by using non-compliant exchanges, mixers, and other methods, according to the IMF, while US and UK regulators have pushed crypto businesses to be more vigilant. They might also use energy to mine cryptocurrency and enhance their funds. The IMF suggested that nations focus on implementing the Financial Action Task Force standards, which included a travel rule for crypto assets that require exchanges to communicate information, to avoid these crypto-specific risks.

Along with brand advisor Randi Zuckerberg, the business hopes that its new endeavor, which just pledged $1 million to support women in crypto, will empower crypto for all. While NFT marketplaces are becoming increasingly competitive, with big fish OpenSea being challenged by rivals such as Nifty Gateway and Rarible, Okcoin stands out for its zero-fee policy. &apos;We&apos;re introducing a free market for NFTs, where supply and demand will decide prices and profits more than anywhere else,&apos; CEO Hong Fang stated. OpenSea, on the other hand, charges a 2.5 percent transaction fee on every trade, while competitor SuperRare charges a 3 percent cut. However, royalties, which many prominent markets cap between 0-10 percent, are where NFT authors may really cash in—or lose out—on the proceeds of their work. Many NFT collections, including most blue-chip projects, have substantially traded up in secondhand auctions, especially considering the speculative character of the new sector.
