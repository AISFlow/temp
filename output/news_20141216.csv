42398070,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG45S,1418772031,Coinkite Removes Limits on Multisig Bitcoin Wallets in Service Fee Shakeup,"Coinkite is now offering its starter membership free of charge, a move that finds the bitcoin technology startup removing the 1% withdrawal fee formerly associated with the service.  The offer  makes a number of Coinkite services available up to certain limits. With a starter account, users can create multi-signature wallets, watch-only accounts and send bitcoin by SMS, email and voucher, among other services.  The normally PR-shy Coinkite spoke out during what CEO Rodolfo Novak categorized as a trying time for bitcoin users, many of whom have reported losing funds due to problems with hosted wallet services and open-source alternatives.  As such, Novak suggested that the most appealing aspect of the news for consumers may be the ability to fund multisig wallets without limitation.  Novak told CoinDesk:  ""The amount of people who lost money is unacceptable. This is very bad for bitcoin. So, we decided to make the account available for free. Because we don't have control of the keys for multisig, we let users deposit any amount at no charge.""  The move follows Conkite's release of its multisig accounts in November, which allow for the use of up to 15 signatures. Users can now keep an unlimited amount of bitcoin in their multisig wallets, though hot wallets are limited to 1 BTC (roughly $329 at press time).  Coinkite announced no changes to the pricing for both its personal and professional accounts. The products allow for increased usage of Coinkite's services, including its debit cards and advanced liquidity features, for $10.09 and $30.27 a month, respectively.  Appealing to developers  Though Novak stressed that Coinkite's services are available to any end user, be it an enterprise business, small merchant or consumer, he emphasized that the company is taking steps to better appeal to bitcoin's development community.  ""We have more than 1,000 developers that are using our API, and a lot of them are working at exchanges,"" Novak said, citing derivatives platform BitMEX as one such client.  Key to this strategy will be its partnerships with startup incubator Boost VC and BitAngels, through which Coinkite will offer an upgraded version of its API to startups for free for one year.  Novak indicated that the goal of the program is to get the startups of the future acclimatized to, and building on, its technology.  Additional business clients on the Coinkite platform including bitcoin e-commerce startup Purse.io and the recently launched Ledger USB bitcoin wallet.  Focus on foundational tech  Novak stressed that while his company has seen growth in 2014, Coinkite still considers the bitcoin ecosystem to be in its early days. This, he said, has allowed the company to be ""unfocused"" in how it looks at developments in the space.  Novak suggested that this experimentation, however, has allowed it to develop an expertise in the technology, even as it works on services as diverse as bitcoin debit cards and point-of-sale (POS) hardware systems.  ""Companies still have 'coin' in the name, like when companies used to have 'net' in the name. We want to build a lot of stuff, a lot of features and see which of these features get more adoption and more use,"" he said.  For now, he said, Coinkite aims to focus solely on cryptography, refraining from interacting with fiat currency and encouraging unlimited experimentation on its service. In particular, Novak cited one unnamed Asia-based company, as evidence of how far Coinkite has gone to support its ideals.  ""They're building a competitor to us, using us,"" he said. ""We welcome that.""

42398065,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG3yZ,1418752431,Student Aims to Boost Free Speech with Bitcoin Messaging App,"A computer science student in the Netherlands has developed a cheap and censorship-resistant messaging service built on top of the bitcoin blockchain.  The new tool was developed by Krzysztof Okupski as a graduation project while at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Notably, the 25-year-old is also the author of the Bitcoin Developer Reference.  Using a combination of techniques with the explicit goal of being as cost-efficient as possible, Okupski has possibly developed the cheapest method for broadcasting messages over the bitcoin blockchain to date.  “I was on the lookout for a topic related to bitcoin, when my graduation supervisor, Dr Boris Škorić, came up with the idea to use the blockchain for evading censorship,” Okupski explained. “Due to the humanitarian nature of the project, I immediately agreed that it was a good idea and went to work.”  Okupski hopes that his software might one day help dissidents worldwide to circumvent restrictions on freedom of speech.  He said:  ""Binding a payments network like bitcoin together with an anti-censorship system forces any repressive government to either accept or abandon both. Abandoning it might not be very smart, however, since bitcoin is an active and growing currency that an economy could benefit from.”  Tuning in  The basic idea behind the software is straightforward. The service connects to a user's local Bitcoin Core wallet, and recirculates funds within it. To transmit messages, the software embeds data in the fundamental building blocks of each transaction, such as signatures, public keys and even transacted amounts.  Since these transactions transfer funds between addresses that are always owned by the user, they remain in his possession. As such, no significant amount of bitcoin is lost, although a broadcaster does need to pay mining fees in the process.  In order to read the message, a user needs the same client, along with a so called 'identifier' provided by the author of the text. This determines what parts of the blockchain should be read, and is therefore somewhat comparable to tuning an antenna to the correct frequency.  Affordable solution  While Okupski's design is not the first solution for transmitting messages over the bitcoin network, he believes it's a far cheaper and more efficient option than any existing alternative out there.  “Before I started to write the software, I conducted an extensive analysis on what freedoms the bitcoin protocol has that would allow for the inclusion of arbitrary information in transactions,” he explained, adding:  “In the course of about nine months, I have identified all elements that can embed data, and have constructed a model, which I then optimized with respect to the cost rate in satoshi per embedded byte. Additionally, I've included a simple text compression algorithm, which reduces the total size of all data.”  Results from Okupski's software show that – in the best case – the cost rate lies at approximately 16 satoshis per embedded byte, or about 60,000 satoshis for an article of this size. That's less than a quarter of a dollar at current exchange rates.  Another interesting attribute of the project is the ability to chain messages together, which might be a useful option for creating news services that run on top of the blockchain.  Whenever a new message is published, Okupski said, it can be chained to the previous one. This allows any user in possession of the required identifier to read all future messages without the need to obtain any additional information. ""Just type in the address and check if any new messages have been posted,” he added.  Work still to do  A possible downside of Okupski's software, however, is the intensive use of the bitcoin blockchain for purposes other than transferring funds.  Not only does this cause 'blockchain bloat', but, if successful, might also drive its own cost of use up, since competing transactions could increase the required mining fees.  “If my messaging system really catches on and becomes very popular this might indeed be an issue,” Okupski said. “But as long as it's merely used by a handful of news services, it's negligible. Besides, blockchain bloat is a problem with or without this software.”  Furthermore, Okupski emphasised that it would in practice be difficult to actually use his system right now, since the software is only at the proof of concept stage.  ""Several parts of it would need to be improved before it can be deployed in a practical sense,"" he said. ""For instance, it would definitely need to be made quite a bit more user friendly and, more importantly, there needs to be some kind of evaluation to determine what kind of security guarantees it provides.”  For instance, because of the highly irregular nature of transactions used by the messaging system, it should be noted that broadcasts are not necessarily untraceable. Users who know what to look for should be able to decipher messages from the blockchain even without the identifier.  Okupski added:  “And although broadcasters cannot be censored, they should not expect to be anonymous. Readers, however, cannot be distinguished from ordinary bitcoin users.”  For now, though, Okupski has put his project on hold. “I don't think it would take much work to finish the implementation, but I won't be continuing the project at this time. Although I do hope that with the right support, it might evolve into a full grown project in the near future.”  Other approaches    While Okupski's design is not the first solution for transmitting messages over the bitcoin network, most alternatives create unspendable outputs, meaning transacted bitcoin amounts (although small) are lost forever. They also make limited use of the available transaction types.      One alternative publishing service, CryptoGraffiti.info, lets users write and read arbitrary messages on the blockchain via a web interface. Reddit user Adam Smith also recently released his own blockchain publishing service called Stone.      Other services, such as Proof of Existence, use the same principle to allow creators of original content to timestamp their work to prove authorship. The service stores a cryptographic digest of the digital work, linked to the time at which the document was submitted. Thus, the data can be certified to have existed at that time.      Okupski's full thesis, titled (Ab)using Bitcoin for an Anti-Censorship Tool, can be read on his website, and the code of the proof of concept will soon be released on his Github page.

42398073,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG46R,1418749505,US State Bank Supervisors Issue Model Regulation for Digital Currencies,"The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) has released a draft proposal for regulating digital currency businesses.  The membership group, which represents bank regulators from US state agencies but does not play a direct role in how states craft new financial rules, outlined a number of areas in which it believes companies that work with digital currencies should be supervised, including approaches to consumer protection, licensing and security.  Overall, the framework echoes elements of the New York State Department of Financial Services’ (NYDFS) BitLicense proposal. The draft framework targets those who exchange digital currencies or facilitate such activities, and explicitly identifies itself as “technology neutral”.  The CSBS suggests licensing and supervision requirements should apply to businesses that exchange virtual currency for fiat currency and virtual currency for other types of virtual currency; transmit virtual currencies; and facilitate the third-party exchange, storage or transmission of virtual currencies. The latter category is defined to include wallets, vaults, kiosks, merchant-acquirers and payment processors.  The draft continues:  “For financial services, these activities-based regulations already exist in most state laws, generally covering the transmitting, exchanging, and/or holding of value on behalf of another. Such financial transactions or services place the activity provider in a position of trust. This position of trust is the basis for most financial services laws and regulations, and should be applied regardless of the medium of value.”  The CSBS has held several meetings in the past year, which garnered participation from both regulators and members of the cryptocurrency industry. During those hearings, both the promise and challenges of the technology underlying bitcoin were explored, eliciting both positive and negative reactions from the CSBS representatives leading the talks.  In addition, the CSBS announced that a period of public comment on the guidance has begun that will last until 15th February 2015. Members of the public can submit their comments via electronic or paper means, according to the CSBS announcement.  Echoing the BitLicense framework  The draft framework includes eight areas in which the CSBS is pushing for digital currency regulation, which covers record keeping, cybersecurity protocols and transaction data standards.  Like the NYDFS, the CSBS wants digital currency businesses to gather information on those involved in transactions that they are party to, such as names and IP addresses. The framework calls for those firms to adhere to existing AML/KYC regulations and institute consumer protection measures including disclosure agreements, insurance mandates and secure data storage mechanisms.  The CSBS is also advocating for rules that will allow state regulators to share information and coordinate on investigations that involve digital currency businesses.  “A critical piece of such a system is the ability of states to share licensing and enforcement data in real time,” the group wrote.  Outlines possible state approaches  The document released by the CSBS proposes guidance for how states might look at regulating digital currency regulations.  Currently, only a few states have taken concrete steps toward doing so, though other states have begun proceedings that will likely lead to the creation of BitLicense-like systems or other state-based approaches.  Of note is that the CSBS examines how potential digital currency frameworks might interact with existing money transmission laws. As money activities are regulated on the state level and can differ depending on the jurisdiction, the CSBS urges those regulators to take care in defining which activities would render a company a money services business.  The framework explains:  “States can apply activities-based regulations to virtual currency service providers through various means, including with laws and/or regulations written explicitly for virtual currency activities, or by interpreting or amending existing laws and regulations – for example, banking or other financial services laws – to include virtual currency in existing licensing schemes.”  The CSBS concluded in its policy statement that consistency in regulatory language can help those who oversee the emerging digital currency industry regulate activities appropriately, and pledged its support for “consistent and uniform regulation”.

Biggar said:  ""We are always looking for ways to make it easier for consumers to engage with our brands and this pilot program will give bitcoin users a seamless and simple way to purchase subscriptions.""  Biggar further hinted that Time would potentially expand its acceptance to more properties ""in the coming months"".  In turn, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong remarked that the partnership will allow it to showcase how bitcoin can become a viable revenue stream as the publishing industry goes digital.  The company has emphasized this value proposition in recent weeks, introducing a one-click tipping tool in November that it framed as a revenue solution for blogs and content creators.  The announcement notably follows that of fellow US-based publishing company, The Chicago Sun-Times, which earlier this year partnered with microtransactions startup BitWall to accept bitcoin for its subscription services.

42398082,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG3xa,1418738135,Australian Regulator: Bitcoin is Not a Financial Product,"Digital currencies are not a financial product and operators do not need licenses to trade or hold them, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has said.  Additionally, an operator does not require a license to provide advice to others in relation to digital currencies, or to arrange for others to buy and sell them.  ASIC's comments are contained within a 32-page submission (download the pdf here) to the ongoing Australian Senate inquiry into digital currency.  Like the Australian Tax Office's ruling in August, ASIC's submission is regarded as temporary until such time as the federal government is able to clarify the issue with formal legislation.  The commission  is Australia's principle corporate regulator, tasked with protecting the interests of investors and financial consumers.  License may still be required  While, on the surface, this news might be cause of excitement to some in the bitcoin space, in reality the exact nature of a digital currency's business will determine whether licences are required.  Businesses connecting digital currencies to the fiat world, or other legally defined financial products, will still require market or financial services licences.  The submission itself says: ""If there is a delay between the entry of the agreement to sell and the delivery of the digital currency, the contract may be a derivative and the financial services and financial markets regimes would apply in the normal way"".  Additionally, under a section titled 'Facilities that May Be Financial Products', the paper refers to payment processors exchanging digital currencies for 'monetary value'. Facilitation of such 'non-cash' payments may still require a financial services license.  Examples cited  ASIC singles out two prominent Australian bitcoin companies – CoinJar and Living Room of Satoshi – as examples of such services.  In particular, it referred to CoinJar's 'Swipe' debit card system, with which customers can fund a dollar account directly from their bitcoin balance, using CoinJar's exchange, and then use the card like a traditional debit card.  Living Room of Satoshi, which processes bill payments via Australia's national electronic BPAY network, reopened just this week after shutting down in October due to tax issues.  Founder Daniel Alexiuc told CoinDesk his company has been engaging with ASIC's legal team, and that he was please it could be involved in shaping regulation for the future of bitcoin in Australia.  ""At the moment, in our specific circumstances, we have determined that we do not require an AFS licence. But I foresee that it may be required in the near future for LRoS.""  In a market dominated by incumbent players, Alexiuc added, he is hopeful regulators will avoid making licensing rules so onerous they prevent startups and new players from entering the space.  Consumer assumptions  ASIC said it had also received an application for a financial services license from a bitcoin trading platform for its bitcoin escrow service (though not the exchange itself).  After deliberating, the regulator said the bitcoin escrow service may be technically a financial product, but eventually decided that it was not, and would not be subject to the financial services regulatory regime.  The commission further explained that this was because the service is a minor part of a wider unregulated business, and that requiring a license may lead consumers to assume the entire business was ASIC regulated.  The ASIC submission is one of 44 to date from various stakeholders in Australian business and economy.  As well as individuals and bitcoin companies, this list has included industry groups like the Australian Payments Clearing Association (APCA) and regulatory/enforcement bodies like Australian Federal Police, the Australian Taxation Office and the department of the Attorney-General.

Speaking to CoinDesk, Dai said ""payments will be a priority"" for the company.  Industry experience  Dai's stint as chief analyst at Chinese household name Alipay lasted from 2007 to 2011. During his time at the company, Dai said, he helped build the company’s online credit-scoring system, with which the service determines the sizes of loans applicants may receive.  After leaving Alipay in 2011, he joined and became the vice president of the online financing arm of Suning, one of the largest Chinese electronic appliance retail chains.  When asked what has prevented major Chinese retailers like Suning from accepting bitcoin payments, Dai replied that it has ""more to do with awareness than regulations"".  Dai denied he was ""exceptional"" in leaving the more traditional online financing sector to join a bitcoin company, saying:  ""Almost everyone I know in the Internet industry knows about bitcoin. They either recognize its value, or are still on the fence and waiting.""  Optimistic as to the digital currency’s future, he said that, as the new technology become more accepted, more talent would be attracted to enter the space.  Catering to demand  Launched on 18th November, BTC China's online payment arm JustPay is one of a cluster of Chinese bitcoin services launched within months of each other to cater to the fast-growing demand for cross-border money transfers.  A BTC China representative told CoinDesk that JustPay has successfully signed up 14 merchants since its launch, and has a total transaction volume of 1.24m CNY ($200,000).  One of those merchants, Jingubang (JGB), is an e-commerce website selling overseas merchandise. The website lists JustPay as one of the three payment options alongside from Alipay and Tenpay – both products of two of the largest Chinese Internet companies.
