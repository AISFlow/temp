He's also an angel investor, traded derivatives during the 2008 world financial crisis and, since 2013, has been fascinated and excited about cryptocurrency.  In this article, Woo presents his simulations of cryptocurrency index funds, which suggest that bitcoin is hard to beat.  This year, the idea of managed portfolios and index fund portfolios has been on the rise, you can bet on many hitting the market in 2017. It’s a popular idea borrowed from Wall Street. For stocks 99% of index funds (namely funds that buy the entire market passively), outperform actively managed funds.  Sounds like a great idea for crypto-land right?  I’ve been running simulations in the alt-coin markets to see if this is true. If so it would be prudent to diversify across many altcoins as a higher performance investment over bitcoin.  The results are surprising.  The simulations  This simulation spans 16th October 2013 through to today – exactly three years. Earlier than this, and you’ll find the altcoin market was very undeveloped.  My three-year span happens to nicely capture the last bubble of 2013, the long bear market of 2014/15 and its subsequent recovery until today. This is great, as it allows us to observe how indexes and bitcoin perform relative to each other in each scenario.  For all of my indexed portfolio simulations below, I have rebalance them every 30 days to account for newcomers into the list and old dropouts leaving.  Bitcoin vs the top-10 ranked altcoins proportioned by marketcap  Bitcoin outperformed the altcoin portfolio by 3.8x. Surprisingly during the 2013 bubble, alts performed even higher, but lost more ground in the bear market thereafter.  This pattern of alts having an edge in bull markets happened twice. I make out the bottom of the market was mid-May 2015. Since that time, alts recovered with a 3.8x rally (from 0.308x to 1.17x), while bitcoin recovered with a 2.7x rally (from 1.68x to 4.56x).  For those interested, here are the coins held each 30-day cycle denoting the top 10 altcoins over the three years.  For those who want to see more coins in the portfolio, here’s the same simulation run across the top 20 altcoins. The results are almost identical. (At this point I’ve had people say to me the numbers are wrong. Trust me, these numbers are correct).  Bitcoin vs the 11th-20th ranked altcoins by proportioned marketcap  To shake things up, here’s a portfolio with 10 'small cap' alts ranked 11th through to 20th making up the index. The idea behind this one is to capture the coins that have more potential for growth and exiting once they graduate to the big leagues (or fade into oblivion).  These results were one of the more promising index allocations, the portfolio dropped less during the bear market and had impressive gains during bull markets, however bitcoin still won out with a 4.6x return vs 3.6x for the index, which also exhibited more volatility.  Bitcoin vs the top-20 ranked altcoins by capped marketcap proportion  Off the back of Iconomi’s ICO raising $10.6m USD, I wanted to simulate an index similar to their CTF offering. Iconomi use a 25% cap and a further mechanism of categories to distribute the allocations.  Here’s an index with a maximum allocation of 25% for any altcoin in the basket. It will differ slightly from Iconomi’s fund, but likely their results will be a halfway point between these results and the last index simulation which uses equal allocation.  Ahem. Our first loss maker of 0.82x vs bitcoin’s 4.6x.  I may run their exact allocation through a simulation if I get enough requests (try me on Twitter).  Part of my beef with their investor whitepaper is they picked a bull market (since Jan 2016) to demonstrate their glam results, but here’s a simulation run through a bear market. It seriously underperforms against the vanilla standard indexes above, and significantly underperforms against bitcoin. Nevertheless, clients will unlikely notice this until our next bear market, which is a while away.  Bitcoin vs the top-20 ranked altcoins allocated by equal proportion  Going with the theme of more distributed allocation, this index proportions holdings equally at the start of each 30-day cycle. This one was a disaster with an abysmal 0.64x return (a significant loss).  Conclusions  Bitcoin is really hard to beat with index funds, maybe unbeatable with the present state of altcoins we have. Not only do they underperform bitcoin by a significant amount, but as a combined basket their day-to-day volatility is higher.  I ask myself why we don’t parallel the stock market world, where indexes are very successful and my conclusion is that we are in a world of unvetted shitcoins.  When a company goes IPO, it needs to mature for many years and must qualify under stringent Securities and Exchange Commssion (SEC) criteria. Not so in altcoin land. They are like early stage startups that IPO immediately, but any angel investor will tell you they see a 99% failure rate of early stage startups.  There will be a bunch of altcoin funds hitting the crypto investment world in this coming year. Having seen the data, I would take the index-based approaches to fund investment with a decent pinch of salt.

42399427,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9Oa,1477138616,Physicians Say Blockchain Healthcare Ideas in Need of Exam,"While there’s a lot of hype over blockchain in healthcare, some who work in the industry say that the product pitches so far are little more than pipe dreams.  The comments come as blockchain technology has become increasingly touted as a solution that could streamline everything from electronic health record (EHR) management to medical insurance, reducing complexity in a system that remains frustrating for consumers and participants alike.  But new interviews suggest that, while well-meaning, entrepreneurs exploring these applications aren’t quite showcasing why the technology is a match for industry problems.  “It’s just not possible for the healthcare industry to be real time as it relates to claims,” said Dr Alyssa Hoverson Schott, a physician at Sanford Health who started this conversation at the Distributed Health conference earlier this month.  Hoverson Schott sees about 39 patients per day, inputting medical visit and procedural codes for each patient in between visits.  “There’s often not time right then to input the codes,” she said.  These codes are then sent to insurance providers who review the claim and negotiate down the bill. This negotiation process, which goes back and forth between the hospital and the insurance provider, can go on for 90 days.  The real problem? Those offering tech solutions to the industry don’t actually understand the day-to-day flow of providing healthcare, Hoverson Schott argued.  She told CoinDesk:  “A lot of the time, these entrepreneurs talk about things that aren’t actually doable. I don’t think they understand how busy our day is and how the system underneath actually works.”  That’s not to say she doesn’t believe blockchain can solve problems in healthcare, rather she questions whether startups can succeed without collaborating with the traditional industry. Her interest is also personal, as her husband, a senior business analyst at Experian, has developed an interest in the technology.  Despite the concerns of industry incumbents, however, her story shows how blockchain has become more than a business solution, but a social phenomenon that continues to spread.  Healthcare concerns  This expansion has led to interest from other healthcare veterans like Dr Jonathan Holt, a once practicing physician that now focuses on his two startups: SeqTech Diagnostics (which carries out genetic testing on food) and TranSendX, a blockchain for healthcare interoperability aimed to bring patients more control of their medical records.  Yet, Holt sees an opportunity to parlay his expertise into a new venture. He argued that healthcare providers, like financial institutions, have incentives for keeping patient information private and in their control.  And Holt isn’t alone in his belief that healthcare providers will continue to be cautious about new systems for housing their data, as they can incur huge fines for exposing patient health records – fines big enough to bankrupt some healthcare institutions.  During the conference, tech entrepreneurs were met with this kind of skepticism when presenting such ideas.  Yet another reason healthcare providers are hesitant about blockchain technology is because they’ve put a significant amount of time and money into their existing architecture. Just as the financial services industry likely won’t rip and strip away legacy systems completely, healthcare providers would also rather see updates instead of overhauls.  Adding to this, most hospitals are now transitioning to electronic health record (EHR) software.  As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the government mandated that healthcare providers show “meaningful use” of EHR by the beginning of 2014.  “Other innovation screeches to a halt,” said Holt about the transition from paper to digital, adding:  “Blockchain as a bleeding-edge technology that’s only three years old is going to take some time to implement.”  Provenance’s potential  Instead of focusing on EHRs and insurance claims, Michael Gucci, a practicing emergency room physician and founder of Bitcoin Fortress Ventures, thinks blockchain entrepreneurs would have a better chance disrupting medication provenance first.  While counterfeit medication isn’t as much of a problem in the US, in developing countries it’s a huge dilemma, he said. The issue costs the industry hundreds of billions of dollars per year and results in thousands of deaths annually, according to a 2014 American Health and Drug Benefits report.  And there are already companies working towards this practical solution, he said, pointing to Block Verify out of the UK. The company has been working on several provenance pilots that allow medical professionals and consumers to scan a QR-code on a bottle of pills to ping the blockchain to verify the integrity.  In terms of streamlining the insurance claims process and the transfer of EHRs between providers, that’s probably 10 to 15 years off, Gucci said.  “Hospitals aren’t going to implement any huge changes right away. It’s going to happen in small steps,” he said.  Baby steps  This aligns with Holt’s thoughts that blockchain entrepreneurs should develop systems of data integrity and provenance, but for simpler problems.  One example is Saavha, a blockchain startup verifying the integrity of healthcare scheduling. This is particularly interesting in light of the Veterans’ Affairs (VA) scandal of 2014 and the VA’s continuing problems with falsified waiting lists.  It’s also a problem one US Congressman’s proposal argues distributed ledger technology could solve.  The VA even has a more stringent regulatory burden than most other hospitals, said Holt. Much of its data has to be encrypted on a hard drive under lock and key in a cage with 24/7 video surveillance, he said. And yet, the information was still manipulated.  “The attention is on these big issues because everyone loves the sexiness of solving a big problem,” said Mathew Rose, a practicing junior doctor in Ireland and co-founder at Saavha. “But if you think throughout history, anything that was an immense problem, it was easier to solve the little problems inside that big problem.”  Look at the development of medicine, for example. Part of the reason medical science has advanced so far is because every medical researcher works on a part of the problem, Rose said. In cancer research, some doctors focus on practices for removing tumors, while others focus on inhibiting blood supply, while still others investigate what role proteins play.  In Saavha’s implementation, a hash of the appointment data is stored on the blockchain so it can be proven that the data wasn’t changed retrospectively. The problem also circumvents one of the core criticisms about blockchains – that they are inherently slow databases that aren’t good at storing of large amounts of data,.  By focusing on data integrity, EHRs can store a hash on a blockchain to prove the validity of information stored elsewhere, likely in centralized repositories that exist today.  Sweet spot  There is, however, an argument to be made that these centralized databases could benefit from other less immediately viable applications of blockchain.  Adrian Gropper, CTO at the non-profit group Patient Privacy Rights, thinks these centralized stores of data need to be scaled down immensely. Today, there are centralized healthcare databases containing between 5 million and 10 million patients, he said.  “We’ve created a 10 million patient honeypot [for fraudsters] where something on the order of 50,000 people on staff at these hospitals have access to those records. And these systems are totally opaque to the user,” Gropper said.  This already is a big problem for the industry. Last year, fraudsters pulled off the largest healthcare hack in history on Anthem, exposing more than 78 million customers. And in March, MedStar Systems, a clinical information system of 10 hospitals was hacked and had to take its system offline.  This is a situation that’s likely to continue, since some estimates show healthcare data is almost 100 times more valuable than stolen credit card information.  “The only hope for actually managing this kind of personal-level information is to distribute it back out to a diverse group of holders, and blockchain is going to play a central role in this,” said Gropper, who is building a patient-centered health record platform on blockchain technology called HIE of One.  In his mind, the blockchain acts as storage for identity data, a hash of a timestamped document and the payment record.  Further, he says centralized healthcare databases should be smaller, housing only the records only one doctor or maybe one community. Transfer of data is in the hands of patients, with HIE of One using User-Managed Access (UMA) as its access control standard.  Long road ahead  Lofty ambitions aside, the healthcare industry looks likely to take its time in experimenting and implementing the technology.  In place of a large disruption is likely to be a cautious, piecemeal approach that might arguably be the safer, preferable option for the aspects of healthcare that may adopt blockchain applications over time.  Rose argued that, in this light, technology solutions also need to take a backseat to patient security, which he said remains the industry’s core mandate.  He explained:  “The healthcare industry likes technology, but it needs to be safe and secure. No one wants their grandmother put at risk because a doctor decided to adopt a technology that wasn’t proven.”  Doctor image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Bailey Reutzel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/22/physicians-say-blockchain-healthcare-ideas-in-need-of-exam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25653a61d8cd6aaad479b30fa030d6395f15d1f8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
