42426497,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtF3h,1442343704,Russian Artist Makes Music Using Bitcoin Market Data,"Is this the sound a bitcoin market makes?  Russian artist Dmitry Morozov, also known as ::vtol::, recently debuted a new art technology installation entitled silk that uses live data from bitcoin and litecoin markets across five different currencies to create music.  The work was shown this past weekend during Cosmoscow, a contemporary art festival held in Moscow. According to the artist’s website, silk is a kind of autonomous stringed instrument that responds to price changes denominated in rubles, yuan, euros, and US and Canadian dollars. The software draws bitcoin price data from BitcoinWisdom.com.  Here’s how Morozov describes the work on his official website:  “The installation is tracking the real time changes in the market activities related to [the] cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Litecoin – independent and uncontrolled by any state peer-to-peer payment systems. [The] constantly changing currency rate of Bitcoin against major world currencies is influencing the strain of strings in [the] installation and the way the picks are hitting them. The robotic system of the artwork is directed by a computer algorithm: influenced by dynamic changes of data, the installation sounds like a complex sound instrument.”  Morozov said that the work was co-commissioned by Laboratoria Art & Science Space, a contemporary art organization based in Moscow, and a company called Lykke AG.  “They were asking me to find some idea that will combine art and finances - and I think bitcoin is a very interesting ‘new’ thing that can change society,” he told CoinDesk in an email.  The result, as the video shows, is a strange, metallic and ever-changing soundscape and an “infinite number of variations and harmonies”, in the words of the artist.  “This piece explores how new technologies and progress in such areas of knowledge as cryptography, mathematics, computer science influence the financial system, inevitably changing the social structure of the society,” Morozov wrote on his website. “These changes can be characterised by growing decentralization, transparency, unfalsifiability, immateriality of values.”  The work comes months after Morozov exhibited another sound-oriented work called Oil, which, according to The Verge, invited participants to record audio of themselves slowly crushing their smartphone or other possessions with a hydraulic press.

42426485,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEnh,1442334656,Bitcoin Peer-Reviewed Academic Journal ‘Ledger’ Launches,"Ledger, the first ever peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to cryptocurrencies such as a bitcoin, launched today.  Arising from a partnership between the University of Pittsburgh, MIT Media Lab and partly funded by Coin Center, Ledger Journal will attempt to lead the research being done in the cryptocurrency field.  Dr Peter R. Rizun, co-managing editor at Ledger, told CoinDesk he wants to create a mechanism for efficient peer review within the bitcoin community, adding:  ""I wanted to build an academic and interdisciplinary communication channel that would allow bright minds in economics, sociology, physics, law and political science to contribute at the highest-level towards the evolution of bitcoin.""  Currently, the contribution is mostly made by core developers.  ""I believe bitcoin would benefit from greater diversity at the leadership level,"" he added.  Not just about bitcoin  Richard Ford Burley, editor at Ledger, shared the journal's objectives:  ""The purpose of Ledger is to provide something currently missing from the cryptocurrency world: a scholarly, peer-reviewed forum to bring together multiple disciplines to discuss new ideas and research.""  He continued: ""While there are spaces online to discuss new and ongoing issues in cryptocurrencies, they can sometimes lack the openness and accountability of an open system of peer review.""  However, Ledger is not just about bitcoin, said Ford Burley, adding that the editorial team is actively interested in receiving submissions relating to cryptocurrencies, shared distributed ledgers, cryptographic proof-of-works systems and distributed consensus.  The group – which features academics from prestigious universities such as Oxford, Stanford, Cornell, MIT and Duke – intends to publish the first issue at the end of the first quarter of 2016 via the University of Pittsburgh's Library System.  Ledger will timestamp all published articles on bitcoin's blockchain and urges authors to consider digitally signing their manuscripts.  The call for research submissions opened today and will close on 31st December 2015.

42426489,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEth,1442332478,Société Générale's Legal Director Seeks Bitcoin Regulation,"Société Générale's group legal director has called out for the establishment of an international bitcoin regulatory framework.  In an article  co-written by Dominique Bourrinet, group legal director of the French multinational bank; and his colleague Etienne Mauret, the consequences of bitcoin's undetermined legal status are discussed.  A loosely translated version of the article reads:  ""In terms of French law, it [bitcoin] goes into no known category: it is neither a legal tender nor a means of payment – not even an electronic currency – within the meaning of the Monetary and Financial Code. This uncertainty has not prevented the French government from establishing an ad hoc tax system. The question of the application of VAT remains to be decided.""  Despite branding the French authorities' efforts as ""laudable"", the authors continue to outline the need for an international regulatory framework that would quickly supervise this ""new money"".  Associated risks  Bourrinet and Mauret go on to warn against the associated risks of using cryptocurrency in the absence of regulation. Bitcoin, they say, offers no guarantee with regards to price or liquidity.  Additional negatives attributed to the digital currency in the article include its use in the purchase of illegal products and the potential for customers to lose funds as a result of ""failure or destruction of the computer's owner or closure of the corresponding storage unit"".  This is not the first time the bank – France's third largest in terms of assets – has dabbled in the crypto space.  In July this year, Société Générale posted a job advertisement for a bitcoin-focused developer.

42426475,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEXh,1442326655,Global Investment Banks Back Blockchain Initiative,"Nine major investment banks including J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have partnered with distributed ledger startup R3CEV.  The partnership will see collaborative efforts between the institutions take shape, work that will include the development of standards for using blockchain technology within the broader financial industry.  The banking group includes Credit Suisse, State Street, UBS, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, BBVA, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland. Many on the list have previously announced independent efforts to study blockchain tech, and the banks are said to be investing money in R3 as part of the effort, according to a report by The Financial Times.  The banks and R3 will form working groups as part of the development of blockchain prototypes and proofs-of-concept. R3 has spent months working with Wall Street financial institutions on the technology, a process that included hosting industry roundtables and assisting on internal investigations by banks.  R3 CEO David Rutter said of the partnership:  “This partnership signals a significant commitment by the banks to collaboratively evaluate and apply this emerging technology to the global financial system. Our bank partners recognize the promise of distributed ledger technologies and their potential to transform financial market technology platforms where standards must be secure, scalable and adaptable.”  Representatives from the banks involved said the partnership helps harmonize development of the technology in a bid to promote more comprehensive work.  ""Right now, you’re seeing significant money and time being spent on exploration of these technologies in a fractured way that lacks the strategic, coordinated vision so critical to timely success. The R3 model is changing the game,” said Kevin Hanley, director of design at Royal Bank of Scotland.  Participation by the banks, according to one representative, is reflective of the growing interest among large financial institutions in blockchain tech.  ""These new technologies could transform how financial transactions are recorded, reconciled and reported – all with additional security, lower error rates and significant cost reductions,"" said Hu Liang, State Street SVP and head of emerging technologies.

42426487,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtElh,1442318020,BNP Paribas Fortis Denies Bitcoin Vault Project,"BNP Paribas Fortis has denied it is exploring the idea of entering the bitcoin space as a digital vault provider.  A spokesperson for the international Belgium-based bank – a subsidiary of BNP Paribas – told CoinDesk the company was not planning to allow its customers to store bitcoin as they would any other asset.  The spokesperson added:  ""I will disappoint you because we do not have a project regarding the bitcoins. So, it's not true.""  BNP Paribas Fortis' denial comes after CoinDesk was contacted by a subscriber to the Bitcoin Brussels mailing list, who claimed to have received an email from a marketing analyst at the bank detailing plans to offer a digital vault solution.  According to the subscriber, the message asked readers to register their interest on a Launchrock website – a platform that enables its users to create viral 'Launching Soon' pages with in-built sharing tools and analytics – by providing their email address.  The spokesperson for BNP Paribas Fortis attributed the ""confusion"" around the bank's intentions to a training excercise:  ""As part of training on the Lean Startup, the theme of bitcoin is often chosen as a case study. As part of this training, a hypothesis was tested by posting a web page (not branded) on bitcoiners [sic] forums to analyse the possible interest of these in being able to store bitcoins safe in a bank.""  Watching the blockchain  Despite unwilling to disclose specifics, the spokesperson said the bank was watching blockchain technology to assess how it could be used to speed up business processes and make them less costly.  ""But these are only projects and formations,"" they added.  The comments come after a report in July suggested BNP Paribas was looking to incorporate bitcoin to one of their currency funds.  CoinDesk reached out to BNP Paribas at the time but was unable to verify the news.
