42397387,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Ajt,1393881733,Bitcoin Prices Rise 15% to Reach Post Mt. Gox Crisis High,"The price of bitcoin is up more than 15% today on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), having reached a high of $677.58 before settling to $659.50 at press time.  The $659 figure was roughly $90 more than the opening price of $560, and marked the highest CoinDesk BPI prices observed since mid-February, when troubled bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was removed from the average amid escalating concern about its financial state.  Press time lows on both BTC-e and Bitstamp were the highest observed since 23rd February, when Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles abruptly resigned from his board of director position at the Bitcoin Foundation.  Indeed, the rise in the price of bitcoin was significant at points today, with most price gains happening within a roughly three-hour flurry of buying activity peaking at 16:00 pm GMT.  Exchange prices rise  At press time, prices on major Slovenia-based bitcoin exchange Bitstamp had risen from an opening price of $565 to a low of $658. Volume reached its height on the exchange at around 18:00 pm (GMT).  Likewise, prices on BTC-e increased from an open of $554 to a low of $639 at press time. Here, too, volume peaked at around 17:45 pm before cooling.  Suspected causes  Speculation was rampant as to the exact cause of the increases, with message boards suggesting that a single buyer had moved the market. Others attributed the rise to the general feeling of optimism from investors following the demise of troubled Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and the UK's decision to ease bitcoin taxes.  Further, the price jump happened in spite of negative news stories such as the ongoing unrest in Ukraine and renowned investor Warren Buffet's high-profile rebuff of bitcoin.  The most plausible theory presented may be that no one news story was the impetus for the increase, but that rather prices recovered due to more complex market factors.  For example, some reddit users suggested bitcoin prices now revolve more correctly around hype cycles, and that the increased publicity has brought an influx of new buyers looking to take advantage of a weakened market.  While prices are recovering, however, it remains to be seen if the market can reach the lofty goals some members expressed would occur at the onset of 2014.  Do you still believe the price of 1 BTC will hit $10,000? Weigh in below.

42397380,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Adz,1393870535,"Iceland’s Auroracoin Passes Litecoin, Becomes Third Largest Altcoin by Market Cap","Auroracoin, the digital currency launched this February for use by the citizens of Iceland, has now passed litecoin to become the third-largest digital currency by market capitalization.  At press time, auroracoin had a total market capitalization of $515m, roughly $162m more than litecoin’s $353m, according to data from Coinmarketcap. The price of auroracoin (AUR) currently stands at $47.08 on the company’s website.  The quick spike in interest from investors has surprised even its creator Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson who has mixed sentiments about his coin’s meteoric rise.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Óðinsson indicated that he believes the high value could be key to convincing more Icelanders to claim and use the 31.8 auroracoins his team will disperse to citizens later this month.  Explained Óðinsson:  “What I did not expect was the sheer volume of speculation that would go on. I thought a market cap of $20m would be a huge success and enough to get Icelanders excited.”  The news of auroracoin’s ascent on the market cap leaderboard is particularly noteworthy given that digital currency is based on litecoin.  Fifty per cent of all auroracoins have been pre-mined, and will be given out via an ‘Airdrop’ to citizens on 25th March. Claimants will be required to use state-issued ID numbers in order to receive the coins.  Speculation threatens community  Though undeniably excited about the interest his project has generated, Óðinsson says that this increase in value is not without its drawbacks.  First and foremost, he worries of the effects excessive speculation could have on the success of this month’s launch.    What will all this speculation do to the Airdrop? My fear is that things are overheating.      — auroracoin (@auroracoinIS) March 3, 2014    This focus on speculation, Óðinsson reasons, may detract from the building of necessary infrastructure, as most current trading is being conducted by speculators, not involved community members.  However, Óðinsson acknowledges that given the digital currency’s decentralized nature, there’s only so much he can do to ensure its ultimate success.  “People need to be able to do something with their coins other than just immediately sell them. This aspect of the coin can’t be centrally planned, it has to grow from the community.”  Struggling to keep up  As evidence of auroracoin’s rise, major altcoin exchanges are rushing to add the hot listing to their offerings.  In just the last week alone, auroracoin has been added to Cryptsyhttps://www.cryptsy.com/markets/view/160, Swiss Coin Exchange and Mintpal.    AuroraCoin has been added to the Exchange      — BigVern (@cryptsy) March 2, 2014    The increase in interest has been so rapid that auroracoin has faced operational issues with its website, that it suggested were due to its market surge.    http://t.co/RpRdFMX1lg website still out. Trying to resolve issues. Reason for outage here: http://t.co/9bw1fcnfNI      — auroracoin (@auroracoinIS) February 27, 2014    Community members have been noticing the resulting fluctuations, indicating that the price has been unpredictable in light of this increased attention.  On these issues too, Óðinsson chose to take a balanced view. He recognizes that part of his goal with auroracoin was to open up Icelandic commerce to the rest of the world, and that such additions, while troubling for operations in the short-term, are necessary.  “Auroracoin must grow bigger than just to serve the domestic economy. This is already happening,” he said.  Example to the world  Adding pressure to the project is that auroracoin doesn’t just have implications for Iceland.  If successful, Óðinsson indicates that he expects more countries, especially those that have experienced a recent banking crisis, to follow auroracoin’s lead.  Óðinsson did reveal that his team is currently preparing for the Airdrop, and that smartphone apps and other key complementary features are under development.  For now, it seems, the March deadline will remain Óðinsson's main focus.  “There is only so much I can do, other than execute the Airdrop. The success of the coin is in the hands of the community,” he said.

42397389,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Alr,1393866713,"The CoinDesk Mining Roundup: Useless Servers, Legal Aid and Scrypt Miners","The past few weeks have not been incredibly positive for the bitcoin economy, to say the least. Yet it is important to stay cognisant of the fact that, although bitcoin exchanges will come and then go, mining is here to stay.  No regulator is going to be able to create a policy to get rid of the ASIC chips out there confirming bitcoin transactions. As Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen recently told American Banker:  “These chips will become ubiquitous. You might buy a box of Cracker Jacks and get a bitcoin mining ASIC unit.”  With that positive thought in mind, here’s a look at the best of the mining stories that have cropped up since the last round-up.  The profits of malware mining  Researchers at the University of California, San Diego have been analyzing malware-based bitcoin mining.  Their study involved looking at over 2,000 pieces of malicious software. While some strains target bitcoiners’ digital wallets, many harness the host computer to undertake illicit mining activities.  The results? At least 10 of these malware mining enterprises have been able to reap as many as 4,500 bitcoins. At today’s CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index valuation, that would amount to over $2.8m.  Researchers say this activity has occurred over the past two years.  Dell SecureWorks recently said that it has only been able to identify 146 active strains of bitcoin malware, so perhaps the amount of bitcoin mining-related malware may be decreasing as the difficulty increases, which leads us to ...  Standard servers ‘a waste of time’ for BTC mining  Online backup company iDrive runs automated nightly backups for its customers. So, during the day, while its systems were idle, the company decided to conduct an experiment.  iDrive set 600 of its quad-core servers to work to see how much bitcoin could be mined.  The results were conclusive: mining bitcoin with regular hardware is no longer profitable.  With the results of the test, iDrive calculated that running mining software on its 600 servers would earn approximately 0.43 bitcoin – per year!  iDrive's Matthew Harvey told Data Center Knowledge:  “It’s a waste of time, so any other company thinking about mining with their infrastructure, learn from us. Don’t do it. You need custom machines to effectively mine bitcoins and generate a real ROI.”  Altcoin mining may be leading to AMD card shortages  Both litecoin and dogecoin use scrypt as proof of work, and suitable ASIC mining technology has not yet hit the market.  As a result, AMD’s flagship Radeon R9 290X, which was designed as a high-end graphics card, is being snapped up by miners looking to cash in on scrypt mining while they can.  An example of this trend is the DopaMINE hardware chassis, which is built for the specific purpose of loading up with a number of these cards and hashing away  The result of this alt-mining craze seems to be that the cards are in very short supply, says Sam Mattera at Fool.com.  NewEgg appears to have them in stock, while Amazon sellers seem to only have them in limited supply. If you want to buy one, though, they will cost you an inflated $649 or more.  Nvidia takes on AMD in the mining race  It seems that AMD’s largest rival, Nvidia, is trying to up its game for scrypt-based mining via GPUs.  The company has just released a new technology it is calling Maxwell, which is aimed to compete with the Radeon R9 290X.  What Maxwell allows Nvidia to do is offer better performance, but at a lower price and with a lower energy output than AMD’s top-of-the-range offering. Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 750 Ti, for example, only costs $149.99.  Forbes reports  that Nvidia is able to offer these cards for so much less because it has better control of its supply chain.  Tom’s Hardware makes the case that four of the Nvidia cards should outperform the Radeon R9 290X, while still saving on electricity  CoinTerra announces shipment of its 1,000th miner  Texas-based CoinTerra has announced that its 1,000th ASICs miner has departed the company’s Austin facility.  The company has been ramping up production since the delays that previously plagued the company's TerraMiner shipments.  CoinTerra stated in its release:  “TerraMiners already account for over 1.7 petahash of bitcoin mining performance, which is more than 6% of the entire bitcoin network.”  The company is once again taking orders for its TerraMiner IV – a 2TH/s unit, priced at $5,999 – that will ship June 2014.  Also due in June is the company’s water-cooled GSX I – a 400 GH/s card, costing $1,599. The GSX I can be daisy chained via USB using a PC host, and should go some way towards keeping small-scale miners in business.  Tidbit pressure leads MIT to establish legal resource  Tidbit  was a project initiated by a group of MIT students to harness the power of PCs to mine bitcoin.  The idea was that you place a snippet of code on your website, which can earn you bitcoin using your visitors’ processing power.  The New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs, however, issued a subpoena to one of Tidbit’s developers, and demanded that all of the project’s assets be handed over to law enforcement agencies.  An open letter was published by an MIT faculty member, imploring the university to defend the student in question.  MIT’s President L. Rafael Reif has now announced the formation of an independent legal resource as a result of this case, with the plan being to aid students ensnared in this sort of predicament.  Reif said:  “I believe we should provide our student inventors and entrepreneurs with a resource for independent legal advice, singularly devoted to their interests and rights.”  Standard computing technology has pretty much been rendered useless in bitcoin hashing. However, Tidbit was working on an intriguing distributed-computing concept before the intervention by the Division of Consumer Affairs.  Alpha issues update on scrypt ASICs miner  Alpha Technology, a company based in Manchester, UK, has updated prospective customers on its progress in bringing the Viper ASICs-based scrypt miner to market.  The company aims to be the first with such a product, which is aimed at mining digital currencies other than bitcoin.  The unit's node has been finalized at 40nm, the company stated, adding:  “Higher than advertised hashing power will also be provided to batch-1 customers.”  The company is currently taking 30% deposits for its initial line of Vipers. The device will be available in either $9,000 25 MH/s at 500 watts (approx.), or $2,250 5 MH/s unit at 100 watts (approx.) configurations.  Although others are rumoured to also be in the race to produce an ASICs miner for scrypt currencies, Alpha Technology appears to be closest to the finishing line.  HashFast upgrades miners amid complaints  ASICs miner manufacturer HashFast has announced that the company’s hardware is being upgraded.  Its next-generation Evo lineup, the company said, will offer more power, thanks to design improvements on the same 28nm chip that the company is already selling.  HashFast’s ‘batch-2’ Sierra Evo is available for $6,000 and hashes at around 2 TH/s. The company said that for “added flexibility” the units will not ship with power supplies. The Sierra Evo is expected to ship in May 2014.  HashFast is also currently taking orders for its Yoli Evo boards, providing 800 GH/s, with a minimum order of 10 for $19,000.  The company says it will start shipping its Evo products once it has fulfilled all previous model orders.  Many Hashfast customers are not happy about this announcement. Notable bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell voiced his concerns publicly on the Bitcointalk forum after failing to receive a miner he ordered. He said:  “I urge everyone to provide HashFast with no further business until they make right by their past customers.”  Got a cryptocurrency mining tip for future round-ups? Contact us.

42397374,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4AY5,1393862214,"London Student Mines Dogecoin With University's Computers – They Don’t Know, Yet","Each evening, ‘Felix’ sneaks into the computer suite at his university and starts up the machines. One by one, he runs a script on each computer and his ‘workers’ begin solving complex algorithms.  You wouldn’t know just by looking, but he’s making his own money – using his university’s computers to mine dogecoin.  Felix’s story mirrors that of a Harvard researcher who used his university’s supercomputer for dogecoin mining, earning himself a permanent ban from the computer and, presumably, a heck of a lot of coins in the process.  Like others who came onto the cryptocurrency scene late, Felix (not his real name), says he was gutted about “completely missing the bitcoin craze”. Mining dogecoin is his chance at getting on the gravy train while the price is low and riding it all the way to the moon – he hopes.  Dodging the IT department  After giving his laptop a shot at mining dogecoin before Christmas, he returned to his university, Imperial College London, after the holidays with a plan: he would use rows upon rows of university computers as his personal mining pool. So far he’s managed to sneak under the radar, he says:  “I've not had a single issue yet, so I've kept scaling up! It seems they don't have anything set up to bring attention to the fact I'm maxing out the CPUs, which is nice.”  Felix mines using an online pool, meaning that his efforts are combined with others through a website. After installing a program on to each computer, their individual processing power is counted towards his single online account, allowing him to combine many computers with very little technical know-how.  Although he is able to dodge the Symantec security software guarding the computers for CPU mining, Felix says that he has been unable to utilise the graphic cards, which would allow him to tap into yet another level of computing power.  He hasn’t tried to crack the graphics cards’ defenses yet, as he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself, so to-date he’s only had access to i7-2770k processors.  Possible repercussions  It’s unclear what repercussions Felix would face if caught. Unlike the researcher who used Harvard’s supercomputer, Felix is mining with standard desktop computers used by students for coursework and browsing reddit, not in-demand research technology.  Running unauthorised scripts when everyone’s gone home might irk the IT department, not to mention the electricity he has been burning, but it’s perhaps the least immoral tactic people have used to leverage large numbers of computers for mining without permission.  Other methods include infecting computers with malware that extorts money but also runs mining operations in the background.  The amount he’s mined so far is fairly modest: just 30,000 DOGE, which currently holds a value of just £20 ($33). His strategy is to build up a large stock of dogecoin and hope the price rises spectacularly as it did with bitcoin.  Buying himself a specialised miner is out of the question, says Felix:  “I don't find the cryptocurrency market stable enough to make real investments, at least for now, on a student budget.”  Funding gap  The ease with which mining operations can be set up, combined with the ready availability at universities of large amounts of computing power, suggest that Felix is by no means the only student mining in this way. Indeed, the Harvard supercomputer and Imperial’s computing suites may just be the tip of the iceberg.  Perhaps it’s even time the universities themselves got in on the game – what better way to fill the funding gap caused by government cuts than with Shiba Inu-branded digital currency? Sure beats raising tuition fees again.

42397379,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Ac1,1393858019,Warren Buffett: Bitcoin is Not a Currency,"Warren Buffett hardly needs an introduction – the legendary 83-year-old investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has a résumé that can put just about anyone to shame.  However, you're unlikely to find the phrase ""bitcoin believer"" on this particular CV.  Speaking to CNBC, Buffett touched on many issues, from the crisis in Crimea to his eventual successor and even bitcoin. What the 'most successful investor of the 20th century' had to say about the latter is not very encouraging, however.  Bitcoin won't be around in a decade or two  Buffett brought up bitcoin in a curious context. He argued that in wartime it is much better to hold stocks rather than money. He pointed out that he made his first investment in 1942, when the war in the Pacific wasn't going very well for the US.  He was right to do so, as the stock market grew during the war, while the dollar depreciated.  ""American businesses are going to be worth more money. Dollars will be worth less, so that money won't buy you quite as much, but you'll be much better off owning productive assets over the next 50 years than you will be holding pieces of paper or, I'm not sure, bitcoins,"" he said, chuckling.  Buffett does not view bitcoin as a currency at all:  ""It's not a currency. I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't around in the next 10-20 years.""  Buffett went on to point out that bitcoin is being priced off the dollar and that it is simply not a durable means of exchange.  Wars, markets, economies  Buffett appears to believe that world markets are overreacting to Russia's decision to deploy troops to the Crimea, essentially invading Ukraine via a back door.  He said that he simply does not take such things into consideration, adding that he doesn't buy businesses based on macro factors. In other words, even the prospect of a war in Europe leaves Buffett unfazed.  The CEO is bullish on the stock market and the US economy in general. He points to moderate, but consistent growth over the last few years and the resilience of the economy in face of public mistrust.  It is easy to see why some people may be reluctant following the crash of 2008, but Buffett thinks everything is in order – nobody is getting wildly optimistic or pessimistic, he concludes.

42397376,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Aa3,1393853733,London Hostel Chain Clink Now Accepts Cryptocurrencies,"Bitcoiners visiting London no longer have to stray into the fiat world to pay for their accommodation. A chain of hostels in the UK capital is now accepting payments in both bitcoin and litecoin.  Clink Hostels  , which owns two hostels in central London, including one in a former courthouse, began accepting the currency last month.  Dave Double, sales manager for Clink, encouraged the move towards bitcoin payments and is heavily involved in digital currencies, mining litecoin, qubitcoins, vertcoin and dogecoin – the latter of which he admits has problems in a business environment:  “It’s catchy because it’s a fun coin, but getting my CEO to take dogecoin seriously is difficult when the bank balance is at stake.”  Cheaper travel  Travellers have much to gain from using bitcoin, primarily in the avoidance of currency conversion fees.  In 2013, Austin Craig and Beccy Bingham-Craig spent 100 days living on bitcoin alone and travelling the world.  They told CoinDesk at the time that not having to worry about using a different currency in each country was a refreshing change. Double echoed those sentiments, saying:  “We love the idea that people from around the world can travel at the same exchange rate regardless of how rich or poor a country you’re in.”  At the moment Clink uses a straightforward QR code system for receiving payments, so travellers pay bitcoin straight to Clink’s wallet, but they are intending to use a third-party payment processor and “leaning towards Coinbase”.  Poor perceptions  Time and time again, small businesses that accept bitcoin cite one major problem with the use of digital currencies: public confidence in the currency.  Clink Hostels is no different. Double says that issues about converting bitcoin into fiat currency and vice-versa are no longer big problems for business – relatively mature payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase have resolved this question.  However, volatility and high-profile cases linking cryptocurrencies with incompetence, criminality and deceit continue to weigh on the minds of business owners, says Double:  “Volatility in the exchange rate puts [businesses] off as it seems complicated to make sure you get a good price for your product. Of course, this is [not true], as you can convert straight away, but things like Silk Road haven’t helped.”  From Double’s perspective, businesses will begin to feel more comfortable about getting into the bitcoin arena when there’s greater government clarity on bitcoin regulation and on bitcoin taxation, which we’re beginning to see.  For now, Clink gets to hold the crown of being the first hostel in the UK to accept bitcoin – something that gives them the edge, not over physical competitors, but online booking sites like booking.com.  “They can’t tap into [this community] at the moment,” says Double.  Perhaps, but with travel companies waking up to the potential of bitcoin, Clink won’t be alone for long.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/03/london-hostel-chain-clink-now-accepts-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ee1733c26455cc63cf6f966efa9f1a8869e620e-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397378,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Ad0,1393850113,Mt. Gox Lawsuit Targets Mark Karpeles’ Personal Wealth,"A class action against Mt. Gox is being organised by a London law firm that says it will go after CEO Mark Karpeles personally to recover its clients’ lost bitcoins.  Selachii LLP  says it is representing over 200 claimants from China, the US, Canada and 12 European countries, and that it will launch proceedings against Karpeles “wherever in the world he is”.  They also are in discussions with lawyers in Japan to mount a case against Mt. Gox, which has filed for bankruptcy in Japan after admitting it had lost around 750,000 its customers’ bitcoins. One of the claimants in the lawsuit has lost over 4,000 coins, which equates to $2.3m at today's exchange rate.  The lawsuit may also make a claim against Tibanne, Mt. Gox’s parent company, which was founded by Mark Karpeles.  Separate legal action was also launched against Mt. Gox and Karpeles in Denver, Colorado, on Thursday by Mt. Gox customer Gregory Greene.  Fraud accusation possible  With Selachii taking action on multiple fronts, Mark Karpeles could find himself defending Mt. Gox’s actions on at least two continents.  Richard Howlett of Selachii says that the facts around the closure of what was once bitcoin’s largest exchange “don’t add up” and that the court action would force Mt. Gox and Mark Karpeles to prove that the huge bitcoin hack actually occurred:  “I don’t know if it’s true that they were hacked, no one knows if it’s true. but that’s something that will come out in court. I will be surprised if it’s as simple as they were just hacked.”  Howlett also raised questions about the loss of fiat funds in addition to Mt. Gox’s bitcoin, which can’t be explained by the hacking of data in the same way as a loss of bitcoin.  Mt. Gox’s public statements reassuring their customers that all was well could come back to haunt the company.  If the company and Karpeles were aware of Mt. Gox’s dire financial situation – which, considering the scale of the issue, is a plausible assumption – Howlett says they could be accused of behaving fraudulently by inducing customers to continue to invest their money in the exchange:  “They had to be honest [with their customers]. They should have stopped everything, because it appears that they were in serious financial difficulty.”  This element of potential liability could explain why Mt. Gox deleted all of its tweets in the days leading up to its eventual demise.  Furthermore, how bitcoins were allegedly stolen from cold storage will be a key technical point, with Howlett suggesting that one explanation could be they were never in cold storage and that Mt. Gox was acting negligently.  Frozen assets  Once a leading member of the bitcoin community, Mark Karpeles bowed deeply last week at the press conference in Japan announcing Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy filing.  The lawsuit could yet see him on his knees if his personal wealth is plundered to pay back Mt. Gox customers. Howlett says that every part of Karpeles’ wealth will be targeted:  “His bank accounts will be scrutinised, his finances will be scrutinised, any offshore accounts, all those sorts of things – if there’s money there, those assets could be pulled into the pot to distribute to the people in the class action.”  Hunting down a person’s assets could prove difficult, however, if they are largely held in bitcoin wallets. Proving ownership of bitcoin assets is not straightforward, even if it is possible to find them in the first place. Bitcoin’s held in cold storage could be hidden in any number of offshore locations.  It is is likely that assets owned by Karpeles, Tibanne and Mt. Gox will be frozen to prevent them being liquidated or hidden once the lawsuit is underway.  Mt. Gox win?  If the lawsuit succeeds, there will be a crucial legal battle about whether any payout should be in bitcoin or in fiat currency.  The value of bitcoin may have risen enough by the culmination of the case to make a fiat currency payout small compared to the total value of any remaining bitcoin in Mt. Gox’s control. Many of Selachii’s clients in the lawsuit are not necessarily looking for their bitcoin back, just their money, says Howlett:  “Many people have got their fingers burnt. The vast number of people we’ve spoken to would rather have the financial value back instead of bitcoin, they’ve been scared off now.”  If the lawsuit is settled in fiat currency and not in bitcoin, then “Mt. Gox could end up winning”, says Howlett, even if the allegations against them turn out to be true.

As part of the launch, the first 96,000 downloads will be awarded with a few bucks to spend.  The KnC Bitcoin Wallet app is available on the Google Play Store and it's free. Needless to say, there's no app for iOS or Windows Phone. The wallets are pre-funded and it appears that the first 1,000 downloads will be awarded with $5 each, while the next 95,000 wallets will get $1 each (at the current BTC/USD exchange rate).  Bitcoin wallets for the masses  In order to appeal to a wider audience, KnC has teamed up with the Chicago Sun-Times, which is supporting the launch with ads and sponsored content in the form of a ""Bitcoin for Beginners"" guide.  KnC co-founder Sam Cole said the move was part of the company’s effort to educate a wider audience about the possibilities of Bitcoin:  “KnC wants to share information about this evolving technology with the public. Most people don’t understand what exactly Bitcoin is or how they could benefit fromusing KnC Wallet in their daily life. We’re trying to change that.”  Wrapports Chief Technology Officer Josh Metnick said the Chicago Sun-Times was an obvious choice, as the paper already embraced bitcoin. Wrapports publishes the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Reader and several dozen smaller publications in northern Illinois and Indiana.  “As a media company in today’s environment, it’s crucial for us to stay engaged with new forms of commerce like Bitcoin. Our initial Bitwall experiment proved successful, and we are going to keep pushing the boundaries across all types of technologies,” Metnick said.  The big hope is to equip 100,000 Chicagoans with an active bitcoin wallet, Metnick told us.  Teething problems  According to the Google Play page, the wallet is currently in version 0.9.1 and it has been installed just under 500 times.  The company's wallet can send and receive bitcoins using phone contacts and it has an integrated QR scanner to dynamically convert BTC to local currency. However, KnC admits a couple of limitations – for example its NFC payments are still not working.  The app supports all Android versions back to 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, so it should work on the vast majority of devices launched over the last two to three years.  The first version of the app was uploaded on 21st February to a mediocre response. The average review score is 3.7 and some users are reporting several issues. However, KnC has acknowledged these negative comments and promises to iron out any kinks soon.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/03/knc-and-chicago-sun-times-launch-pre-funded-bitcoin-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db2d2617c8f23320bc405b311de2263e6e4ceb68-1020x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397386,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Afx,1393839017,Mt. Gox Bankruptcy Support Line Opens for Business,"Defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which declared bankruptcy after close of business last Friday, has officially opened a phone support line for customers and updated its website with details of Friday's bankruptcy filing.  The company posted the following message on its now commerce-free website:    ""A call center has been established to respond to all inquiries. The call center is planned to start on March 3, 2014. All inquiries to MtGox Co., Ltd. should be made to the following telephone number:      Telephone number: +81 3-4588-3921    Working hours: Monday to Friday 10am to 5pm (Japan time)    Please refrain from contacting the office of the supervisor/investigator.""    Mt. Gox has still provided no further details as to how it managed to lose over 800,000 bitcoins, causing pundits to run wild with detailed theories. The bankruptcy statement still claims the loss of 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 of the company's own is ""through the abuse of a bug in the bitcoin system"".  Interestingly, the bankruptcy filing looks at the possibility of Mt. Gox continuing its business in some form.    ""In order to increase repayments to our creditors, it is necessary to explore the possibility of having MtGox Co., Ltd. continue its business. This is why the civil rehabilitation procedure has been chosen, Rebuilding MtGox Co., Ltd under the supervision of the court in a legally organized procedure while giving proper explanations will not be for the sole benefit of the company but for that of the whole bitcoin community.      All efforts will now be made to restore the business and recover damages to repay debts to creditors. We hope for the understanding and cooperation of all.""    Japanese call center  Phone support staff appear to work for a call center contractor, and have little information about the company itself, or any details off the official script.  CoinDesk contacted the support line and, after roughly 10 minutes on hold, was told they could not give out any information or register customer names, but just ""take messages for the lawyers"".  Staff also directed callers to updates on Mt. Gox's website, which now features details of the bankruptcy filing but little other useful information for customers or creditors.  Despite an overwhelming majority of Mt. Gox's customers being located in the United States or otherwise outside Japan, and the company's management partnership being French, last Friday's media conference was conducted almost entirely in Japanese and the support line announcement is posted in Japanese first, English second.  Support staff seem to be Japanese and answer calls in Japanese, though they do speak English.  Customer Tony* called the support line shortly after it opened, but discovered little useful information. He recorded his call, which was cut off midway through, and posted the experience on YouTube.  The initial call handler seemed nervous at the suggestion the call was being recorded, saying staff were not representatives of Mt. Gox but employees at a call center, but concluded ""it's at your discretion basically"".  Tony, who says he had about 30 BTC stored with Mt. Gox, asked staff what the recourse was for customers who had lost money.  The response was that Mt. Gox would have to go through proceedings with the Tokyo District Court before a deal could be arranged with creditors, including how much could be repaid.  ""All things are transparent to the court [...] The company cannot hide everything (sic) [...] cannot hide the assets, everything is now transparent,"" the Japanese call center representative said.  Tony asked if coins would be repaid to customers in full, or as a percentage, but was again told that court proceedings would need to be completed first ""to confirm who is a creditor, including those holding bitcoins.""  ""Because this case is very unique, and no court has experience handling similar cases of bitcoin, so I think it may take a long time to decide how much will be paid.""  She said details of court proceedings would be posted on Mt. Gox's website.  Ordinarily, she said, this sort of case would take a couple of months but the unique nature of the case meant the court has not announced a timeline. That information would be disclosed once the court gave its approval.  The call dropped out part-way through her next sentence. Upon re-establishing a call, the next staff member could say only that court proceedings were underway and updates would be posted to the mtgox.com site.  *not a real name, as requested by the customer. YouTube account is also not his real name.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/03/mt-gox-bankruptcy-support-line-opens-for-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c7feafcc9b26fa208fe745cac71225a5f1cf5a7-1138x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
