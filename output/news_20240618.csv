This recent downturn reflects a broader trend observed over the past week, with Bitcoin shedding approximately 2.4% of its value. The last 24 hours alone saw a further decline of 1%, signaling growing market nervousness. Related Reading: CoinShares: Altcoins Defy Trends As Bitcoin Faces $600M in Outflows – What’s Next? Should You Panic? Analysts from the blockchain analytics platform Santiment highlight the ongoing decline phase as a steepest three-day decline in active Bitcoin wallets since the peak earlier in March, suggesting a significant shift in investor behavior and market sentiment. However, this contrasts sharply with ETH, as Ethereum wallets continue to increase, indicating divergent investor confidence between the leading cryptocurrencies. The increase in Ethereum wallets suggests a bullish outlook for ETH despite the bearish pressure on Bitcoin. Meanwhile, according to Bitfinex analysts, the ongoing sell-off has been significantly influenced by long-term Bitcoin holders and whales adjusting their holdings amid the market’s consolidation phase. This behavior is typical of long-term holders who opt to reduce their positions during periods of market uncertainty to capitalize on or mitigate losses. The Bitfinex analyst reveals that the Hodler Net Position Change metric has consistently shown negative values, indicating that these significant players are moving their holdings to exchanges, potentially to sell, exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. This trend is echoed by the rising Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio, which tracks large deposits into exchanges relative to overall market activity. As more whales transfer their Bitcoin to trade on platforms, the increased potential supply on the market can lead to price drops. Should You Buy? Despite these pressures, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic about a potential rebound.

29656279,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625275,1718748005,"Expert Forecasts Altcoin Market Crash, Suggests Optimal Buy-In Points For Top 10 Cryptos","Renowned crypto analyst Doctor Profit recently released “The big altcoin report” for the third quarter of the year, suggesting further downward movement for the market. Based on historical performance and the current state of the market, Doctor Profit warns of an impending altcoin market crash triggered by an episode of uncertainty and a recent price correction in the top 100 cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin (BTC). However, the analyst remains optimistic, highlighting potential buying opportunities and optimal entry points for several top altcoins. Altcoin Market Correction Doctor Profit draws attention to the altcoin market’s recent exponential growth, with market capitalization surging from $300 billion to nearly $800 billion between October 2023 and March 2024, representing a 150% increase in just five months. Related Reading: From Cheers To Tears: Beercoin (BEER) Dries Up, Loses 70% Of Its Value Corrections following such significant growth are deemed normal but can prove challenging for retail investors. The recent correction of 25%, bringing the market cap to around $550 billion, is regarded as a healthy adjustment by the analyst. Doctor Profit believes that altcoins have nearly reached their bottom and are poised for another substantial rise, potentially reaching a market cap of $1 trillion and setting new all-time highs. The analyst parallels the current market situation and previous cycles, emphasizing the repetitive pattern of sideways movement and dumps followed by explosive growth. Doctor Profit identifies several altcoins with optimal buying levels based on their current prices and expected retracements. For instance, the native cryptocurrency of the 3D metaverse game, The Sandbox (SAND), is currently trading at $0.31. Doctor Profit suggests a potential retracement of $0.22 would present an optimal buy zone. Another altcoin, Stacks (STX), a Bitcoin Layer 2 token, currently trades at $1.61. Doctor Profit recommends a downside target and buy zone of $1.48. Similarly, Arbitrum (ARB), a Layer 2 token, is currently trading at $0.78, with losses of over 10%. Doctor Profit identifies $0.61 as the best-buy zone for this token, suggesting further losses in the coming days. Mid-July Rally Forecasted Moving on to larger altcoins, Doctor Profit analyzes Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency. Despite being the largest altcoin, Ethereum has witnessed a 3% drop, with the current trading price at $3,430. Doctor Profit’s analysis suggests a potential decline towards $2,890, indicating an entry point for a long position. Binance Coin (BNB), which recently reached a new all-time high of $725, is expected to retrace almost 50% to $396, presenting the best entry point according to the expert. Currently, BNB has retraced to $585. Doctor Profit further notes that other altcoins expected to retrace substantially include Optimism (OP), the Sei (SEI) token, Toncoin (TON), Notcoin (NOT), and Omni (OMNI). These altcoins have recorded price drops ranging from 8% to 17%, reflecting investor sentiment. Doctor Profit provides specific price targets and optimal buying levels for these altcoins. Doctor Profit advises caution due to potential “market maker manipulation” and order placements at the same levels. The analyst sets orders 3-5% higher or lower than the identified optimal buying levels to avoid missing out. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Solana Suffer As Institutional Investors Pull $600 Million Out Of Crypto Funds Lastly, Doctor Profit highlights the upcoming Ethereum ETF launch on July 2nd. While not expecting a significant pump on that day, similar to the Bitcoin ETF launch, the analyst predicts a sideways or bearish trend for altcoins in the next 3-4 weeks. However, a significant reversal and the start of a new altcoin rally are anticipated by mid-July. The analyst emphasizes that altcoins are currently low, and only a few will succeed. Based on the provided analysis, Doctor Profit believes that the altcoin market cap is 10-15% away from its bottom, making it an opportune time to invest for long-term gains.

His prediction comes amid a recent spike in XRP’s trading volume, which also provides a bullish case for the crypto token. XRP To Reach $200 At Some Point Egrag suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP could reach $200 at some point based on its next triangle consolidation. He stated that in the future, newbies would talk about how XRP’s price has remained stagnant at around $50 (instead of its current price of around $0.50) and that these same persons would complain about XRP pumping from $50 to $200. Basically, the analyst was predicting that XRP will experience exponential growth soon and that XRP newbies will not understand how the crypto token has come a long way, considering how it has remained stagnant for a while now. He claimed these investors will “never comprehend seven years of conviction and dedication.” Egrag acknowledged the frustration regarding XRP’s tepid price action and even mentioned that XRP Ledger (XRPL) builders are “starting to nag and feel frustration.” However, as always, he urged the XRP army to “stay steady.” He suggested that XRP is the token of the future, as he stated that “all previous models will be thrown out the window because they will not apply to the fourth industrial revolution.” Egrag’s analysis comes amid a recent surge in XRP’s derivatives trading volume, with data from Coinglass showing a 300% increase and a total of $3.24 billion traded in the last 24 hours. Additionally, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP’s spot trading volume is up by over 200% in the last 24 hours. This development is significant. It shows that crypto investors and traders are actively invested in the crypto token and may be looking to accumulate more XRP during this period, which could contribute to a price rally for the crypto token. Interestingly, XRP is one of the few crypto tokens up in the last 24 hours despite the recent crypto market dip. Another Bullish Outlook Crypto analyst Casi Trades also recently offered a bullish outlook for XRP. She claimed the crypto token looked “very bullish” as it had just come off the golden retracement levels. Casi Trades further stated that the altcoin needs to achieve a “strong breakout” above these resistance levels, noting that such an occurrence will clearly indicate a new trend. She suggested that this could be a big moment for XRP, stating that “this test could be the moment” that the market has been waiting for. Casi Trades sounded optimistic that XRP could achieve this breakout as she stated that Bitcoin had retraced close to the .618 level, which she believes could set the stage for the breakout.

29652565,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625239,1718740853,"BitMEX Co-founder Backs Meme Coins: A Boon For Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, PEPE?","Meme coins, the once-dismissed “joke” tokens, are rapidly solidifying their position in the multi-trillion-dollar scene. According to CoinMarketCap, meme coins now command a cumulative market cap of over $45 billion. Interestingly, they are on an upward trajectory as thousands of meme coins are minted predominantly on top platforms like Solana, Ethereum, and Base. Analysts and investors are taking notice as meme coins like BOME, PEPE, and Dogecoin boom. Most predict this subset of crypto will expand and become a core part of the industry in the coming years. Arthur Hayes Backs Meme Coins In a recent interview, Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder, joined the growing list of meme coin supporters. Hayes backed meme coins, stating that these tokens are increasingly gaining traction because of their simplicity. Unlike complex decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or AI, they require no technical knowledge. Therefore, this feature and accessibility continue to broaden their appeal. This position also seems to resonate with Raoul Pal, who, in the same interview, added that meme coins are rising because of the cultural connection these tokens tag. As constructed, meme coins are meant to ride on internet hype and cultural relevance. Related Reading: Potential Downtrend In Play? TON Struggles As Price Falls Below $7.7 Therefore, their playful nature and relatable themes resonate with a global audience. In turn, this helps forge a strong connection with the trend, as evidenced by the popularity of the viral BODEN meme coin. More analysts are coming out to back these tokens. Earlier, one analyst said at least three of these tokens would each command at least $100 billion in market cap in the next crypto bull run. Dogecoin is the most valuable meme coin, with a market cap exceeding $20 billion. If Dogecoin, for example, rallies to command a $100 billion market cap, DOGE holders will massively benefit. As of mid-June, only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT, a stablecoin, have market caps exceeding $100 billion. Despite its sharp expansion, even Solana is still perched at fourth, boasting a slightly over $66 billion market cap. Aptos To Take Over From Solana: A Meme Coin Host While Hayes backed meme coins, he predicted that Aptos would flip Solana to become the second largest and most active layer-1 platform after Ethereum within three years. Interestingly, this clashes with the current trend and Hayes’ position. Related Reading: Cardano Founder’s Pig NIKE Sparks Memecoin Craze, Market Cap Nears $1 Million Because of Solana’s high scalability and low fees, the platform is emerging as a home of meme coins, taking over from Ethereum. Even so, Hayes didn’t provide any explanation, saying all details will be made public in September. Earlier on, the BitMEX co-founder downplayed the threat posed by Solana on Ethereum’s lead. In his view, the first smart contracts platform has strength in its developer community and anchors decentralized finance (DeFi).

42390773,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdJqFJ,1718739863,Original TRUMP Token Struggles With Exchange Listings as DJT Rockets,"The team behind TRUMP (the meme coin, not the former U.S. president) have a similar complaint as their crypto token's namesake: They say the game is rigged against them.  The team, who have no official ties to Donald Trump, told CoinDesk they've had a hard time getting the original Trump-themed PoliFi token listed on mainstream digital asset trading platforms.  TRUMP, whose logo features the GOP candidate with laser eyes, primarily trades on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) but is available on lesser-known centralized exchanges including MEXC, LBank, BingX, and BitMart.  However, when the team applied in mid-May to list the token on Kraken, one of the oldest and largest U.S. exchanges, they never heard back, Steven Steele, marketing director of the TRUMP token, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. A Kraken spokesperson had no comment.  ""The exchanges that have refused to list TRUMP for 'political reasons' are exhibiting embarrassing levels of cowardice that is also incredibly tone deaf to the current memecoin landscape and their own customers,"" Steele said.  ""To shun the pioneer of PoliFi because it’s a Trump-themed project in an election season wherein he is openly running as America’s first major Presidential 'crypto candidate' is shockingly out of touch and speaks volumes as to who they are and where they’re coming from,"" he continued.  PoliFi refers to political finance, a category of election-themed memecoin where ownership represents partisanship (though again, not formal affiliation), and a token's market movement reflects a candidate's chances of winning.  Despite Kraken's apparent refusal to list TRUMP, a jokey counterpart, TREMP, recently debuted on the U.S. exchange. Aside from Kraken, TREMP also trades on HTX in addition to many of the lesser-known exchanges that list TRUMP.  Kraken also lists BODEN, the Joe Biden-themed counterpart to TREMP.  'Too political'  Other exchanges told the TRUMP team that the token was ""too political"" to list, despite initially seemingly being okay with it provided certain volume targets were hit prior to listing.  In screenshots seen by CoinDesk, a representative from ByBit's listing team initially provided volume goals as a prerequisite for listing the token on the exchange.  However, later, that rep said that exchange management rejected the listing because of the potential political risk it could bring to a centralized exchange.  A ByBit spokesperson would not discuss the matter on the record.  OKX also gave the TRUMP team a similar response. In screenshots seen by CoinDesk, a member of its listing team said political meme coins were too sensitive of a topic to list.  An OKX spokesperson would not discuss listing decisions when contacted by CoinDesk.  The TRUMP team has not yet applied to be listed on HTX, the only other mainstream exchange aside from Kraken that lists the TREMP token. A spokesperson for HTX wouldn't rule out listing TRUMP when asked by CoinDesk.  ""We consider every potential project and token to list on our platform, subject to the market environment and trend,"" a HTX spokesperson told CoinDesk in a Telegram interview. ""And to be fair to every project, there is also a strict evaluation process by our listing committee.""  Down bad  All PoliFi tokens are deeply in the red after the launch of DJT, another Trump-themed token that some have claimed has the official support of the former President's campaign (though no definitive proof has been given).  DJT rallied nearly 200% Monday after reports it had the backing of Trump, though it's down 30% after the connection between DJT and the campaign continues to be questioned.  Crypto trader GiganticRebirth, once a leaderboard champion on FTX, broke a year-and-a-half tweeting hiatus to question the connection between the token and the campaign by offering to be a counterparty in a bet by convicted pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli.  At the same time, TRUMP is down over 38%, according to CoinGecko data while TREMP is in the red with a 45% on-day loss.  Bettors on Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market platform, are signaling a 16% chance that the DJT token has the backing of Trump himself or his campaign.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/18/original-trump-token-struggles-with-exchange-listings-as-djt-rockets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfe8c9fce73f961cd773c09ef8eefd5bd8d2f422-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While some analysts point to technical indicators hinting at a price surge, others warn of potential pitfalls lurking beneath the surface. Related Reading: Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess Bulls See Bullish Flags And Futures Technical analysts are a curious breed. They speak in a language of charts, patterns, and indicators, deciphering the cryptic movements of the market. One such indicator, the bullish flag pattern, has some analysts, like Gert van Lagen, cautiously optimistic. $BTC [2D] – The handle of the 3Y+ Cup with Handle itself qualifies as a bullflag targeting $127k. Price clearly has broken out of and successfully retested the flag for support.#BTC is ready for the next leg up 📈 Invalidation setup: close below$60k pic.twitter.com/5fDkeubpvT — Gert van Lagen (@GertvanLagen) June 16, 2024 This pattern suggests a potential price increase based on recent price movement, with Bitcoin consolidating within a specific range before a potential breakout. Lagen added that BTC had tested the support with success. If that’s accurate, then Bitcoin might start a bull run shortly and reach $127,000 in the upcoming weeks or months. Adding fuel to the bullish fire is the apparent dominance of buying sentiment among futures investors. Futures contracts allow investors to speculate on the future price of an asset, and in this case, it seems many are betting on Bitcoin’s rise. This could create a self-fulfilling prophecy, as increased buying drives the price up, attracting even more buyers. A Worrying Trend? Meanwhile, on-chain data, which tracks the movement of Bitcoin on the blockchain, reveals a concerning trend. There’s been a surge in deposits to exchanges, indicating investors are moving their Bitcoin to platforms where they can be easily sold. This suggests a potential selling spree on the horizon, which could put downward pressure on the price. Bitcoin Short-Term Outlook The immediate future of Bitcoin appears precariously balanced on a tightrope. Technical indicators like RSI, CMF, and MACD, which measure momentum and investor strength, are currently bearish, suggesting a continued price decline. This aligns with the prediction of some analysts who see Bitcoin potentially dipping as low as $60,000 in the coming days if the bearish trend continues. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Struggles Near $6.30 – Is Now The Time To Accumulate? However, there’s a silver lining for the bulls.

29648913,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625223,1718733643,"Bitcoin Price Drops Below Critical Support Level Following Rejection At $70,000","Bitcoin recently dropped below the critical support level between $67,000 and $68,000, having failed to break above the $70,000 price level successfully. Based on crypto analyst Josh’s analysis, the flagship crypto needs to climb above this critical support level soon enough or risk flipping into a bearish trend. Bitcoin Needs To Climb Above $68,000 Josh mentioned in a video on his YouTube channel that Bitcoin needs to achieve a confirmed breakout above $68,000 to flip bullish again and possibly experience more upside moves to the resistance levels between $72,000 and $74,000. With Bitcoin currently below $67,000, the crypto analyst noted that the area between $67,000 and $68,000 is now an area of strong resistance and one to watch out for in the short term. Bitcoin’s failure to climb above $68,000 soon enough could lead to more short-term pullbacks to between $63,000 and $64,000, an area in which Josh claimed there is a decent amount of traded volume. The crypto analyst also suggested that Bitcoin’s drop to $64,000 could happen swiftly, as he highlighted the volume profile indicator, which showed that there is little traded volume between $66,000 and $64,000. Meanwhile, Josh outlined a scenario in which Bitcoin could rise to around $67,000 to grab a large amount of liquidity and liquidate the short positions around that area. He noted that that area coincides with the resistance level between $67,000 and $68,000. As such, he warned that Bitcoin may experience a short-term bounce and then be rejected at the resistance level. He again claimed that Bitcoin would need to break above $68,000 to confirm that the pullback is over. A Massive Move On The Horizon For BTC Analyzing Bitcoin’s four-day chart, Josh stated that the Bollinger Bands are still squeezing together, which points to a “major move” coming at some point within the next few weeks. He added that the move would be volatile and that Bitcoin could potentially record a 20% to 30% price movement. On the larger time frame, Josh remarked that Bitcoin is still trading sideways and within a massive consolidation that usually occurs during a “much larger bullish trend.” As such, the analyst suggested that Bitcoin is still far from its market top despite its recent price decline. Based on predictions made by other crypto analysts, like CrediBULL Crypto, Bitcoin is still expected to rise to $100,000 in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital had also warned about these price declines amid this bull run. He stated that Bitcoin would retrace deep enough to convince anyone that the bull run is over before it resumes its uptrend. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $65,400, down 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

29647054,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625174,1718730029,"XRP, Dogecoin, & Shiba Inu All See Negative Sentiment: Signal To Buy?","Data shows social media users have been showing a negative sentiment towards XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu after their plunges in the past day. FUD Has Engulfed Traders Towards These Altcoins After The Latest Crash According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, the sentiment around XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a significant drop recently. The indicator of interest here is the “Weighted Sentiment,” which derives its value from two other metrics: Sentiment Balance and Social Volume. The first of these, the Sentiment Balance, goes through posts/threads/messages related to a specific cryptocurrency on the major social media platforms and puts them through a machine-learning model. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Crash To $60,000 If This Support Gets Lost: CryptoQuant Head This model is able to identify and separate between negative and positive posts. The Sentiment Balance then takes the difference of these posts to find a net sentiment for the market. The other relevant indicator here, the Social Volume, basically keeps track of the degree of discussion that a given asset is receiving on social media. The metric’s value represents the unique number of posts that are making at least one mention of the coin. While the Sentiment Balance on its own does tell us about what the majority sentiment on social media currently is, it doesn’t quite contain information about how many users actually share this sentiment. Activity on these platforms can fluctuate and sometimes only a few posts around the given cryptocurrency may pop up. Even if all of these posts are bullish, it’s hard to say whether they represent what the entirety of the market thinks. The Weighted Sentiment remedies this issue by taking the Sentiment Balance and weighing it against the Social Volume. With this adjustment, the indicator only reflects an overwhelming dominance in either direction when not only does the net sentiment have a high magnitude, but also a large amount of posts are circulating around the asset. Now, here is a chart that shows the recent trend in this indicator for three altcoins: XRP, DOGE, and SHIB. As displayed in the above graph, the Weighted Sentiment has recently plunged into the negative territory for all three of XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. This decline in the indicator has come as the prices of these assets have gone through a drawdown. Naturally, these negative values imply the traders on social media have become bearish towards these assets. This FUD, however, can actually turn out to be a boon for the coins. Historically, cryptocurrencies have tended to move contrary to the expectations of the majority. As such, with the Weighted Sentiment at negative levels, XRP and others could be close to hitting a bottom.

42390781,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdJqpD,1718726609,Bitcoin Hashrate May Finally Slow as Miners Face Scorching Summer Heatwaves,"Bitcoin hashrate and difficulty may fall during the North American summer months as miners curtail some of their operations.  Lower competition may provide some reprieve to miners who are already facing a profit squeeze due to the halving event, which reduced Bitcoin mining rewards by 50%.  The unrelenting growth of Bitcoin's {{BTC}} hashrate, or computing power of the network, may finally slow down, giving miners some reprieve as extreme summer heatwaves force curtailments of some operations.  Miners have seen their profit margins squeezed in an already overcrowded sector after the halving cut their mining rewards by 50% while hashrate kept hitting new all-time highs. Among the main reasons for growing hashrate: previously purchased mining rigs are coming online, and the miners have been scrambling to upgrade their fleet with more efficient rigs to stay profitable after the halving. On May 25, for example, hashrate climbed to a record high of 658 exahash per second (EH/s), according to Luxor's Hashrate Index data.  However, this unrelenting growth is poised to slow down for the next few months as North America enters the summer with is associated heat waves. Miners use extremely powerful machines that give off a lot of heat as a result of their computations. ""The number one operational challenge for Bitcoin miners is heat mitigation,"" said Blockware Intelligence analysts. ""ASICs are large, powerful computers that can reach very high temperatures without proper cooling measures in place.""  Mitigating this heat becomes an even greater issue during summertime as the companies need more power to cool their machines and/or shut down operations due to high demand from energy consumers cranking their air conditioning. ""Many miners have to curtail operations [during summer months] in part due to overheating, but also due to residential energy consumption reaching high enough levels to activate demand response clauses in miners’ power purchase agreements,"" Blockware added.  This seasonal phenomenon has resulted in lower hashrate over the past two summers and the lower hashrate means a decline in the difficulty of mining a bitcoin block. ""As we enter the summer months in the United States, we're keen to see if hot weather will force miners to curtail and thus suppress hashrate growth as we saw in 2022 and 2023,"" according to a June 17 report by Colin Harper, head of content and research at Luxor Hashrate Index.  In fact, the hashrate has already started to come down since reaching an all-time high in March. As of June 17, it is lower by 10% to 589 EH/s, according to Hashrate Index data. Since most miners are located in the U.S., particularly in steamy Texas, companies in North America shutting down their operations will likely make a dent in the hashrate growth. ""According to data from the University of Cambridge, roughly 37% of all Bitcoin mining takes place in the United States,"" said Blockware. ""As summer continues heating up, it’s reasonable to expect US-based miners to have heat-induced curtailments.""  The lower hashrate and difficulty could be a positive outcome for some miners as competition ramps down for the summer. Additionally, some miners, such as Riot Platforms (RIOT), will be able to earn extra income from the power grid by curtailing their operations as part of their power purchase contracts.  Luxor's Harper: ""If hashrate continues to stoop, then miners may be graced with a negative [difficulty] adjustment this week – here's to hoping!""

Related Reading: Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess 40% FLOCKA Disappears Before Takeoff Blockchain detectives were the first to sound the alarm. Just before FLOCKA’s official debut, a single wallet swooped in and gobbled up a staggering 40% of the entire token supply. This pre-launch land grab made crypto enthusiasts paranoid, as it hinted at potential market manipulation. The plot thickened when, immediately after launch, the same wallet began rapidly dispersing its FLOCKA holdings across a network of anonymous accounts. “Interesting how a fresh wallet funded via exchange sniped ~40% of the supply and dispersed to alt wallets,” tweeted ZachXBT, a prominent blockchain investigator. This rapid fire dispersal of tokens fueled suspicions that someone with inside information was playing the market to their advantage.

Vaiman went further, criticizing the growing trend of celebrities venturing into crypto without a firm grasp of the underlying technology or market dynamics. Waka Flocka Flame’s Past Raises Eyebrows The shadow of insider trading wasn’t the only dark cloud hanging over FLOCKA. Waka Flocka Flame’s past dalliances with the crypto world raised concerns about his motivations. According to reports, the rapper has a history of promoting questionable crypto projects, often failing to disclose that these were paid endorsements. This pattern of behavior led many to question whether FLOCKA was simply another vehicle for a quick buck, rather than a legitimate cryptocurrency with long-term potential.

42390775,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdJqKR,1718725846,"Ether ETF's Lack of Staking Won't Dampen Strong Institutional Demand, 21Shares' Ophelia Snyder Says","Lack of staking is unlikely to concern institutional investors, though retail investors may be upset, Synder said.  This difference in demand means there is a potential business case for providers to list separate, distinct products to satisfy both camps.  Institutional investors are unlikely to be concerned that U.S. spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) won't be staking the underlying token to provide extra returns, according to Ophelia Snyder, a co-founder of digital asset manager 21Shares, even though retail investors would be keen to have that built-in.  The discrepancy means there is a potential business case for providers to list separate, distinct products to satisfy both camps, Snyder told CoinDesk in an interview.  Spot ether ETFs look set to list in the U.S. in the near future after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings from applicants last month. SEC Chair Gary Gensler told senators in a budget hearing last week that final approvals should be finished in coming months. Prospective providers have removed the provisions for staking from their applications to avoid potential regulatory roadblocks.  ""One of the things that people forget is that staked assets have an impact on liquidity,"" she said. ""So, if ether's unstaking period balloons to 22 days, which does happen, how do you deal with that?""  Institutional appetite  There have been suggestions that the lack of staking may damp investor appetite for ether ETFs. JPMorgan said at the end of May that it expects $3 billion worth of inflows by the end of 2024. That figure could double if staking were permitted.  Snyder, however, doesn't think the absence of staking is an issue for institutional investors. If it were, they'd want to see a track record of asset managers executing effectively against withdrawal delays because of the intrinsic risk management that it requires, she said.  ""For example, there could be months when the unstaking period is six or nine days, and that range can be so wide, it changes your liquidity requirements,"" Snyder said. ""And it doesn't just jump from nine to 22 days. It actually slowly extends and if you monitor these things, there are data inputs that you can use to manage that portfolio such that you're doing the right things in terms of maximizing returns while minimizing the probability of a liquidity issue.""  21Shares is likely to have a handle on the institutional market. Not only is it one of the existing providers of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., it's one of the largest exchange-traded product (ETP) issuers in Europe. Its ether ETP, which includes staking, has assets under management of around $532 million. Its SOL equivalent has $821 million. The company is also applying for a U.S. spot ether ETF. That specifically excludes staking as a source of income.  There's another issue to consider too: government coffers. It is unclear how staking rewards will be treated from a tax point of view in the U.S., she said.  ""If you want institutions to come and play, you need to start by making it easy,"" she said. Non-staked products would be ""more digestible"" to an institutional audience even if they're less popular with retail investors.

The firm has raised $4 billion of convertible debt to buy bitcoin.  No other company has an active bitcoin investing strategy that can attract large amounts of capital, Bernstein said.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) is not just a software firm diversifying its corporate treasury into cryptocurrency, it is pioneering bitcoin {{BTC}} capital markets, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday.  “MSTR is the only corporate that has developed institutional demand for bitcoin linked convertibles,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  The broker notes that to date MicroStrategy has raised $4 billion of convertible debt for the solpurpose of buying more bitcoin. A convertible bond is a type of debt security that can be converted into shares. Michael Saylor’s firm currently holds 214,400 bitcoin worth about $14.5 billion. It started buying the cryptocurrency as a reserve asset in 2020. “No other corporate has an active bitcoin investing strategy that can attract capital at scale,” the authors wrote.  MicroStrategy’s long-term convertible debt strategy means it has enough time to benefit from potential bitcoin upside with limited liquidation risk to the crypto on its balance sheet, the note said.  When bitcoin rises the Virginia-based company has more room to issue new debt, conversely when the crypto falls and leverage rises, the firm can issue new shares to cut leverage, Bernstein noted.  This use of both equity and debt has seen MicroStrategy grow its bitcoin per equity share nearly 67% in the last four years, the report said.  Bernstein notes that MicroStrategy has not sold any bitcoin since it started buying the crypto in 2020, and it expects the company to continue to raise capital to add to its stash.  The broker has an outperform rating on MicroStrategy stock with a $2,890 price target. The shares erased a drop of as much as 2.5% to trade little changed around $1,509.

29642474,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625225,1718721047,"Bitcoin, Solana Suffer As Institutional Investors Pull $600 Million Out Of Crypto Funds","Crypto funds witnessed outflows last week after recording five weeks of consecutive inflows. According to CoinShares data, digital asset funds saw $600 million in net outflows for the week ending June 14. The outflows were concentrated in Bitcoin and Solana funds, which saw $621 million and $0.2 million exits, respectively. These outflows come amidst a corresponding drop in the price of Bitcoin throughout the week and a more hawkish-than-expected Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held during the week. Crypto Funds Bleed Largest Since March, With Bitcoin In The Lead Crypto funds witnessed outflows of $600 million last week after an intense $2 billion inflow in the prior week, bringing a recent $4.35 billion inflow run over five weeks to an end. The outflow recorded, according to CoinShares data, was the largest since March 22, 2024, and it occurred under comparable circumstances. Notably, the outflow ending March 22 came after a period of significant inflows totaling $3 billion in the week prior. Investors had to pull out their exposure to more stable assets due to the outcome of the FOMC meeting. The FOMC held its most recent meeting on June 11 and 12, 2024, holding interest rates at 5.25%-5.50%, leading many crypto investors to pull out. Crypto is seen as a risky, speculative asset, and so it is only natural for investors to move into safer havens considering the high interest rate. Unsurprisingly, most of the outflows came from Bitcoin, with crypto funds of the leading crypto asset losing about $621 million. Furthermore, the majority of this Bitcoin outflow was registered in Spot Bitcoin ETFs trading in the US. According to data, Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed outflows every day last week, save for a $100.8 million inflow on June 12. As a result, these Bitcoin ETFs registered a total of $580 million in outflows last week. The negative Bitcoin investor sentiment was also reflected in short Bitcoin products receiving $1.8 million worth of inflows. Solana, which also had a rough week in terms of price action, recorded $0.2 million of outflows in its investment products. In addition, multi-asset investment products experienced outflows amounting to $1.1 million. Trading volume averaged around $11 billion for the week, well below the $22 billion weekly average for the year. These outflows and little trading volume saw the total assets under management (AuM) fall from over $100 billion to $94 billion over the week. On the other hand, Ethereum received $13.1 million in outflows as investor interests continued to grow in anticipation of the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs. BNB, Litecoin, XRP, Chainlink, and Cardano also witnessed inflows of $0.3 million, $0.8 million, $1.1 million, $0.7 million, and $0.8 million, respectively.

The comment also comes just days after cryptocurrency startup funding surpassed a total of $100B, according to data from aggregator DeFiLlama. ""52M own crypto assets, that’s one in six Americans,” John Hoffman, managing director of distribution & partnerships at Grayscale, said at the Seeking Alpha Investing Summit on Tuesday, and predicted that ""over the next 20 years"" crypto is ""going to be in every portfolio."" The question isn’t whether crypto is going to stay, but rather what it is going to look like in the future, Hoffman said, adding that it was ""not going away."" The total crypto market cap currently stands at $2.32T, according to CoinMarketCap . The growth of crypto can be seen by the infrastructure that is being laid out and the institutional flow of capital into the segment, Chris Kuiper, director of research at Fidelity Digital Assets, added at the Seeking Alpha Investing Summit. At the start of this year, the crypto industry received a shot in the arm from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's long-awaited approval of spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exchange-traded products. Not long after, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a record high north of $73,000 in March, though it has since retreated after its last halving on April 19, 2024. Halving events reduce the rate at which new coins are created and thus lower the available amount of new supply.

Infineo, a company that focuses on blockchain-based life insurances, said Tuesday that it has transferred the ""first-ever"" tokenized life insurance policy on distributed ledger system. The firm minted a total of $9.4 million worth of policies using the Provenance network, according to a press release reviewed by CoinDesk.  The policies were tokenized with Provenance Blockchain Labs, the ecosystem development organization behind the Provenance network. Infineo said it is also developing secondary markets for tokenized policies that enable peer-to-peer transactions and new offerings backed by tokenized life insurances.  Infineo's minting happened as traditional capital markets and crypto are becoming increasingly intertwined, with institutions placing old-school financial products like credit, bonds and private equity on blockchain networks in the form of tokens. The process is often referred to as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), and a Bank of America report said it could transform and disrupt legacy financial systems. Participants hope that tokenization could create more efficient systems, speed up settlements and increase transparency.  ""The digitization of life insurance policies not only unlocks global accessibility to life insurance, but also delivers efficiencies and cost savings for industry stakeholders at every point along the value chain,"" infineo founder and CEO Cole Snell, said in a statement.  Infineo said the $3 trillion life insurance market could benefit from using blockchain rails, for example by protecting policy holders and beneficiaries from more than $7 billion worth of unclaimed benefits.  Provenance hosts more than $7 billion worth of active home equity lines of credit, rwa.xyz data shows, and has a $13 billion of total value locked (TVL) on the chain, according to Provenance's website.

Within just 12 hours of Hoskinson‘s post on X, NIKE’s market capitalization soared close to $1 million, underscoring the volatile and often unpredictable crypto market dynamics. Cardano Founder Sparks New Memecoin The genesis of the NIKE token was a simple, casual tweet by Hoskinson, featuring his pet pig, Nike. The tweet rapidly captured the imagination of the Cardano community, leading to the creation of a new memecoin named NIKE. Fun Fact: I have a pig named Nike pic.twitter.com/53KeeYD1Sf — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 17, 2024 Within hours of its introduction, NIKE exhibited an astonishing surge in its valuation. According to data from TapTools, the token’s price quickly escalated. Trading metrics painted a picture of frenetic activity: the token’s price increased by an unprecedented 60,200% when it reached $0,00089. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Lists The Cardano Developments That Will Drive ADA Price To $3 In 2024 The market’s reception to NIKE has been vibrant, with the token swiftly climbing the ranks to become one of the most actively traded within the Cardano ecosystem. As per the latest metrics by taptools.io, NIKE’s 24-hour trading volume stood at $616,000, featuring 2,304 buys and 1,432 sells. The buy volume reached $316,955 while the sell volume was slightly lower at $284,505, indicating a robust but balanced trading interest. Liquidity figures were equally compelling, with the token maintaining a pool of $47,900. The largest NIKE token holder commands a significant 19.37% of the total supply, a factor that adds a layer of risk concerning potential price manipulation or future sell-offs. This trader is followed by holders with 5.58%, 3.35% and 2.93% respectively of the 1 billion token supply. Currently, there are 668 holders of NIKE. The rapid ascent of NIKE has elicited a spectrum of reactions from the crypto community. While some enthusiasts are optimistic about the playful engagement and the potential for profit, others express concern about the speculative nature of such developments. Related Reading: Cardano and MultiversX Attend Launch Of Web3 Initiative In Geneva With Launch of Lightningbox One user commented on the phenomenon, noting, “This is everything that’s wrong with Crypto and why a lot of people will never feel comfortable investing in it.” Another user jokingly asked: “What other animals do you have?”, which would probably have initiated the creation of another memecoin if the farm owner Hoskinson had replied. Hoskinson expressed his shock and wrote via X, “I’m at a loss that a picture of my pig has resulted in a memecoin that is nearly at a million dollars in under 12 hours.” I’m at a loss that a picture of my pig has resulted in a memecoin that is nearly at a million dollars in under 12 hours. pic.twitter.com/Hzhe0qjkI0 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 18, 2024 As NIKE continues to garner attention and trading volume, it could potentially pose a challenge to SNEK, the previously dominant memecoin in the Cardano ecosystem with a market cap of $74 million.

If monetized, its crypto assets have the potential to confer to it a much higher value than revenues derived from software products. However, assigning a value based on Bitcoin comes with risks, and this is why it is also important to be equipped with an exit strategy. These risks emanate mostly from the miners adjusting to the post-halving landscape while facing high difficulty. Since I last covered MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) in October 2020, it has gained 800%. Two reasons for being bullish were the benefits from digital transformation for its BI (business intelligence) software products and accumulating Bitcoins ( BTC-USD ). The chart below shows that it is up by more than 900% as Michael Sailors' company represented a viable option for investors wanting exposure to the cryptocurrency without needing to open a digital wallet account at one of the crypto exchanges, but things have changed. Data by YCharts Today, there are eleven new spot ETFs approved by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in January in addition to others dealing with futures, implying competition. Still, based on the value of Bitcoins it has amassed and comparison with other investment vehicles, this thesis aims to show that MicroStrategy is a buying opportunity. However, it is preferable to first wait for the period of volatility to elapse, and, in the spirit of risk aversion, I also elaborate on an exit strategy. First, for a company trading at nearly 46 times trailing sales, it is important to check finances. Decreasing Revenues, Profits and Cash Flow Since 2020, revenue progressed to reach the $510 million mark in 2022 as a result of its BI tools getting traction from the Covid pandemic. However, since then, revenues have come down slightly in a highly competitive analytics marketplace place where there has also been a lot of industry consolidation with Salesforce ( CRM ) acquiring Tableau in 2019. Data by YCharts Moreover, there is also Microsoft ( MSFT ) with PowerBI or SAP SE ( SAP ) with Business Objects, without forgetting Oracle ( ORCL ) taking advantage of its database strength to offer analytics solutions. Still, despite facing such fierce competition from giant players, the company has not suffered from an erosion of its market share, and this is mostly due to analytics being a sticky business, making it difficult for customers to switch. Furthermore, MicroStrategy prioritized a cloud strategy since 2020 to provide more flexibility to customers wishing to opt for subscription models certainly helped. This timely transition away from the complex licensing model to monthly subscriptions was key to its survival as a software play. Looking forward, it has invested in an AI Bot for enterprise analytics, but this does not automatically mean a boost in sales as competitors have also enhanced their products. Moreover, as shown in the charts above, both operating income and cash flow from operations have declined, which reduces the stock's attractiveness for those wanting to invest purely because of the IT. Remains a Valid Investment due to Bitcoins However, the market has shown that MicroStrategy remains a valid investment, even after the issue of new ETFs including popular ones like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) which has accumulated $20 billion in assets under management about six months after launch and the presence of leveraged ones like the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ). Hence, as charted below, the IT company has outperformed them all, and by more than 100%. Data by YCharts Therefore, despite commanding such a high valuation, it seems to be trusted by investors because of crypto. Now as per its first quarter 2024 financial results, it held 214,400 coins which cost $7.54 billion based on a per unit price of $35.18K, but when multiplied with the current price of $65K totals $13.94 billion as per the table below. Table prepared using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) This culminates in a profit of $6.4 billion, enough to repay its debt of $3.62 billion , which was contracted mostly to buy crypto. Now, some will argue that its shares outstanding have increased by around $10 million to $17.7 million as a result of equity offerings again to fund the purchase of crypto. This represents 77% more shares outstanding but in the meantime, far from seeing a stock sell-off as is normally the case for companies seeing little growth and ballooning debt, it appreciated by 800%. Data by YCharts This may explain why, despite a major disconnect between the income level and valuations, investors seem to be willing to pay a premium for the company’s capital allocation strategy over the last four years, in the way it has used its cash flow, debt, and equity sales to boost its crypto assets. Hence, it becomes important to value the company accordingly. Valuing MicroStrategy based on Crypto Considering it sells only half its Bitcoin, it will obtain about $6.97 billion, and dividing by the total shares outstanding of 17.74 million, this comes to a sales per share of $398.83. Further dividing the share price by this figure leads to a price-to-sales ratio of 3.81x, higher than the 3.48x when I covered the stock in 2020, but this was based only on IT sales, whereas now it has over 200K Bitcoins. Table prepared using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) Now, comparing 3.81x with the wider IT sector median of 2.97x would again fail to factor in the value of MicroStrategy's Bitcoin reserves, which, if monetized, could generate a much higher revenue than BI products. Hence, a more suitable comparison would be with Bitcoin miners, which HODL or hold Bitcoins for hard times instead of selling all of their produce. This is illustrated in the table below and even when compared with lower-valued Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) which owns 9,084 Bitcoins (end of May), the company is undervalued by 48%. Applying only a 24% upside due to the risk factors I elaborate upon below, I obtained a target of $1,771 based on the current share price of $1,329. This target is slightly below the peak reached on March 15 before the halving period. Comparing with peers (seekingalpha.com) Switching to risk-off mode, the Bitcoin halving event that occurred on April 19 impacted the profitability of miners, who play an essential role in the Bitcoin ecosystem by devoting the computing power of their mining rigs to validate transactions in the form of new blocks which are then added to the blockchain on which the cryptocurrency is based. The Risks as Miners Adjust, and an Exit Strategy After this event, the reward obtained by miners was reduced in half while mining difficulty increased considerably, implying it takes more time to add a block to the blockchain. This means that except for a few larger miners already invested in equipment to rapidly add additional hash rates (or production capacity), most will obtain lower revenues while at the same time, their operational expenses remain about the same, implying lower profits. At the same time, borrowing costs remain high . In these circumstances, they have to dispose of more of their HODLed coins, as Bitcoin prices remain below $70K, a possibility confirmed by CryptoQuant which says that selling reached a two-month high in the first half of June. This, in turn, creates more supply in the market, pressuring prices while at the same time, demand for Bitcoins from fund managers of the newly launched ETFs has moderated compared to January. Hence, except for IBIT, most funds have seen net outflows or more investors selling shares than buying. Lower demand for Bitcoin could also be due to some investors diversifying away to Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) after the SEC approved ETFs. Furthermore, just like for equities and bonds, another factor that affects the performance of Bitcoin-linked assets is whether interest rates are likely to be cut in the near term. This explains the reasons for the $600 million of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs last week, coinciding with hints by a key U.S. Reserve Bank official that the fight against inflation is not over. Therefore, the pains could continue and for those holding the stock and looking for an exit price, the company should break even at a Bitcoin average cost price of $35.18K , which is about 30K less than what the cryptocurrency is trading currently. However, this does not consider the debt of $3.62 billion, and, after accounting for leverage, I arrive at a higher break-even Bitcoin price of $52K. Table prepared using data from Therefore, for risk-averse investors wondering when it is time to exit, this is a level to monitor as monetary policy remains tight and miners adjust, with some predicting that at the current liquidation level, BTC's price could drop to $62.5K. However, there are two strong positives for the long term. Bullish For the Long term First, the halving went off without a hitch, once again showing the smooth functioning and resilience of Bitcoin as a decentralized blockchain or one that does need supervision by a central authority. Second, there is the demand-supply equation, which favors higher prices. In this case, with halvings occurring approximately every four years, more than 19 million coins have already been put into circulation out of the total of 21 million programmed. This means that less than 10% of supply is left. As for demand, previous halvings were followed by a sharp rise in the price of bitcoin in the following months, such as in 2021 when it surged by more than 350% post the 2020 halving as seen by the spike in MicroStrategy's share price in the introductory chart. However, this price action has not been replicated this time as Bitcoin had already appreciated by 300% from January 2023 to April this year, due mostly to the enthusiasm around the approval of spot ETFs and the impending halving event, with Bitcoin flirting with $74K in mid-March reaching a new record. Now, the price of Bitcoin staying below $70K pressurizes the profitability of miners, causing some of them to stop their activities, a phenomenon referred to as miner capitulation which may be why the hash rate (overall production capacity) has also come down to around 600, from 700 as charted below. Now since the mining process remains a highly competitive one, this in turn reduces mining difficulty which has now descended to 83.72 from its peak of 88 as shown below. Data by YCharts This increases the chances that active see lower production costs, in turn reducing the pressure to sell Bitcoins to finance operations. Thus, with a lower supply, asset prices can eventually stabilize and even rise depending on demand status. Finally, the stock could potentially appreciate by 24% based on its selling just half of its Bitcoin reserves, while investors seem to favor Michael Sailor's strategy over other investment vehicles tracking crypto. However, this thesis is subject to risks, especially a fall in asset prices which would considerably devalue MicroStrategy's assets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699799-microstrategy-upside-potential-but-wait-for-miners-to-adjust?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29638867.jpeg

Overall, crypto longs lost over $440 million as profit-taking and dollar strength weighed on the market, traders said. Open interest, or the number of unsettled futures bets, has dropped 16% to $600 million. Meanwhile, a long-short ratio tracking DOGE futures shows traders are positioning for further declines, with the ratio at 0.94 – indicating a bearish bias.  Layer-2 blockchain ZKsync kicked off its airdrop on Monday, with 45% of the tokens claimed in under two hours. The ZK token opened at $0.31 and is down about 32% since then, according to CoinGecko data. The market capitalization stands at about $800 million, based on the circulating supply, with about 3.7 billion tokens eligible to be distributed. On a fully diluted basis, the market cap would be $4.5 billion. Cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, Bybit and KuCoin have currently listed the ZK token, even though Binance had said it would postpone the listing after experiencing tech issues with its node.

MicroStrategy's software business valuation has surged to $16.6 billion from just $1.79 billion one year ago, raising concerns. Insider sales of MicroStrategy stock, along with liquidity issues surrounding its Bitcoin holdings, suggest a ""Sell"" recommendation at this time. MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR) (""MicroStrategy"") has been widely considered as an investment vehicle to gain leveraged exposure to Bitcoin. However, the recent rise in MicroStrategy's stock price has resulted in a decoupling from its Bitcoin holdings, suggesting an overvaluation of MicroStrategy's software business. As a result, I recommend a ""Sell"" at this time on MicroStrategy's stock. Introduction Founded in 1989 in the United States, MicroStrategy has been providing enterprise analytics software solutions to various sectors in multiple countries (mainly the United States) for the past 30 years. Its software business is performing well and steadily, but not exceptionally compared to other tech giants of the world. MicroStrategy has been cash-flow-positive for many years. However, MicroStrategy seemed to be limited in its growth potential and had to allocate excess cash to either repurchase its common stock or invest in other marketable securities. Between 2014 and 2019, MicroStrategy generated about $340 million in cash from operations. With this excess cash, including the funds that were already on hand in 2014, MicroStrategy purchased about $320 million in other marketable securities and repurchased about $180 million worth of its common stock. MicroStrategy turned almost into an asset management company. In its 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, MicroStrategy's investment income was $12 million and $11 million respectively, while its operating income from the software business was only an income of $4 million and a loss of $1 million respectively. Then, the strategic pivot came in August 2020 when MicroStrategy decided to focus on Bitcoin rather than repurchasing its common stock or other marketable securities with excess cash. In addition, MicroStrategy went all out to raise funds specifically for the acquisition of bitcoins. As a result, in 2019 and 2020, MicroStrategy sold off its investment portfolio for a total of $474 million, raised $497 million in debt, and issued $154 million worth of common stocks to purchase the initial tranche of bitcoins worth $1.125 billion in 2020. MicroStrategy was quite lucky that it started acquiring Bitcoin immediately after the previous halving event around May 2020 and the price of Bitcoin was rising sharply. From August 2020 to December 2020, the price of Bitcoin tripled from about $10,000 each to about $30,000 each. With this windfall and the heightened attention (free marketing) MicroStrategy received from the world, MicroStrategy doubled down on its Bitcoin strategy. In 2021, MicroStrategy raised about $2.6 billion in debt and equity and purchased $2.63 billion worth of bitcoins. From there on, MicroStrategy's business became intertwined with Bitcoin. Its software business's valuation starts to fluctuate based on the price of Bitcoin. 31-Mar-24 31-Dec-23 31-Dec-22 31-Dec-21 31-Dec-20 31-Dec-19 31-Dec-18 Market Capitalization (Billions) 28.34 11.20 1.60 6.23 3.60 1.44 1.35 Number of Bitcoins Held 214,278.00 189,150.00 132,500.00 124,391.00 70,469.00 - - Bitcoin Price 71,333.65 42,265.19 16,547.50 46,306.45 29,001.72 N/A N/A Long-Term Debt Used to Acquire Bitcoin (Billions) 3.56 2.18 2.38 2.16 0.50 - - Bitcoin Holdings Value (Billions) 11.73 5.81 - 0.19 3.60 1.54 - - Software Business Value 16.61 5.39 1.79 2.63 2.06 1.44 1.35 Cash from Operations (Millions) 28.6 12.70 3.20 93.80 53.60 60.90 10.60 Multiple Over Cash Flows N/A 424.06 N/A 28.04 38.36 23.65 127.36 EBITDA without Bitcoin (Millions) - 9.80 0.90 10.30 46.10 57.10 - 1.00 4.00 Multiple Over EBITDA N/A 5,983.93 N/A 57.05 36.01 N/A 337.50 On December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2019, MicroStrategy's software business was valued at about $1.4 billion as shown above. After the pivot into Bitcoin, without substantial change, its software business was valued at about $2.06 billion on December 31, 2020, and $2.63 billion on December 31, 2021. In 2021 and 2020, MicroStrategy spent about $160 million and $149 million in sales and marketing while generating similar levels of revenue ($511 million in 2021 and $481 million in 2020). As a result, compared to $191 million and $206 million spent on sales and marketing in 2019 and 2018, MicroStrategy was able to generate more cash from operations ($54 million in 2020 and $94 million in 2021). However, this marketing effect goes both ways. In 2022, when the price of Bitcoin was declining drastically, MicroStrategy's revenue declined, too. In 2022, MicroStrategy only generated $3 million in cash from operations as seen in the table above. It could be said that due to the heightened market attention, MicroStrategy generated more revenue with fewer sales and marketing dollars spent, which helped increase its software business' valuation. Current Valuation of MicroStrategy's Software Business Now let's look at what's happening recently with MicroStrategy. Another Bitcoin halving event just took place in April 2024, pushing the price of Bitcoin to its historical high. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, MicroStrategy generated just $12.7 million in cash from operations. For 2024 Q1, MicroStrategy generated about $3.9 million in cash from operations, which is similar to prior years for its software business. Revenue for 2024 Q1 declined slightly from $122 million to $115 million compared to the same quarter last year. Its gross profits and operating income from the software business declined accordingly. When diving deeper into its revenue composition, it appears that its Product Licenses revenue dropped sharply while its Subscription Revenue increased. As explained by MicroStrategy's management, this is due to MicroStrategy's push to convert customers from a perpetual Product Licenses model to a cloud-based subscription model. While the way that MicroStrategy charges its customers may be different, the business fundamentals for its software business remain the same. However, the value of MicroStrategy's software business has exploded to $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, and $16.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, led by the rise in Bitcoin price. While MicroStrategy's software business headcount went down from 2,123 employees on March 31, 2023, to 1,851 on March 31, 2024 (a 13% headcount decrease) with lower revenue, profitability, and uncertainty on the change to the subscription model, it seems quite unreasonable to believe that the software business is worth $16.6 billion at this time compared to $1.79 billion just about one year ago. It may be reasonable to justify the valuation of MicroStrategy's software business back in 2021 and 2020 due to the marketing effect of the Bitcoin strategy, I am not certain the multiple of 424 times (as shown in the table above) cash from operations as of December 31, 2023, can be justified at this time. It appears that the higher Bitcoin's price rises, the higher the market values MicroStrategy's software business. As of March 31, 2024, MicroStrategy held 214,278 bitcoins in total, quite remarkable indeed, representing over 1% of total bitcoins mined to date. MicroStrategy is still raising funds to purchase more bitcoins. In 2024 Q1, MicroStrategy raised $782 million in proceeds from the 2030 Convertible Notes and $592 million in proceeds from the 2031 Convertible Notes. Then in 2024 Q2, MicroStrategy is looking to raise another $700 million in proceeds from the 2032 Convertible Notes. Together with the issuance of some common stock, this is about $2.35 billion worth of bitcoins (about 34,000 bitcoins or 15% of the bitcoins owned so far) added to MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings in 2024 Q1 and Q2 alone. $2.35 billion is such a large amount of funds that when poured into the market, it should have some level of influence over the price of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin's price keeps rising, its software business would likely increase further in valuation, providing MicroStrategy with the ability to raise more funds to purchase more bitcoins. However, without significant change to MicroStrategy's software business, when Bitcoin's price starts to decline, MicroStrategy would be in trouble, likely more severe than what happened in 2022. Insider Sale In 2024 Q1 and Q2, MicroStrategy insiders have been selling a significant number of shares, much more than in 2021. In 2022, when bitcoin price and MicroStrategy's stock price were low, there was no insider sale of stock at all. This is an indicator that the management team believes that MicroStrategy may be overvalued at this time. www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MSTR/insider-trades/ MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Liquidity Even though MicroStrategy has $11.73 billion (as shown in the table above) worth of bitcoins net of the long-term debt, the $11.73 billion bitcoin is far from liquid. MicroStrategy has received so much attention on its long-term view of Bitcoin and its commitment to never sell Bitcoin . The moment MicroStrategy starts to liquidate Bitcoin, it may trigger a collapse in Bitcoin price. Given the transparency on any bitcoin-related activities, even if MicroStrategy wants to liquidate its bitcoin holdings, it may not be able to realize the full $11.73 billion. Conclusion While MicroStrategy's pivot to Bitcoin initially yielded significant gains and attracted market attention, the recent decoupling of its stock price from Bitcoin's value signals a significant overvaluation of its software business. Despite being profitable, MicroStrategy's software business has not had significant growth or fundamental change warranting such an increase in its valuation. With insiders selling a large volume of shares in the past several months and the potential liquidity issues surrounding its Bitcoin holdings, the current valuation appears unsustainable. As a result, I recommend a ""Sell"" on MicroStrategy's stock at this time.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699795-microstrategy-valuation-significantly-decoupled-from-its-bitcoin-holdings?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29638010.jpeg

42390765,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdJpaH,1718712000,"Renzo Capitalizes on Restaking Frenzy to Raise $17M From Galaxy, Brevan Howard","Liquid restaking protocol Renzo shared Tuesday that it has raised $17 million in a funding round, according to a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk.  The fresh capital, which took place over two rounds, was led by Galaxy Ventures in the first round and by Brevan Howard Digital Nova Fund in the second. Funds will be used towards expanding the project's restaking services, including adding support for ERC-20 tokens.  Renzo is part of a new class of “restaking” protocols built on EigenLayer, which takes users' ether (ETH) tokens, deposited or ""staked"" as security on the Ethereum blockchain, and then repurposes them to secure additional networks, known as “actively validated services,” or AVSs.  Renzo, which describes itself as a ""liquid derivative platform built on EigenLayer,"" serving as the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem by securing AVSs and offering a higher yield than ETH, according the project's documentation. ""For every liquid staking token or ETH deposited on Renzo, it mints an equivalent amount of Renzo’s liquid restaking token, ezETH, in return,"" the documentation reads.  The latest trend in restaking is that users can now stake their ERC-20 tokens too, which are tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. EigenLayer previously shared that they would start accepting their EIGEN token, which is an ERC-20, to secure its in-house AVS, EigenDA.  Restaking competitor Symbiotic also shared that it would accept Ethena Labs’ $ENA and $USDe, which are ERC-20 tokens.  Lucas Kozinski, founding contributor of Renzo, said in an interview over Telegram that this is part of a wider trend, and that restaking is also starting to peep into the Bitcoin ecosystem and non-EVM chains.  “EigenLayer pioneered native ETH restaking, which is now expanding into other assets including $EIGEN to secure EigenDA,"" Kozinski told CoinDesk. ""The use of ERC-20s for restaking is opening the door for other liquid restaking tokens to join alongside $ezETH.”  The fundraising announcement comes two months after Renzo released an airdrop for its $REZ token, in which 9.5% was distributed to its community. The whole communication allocation is 32%.

29636972,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625181,1718710232,Potential Downtrend In Play? TON Struggles As Price Falls Below $7.7,"TON has experienced a dramatic price shift, falling below $7.7 three days after reaching an all-time high of $8.2. This sudden decline has caught the attention of investors and market analysts, raising concerns and sparking discussions about the potential implications of this sharp reversal. It also follows a period of intense volatility and highlights the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. With TON’s price trajectory undergoing significant fluctuations, it’s essential to examine the factors contributing to this downturn and explore what this could mean for the future of TON and its investors. This article delves into an analysis of the recent price movements and potential outcomes of TON’s sudden drop after setting a record high. As of the time of writing, TON has a market capitalization of over $18 billion, a trading volume of over $472 million, and a price drop of 4.03%, trading at around $7.3 over the past 24 hours. Despite a decline of 5.77% in market capitalization, the trading volume for TON is up by 40.90%. Market Volatility And Recent Price Movements For TON On the 4-hour chart, TON is currently attempting a break below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) after it has successfully broken the $7.7 support mark. A careful examination of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator indicator suggests that TON may actively go bearish as the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are attempting to cross below the zero line. Meanwhile, on the 1-day chart, TON’s price is currently declining toward the $6.7 support mark. It can be observed here that after TON hit its all-time high of $8.2, the crypto asset has been dropping down with strong bearish momentum candlesticks. Additionally, the signal line and SMA of the Composite trend oscillator indicator on the 1-day chart are currently trending in the overbought section, with the signal line attempting a cross below the SMA, indicating a bearish move could be on the horizon. Thus from the 4-hour and 1-day price actions and formation of the indicator used for this analysis, it can be suggested that the price of TON may actively go bearish. Technical Analysis: Key Support And Resistance Levels TON’s abrupt fall below $7.7 after reaching an all-time high of $8.2 underscores the inherent volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. Consequently, if the price of TON continues to move downward below the 100-day SMA toward the $6.7 support level and breaks below it, it may decline further to challenge the $6.05 support level. However, if TON’s price fails to break below the $6.7 support mark, it will begin to ascend toward the $7.7 resistance level again. TON could ascend further to challenge the $8.2 resistance mark and possibly move on to set a new high if this level is breached.

Google Trends shows peak public interest in AI.  Spikes in crypto-related Google search queries have historically occurred at major market tops, validating legendary investor Warren Buffet's mantra of buying in doom and selling in boom. A similar dynamic now seems to be playing out in the market for tokens supposedly related to artificial intelligence (AI).  The so-called AI coins like FET, RNDR, TAO and GRT have seen their market value slide by as much as 30% in the past seven days, according to data source Coingecko, just as Google Trends indicates search interest in artificial intelligence may have peaked.  FET is the fourth-worst performing of the top 100 cryptocurrencies of the past seven days. Market leader bitcoin {{BTC}} is down just 2.8% during the same period while the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, has lost 6%.  Google Trends is widely used to gauge general or retail investor interest in trending topics. It shows the value for the search query ""AI"" over the past 12 months reached a peak of 100 last week. That's the same as the value of the past five years. A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for the query during a given time frame.  In other words, the excitement about artificial intelligence has hit the main street, and an increasing number of existing and potential retail investors are looking for information about it and Nasdaq-listed chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things AI.  Though only indicative, the tool may be a good indicator to watch as the masses are often driven by emotions and frequently the last to enter a bull market and exit a bear market. For instance, spikes in searches for BTC and Solana's SOL occurred at the respective price tops in May 2021 and November 2021, respectively.  It's crucial to note that bitcoin, known to have a strong positive correlation with NVDA, bottomed out with technology stocks in late 2022 after the debut of ChatGPT raised general awareness about artificial intelligence. According to GMO's Chief Investment Strategist Jeremy Grantham, the AI rally represents a potential bubble within a bubble that could soon deflate.

29634149,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625146,1718704805,"From Cheers To Tears: Beercoin (BEER) Dries Up, Loses 70% Of Its Value","Beercoin, the effervescent Solana-based meme coin that promised a taste of financial freedom, is experiencing a hangover of epic proportions. After a meteoric rise in price earlier this month, Beercoin has come crashing down, plummeting by nearly 70% in a matter of days. This dramatic decline reflects a confluence of factors, including a broader crypto market correction, a hawkish Federal Reserve stance, and a concerning trend of insider selling. Related Reading: Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess Fed Tightens The Taps The Federal Reserve’s recent decision to adopt a more hawkish monetary policy, prioritizing inflation control over economic stimulus, has cast a dark cloud over the entire cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the bellwether of the industry, dipped below $66,000 this week, dragging most altcoins down with it. This shift in central bank policy is particularly detrimental to highly speculative assets like meme coins, which thrive on easy money and investor exuberance. Meme coins, often lacking real-world utility or established fundamentals, are seen as the first to be dumped when risk aversion creeps into the market. Whales Jump Ship Adding fuel to the fire of Beercoin’s descent is a troubling trend of insider selling. Onchain analysis by LookOnChain revealed that several individuals with significant holdings, likely early investors who acquired Beercoin at a discount during pre-sales, have recently cashed out in large quantities. Another wallet related to the #beercoin team sold 5.43B $BEER for $1.13M! Although it has been transferred many times, we traced that the wallet received $BEER directly from the #beercoin team wallet “7yfvQX…o9v394” and “8VY4LF…fDd5G2”.https://t.co/vElDToYi5C pic.twitter.com/oYp41d3Naz — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 16, 2024 This mass exodus by insiders, who presumably possess a deeper understanding of Beercoin’s potential or limitations, raises serious red flags for retail investors. Their actions can be interpreted as a loss of confidence in the project, potentially signaling that Beercoin may not be the golden ticket to riches it was initially touted to be. Technical Indicators: Frothy Future Technical analysis, the study of price charts and historical data to predict future market movements, paints a similarly grim picture for Beercoin. The token has not only fallen below a key support level, but it also continues to trade beneath crucial moving averages, technical indicators used to gauge momentum and identify potential trend reversals. BEER Price Prediction Meanwhile, the current BEER price prediction suggests a significant upward trajectory, anticipating a 220% increase to $0.0₁₀5119 by July 18, 2024. Despite this optimistic forecast, technical indicators show a bearish sentiment, indicating potential caution among investors. The Fear & Greed Index is at 74, which denotes high levels of greed in the market, suggesting that the current bullish outlook may be driven by overenthusiastic sentiment rather than solid fundamentals. Related Reading: XRP Whale Goes On Shopping Spree: 27 Million Coins Snapped Up As Price Dips Over the past 30 days, BEER has experienced an unusual trend, recording 100% green days with zero price volatility, an anomaly in typical market behavior.

The liquidations occurred as DOGE prices dropped over 10%, reflecting broader market sell-offs and a bearish sentiment in the crypto market.  Bullish bets on dogecoin {{DOGE}} futures fared worse than their bitcoin {{BTC}} counterparts on Monday, unusually, as a slide in the dog-themed meme token liquidated $60 million in long trades.  The DOGE price slumped more than 10%, before briefly recovering amid a sell-off in major tokens and bitcoin in Asian trading hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, has dropped 3.4% in the past 24 hours.  BTC long bets lost $47 million in the same period. Ether {{ETH}} bullish bets lost the most, however, at $76 million. Overall, crypto longs lost over $440 million as profit-taking and dollar strength weighed on the market, traders said Tuesday.  ""The meme coin market has experienced a general pullback this month as bitcoin prices face pressure,"" said Lucy Hu, a senior analyst at Metalpha. ""The expectation of one rate cut by the Fed has prompted investors to divert from risky assets to less risky ones, and DOGE may suffer as one of the largest meme coins on the market.""  Coinanlyze data shows that almost all the DOGE liquidation activity in the past 24 hours came from longs, or bets on higher prices. Only about $600,000 worth of shorts, or bets against the token, were liquidated.  The figures are the highest for DOGE futures since May 2021, the data shows. Over $44 million of the liquidations occurred on Huobi, a crypto exchange popular with Asia-based traders.  Open interest, or the number of unsettled futures bets, has dropped 16% to $600 million. Meanwhile, a long-short ratio tracking DOGE futures shows traders are positioning for further declines with the ratio at 0.94 – indicating a bearish bias.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin.

29632237,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625144,1718701205,XRP Set For Monumental Rally: Analyst Points To Extremely Rare Signal,"The latest chart analysis by crypto analyst @Cryptobilbuwoo0, published via X, offers a compelling narrative for XRP’s potential upward trajectory when juxtaposed against the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. The analyst emphasizes key technical indicators and historical patterns, suggesting that XRP might be on the brink of a significant bullish phase. XRP Price Poised To “Bounce” The XRP/Total chart primarily illustrates a descending trajectory that began forming from its early 2018 peak. This overarching downtrend is marked by successive lower highs that articulate a consistent descending trendline. Moreover, @Cryptobilbuwoo0 highlights the ‘Bounce Back Line,’ a horizontal support line that has historically acted as a crucial reversal point for the XRP price action. The chart shows several instances where the price of XRP, upon reaching this line, has rebounded dramatically. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rally 102,590% To $500, But There’s A Catch The last instance of XRP interacting with the “Bounce Back Line” was on December 28, 2020. Following this touchpoint, the price soared over 1,100%, climbing from $0.18 to $2. Earlier, on February 27, 2017, XRP escalated from just under $0.02 to $3.35 within 10 months. Currently, XRP is once again nearing the “Bounce Back Line.” Given the historic outcomes following support from this level, the analyst predicts another significant rally may be on the horizon. The chart analysis further deepens with a nuanced look at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Wavetrend Indicator (WT Krypt), which are pivotal to understanding the market’s momentum and potential reversals. The 14-day RSI is currently nearing 31, approaching the oversold territory which historically signals a buying opportunity or a trend reversal. This is evident in the past markings on the chart, where similar RSI levels have coincided with the “Bounce Back Line” and substantial upward price movements. The Wavetrend Indicator, used for spotting the start and end of cycles in the cryptocurrency’s price, has shown several bullish signs. Bullish divergences have been a critical focus, occurring when the price of XRP makes new lows while the indicator does not follow suit, suggesting a decrease in downward momentum. Moreover, the recent crossover of the Wavetrend lines (red crossing over blue) is typically interpreted as a bullish entry signal, indicating potential upward price movement. Related Reading: XRP Whale Goes On Shopping Spree: 27 Million Coins Snapped Up As Price Dips In addition to the primary indicators, the analyst has annotated the chart with past price actions and highlighted areas and patterns, such as bullish divergences. These annotations serve to emphasize significant trading zones and anticipated trend shifts based on historical data. The marked sections of the chart indicate that each time similar conditions were met, there followed a significant increase in the XRP price, reinforcing the bullish outlook presented in the current analysis. @Cryptobilbuwoo0’s analysis suggests that XRP, currently positioned at a historically significant price level and supported by bullish indicator signals, is poised for a potential breakout. This outlook is bolstered by the RSI nearing oversold conditions and the positive signals from the Wavetrend Indicator. If the historical pattern repeats, the crypto asset could see a substantial rally, affirming the analyst’s perspective: Looking at the XRP/Total chart, XRP has always risen significantly from the rebound line. Indicators are also calling the bulls. XRP always moves alone like a maverick. XRP’s showtime begins. At press time, XRP traded at $0.49.

The filing said the bankruptcy code prioritizes certain creditors over others, such that holders of FTX’s FTT token are near the bottom of the priority list.  FTX bankruptcy victims are seeking a ruling that the failed crypto exchange's forfeited assets, some $8 billion, belong to its customers, not the bankruptcy estate, according to a Friday filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Last month, the estate proposed a new reorganization plan that would see 98% of creditors get back 118% of their claims – in cash – within 60 days of court approval. The plan irked many of FTX customers, who had missed out on the opportunity to profit from the run-up in crypto prices while their funds were stuck in bankruptcy limbo.  The court filing said FTX filed for bankruptcy during the so-called crypto winter, when cryptocurrency prices saw a dramatic drop. Measuring customer claims at that time value would be profoundly unfair, according to the filing, which said the price of Solana (SOL) has increased ninefold and the price of bitcoin quadrupled since the petition date.  The victims' attorneys, Adam Moskowitz and David Boies, said in the filing the bankruptcy process has left ""FTX customers feeling 'aggrieved and robbed,' many of whom view the bankruptcy process as a 'second act of theft' and that the 'FTX bankruptcy estate remains to be the same fraudulent corporate entity' as was the enterprise run by SBF."" SBF, is former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud.  FTX collapsed in November 2022. The lawyers said that the jury found SBF stole no less than $8 billion from FTX customers. Bankman-Fried, who was also ordered to forfeit $11 billion, plans to appeal his sentence and conviction. ""If not for SBF’s crimes for which he was convicted—i.e., the theft and misuse of customer assets—the customers would have today owned their crypto investments,"" the filing said.  The filing also points out that the bankruptcy code requires prioritizing certain creditors over others, such that holders of FTX’s FTT token are near the bottom of the priority list. ""It is unlikely that holders of that token will receive compensation from the estate,” it said.  “We don’t know what the damages will be because complete accounting has not been done,” Moskowitz told CoinDesk. While the fluctuating value of crypto might change things, “it is safe to say that over $8 billion” of damages are owed.

However, this time it comes with a sense of caution among investors triggered by macroeconomic data, particularly from the United States. In addition, the resulting outflows of over $600 million from the primary market of the digital asset ecosystem, as reported by asset manager CoinShares, have raised concerns about potential price corrections shortly. Against this backdrop, renowned analysts and technical experts have weighed in to share their insights and predictions on Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Crypto Experts Warn Of Looming Bitcoin Correction Crypto analyst Timothy Peterson, in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), highlights Bitcoin’s substantial 65% rise over the past six months. However, based on ten years of historical data, Peterson suggests a 90% probability that BTC will experience a 10-20% decline in the next 90 days, taking the BTC price below the key $60,000 threshold. On a more optimistic note, Peterson noted that there is also a two-thirds chance that Bitcoin will finish the next three months with a 50% increase. This projection places the median Bitcoin price path at $65,000, followed by $52,000, and potentially reaching $98,000 by October. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Moves $64.4 Million Worth Of ETH, Is This A Dump? Supporting these predictions, technical analyst Rekt Capital points out that Bitcoin tends to form clusters of price action near the resistance range high above $71,600. Historical patterns indicate that these clusters often precede downside moves, leading to lower levels within the range. In line with Peterson’s analysis, this correction could potentially take Bitcoin’s price down to around $56,000, similar to the previous correction observed after its all-time high of $73,700 in March. BTC’s Post-Halving Trajectory On Track? Rekt Capital further emphasizes that Bitcoin trades within its normal re-accumulation box following the Halving event. This re-accumulation phase typically begins a few weeks before the Halving and concludes with a breakout months afterward. The analyst further shared that the current Re-Accumulation Range for Bitcoin is estimated to be between $60,000 and $70,000, with price fluctuations within this range. This phase aims to stabilize Bitcoin’s price, preparing it for the next cycle phase—the “Parabolic Phase.” Rekt Capital suggests that the Re-Accumulation phase can last several months, potentially up to 150 days. Upon breaking out of the re-accumulation area, Bitcoin enters a parabolic uptrend characterized by accelerated growth. Considering the timeline, the market is now two months after the Bitcoin Halving and the current price action aligns with previous 60-day post-Halving periods. Related Reading: This Altcoin Gem Will Overtake Solana, Predicts Arthur Hayes In summary, considering the scenarios presented by the analysts, BTC is anticipated to remain within its established range, possibly experiencing deeper corrections before embarking on an upward trajectory toward further price appreciation and the potential to reach new all-time highs.

Lagging (bottom left) represents weak relative strength and negative momentum and improving indicates weak relative strength but positive momentum.  XRP's move into the improving quadrant from the lagging quadrant, accompanying ETH and LINK, indicates the three coins still have lower relative strength compared to BTC, but their performance is gaining momentum.  ""We use RRGs [relative rotation graph] to evaluate cyclicality among the top altcoins normalized versus bitcoin. A few altcoins have less downside momentum versus bitcoin, with Chainlink joining Ether and Ripple in the Improving quadrant,"" analysts at Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients Monday.  The positive shift from the lagging quadrant to the improving quadrant suggests a rotational opportunity could unfold in the coming weeks, whereby capital might flow into the improving sector as investors seek exposure to resilient corners of the crypto market.  Momentum traders tend to view the cross into the improving quadrant as a potential opportunity, indicating that the asset is showing signs of improvement and may outperform in the near future.  DOGE, SOL and BCH are in the weakening quadrant and point left, indicating a continued underperformance and an impending move to the lagging quadrant. The remaining top altcoins are already in the lagging quadrant, exhibiting both underperformance and negative momentum relative to BTC.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | LINK,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | LINK | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/18/xrp-link-eth-stand-out-relative-to-btc-in-sector-rotation-analysis-doge-struggles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5af359e35336d865c46bffbba9a34dd17f7fe020-1280x803.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This was influenced by ongoing profit-taking and outflows from U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs, which impacted bullish sentiment.  The declines were led by notable losses in tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana's SOL.  Major tokens slid in Asia trading hours Tuesday amid continual profit-taking and another day of net outflows from U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday, pressuring bullish sentiment.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} slid to nearly $66,500, reversing all its Monday gains, while ether {{ETH}} fell to $3,400, reversing all of last week’s gains. BTC has been hovering around the 50-day moving average at $66,000, testing the medium-term uptrend. Meanwhile, BTC ETFs recorded net outflows of $145 million, continuing last week's dismal run.  Major tokens dogecoin {{DOGE}} and Solana’s SOL lost as much as 9% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, to lead losses. Ton Network’s TON fell 5%, while BNB Chain’s BNB outperformed with losses of just 1.5%.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens, minus stablecoins, is down 4.2%.  Last week, BTC dipped below the $65,000 mark for the first time in a month as net outflows from ETFs crossed the $500 million mark and the Federal Reserve signaled just one interest rate cut in 2024.  “Other factors haven’t helped,” shared Neil Roarty, analyst at investment platform Stocklytics, in an email to CoinDesk. “The political uncertainty triggered by Emmanuel Macron's surprise decision to call a snap election in France further strengthened the dollar as traders exited the euro.”  “A strong dollar tends to put downward pressure on Bitcoin,” he said, adding that it would take considerably lower interest rates and a weaker dollar to push BTC closer to the $70,000 mark.  Elsewhere, FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich warned of generally bearish sentiment as favorable ether ETF developments did little to buoy ETH prices.  “Ethereum, on optimistic expectations about the ETF, was able to add over 6% after briefly dipping under its 50-day MA on Friday.

29627604,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625124,1718692215,End Of The Road For FLOKI? Analyst Predicts 80% Crash For The Shiba Inu Competitor,"Shiba Inu competitor FLOKI has been one of the best performers this year and continues to maintain a high level in the market. Its price has more than doubled in 2024, prompting an influx of new investments into the meme coin. However, as investors throw money at FLOKI, one analyst expects this increase to be short-lived, predicting a massive price crash for the altcoin. FLOKI Poised For A Rally And Then A Dump Crypto analyst iMoneyTeam has predicted a dump for the FLOKI price that could erase all of the meme coin’s gains from the last few months. The analysis, which was posted on the TradingView platform, tracks the movement of FLOKI over the last few months in a bid to predict where the price is headed next. As the crypto analyst explains, the price has reached a “bearish iCH” in the internal structure, which has created “an internal pullback,” depicted on the chart below. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Triple-Digit Surge Across Major Metrics, What’s Going On? This is evident in the price pullback that has rocked the meme coin in the month of June so far. However, where a recovery is usually expected for an asset in this situation and a continuation of the rally, the crypto analyst believes that it is a setup for further pullback. For now though, the analyst identifies that there is still a lot of bullish pressure on the meme coin. This comes even as its price has broken a trend line, which would usually be bearish. But in this case, the bullish pressure could help the price hold its position. From here, there could be a recovery in price toward new all-time highs. However, after this is when the real problem begins for the cryptocurrency. Multiple Targets For The Meme Coin Going by iMoneyTeam’s prediction, before the FLOKI price will crash, there will be an increase in price. The chart shows a recovery to as high a $0.00044, which is an almost 60% increase in the meme coin’s price at the time of this writing. However, following this, the crypto analyst expects the Shiba Inu competitor to hit a supply zone, which will begin its decline. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Moves $64.4 Million Worth Of ETH, Is This A Dump? Once the price starts to fall, the analyst expects the price to fall to as low as $0.00006. Now, from the current price of $0.00018, it would mean an 80% decline in price. However, if the price does hit a new all-time high price of $0.00044, as the analyst predicts before falling, then a crash to $0.00006 would mean an 86% decline. In terms of when this could happen, the crypto analyst does not give a timeline of events. However, the chart shows that the price would hit a demand zone around $0.00006, which would suggest that would be the bottom for the crash.

29624933,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625091,1718686803,Is Ethereum Poised For A Record Break? Top Analyst Says $5K is Coming Soon – Here’s Why,"Prominent crypto analyst Jelle has projected Ethereum (ETH) to surge to $5,000 by the end of this year. This prediction comes with a notable reason from a technical perspective. Ethereum Rally: Setting the Stage For New Peaks Jelle’s forecast comes after Ethereum is experiencing a form of stabilization above the $3,500 mark, following a correction from its March high of over $4,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin, But Ethereum Holds Potential for Surprise — QCP Capital As the crypto community watches closely, Jelle’s insights suggest significant bullish potential for Ethereum, particularly as the market anticipates the launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Jelle’s analysis points to a pivotal moment for Ethereum. After a brief dip in price, Ethereum has rebounded, reaching as low as $3,384 last Friday; the asset is currently trading around the $3,500 mark and demonstrating a recovery though with a 2.2% decrease in the last 24 hours and nearly 5% over the past week. This stabilization is a minor fluctuation and a critical support level that could foresee significant price movements. According to Jelle, “ETH successfully turned $3,500 into support. Very few people are ready for this one to make new all-time highs, but $5,000 ETH is very much on the menu this year. Let’s roll.” This statement underscores a strong conviction that Ethereum is recovering and gearing up for a substantial upward trajectory. The current market dynamics provide a fertile ground for such optimism. Ethereum’s resilience in maintaining key support levels amidst market fluctuations bodes well for its potential to breach previous highs. The anticipated introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs is expected to inject further vigor into its market cap, attracting institutional and retail investors drawn to its ecosystem and the promise of enhanced liquidity and regulatory compliance. $ETH successfully turned $3,500 into support! Very few people are ready for this one to make new all-time highs, but $5,000 ETH is very much on the menu this year. Let’s roll. pic.twitter.com/k438SvCX2o — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) June 17, 2024 Strategic Movements and Market Sentiments The broader crypto market, especially Ethereum, is buzzing with activity, anticipating the spot on ETH ETFs. Recent data from NewsBTC highlights that the crypto community is particularly bullish on Ethereum, as evidenced by the substantial number of contracts that expire ETH options. Most of these are call options, betting on Ethereum’s price rise, with a notably low put-call ratio of 0.36, signaling a strong bullish sentiment among traders. This optimistic outlook is further supported by significant buying activities from permanent holders, particularly institutions. On June 12, these investors made one of the largest daily purchases of Ethereum, buying 298,000 ETH, just shy of the record 317,000 ETH purchased on September 11, 2023. Such investment activity not only underscores the confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value but also indicates a market poised for a rally, especially with potential catalysts such as the approval of ETH spot ETFs on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Withdrawals From Coinbase Top $1.2 Billion, What’s Going On? Moreover, QCP Capital’s analysis reinforces this sentiment, noting Ethereum’s higher implied volatility than Bitcoin. This suggests that while the general crypto market might experience subdued activity by summer, Ethereum could see significant trading volumes and price action, particularly if the ETFs start trading live.

Polygon is slowly recovering, but the bears might be active near $0.5650 and $0.5720. MATIC price started a fresh decline from the $0.6285 resistance zone against the US dollar. The price is trading below $0.570 and the 100-hour simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5720 on the hourly chart of the MATIC/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could recover and test the $0.5720 resistance zone in the near term. Polygon Price Takes Hit After a decent increase, Polygon’s price faced heavy resistance near the $0.6285 zone. MATIC formed a short-term top at $0.6286 and recently started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a sharp move below the $0.600 and $0.5720 support levels. The price even dipped below $0.5250 and tested $0.5150. A low was formed at $0.5151 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $0.5350 resistance level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6286 swing high to the $0.5151 low. MATIC is trading below $0.560 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $0.5550 zone. The first major resistance is near the $0.5720 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6286 swing high to the $0.5151 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5720 on the hourly chart of the MATIC/USD pair. If there is an upside break above the $0.5720 resistance level, the price could continue to rise. The next major resistance is near $0.5850. A clear move above the $0.5850 resistance could start a steady increase. In the stated case, the price could even attempt a move toward the $0.6285 level or $0.650. Another Decline in MATIC? If MATIC’s price fails to rise above the $0.5720 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.5320 level. The main support is near the $0.5150 level. A downside break below the $0.5150 level could open the doors for a fresh decline toward $0.50. The next major support is near the $0.4850 level.

The flip side is, downside risks will be exaggerated if and when Bitcoin falls hard again. The Company's operating business failing to produce income, on top of investors paying 2x the market value of its Bitcoin holdings are other bearish issues to consider. A share price drop to zero, or close to it, for MSTR is a real possibility, given Bitcoin crashes later this year and/or 2025. MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) has ridden the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) craze amazingly well, leveraging with borrowed money its current 214,400 stake in the world's leading cryptocurrency. It's a brilliant investment strategy to employ when you are speculating on an asset going straight up in price, especially with the pyramiding plan of buying high and higher prices executed by management. Share ownership is basically a margined position in Bitcoin. The problem arises when the world's main cryptocurrency slides hard in price, which it has done numerous times since invention during 2009. You can review below the high correlation in price swings between the two assets over the past five years. YCharts - MicroStrategy vs. $Bitcoin, Price Changes, 5 Years What is different today vs. the 2021 peak in quotes for both (in a critically negative way for MicroStrategy owners) is Chairman Michael Saylor has led the effort to load the company with borrowed funds in U.S. dollars to purchase cryptos at high quotes over the last 12 months. The company just issued another $700 million in convertible debt to finance the purchase of additional Bitcoins, support day-to-day operations, and repay previous borrowing. MicroStrategy - Investor Relations Homepage, June 12th, 2024 My worry is Bitcoin prices could just as easily collapse, as rise further from $67,000. Who knows for sure, since cryptos are a confidence and excess money game in the overall economy. Any type of liquidity crunch, recession, or black swan event could knock Bitcoin from its perch. As the consequence of extra debt vs. 2022's Bitcoin implosion period, MicroStrategy is actually a much ""riskier"" bet than 3-4 years ago, in my opinion. In fact, a price drop of -50% in Bitcoin would create net losses on MSTR's total stake built since 2020. Plus, a percentage drop beyond this level could wipe out all book value for the company, with many convertible debts callable for cash. In the end, a -70% to -80% Bitcoin drop could ruin MicroStrategy, with a margin-call like situation an outlier possibility. Let me explain some of the math in a bear market for cryptocurrencies. StockCharts.com - MicroStrategy, 12 Months of Daily Price & Volume Changes StockCharts.com - $Bitcoin, 12 Months of Daily Price & Volume Changes Bitcoin Leverage has a Downside At the end of March, MicroStrategy held $240 million in current assets like cash and receivables, just $84 million in net property and equipment, and roughly $5.1 billion in Bitcoin investments (at cost), with $920 million in deferred tax assets. All this was matched against $3.9 billion in total liabilities, $3.6 billion of which was debt. Cost-accounting stockholder equity of $2.4 billion supported the $28 billion equity market capitalization at that point in time (slightly above the $27 billion total currently). MicroStrategy - Q1 2024 Earnings Release, Bullett Point Summary, April 29th, 2024 On April 26th, 2024, the company reported owning 214,400 Bitcoin at an average purchase cost of $35,180. So, using today's Bitcoin price of $67,000, MSTR holds a liquidation crypto value of $14.35 billion, before capital gains taxes. When you include likely taxes, subtract all debts and liabilities, and add other assets into the equation, a net/final liquidation value in the $11-12 billion range means new buyers of MSTR stock are paying more than DOUBLE its true underlying worth in the middle of June (quite a premium to begin with). But here's the rub. If Bitcoin prices are hit by its 4th drop of -70% to -80% in price over the last 11 years, MicroStrategy's rising debt load could morph into a serious going-concern problem. For example, at a Bitcoin price of $15,000, MSTR could be sitting on greater than $4 billion in investment losses, with a crypto-backed asset value of $3.2 billion (vs. $14.35 billion presently). AND, if additional Bitcoins are purchased at peak pricing with borrowed funds the rest of the year, carried losses could balloon a year or two down the road. In a mark-to-market exercise, MSTR could be sitting on a NEGATIVE -$2 billion number or worse in liquidation book value, without aggressive Bitcoin selling soon. In other words, another Bitcoin swoon could effectively move the company into insolvency rather quickly (with a stock price of ZERO), if many of its bonds with convertible for cash clauses are called. The company may not have enough Bitcoin assets to sell and repay its debts, as one possibility. Insider Selling What do insiders and management think about their stock, and the odds of future riches? If you listen to Michael Saylor on television, he is quite optimistic. However, his personal trading in shares reveals far less bullishness. Including his activity, officers and directors have sold roughly $500 million in stock value (at the time of each transaction) over the last 12 months, with NO insider buys reported to the SEC in its Class A shares. This liquidation total represented about 20% of their Class A holdings. Nasdaq.com - MicroStrategy, Insider Transactions, 12 Months Mr. Saylor did retain 56% voting control of the company through 1.96 million Class B shares held in February , each with 10 votes vs. the publicly traded Class A with one vote. In terms of an economic interest in MicroStrategy (both share classes are equally weighted), the Chairman owned 11.6% of the company. Michael Saylor's personal tax-evasion tactics are another huge red flag to consider. Just a few weeks ago, he agreed to pay $40 million in back taxes due to the government. My worry is company managers avoiding the payment of taxes may be symptomatic of other problems with day-to-day management decisions at the operating business. According to a Seeking Alpha article explaining the tax situation : Chairman, Michael Saylor, agreed to pay $40M to settle a civil complaint over his alleged failure to pay personal income taxes over a number of years. The company had also been named in the suit on allegations that it conspired to assist Saylor in his alleged failure to pay income taxes. The lawsuit was filed on Aug. 31, 2022 , by the Washington, DC's attorney general. Under the consent order, the company and Saylor agreed to pay $40M to resolve the case. However, in a separate agreement between the company and Saylor, Saylor will pay the settlement amount in full, ""and the company will not be obligated to make any contribution to the settlement payment,"" MicroStrategy said. In resolving the issue, the company and Saylor did not admit to the allegations or any violation of law or regulation. Final Thoughts Reality check. The ""operating"" business (outside of Bitcoin ownership) has not earned an honest profit in many years. Operating losses have been reported since 2018. Below are Wall Street analyst consensus projections for 2024-25. The hope is MicroStrategy's business, excluding Bitcoin trading, will generate a minor profit in 2025. Seeking Alpha Table - MicroStrategy, Analyst Estimates for 2024-25, Made June 17th, 2024 Shareholders in MSTR are speculating on Bitcoin's future price with leverage, pure and simple. Just like uncommon upside is possible given strong Bitcoin price gains above $100,000 this year, any unexpected collapse in cryptocurrencies will translate into monster losses for MicroStrategy owners. Don't say it cannot happen. Believe it or not, the double-top pricing pattern of 2024 appears to be a look-alike cousin to the one outlined in 2021. During the following Bitcoin implosion, MSTR fell -83% in price into December 2022 (measuring from top to bottom). A mirror drop from this year's $2,000 quote peak would put the price at $340 sometime next year. YCharts - MicroStrategy vs. $Bitcoin, Price Changes, April 13th, 2021 to December 31st, 2022 Yet, the added debt load this time around could mean an even bigger price decline may be ready to play out on another -80% Bitcoin collapse. I am forecasting such an experience could drop MicroStrategy shares to ZERO, or close to it. On the flip side of the bearish coin, further Bitcoin gains will likely support some sort of advance in MicroStrategy shares, maybe even a large gain. It's really a gambler's game, with no underlying math to help in making a wager. For myself personally, the risks are just too great. I am in my middle-50s for age, and cannot afford -80% or greater losses on investment. Youngsters have time to make up sizable losses. I do not. After investing and trading for 38 years, I feel it my obligation to explain the downside risks in MicroStrategy. If you continue to own it, or decide to buy shares, you cannot say the risks were not properly explained to you. I rate MSTR a Strong Sell and avoid for most investor accounts.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699734-microstrategy-overleveraged-gamble-cryptocurrency-may-become-worthless-bitcoin-crash?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29623375.jpeg

Bitcoin Is Close To Seeing A Retest Of Short-Term Holder Cost Basis In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has discussed how BTC has recently been near the Realized Price of the short-term holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Cost At $86,700: Price To Surpass This Soon? The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the average price at which investors or addresses on the Bitcoin network acquired their coins. When the cryptocurrency’s spot price is higher than this metric, it means that the average holder in the market is currently sitting on some profits. On the other hand, BTC’s value under the indicator suggests the dominance of losses among the investors. Naturally, when the two are exactly equal, the market as a whole can be assumed to be holding an equal amount of unrealized profits and losses. The holders could collectively be considered just breaking even on their investment. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a specific part of the sector is of focus: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs are the investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price of the Bitcoin STHs over the past couple of years: The above graph shows that the Bitcoin price is close to the Realized Price of the STHs. This means that the margin is small, although these investors are sitting in profits right now. Thus, it’s possible that if the cryptocurrency continues on its latest bearish trajectory, a retest of the average cost basis of this cohort could be imminent. In the past, such retests have proven relevant for the asset. Moreno has highlighted in the chart the interactions the asset’s spot value has shown with this level during the last two years. It would appear that during two of these retests (marked with green circles), the coin found support at this level and rebounded upwards to continue the bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin FOMO: Social Media Users Calling To Buy Sub-$66,000 Dip However, in the three other instances (red circles), Bitcoin failed to retest the level and observed a decline. These corrections were from 8% to 12%, and the latest occurrence of the trend was at the end of April/start of May. With another retest possibly approaching for the cryptocurrency, it would be interesting to see which of the two patterns would follow this time around. If a breakdown of the level happens, the analyst notes, “the price could decline to about $60K.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $65,400, down over 6% in the past week.

Despite lower transaction costs, BCH has failed to gain significant adoption, trading at roughly the same prices as in 2017. BCHG is currently trading at a 160% premium to NAV. Even if BCH continues to rally, BCHG may not follow, if its premium to NAV narrows. Recently, I have been reviewing the crypto markets and came across the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG). BCHG has had a phenomenal run, returning close to 1,000% in the past year, vastly outperforming Bitcoins and its sibling fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) (Figure 1). Figure 1 - BCHG vs. BTC and GBTC (Seeking Alpha) Is Bitcoin Cash the hot new 'altcoin' that is poised to outperform Bitcoin going forward, and should investors consider investing in the BCHG? In my opinion, BCHG is an investment vehicle investors should avoid. Not only is Bitcoin Cash, the cryptocurrency underlying BCHG, not living up to its initial hype, but the BCHG trust is trading at an absurd 160% premium to NAV. Even if investors are bullish on the outlook for Bitcoin Cash, they should seek exposure elsewhere. Fund Overview The Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust is a simple investment trust designed to hold Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) offline in 'cold storage' with Coinbase's ( COIN ) custody solutions. BCHG charges a 2.5% management fee and has $140 million in assets under management. What Is Bitcoin Cash Without belaboring the point, Bitcoin Cash (""BCH"") is a hard fork of the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, that was created in 2017 when the developers behind BCH had a different vision than the mainstream supporters of Bitcoin. BCH supporters wanted to create a cryptocurrency with a greater utility in everyday transactions, so they proposed increasing the block size of Bitcoin such that it could process more transactions per second. However, mainstream Bitcoin supporters were not enthusiastic about the idea, since larger block sizes would require more resources to operate nodes. This disagreement in the vision for Bitcoin led to the hard fork of the codebase, creating Bitcoin Cash. Readers interested in learning more about the cryptocurrency's history can refer to various articles online . Bitcoin Cash Failing To Gain Adoption To decide whether the BCHG trust is a good buy, we must first think about the merits of Bitcoin Cash. Will BCH continue to gain adoption, trading volumes, and investor demand? Compared to traditional Bitcoin, BCH is widely considered to be faster and less expensive for transactions. Due to its larger block size, BCH can process over 100 transactions per second, an order of magnitude higher than Bitcoin's 6-8 transactions per second. However, despite its low costs, BCH adoption has been relatively weak, with only ~13k transactions per day on its blockchain (Figure 2). Figure 2 - Bitcoin Cash transactions per day (Bitinfocharts.com) In contrast, Bitcoin still dominates, with close to half a million transactions per day on its blockchain despite its much higher costs (Figure 3). Figure 3 - Bitcoin transactions per day (Bitinfocharts.com) The difference in adoption rate can also be observed by comparing the market capitalization of Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash. When the Bitcoin Cash fork occurred in 2017, BCH was trading at approximately $240 while Bitcoin was at $2,700. Fast-forward to today, Bitcoin has increased in value to ~$65,000 while BCH is still fetching only ~$420, so the ratio between the two cryptocurrencies has increased by ~14x. In fact, BCH has fallen out of the top-10 most valuable cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of only $8.2 billion, less than the meme-coin Dogecoin (Figure 4). Figure 4 - Top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap (coinmarketcap.com) BCHG Trades At A Large Premium To NAV Interestingly, while BCH has outperformed Bitcoin in the past year, the outperformance has not been as dramatic as Figure 1 implies. Over the past year, BCH has returned 288% compared to Bitcoin's 148% rally (Figure 5). Figure 5 - BCH vs. BTC, 1 year (Seeking Alpha) So how has BCHG been able to return 1,000% in the past year? The answer has to do with BCHG's premium/discount to net asset value (""NAV""). As BCHG is structured as an investment trust, the creation, and especially redemption, of the trust's units are tightly controlled. This means that the market price of the trust can fluctuate independently of the underlying BCH price. During the crypto bear market in 2022, BCHG's price to NAV reached a low of 0.4x and was approximately 0.8x in June 2023 (Figure 6). However, today, BCHG units are trading at a steep 2.6x P/NAV. Figure 6 - BCHG price to NAV (Author created with data from Grayscale) So a strong rally in BCH prices, combined with BCHG's P/NAV swinging from 0.8x to 2.6x, caused BCHG units to rally close to 1,000% in the past year. Outlook Not As Promising With Large Premium To NAV While BCHG may have looked promising in early 2023 when it was trading at a discount to NAV, the current 160% premium to NAV argues for caution (Figure 7). Figure 7 - BCHG currently fetches 2.6x P/NAV (grayscale.com) Even if BCH were to continue its rally, there is no guarantee that BCHG's share will follow suit. In fact, BCHG shares may even decline in certain scenarios if BCHG investors decide to liquidate their BCHG holdings and/or decide to buy the cryptocurrency directly through a crypto exchange like Coinbase. Return Of The Crypto 'Arbitrage' Trade One possible driver of BCHG's premium-to-NAV and possible future risk is the return of the crypto 'arbitrage' trade involving private placements of Grayscale's investment trusts. Historically , when Grayscale was the only game in town with respect to investment trusts holding cryptocurrencies, its crypto investment trusts like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust would trade at a large and persistent premium to NAV. Accredited investors could subscribe to private placements of the trusts, whereby they can buy trust units at NAV. The only caveat is that there is typically a hold period of 6-12 months before these investors can sell their newly minted trust units on the secondary markets. As long as Bitcoin prices kept rising and the GBTC stayed at a premium to NAV, it was akin to 'printing money' for these sophisticated investors. For example, they would agree to purchase GBTC units at $3,000 per Bitcoin, with GBTC trading at a 20% premium to NAV. Grayscale would take the investor's money and purchase Bitcoins in the open markets for the trust (and thus supporting Bitcoin prices). At the end of their 6-month hold period, as long as Bitcoin prices stayed relatively stable and the trust's premium to NAV did not collapse, these investors could turn around and sell their GBTC units to retail investors and collect a handsome return for their time. Some cynical traders have even likened the trade to a 'ponzi' scheme. I bring up the crypto 'arbitrage' trade because, since Q3 of 2023, the BCHG has been issuing tens of thousands of units in private placements (Figure 8). Keen-eyed readers will notice that this behavior coincides with the BCHG trust returning to a premium to NAV in Figure above, and could be a sign that these sophisticated accredited investors have been engaging in the crypto 'arbitrage' trade once again using BCHG. Figure 8 - BCHG has been issuing units in private placements (SEC) Retail investors buying the BCHG may become the unwitting 'exit liquidity' for these accredited investors when their hold period expires in the coming months and quarters. Risks Like all cryptocurrency investments, the biggest risk to BCHG is the price of BCH, which is quite volatile. However, the risk in BCHG is compounded by the fact that it is trading at a 160% premium to NAV. Even if investors are bullish on the adoption of BCH over the long run and wish to participate, there are far cheaper ways to gain exposure to BCH via opening a crypto investment account and buying BCH directly. Not only would investors sidestep BCHG's steep premium, but by buying BCH directly, investors will not have to pay BCHG's steep 2.5% per annum management fee. On the flip side, momentum could continue for BCHG, particularly if enough sophisticated investors continue to pour capital into private placements of BCHG units, which can be turned around to support BCH prices and BCHG's premium to NAV. Conclusion I would personally steer clear of the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust. To date, there is no indication that Bitcoin Cash is gaining in popularity and adoption, since the number of transactions on the BCH blockchain remains far below that of Bitcoin despite its supposedly lower transaction costs. Furthermore, the BCHG trust is currently trading at an expensive 160% premium to net asset value. Even if BCH prices rally, there is a risk that BCHG falls, if its premium to NAV narrows. BCHG's recent surge in price may be driven by a crypto 'arbitrage' trade, whereby sophisticated investors buy BCHG units in private placements at NAV and offload them to retail investors after a hold period. The sudden influx of capital to the BCH ecosystem could have caused BCH prices and BCHG's premium to NAV to surge in the short term. However, with the private placement holds likely expiring in the coming months, retail investors buying BCHG now could become unwitting 'exit liquidity' for sophisticated investors. I rate BCHG an avoid (hold) .",NEGATIVE,BCH,BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699732-bchg-avoid-this-altcoin-trust-trading-at-a-160-percent-premium-to-nav?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29622965.jpeg

Ethereum Price Retests Key Support Ethereum price failed to gain pace for a move above the $3,580 and $3,650 resistance levels. ETH reacted to the downside like Bitcoin and declined below the $3,500 support. There was a sharp move below $3,420, but the bulls were again active near $3,350.

The token, aUSDT, was developed on the company’s Alloy by Tether platform. By leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum Mainnet blockchain, users can mint aUSDT by over-collateralizing it with another Tether token representing the value of gold. Tether Launches Alloy According to the announcement, Alloy by Tether, developed by Moon Gold NA S.A. de C.V. and Moon Gold El Salvador S.A., both members of the Tether Group, serve as the foundation for the newly launched token. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Struggles Near $6.30 – Is Now The Time To Accumulate? In the words of Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino, Alloy is an open platform for creating collateralized synthetic digital assets and will soon be part of the company’s new digital asset tokenization platform that will launch later this year. Furthermore, Alloy enables the creation of various “tethered assets,” potentially including yield-bearing products. The platform’s stabilization strategies, such as over-collateralization with liquid assets and secondary market liquidity pools, will reportedly ensure the price stability of these assets. Ardoino further stated on the matter: We are thrilled to announce the launch of Alloy by Tether, introducing a class of digital assets backed by gold and tethered to a reference fiat currency. While the stabilization mechanism is different compared to traditional options like USD₮, this innovative solution marks an exciting milestone, and we eagerly anticipate how it will interact with the rest of the market. Moreover, we plan to make this innovative technology available in our upcoming digital asset tokenization platform as well. Transactions And Payments Tether Gold (XAUt), the underlying asset for aUSDT, boasts a market capitalization of approximately $573 million. The physical gold that backs Tether Gold is reportedly securely stored in Switzerland. The stablecoin issuer contends that this gold-backed digital asset allows users to engage in transactions, payments, and remittances using a currency similar to the US dollar while retaining their ownership of gold-backed digital assets. Tether has experienced substantial financial success with its USDT stablecoin, generating a profit of $4.5 billion in the first quarter alone, as reported in its attestation. However, the quality of assets backing stablecoins like USDT has faced increased scrutiny from regulators. Incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, Tether reached settlements with the New York Attorney General and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2021, resolving allegations related to reserves disclosure and transparency. Related Reading: Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess Overall, Tether’s introduction of a gold-backed synthetic dollar, aUSDT, represents another milestone in expanding the company’s stablecoin offerings.

The token has hit a new all-time high (ATH) twice this Friday and flipped Ethereum’s active users this week. Market watchers believe this breakout and recent performance could set the stage for a rally toward the $10 mark. Related Reading: Memecoin Fight: DADDY Surpasses MOTHER Despite Insider Trading Activity Allegations Toncoin Sets New $8 All-Time High Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently said Toncoin was on the verge of a major breakout. The analyst highlighted the ascending triangle pattern on TON’s chart and suggested the token was gearing up for a 40% breakout above the $10 price range. On Thursday night, the token successfully tested the $7.7 resistance level, surpassing its all-time high of $7.76. TON continued its uptrend in the following hours, briefly breaking above the $8 resistance level. After setting its new ATH, Toncoin retraced below the $8 mark. TON hovered between the $7.8 and $7.9 price range before restarting its rise to a second milestone in 24 hours. On Friday, the Telegram-integrated token soared 5% to its new ATH of $8.15. This surge represents a 9% increase from the day before. Moreover, TON displays a 7.7% and 17.6% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes. The crypto community praised Toncoin’s performance, highlighting TON’s green numbers amid the market slowdown. GeckoTerminal shared the list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Among the assets, TON is currently the only token with a positive performance in the “last 7 days carnage.” Is TON The New SOL? Crypto analysts took notice of TON’s recent performance, with many believing that a double-digit target for the summer is possible. The bullish sentiment toward TON has made several analysts, including Martinez and Daan Crypto, set their next target for the token above the $10 price range. Altcoin Sherpa said the token remains one of the “strongest charts in crypto.” The analyst had previously stated that TON’s breakout was “just a matter of time.” Similarly, some community members think Toncoin could be the new Solana (SOL). To some, the token’s performance resembles SOL’s in the previous cycle. Crypto trader ImNotTheWolf believes “TON will become the new SOL, in terms of gains potential.” Another market watcher highlighted the token’s strength amid the market. WiseAnalyse suggested TON is “the only strong chart out there” because of its real-life use and adoption. As reported by NewsBTC, Toncoin recently surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in daily active addresses. This feat was attributed to its integration with Telegram and its 900 million user base. Related Reading: Solana Set To Soar?

After last week’s plunge, the token fell by as much as 75% from March 2024 highs, a huge concern for token holders. CRV Recovers, Adds 45% After Plunging However, according to one analyst who took to X, the bottom could be in, arguing that favorable fundamental events in roughly two months could propel the token to as high as $2. CRV is changing hands at around $0.32, up 42% from last week’s lows. Most importantly, prices are stabilizing, with the impressive follow-through of June 13. After the flash crash that day, prices fell to as low as $0.22. Related Reading: Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess However, what was encouraging was the long lower wick, pointing to welcomed demand by the close of the trading day. This push was clear the next day when prices closed higher, with bulls extending gains over the weekend. Whether the June 13 plunge marked the end of CRV woes remains to be seen. For now, the sharp 45% recovery from last week’s lows and the expansion in Ethereum prices could create demand, further propelling CRV to the $0.40 mark. Curve To Change Token Emission As Erogov’s Bad Debt Cleared The analyst thinks something big is in the pipeline for Curve Finance as a protocol and CRV as the primary token priming platform. In mid-August, the token’s inflation rate would fall from 20.37% to as low as 6.34%. This reduction would be primarily because of the protocol’s shift to CRV distribution. From August 12, Curve will automatically cease allocating CRV to the core team for vesting. Instead, gauges will distribute the token directly to the community, drastically slashing inflation. Curve gauges determine how CRV is distributed to various liquidity pools. Through gauges, Curve Finance remains decentralized. This is because token holders can now vote on how much the liquidity providers of a given pool can receive CRV as an incentive. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Moves $64.4 Million Worth Of ETH, Is This A Dump? Besides the shift in CRV distribution, the liquidation of Michael Egorov’s position eliminates the issue of bad debt. Accordingly, Curve can not generate real revenue for CRV holders, drawing value. According to the analyst, Curve could evolve to be a leading decentralized Forex market over the coming years. The protocol is one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. According to DeFiLlama, it commands a total value locked of over $2.2 billion.

ZkSync’s Airdrop Drama On June 11, ZK Nation announced the upcoming launch and airdrop of zkSync’s token. Over 3.6 billion ZK tokens could be claimed by 695,000 eligible addresses on Monday. However, the distribution left many long-term users discontent with the token allocation they received. Several investors expressed disappointment after receiving a lower allocation than users with less volume or transactions. Other customers shared that they were not eligible for the airdrop despite meeting the criteria. Similarly, various top-ranking projects built on zkSync announced they were forming a coalition after not being included in the airdrop. Element and zkApes revealed that they are not getting any tokens despite generating up to $20 million in gas fees for the network. The backlash intensified when users expressed concerns about the lack of anti-Synil filtering. The project stated in the airdrop announcement their decision not to use anti-Sybil criteria. ZkSync’s team explained it was considered an “incomplete approach.” Online reports claim that 80 million ZK tokens are going into the hands of 47,000 Sybil addresses. Over the weekend, ZK Nation addressed the criticism and users’ concerns. The team answered some of the most frequently asked questions, including the zkSync-built projects exclusion, user eligibility, and Sybil detection. Per the post, the team chose an “alternative path” to benefit organic users. As explained, an aggressive Sybil filtering would eliminate “naive Sybils” while mistakenly flagging real users. Additionally, the filtering would miss most bots and professional Sybil accounts. As a result, the airdrop’s Sybil detection was configured “to lower the rate of false positives.” The team explained that a “larger number of Sybil accounts passing through the filter” was “a conscious trade-off.” Binance Offers New Token Distribution On Sunday, Binance announced it would list ZK on June 17. The exchange also revealed it would offer a ZK token distribution program “in light of the ongoing concerns.” According to the post, Binance will distribute 10.5 million ZK tokens to up to 52,000 users who meet the criteria. The requirements include users who initiated at least 50 transactions on ZkSync Era between February 2023 and March 2024 and conducted transactions in seven distinctive months. Additionally, the claim address must not been eligible for the ZK Nation airdrop. The ZK token started trading for $0.3 and reached the $0.32 mark, according to CoinGecko data. In the following hours, the price has retraced to the $0.24 price range, a 21% drop from its launch price. However, the token’s market capitalization sits at $900 billion and its fully diluted value (FDV) is at $5.1 billion. The initial performance has received mixed reactions from the community. Some users highlighted how customer dissatisfaction could be partially responsible for the price drop. “Projects often forget that customer satisfaction is crucial for their product or innovation to succeed,” said one X user.
