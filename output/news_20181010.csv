42401961,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38op,1539208538,One Big Backer Is Propping Up Media Startup Civil's Struggling ICO,"The token sale for Civil, the ConsenSys-backed company putting journalism on the blockchain, has brought in $1.34 million toward its $8 million minimum, according to a transparency report released today by the company.  The company is pre-selling allocations of its consumer token, dubbed CVL, in the run-up to the launch of its blockchain-fueled journalism platform. Last October, Civil announced that it had received $5 million in funding from ConsenSys, the ethereum-focused development studio.  The sale won't be finalized unless it reaches its ""soft cap"" of $8 million by October 15. The company has also designated a funding cap of $24 million.  In the report, Civil founder Matthew Iles said that the startup would push toward reaching the $8 million cap in spite of the progress thus far.  ""The numbers will show clearly enough that we are not where we wanted to be at this point in the sale when we started out,"" he wrote. ""But one thing we want to say at the top is that until the clock strikes midnight on Monday, we are still working nonstop on the goal of making our soft cap of $8 million.""  He later wrote:  ""We were founded to deliver a decentralized network for ethical journalism to the people, so nothing is more painful for our team than to witness how challenging it has been for motivated Civil supporters to wrestle with the user experience challenges involved with our unique consumer token product.""  The company added that ""The Civil Media Company did not and does not need the proceeds from this sale in order to continue operations.""  What the data says  According to the report, 681 individuals from 61 countries had finished purchasing tokens during the sale, accounting for a total of $1,344,721.59 as of 9 a.m. ET Thursday.  The majority of those buyers – 487 contributors – purchased less than $100 in tokens, with 250 people falling in the $100-$500 range. Just one buyer completed a purchase in excess of $10,000.  ""Another 1,671 individuals have committed another $798,503.71, but are either stuck somewhere in the process or simply haven't decided to fulfill their commitment yet,"" Civil added, noting that, all told, pledged contributions amounted to roughly $2.1 million.  ConsenSys ""purchased $1.1 [million] in CVL tokens during two separate transactions in September – representing 82 [percent] of the completed purchase total,"" according to the report.  The slow fundraising progress is a far cry from 2017, when other publishing projects, such as Brave's basic attention token (BAT) raised $35 million in less than a minute.  ""We actually believe in shipping product before asking customers to pay for something,"" Civil CEO Matthew Iles told CoinDesk in an interview in September.

The trading platform, which was accused of acting as an unregistered security-based swaps dealer, as well as violating money laundering and wire fraud laws, saw its website seized by the FBI late last month. The platform was able to reopen its site in a read-only mode in early October, announcing at the same time that it was seeking U.S. counsel to fight the charges.  On Wednesday, it added in a tweet that ""We will start processing withdrawals tomorrow at 12:00 (UTC). Thanks for your patience in the past days!""  The exchange has not announced any reactivation of its trading platform as of press time.  1Broker's legal battle began in September, when the SEC, CFTC and FBI all filed charges against the site, CEO Patrick Brunner and parent company 1Pool, alleging that the platform offered U.S. investors access to securities-based swaps products without following the required legal processes.  The regulators are seeking a permanent injunction against Brunner and 1Pool, along with monetary penalties, as previously reported.  After its domain was seized, the company said in a statement that it holds sufficient funds to cover any and all withdrawal requests, but that it needed permission from U.S. authorities to enable this function first.

42401965,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38uj,1539198039,2017 to Today: Ethereum Predictions Are Aging (But Not Well),"Alex Sunnarborg is a founding member of Tetras Capital Partners, LLC, an investment manager focused on investing in crypto assets.  Eighteen months ago, CoinDesk sent a survey to its readers asking for their opinions on the current state of the crypto ecosystem. The results were analyzed and published in the State of Blockchain Q1 2017. In this piece, the original author reflects on some of the core findings.      The most striking survey response was also the most straightforward to understand: sentiment around the 'overall state' of bitcoin and ethereum.  Less than 5 percent of those surveyed in Q1 2017 felt even slightly negative about the overall state of ethereum. The sentiment and optimism could have hardly been any higher.  At the time, the number of transactions on the ethereum network was rising.  Transactions on the bitcoin network were rising as well, but the magnitude of growth was less dramatic, and bitcoin blocks had started to average over 90 percent capacity.  Demand for bitcoin block space lead transaction fees to average north of $1 for the first time ever while ethereum's fees averaged less than $0.05.  It was clear that transaction fees were a large component of the negativity that survey participants felt when asked about bitcoin.  In the 18 months since, we've seen the rollout and initial usage of both SegWit and Lightning Network to help address bitcoin scaling, but the block limit kept the on-chain transaction count bounded under about 400,000 per day. Without the same limitations, we saw ethereum's transactional count exceed 1m per day in late 2017.  During that period, we saw ethereum's average transaction fee exceed $1, but also watched bitcoin's pass $50.  When block space is abundant and transaction fees are low, high transaction counts are easy to achieve, useful or not (similar to concerns around trading volumes on zero-fee exchanges).  Analysis has now been done that claims that one mixing system comprised over 60 percent of all ETH transaction volume between February 2017 and February 2018.  Ethereum had the largest ICO to date in July 2014 and the genesis block was created a year later in July 2015.  In the year between the ICO and mainnet launch, many projects were experimenting with creating early dapps, including Augur, launching a smart contract on the ethereum test net in April 2015.  Many in the community loved the idea of a decentralized prediction market, and in late 2015, Augur used the ICO model to raise $5 million to continue to build out their platform. The Augur ICO was for REP, a token which allows holders to act as oracles to settle markets after the fact in exchange for a percentage of the total amount bet.  Users do not have to own REP and can bet in ETH, a more interesting token design for REP in my opinion than an approach some dapps have taken by introducing a new required currency within their ecosystem.  By Q1 2017, hundreds of dapp ideas and token mechanisms that are irrefutably worse had been funded, and soon venture capitalists had been replaced by the global retail public via ICOs as the preferred and dominant form of early stage fundraising in crypto.  The community was clearly enthusiastic and willing to fund any new decentralized, tokenized attempt to compete with existing industries and companies.  Not only were participants optimistic about the future of Ethereum and its dapp ecosystem, but they also claimed to very positive about their current state.  I believe Augur is great example of the chasm that has become more clear between expectations and reality. As stated, Augur launched an early, test version of their product before Ethereum actually launched. Augur's actual launch just happened just 3 months ago in July 2018, over 3 years later. In the last 24 hours, Augur has had less than 50 users, 106 transactions, and about $10,000 in volume.  At dapp number 48 out of 970 when ranked by users, Augur's minimal usage metrics are not an outlier among ethereum dapps. The top used Ethereum dapps remain decentralized exchanges and games and no dapps had over 2,000 users or 10,000 transactions within the last 24 hours.  When comparing the usage of dapps across platforms, you can quickly find alternative ecosystems like EOS that are currently displaying more usage than ethereum. The weaknesses in comparing dapp metrics across platforms like ethereum and EOS have many parallels to the comparisons made earlier between transaction counts across bitcoin and ethereum.  Casper and Ethereum's Move to Proof of Stake  Since inception, one of the most critical, protocol level events on the Ethereum roadmap has been the shift from a Proof of Work consensus and security model to Proof of Stake. In June 2016, Vitalik predicted this shift would occur in early 2017.  Data source  In Q1 2017, Casper was not live, but the community was quite optimistic it would at least be live by today.  Eighty-three percent were wrong, it's now Q4 2018 and proof-of-stake is not live on Ethereum. Casper research remains ongoing.  Scaling with Layer-two Networks  Bitcoin, ethereum, and nearly every blockchain project is researching scaling the network through layer-two networks. In Q1 2017, 87 percent of the community thought that Raiden would be live on ethereum by the end of 2018, while 69% thought Lightning would be live on bitcoin.  Bitcoin now has over 10,000 Lightning channels, while Raiden is not live on Eehereum's main net (and now has a token, RDN, which had an ICO). Ethereum dapps including Funfair and Spankchain have however built dapp-specific scaling solutions and research on generalized state channels is ongoing by several parties.  Public Attention and Growth  In many of the easiest ways to measure however, participants were largely right to be bullish.  After the price of ETH spent much of 2016 above $10, the price of ether was back under $10 in Q1 2017 and global Google search interest was down following the chaos of The DAO and ETC.  In March 2017, ETH's price set an ATH of $50.  In June 2017, search interest exploded and ETH's price hit $400.  In January 2018, search interest surged once again, and at the peak of the bull market, ETH hit $1,400.  If you had bought ETH (with dollars) at any point between the ICO and mid-January 2018, you would have had a profitable trade (if you sold at the top). If you bought in the ICO (at $0.31), you would have returned 451,500 percent (better than equity in Coinbase today at a $8 billion valuation compared to its $4 million seed round, and ETH with public market liquidity).  ETH has undoubtedly been a historic investment opportunity. Compared to many traditional and even crypto asset alternatives, it has often outperformed.  On many time scales however, including in 2018's bear market (2014's which it wasn't around to experience), it has actually severely underperformed.  Both holding $ (as many ICO treasuries now realize they should have done) or even BTC would have been vastly superior strategies in 2018.  Ethereum has clearly fallen short of technical expectations over the last 18 months.  In all reality, the bar of expectations was simply set far too high by un-savvy retail investors with dollars and tokens in their eyes. The Q2 2017 survey article alluding to the inevitable pop that Spongebob saw coming from stupid inflated tokens was also simply bound to happen.  Perhaps we should be thankful it happened quickly within the last 18 months and now we can enter a period like 2014 and 2015 where there is more focus on building than trading (or at a minimum it can help filter out the good traders from those who good lucky with 'diversified exposure' in a bull market).  Much like bitcoin companies benefited from the building heavy period of 2014 and 2015, hopefully ethereum and its dapps can benefit heavily in the coming years from the tech built in 2018's bear market. Hopefully the price depreciation and forthcoming ICO regulatory actions will further help shape the design of the next wave of projects, fundraisers, and token mechanisms.

42401944,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38c2,1539190816,BMW-Backed Blockchain Competition Offers Token Prizes for Auto Tech,"The Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) has launched a development ""tournament"" to explore how vehicles will communicate, co-operate and transact in the smart cities of the near-future.  The 4-month MOBI Grand Challenge kicks off on October 12, with a public demonstration of winning technologies to be hosted by BMW Group in Munich, Germany on next February.  The prizes come in the form of blockchain tokens, which will drive next-generation mobility and data sharing: Ocean Protocol, a blockchain enabled data exchange protocol, has committed $1 million worth of token prize; and Beyond Protocol, a machine-to-machine economy distributed ledger technology (DLT) company has committed the equivalent of $250,000.  Stepping back, MOBI continues to grow its distinguished membership which includes startups, carmakers and OEMs since it was formed back in May this year. Indeed, MOBI's CEO and co-founder Chris Ballinger revealed exclusively to CoinDesk that the R3 consortium has just signed up as a member.  Regarding the competition, Ballinger said it's less like a hackathon and more like a cross between the DARPA Grand Challenge – where robotic vehicles competed to autonomously navigate through the Mojave Desert – and an XPRIZE.  In fact, it's just the first phase of a 3-year project to assemble and test out the building blocks of next-generation mobility networks, he said, including components like non-GPS location communication between vehicles and infrastructure, micro-payments, and ad-hoc mobile networks.  And like the first DARPA challenge in 2004, Ballinger acknowledged this is only the first step. He also expects corporate and government sponsorship and support will follow, as it did with DARPA.  ""We know that nobody is going to hit the home run in this first step. The technology is still immature. But we think this stuff will be possible within a few years,"" he told CoinDesk.  Micropayments and electric cars  When micropayments and wallets were first coming on the scene, people hypothesized that cars would be able to make a payment to get right of way, perhaps to reach an airport more quickly, for example.  Ballinger believes micropayments will certainly equip vehicles to do this type of thing, but much more as well; operating as an incentive to share data can reduce traffic flows across the board and also make driving safer, he said.  ""The vision here is cars connecting with infrastructure and other vehicles in local ad hoc networks, sharing data, making a small payment,"" said Ballinger.  This can allow cars, while attempting to negotiate a right of way, to effectively ""see around corners""; sharing information that could result in a small adjustment in speed as a car approaches an intersection could avoid an accident, he said.  Meanwhile, Jonathan Manzi, CEO of Beyond Protocol, said his team has been doing work that involves self-driving electric vehicles which could charge one another using wallets built into the battery units, as these become more efficient and advanced.  ""Today, when a car runs out of gas it goes to the gas station. In autonomous tomorrow, a car could go to a charging station and then wirelessly charge another car,"" said Manzi.

42401962,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38sl,1539187160,Liquid Goes Live: Blockstream's First Bitcoin Sidechain Has Finally Arrived,"Three years in the making, bitcoin's first sidechain ""Liquid"" is now live.  Launched by San Francisco startup Blockstream, Liquid is arguably the most advanced implementation of a technology called sidechains that's long been a holy grail for bitcoin coders (though what's being launched today may be a watered-down version of the original ""trustless"" vision). Still, that doesn't dilute the capabilities of what the company, founded by bitcoin's top open-source coders in 2014, has created.  Built off of the live blockchain, Liquid will now be used to carry large volumes of transactions at a higher speed for several of bitcoin's largest companies.  A notable milestone, Liquid has been in progress for quite some time. Blockstream first unveiled the idea in 2015, then the sidechain was launched in beta – being put to the test on bitcoin's main network – last year. Today, however, the network is finally opening up for all of Blockstream's partners to use for real transactions.  Initial users included 23 bitcoin companies, including exchanges, brokers and other institutions, who will help to manage the sidechain, as well as use Liquid to send transactions.  The full list includes include Altonomy, Atlantic Financial, Bitbank, Bitfinex, Bitmax, BitMEX, Bitso, BTCBOX, BTSE, Buull Exchange, DGroup, Coinone, Crypto Garage, GOPAX (operated by Streami), Korbit, L2B Global, OKCoin, The Rock Trading, SIX Digital Exchange, Unocoin, Xapo, XBTO and Zaif.  With many of bitcoin's big exchanges on board, the companies make up 50 percent to 60 percent of bitcoin's trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap.  ""This will bolster the bitcoin ecosystem because you can trade more securely and rapidly,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said in interview.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's ready for commercial use. At this point, it's just a matter of getting exchanges to integrate.""  Liquid's use  On a more technical level, the product works in a way that's akin to a kind of digital alchemy.  An exchange converts its bitcoin into ""LBTC"" – the liquid bitcoin token – which is pegged to actual bitcoin. Once sent there, exchanges can move money around securely and much more quickly than on the main bitcoin chain.  ""If there's one thing our traders need, it's speed. Liquid delivers that in spades,"" said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex, in a statement. ""Liquid's instant settlements will allow our traders to achieve faster bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, more efficient arbitrage, and even better pricing through tighter spreads.""  But, there's a huge caveat, one that long-time bitcoin enthusiasts are sure not to miss.  Liquid is not exactly a ""real"" sidechain, or at least not the type Blockstream was founded to research and build. Instead of building a sidechain that allows users to swap bitcoins for sidechain coins without a trusted third party, Blockstream built what's called a ""federated sidechain.""  Federated sidechains rely on a group of companies – in this case, Blockstream's launch partners – to collectively manage the sidechain. (A white paper released last year explains in more detail the technicals of the specific type of federated sidechain Liquid uses.)  For this reason, critics like pseudonymous bitcoin subreddit moderator ThePiachu have called the tech ""not innovative"" – even as far back as three years ago. ""Liquid looks like a very interesting project, but it's not the sidechains we are looking for,"" the moderator wrote.  While this might seem like a catch in the development, for the companies involved it doesn't matter all that much, since Liquid helps solve more than one problem that's been bothering them. In addition to moving money faster, partners will also be able to launch tokens on the platform, representing financial instruments, fiat currencies or crypto assets.  Mow went as far as to argue that the sidechain works better than the smart contract blockchain ethereum for launching tokens.  The potential  On top of that, in the coming weeks, Blockstream will be releasing a wallet specifically made for Liquid transactions. Plus, the company's bitcoin wallet GreenAddress already supports Liquid. Hardware wallet providers Ledger and Trezor have unveiled plans to adopt the technology also.  While that sounds like quite the momentum, it's been a long road for Liquid.  ""From a high-level view, Blockstream was founded on two-way peg sidechains. So, you could say Liquid is essentially our company purpose. If you look at it that way, it's been a few years in the making, but actual R&D has been two years,"" Mow said.  So, why did it take so long for Blockstream to build this?  ""It's difficult to launch something like Liquid because it requires security engineering on both software and hardware. It's not something we want to rush,"" Mow contended.  This seems to be proven by recent events. As explained in more detail in a recent blog post, Blockstream argued that when they heard about an unconfirmed security breach of major hardware that's currently rocking the technology world, they shipped their hardware out for an audit – just in case.  They're being picky about their security, Mow said, because they have big plans for the sidechain – that being that the technology could potentially carry a large chunk of bitcoin's total transactions.  Speaking to this, Mow told CoinDesk:  ""It will potentially be transacting billions of dollars worth of bitcoin a day.""  Still, even though the technology is live now, there's a long way to go before the platform reaches that kind of scale. According to the Blockstream team, they'll continue to work with exchanges and wallets to integrate Liquid into more platforms.

In particular, the release said, cryptocurrencies face issues with low liquidity, market risks from volatility and operational risks, among other concerns.  According to the release:  ""Based on the available information, crypto-assets do not pose a material risk to global financial stability at this time. However, vigilant monitoring is needed in light of the speed of market developments. Should the use of crypto-assets continue to evolve, it could have implications for financial stability in the future.""  The report states that, should crypto-assets continue to gain in popularity, it might impact financial stability by having an effect on investor confidence.  Other risks arise from the potential for crypto assets to be used as a form of payment or settlement, the report continues.  While advocating for close monitoring of crypto assets and their potential risk, the FSB notes that this is difficult, at least in part, because there is not a lot of information available on the full impact they can have.  Crypto assets have an impact outside financial stability as well, the report continues, raising question about policy issues including consumer and investor protection, market integrity, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), tax evasion, capital controls circumvention and illegal securities offerings.  However, while important, the organization states that these issues are outside its primary focus, and ""are the subject of work at national and international levels.""

According to a new report from Crypto Fund Research, 90 crypto hedge funds launched in the first three quarters of this year, and the total is expected to reach as high as 120 for the financial year.  With roughly 600 hedge funds of all types expected to launch in 2018, the expected 120 crypto-focused hedge funds would comprise a notable 20 percent of that total.  The figures mark the growing investor awareness of cryptocurrencies over the last two years, and the number of companies setting up to cater for their new interest.  Last year, crypto hedge funds accounted for 16 percent of new hedge funds, and, in 2016, the figure was less than 3 percent.  ""In the midst of 2018's decline in traditional hedge fund launches, crypto hedge funds are a notable aberration,"" said Joshua Gnaizda, founder of Crypto Fund Research.  While low crypto prices and and regulatory uncertainty in many regions persist, ""these seemingly unfavorable market conditions have not deterred managers from launching new crypto hedge funds at a record pace.""  Crypto Fund Research also points out that crypto hedge funds are part of a larger group of crypto funds, including those based on venture capital and private equity. Grouped together, there are currently 622 crypto funds across all categories, 303 of those being crypto hedge funds, which represent assets of less than $4 billion, according to the research.  The research also looks at the geography of new crypto hedge fund launches, saying around a half are based in the U.S. However, multiple launches have been seen in Australia, China, Malta, Switzerland, The Netherlands and the U.K. this year.  Gnaizda concluded:  ""While we don't believe the rate of new launches is sustainable longer-term, there are currently few signs of a significant slowdown.""

According to the October 9 statement, officials at the U.S. regulator are investigating Saint James Holding and Investment Company Trust and its trustee, Jeffre James, months after the agency first moved to suspend trading in penny-stock company Cherubim Interests, Inc.  The SEC explained that it believes Cherubim lied to investors about its claims around the so-called SJTCoin, which it said in January was ""designed for cooperative living, working and healthier lives and offers extensible diversity in the use of the coin over current coins like Bitcoins for both financial and societal gain.""  The agency said in its Tuesday statement:  ""Based on its ongoing, nonpublic investigation, the SEC has reason to believe that to 'pump' its stock price, Cherubim issued false public statements in January 2018 claiming that the company had executed a $100,000,000 financing commitment to launch an initial coin offering ('ICO') for St. James Trust. After Cherubim's stock price and trading volume increased on this news, certain individuals associated with the company may have 'dumped' their overvalued Cherubim stock for significant profits.""  Yet to date, James and the St. James Trust have yet to respond to the subpoena, despite ""personally [serving] James with copies of the subpoenas.""  ""The SEC's application seeks an order from the court compelling James and St. James Trust to produce all responsive documents,"" the agency said.  At the start of the year, the SEC made waves as it moved to scrutinize a number of small-cap stocks that rode a wave of public interest around blockchain, having warned in August 2017 that it would seek to punish public companies that use ICO-related claims to hoodwink investors.

42401958,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38qn,1539176397,A Solution to Crypto's 51% Attack? Fine Miners Before It Happens,"One of crypto's most feared attacks may have an elegant solution.  At least, that's according to the team behind cryptocurrency project Horizen – formerly zencash – which saw more than $500,000 hacked from an exchange in such an attack, called a 51 percent attack, earlier this year.  This attack happens when one single malicious miner controls more than 51 percent of the compute power on a blockchain network and can then inject false transactions into the system.  In a paper released today, the Horizen team claim to have found an innovative solution – by updating their proof-of-work consensus algorithm with a so-called ""delay function"" that penalizes miners that could be preparing for such an attack. Horizen is a fork of privacy-oriented crypto zcash, which is itself a fork of bitcoin.  Because a 51 percent attack requires a miner to produce blocks in secret before posting them to the blockchain, co-founder of Horizen Rob Viglione said a delay function allows for penalties that make such attacks prohibitively expensive.  ""So what it does is essentially it poses a massive cost, a 10x cost, on trying to launch one of these attacks,"" he told CoinDesk.  Stepping back, the 51 percent attack has been a part of many crypto enthusiast's awareness this year, after five major cryptocurrencies lost money due to the attack in June.  Because they damage the confidence in the security of cryptocurrencies more broadly, Viglione described such attacks as a ""negative externality on the entire industry.""  And with direct insight into the attack – the 51 percent attack on Horizen resulted in 36 fake blocks being included in the blockchain – Viglione said:  ""Right after the attack our engineers started brainstorming and we think we have a very elegant, simple solution to make sure that this doesn't happen again.""  He continued, ""Technically, to make it costly if it were ever to happen again.""  The penalties  To do this, Horizen's new algorithm introduces penalties for delayed blocks – those that are broadcast to the network a long time after the latest block.  In effect, the new code release modifies a feature of the underlying consensus algorithm, the so-called ""longest chain rule,"" with a delay function.  For example, if a block is proposed that is 5 blocks or more behind the most recent, a penalty is introduced, Viglione said. That quadratically increases the amount of blocks a miner needs to produce in order to have transactions accepted onto the chain, he continued.  As such, the chances of a 51 percent attack are decreased.  And because of the nature of Horizen's architecture, such a penalty should only occur if the miner is malicious, Viglione said.  ""We have an average block find time of 2 and a half minutes, maximum latency to broadcast anywhere in the world is like one or two seconds, so there's no way you could be 5 blocks behind legitimately,"" he explained.  This though, Viglione noted, could cause a network partition to occur on the blockchain, as multiple chains of blocks compete to be recognized as the honest chain. In this case, Viglione said miners will vote to determine which chain is legit.  ""They essentially elect which chain is legitimate and they start mining on that just like they would any longest chain rule,"" Viglione said.  Additionally, to prevent such network splits from being permanent, Viglione said that penalties decrease on the accepted chain.  ""Blocks are added and there's a negative one decrement to the penalty that was previously assessed, so there's always a convergence that can happen to prevent the network partition being permanent,"" he told CoinDesk.  An age old question  Accompanying the release, a white paper states that should a chain of blocks be rejected due to being too far behind the most recent block, exchanges can freeze suspicious deposits until the situation is resolved.  Additionally, Viglione said the specifics of the penalties can be tweaked depending on network conditions.  ""We can tune and dial up the cost if we ever think it's insufficient relative to hashrates and all that,"" he told CoinDesk.  Still, it's worth noting that such changes have long been the subject of research, and others are skeptical about whether Horizen can achieve its claims.  For example, leading ethereum proof-of-stake researcher Vlad Zamfir noted that while he had yet to dig into Horizen's new code, ""the design space doesn't include miracles.""  Additionally, consensus researcher Emin Gur Sirer expressed skepticism, telling CoinDesk, ""these protocols are subtle and difficult to get right.""  But, following several months of testing, Viglione is confident that the new algorithm works well in practice, and hopes it can set an example for the broader cryptocurrency industry.  ""We've been testing it internally for a little while now, a couple of months, so we're pretty confident with the code,"" Viglione said, adding:  ""I'd imagine that other projects should, they really should update their code as well.""

Announced in a press release, the New York-licensed exchange said that Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto – previously chief operating officer at the Nasdaq-owned International Securities Exchange (ISE) – is joining the firm as managing director of operations on Wednesday.  Her role will focus on ""supervising Gemini's institutional onboarding and expanding client services team,"" the company said.  Prior to the new appointment, Hightower-Sellitto spent 13 years at ISE – a major U.S. options trading platform – and managed the company's transition after its full acquisition by Nasdaq in June 2016 for $1.1 billion.  Gemini president Cameron Winklevoss said in the release:  ""Jeanine's depth of knowledge and experience in the financial industry makes her a valuable asset to our organization and our customers.""  Hightower-Sellitto is the latest executive addition to the Gemini team and her hiring comes at a time when the crypto trading platform is looking to expand its services for institutional investors.  In July, Gemini hired former chief information officer at the New York Stock Exchange, Robert Cornish, to serve as its first chief technology officer. The exchange said at the time that Cornish would be in charge of Gemini's technology team and strategy, as well as overseeing deployment of a Nasdaq market surveillance system at the firm.  Seeking to assure investors of its reliability, Gemini also recently obtained insurance coverage for the digital assets in its custody. Its fiat currency holdings are already covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The exchange said at the time that ""consumers are looking for the same levels of insured protection they're used to being afforded by traditional financial institutions.""

42401963,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38rm,1539172800,Bitcoin Price Stuck Below Key Hurdle For Fourth Week Running,"Bitcoin is having a tough time scaling a key moving average hurdle that has kept the bulls in check for four weeks straight.  The obstacle that is proving so hard to beat is the 10-week exponential moving average (EMA), which stalled a rally attempt from around $6,100 in mid-September.  Since then, BTC has notably failed to produce a weekly close (Sunday's close as per UTC) above the EMA, establishing it as a crucial level to beat for the bulls.  At press time, BTC is trading at $6,580 on Bitfinex, having clocked a weekly high of $6,730 on Monday. The 10-week EMA, meanwhile, is flatlined at $6,698.  The retreat in the last three days indicates that BTC has failed yet again to leap the EMA hurdle, weakening the odds of further gains toward $7,000.  Weekly chart  As seen in the chart above, the 10-week EMA has been firmly capping bitcoin prices for a month.  On Monday, BTC crossed the trendline sloping downwards from July highs, confirming a bullish breakout. While one would have expected the price to now be well above the 10-week EMA hurdle, the EMA hurdle is, in fact, still intact.  The rejection at the 10-week EMA despite the upside break on Monday may now embolden the bears.  View  BTC's failure to keep gains above the 10-week EMA despite the trendline breakout has boosted the odds of a drop to $6,424 (last week's doji candle low).  A violation there would open up downside toward the psychological resistance of $6,000.  A convincing break above the 10-week EMA of $6,698 would signal a continuation of the rally from the September low of $6,100 and would open up upside toward September highs above $7,400.

Announced Wednesday, the partnership is aimed at helping Citizens Reserve, lead by a team of former Deloitte blockchain employees, and its clients more quickly deploy nodes using tools developed by Blockdaemon, enabling users to more easily join the former's SUKU ""supply chain-as-a-service"" blockchain platform.  This, in turn, aims to reduce the time and effort required by clients before they can begin processing transactions through SUKU, which is built upon the Quorum blockchain.  Blockdaemon specializes in helping groups deploy blockchain networks. It received venture funding from the venture wing of telecommunications giant Comcast, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  Citizens Reserve CEO Eric Piscini told CoinDesk that the partnership has been several months in the making, and while his startup is still optimizing its product, the two companies will begin offering clients this new assistance by the end of the year.  ""We want to be able to deploy a node into one of our technology partners in an hour, that's the goal. We were able to do that [and] we exceeded expectations [by deploying] within 15 minutes,"" he told CoinDesk.  Konstantin Richter, CEO and founder of Blockdaemon, told CoinDesk that the Citizens Reserve team was ""always on the cutting edge of the latest blockchain tooling.""  ""Citizens Reserve is aiming to offer a very professional and functional product for the supply-chain vertical, where participants are focused on their use-case, rather than extensive back-end [and] infrastructure orchestration,"" he explained in an email.  Blockdaemon similarly hopes to ""offer security and decentralization combined with ease of use,"" chiefly by simplifying the process of deploying, connecting and monitoring nodes, he added.  The partnership will be a long-term arrangement as well, according to Piscini. While the existing marketplace is ""working great,"" the companies are continuing to integrate their platforms and services.  ""It's a real partnership that's extremely critical ... we're not here for one event or one activity, we're here for the very long term,"" he concluded.

42401957,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38nq,1539169156,Blockchain Finance Startup Clearmatics Raises $12 Million in New Funding,"Blockchain finance firm Clearmatics Technologies has raised over $12 million in a Series A funding round led by venture capital firm Route 66 Ventures.  Additional investment in the funding round came from private equity firm TNF Capital and XTX Ventures, the venture capital arm of electronic market-making firm XTX Markets.  As part of the arrangement, Samir Khosla, a managing partner at TNF Capital, will join Clearmatics' board of directors.  Khosla said his company was pleased to deepen its commitment to Clearmatics and praised ""its exceptional team under the leadership of Robert Sams, a visionary innovator, bringing transformative change to financial market infrastructure.""  Founded in 2015, Clearmatics has adapted the ethereum blockchain to build ""Decentralised Clearing Networks"", which are private, member-owned networks designed to automate the lifecycle of financial derivative contracts without the need for third parties. The firm notably boasts ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as an adviser.  Back in May of this year, the firm teamed up with Axoni for a milestone demonstration of how a financial derivative could instigate a cross-chain atomic transfer of value between two distinct networks. It represented the first time a derivatives contract had been originated on one enterprise blockchain and settled on another.  Elsewhere, Clearmatics is the technology provider to the Utility Settlement Coin Project (USC), a consortium of 17 banks and financial institutions creating a new digital cash instrument collateralized by central bank money.  That effort was the focus of some recent jockeying by fellow enterprise-focused startup R3. As reported by CoinDesk last month, R3 tried unsuccessfully to muscle in on the USC project, proposing that it be built on the Corda platform. However, the idea was unanimously rejected by the 17 consortium members when put to a vote.  With the latest funding, Clearmatics said it plans to expand its team (currently there over 30 staff between its headquarters in London and Silicon Valley) and also launch a Protocol Provider service next year to support the go-to-market of the USC project.  ""We are very excited to be working with investors who are so committed to disrupting legacy market structure through technology,"" Clearmatics CEO Robert Sams said in a statement.

42401949,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38gx,1539163861,Coinbase Confident Japanese Crypto Exchange License Arriving in 2019,"A senior executive of the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase has said he is confident the firm will receive an operating license in Japan next year, even while regulators in the country are stepping up scrutiny of crypto exchanges.  Mike Lempres, chief policy officer of Coinbase, said that the process of getting a license is ""going well"" with the Financial Services Agency (FSA), Nikkei Asian Review reported Wednesday. He added that the company is ""committed to getting it done,"" which will ""certainly be in 2019.""  The company announced its plan to enter the Japanese market in 2016, and appointed former Morgan Stanley Japan staffer Nao Kitazawa to head its local office in June.  As CoinDesk reported last month, Lempres has moved on from his previous role as the chief legal officer for the exchange, and now works on government affairs.  He said that security is currently the top concern at the FSA, which regulates Japan's financial markets, following two major crypto exchange hacks in the nation this year: Coincheck in January and Zaif in September.  The FSA has not yet issued any crypto exchange licenses so far this year, despite having reviewed 16 applications. Meanwhile, more than 160 firms including public companies are planning to apply for exchange licenses, as CoinDesk has reported.  Still, Lempres claimed that the watchdog's toughened stance would actually work in Coinbase's favor, since the exchange stores 99 percent of its funds offline in cold wallets that are not connected to the internet, making a significant cyber-attack far less likely.  ""The Japanese government is more focused on security,"" he was quoted as saying, adding: ""That is good for us.""  The main issue now, he added, is whether Coinbase will be required by the FSA to duplicate its U.S. system inside Japan. That approach would help the FSA monitor transactions, but could raise the possibility of a hack, Lempres warned.  ""We have everything built to protect our storage... in the U.S. ... It would be hard for us to duplicate what we do in the U.S. today in Japan and other countries,"" he said.

In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Ravi Menon, the institution's managing director, said the central bank is trying to ""bring the banks and cryptocurrency fintech startups together to see if there's some understanding they can reach.""  Menon added that a major issue currently facing Singapore-based crypto startups is that traditional banks are reluctant to open bank accounts because some aspects of the industry could appear ""obscure and dangerous"" to both regulators and financial institutions.  ""The nature of this business is a bit different, so banks may need to employ other ways in which they can establish bona fide,"" Menon was quoted as saying.  He added:  ""I hope we can bring minds together on this so that we can get over this hurdle.""  That said, Menon cautioned that this approach does not mean the MAS will adopt a loose regulatory stance just to attract crypto startups.  The central bank, he said, currently has no intention to employ a licensing scheme for crypto exchanges as its Japanese counterpart has done – assigning licenses to 16 Japanese exchanges so far, in part, to help them obtain banking support.  As CoinDesk reported in mid-September, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is now seeking to open a fiat-to-crypto exchange in Singapore that supports trading pairs for the Singapore dollars.

42401945,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd38d1,1539145858,PBoC Op-Ed Pushes Use Case for Yuan-Pegged Crypto Stablecoins,"China should increase its research efforts on the topic of stablecoins and consider backing domestic institutions issuing yuan-pegged cryptocurrencies, a researcher from the People's Bank of China (PBoC) argues.  The comments come in an op-ed piece published Tuesday by CN Finance, a bi-weekly magazine and a mouthpiece of the Chinese central bank, and co-authored by Li Liangsong, PBoC researcher and a professor from China's Fudan University.  The article – titled ""A Brief Analysis of Stablecoins"" – explores the recent development of stablecoins globally, with most so far having been anchored to the U.S. dollar, including some backed by regulators such as the Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and Paxos Standard.  The authors go on to argue that the development of USD-pegged cryptocurrencies will strengthen the dominant role of the dollar in the global monetary system, but could have a negative effect on other major fiat currencies.  ""If the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins can eventually be widely recognized by the market and can prove their use in the real economy, we should double down on our research efforts [on the issue] and learn from relevant experience to support domestic institutions to issue yuan-pegged crypto stablecoins,"" the authors state.  Seemingly echoing that point, crypto exchange OKCoin's founder, Star Xu, said on Wednesday in a Weibo post that he believes the ""Trend of issuing a Chinese yuan stablecoin is inevitable. And OKCoin USA will participate in rolling out a regulated stablecoin.""  That said, the authors of the CN Finance article also pointed out there's still a long way to go before stablecoins can make a real impact on worldwide economies.  ""If stablecoins can scale eventually, the role of central banks could be in a dilemma. Fiat currencies issued by central banks will become collateral to back stablecoins, but will not end up in the market circulation. That will limit the role of central banks in payment settlements and monetary policies,"" the authors say.  They conclude:  ""The evolution of this monetary system will likely be eventually achieved by a central bank-issued fiat digital currency.""
