42399697,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyR8J,1490137216,Circle Urges User Caution As Bitcoin Hard Fork Looms,"Payments startup Circle suggested in an email to users today that, in order to avoid the potential negative consequences of a hard fork on the network, they may want to to sell their bitcoins.  In an email late Monday, Circle – which dropped support for buying and selling bitcoin in December, but still offers wallet services – outlined its contingency plan ahead of a possible network split.  According to Circle's missive (which accompanied a lengthy update to the its user agreement), its bitcoin services could be disrupted ""for an extended period of time"" should a fork take place. Services interrupted would include the ability for users to convert holdings from bitcoin to another available currency on the platform.  Yet, Circle went on to advise users to move their bitcoins to other platforms – or consider selling them altogether.  The startup wrote:  ""The only way to avoid the potential negative consequences of a bitcoin fork is to not hold bitcoin. Just go to Settings > Currency and convert your balance to dollars, pounds or euro (availability is based on where you live). You'll then be able to hold those funds with Circle or cash out instantly.""  According to the language added to the user agreement, Circle indicated that the disruption of its bitcoin services could happen within a short span of time and ""until Circle has determined in its sole discretion that such functionality can be restored"".  ""This bitcoin downtime will likely occur immediately upon a 'fork' of bitcoin with little to no warning, and during this period of bitcoin downtime you will not have access to bitcoin that you hold in your Circle account,"" the startup wrote.  The comments are the latest the find representatives from the technology's business community weighing in on bitcoin's scaling debate, a years-long dispute over the network's future that has escalated in recent days.  Miners and developers are now showing a determination to back separate roadmaps for the technology, adding to widespread perception two competing bitcoin blockchains (and bitcoin tokens) could soon become available on the market.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Circle.

42399694,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyR5M,1490130409,Western Union Seeks Patent for Digital Currency Analysis,"Money transfer giant Western Union is seeking a patent for a transaction analysis system that could be applied to digital currencies like bitcoin.  The US Patent and Trademark Office (USTPO) published Western Union's patent application for methods and systems related to ""multi-network transaction analysis"" on 16th March. The application, which lists 6 inventors, was originally submitted in September of last year.  While not overtly related to the tech, the system, according to the description, is applicable to the realm of cryptocurrencies. Rather, it's a broader effort to develop a means to analyze ""location-based transaction system[s]"", one that could be adjusted to incorporate transactions involving bitcoin or other digital currencies. Bitcoin itself is named once in the application, along with litecoin and peercoin.  The application states:  ""...in various embodiments, electronic data transfer network may be configured to support and perform transfers of various currency types, including traditional and/or digital currencies, centralized and/or de-centralized currencies, cryptocurrencies, and any other medium of exchange...between client devices and/or external systems in different areas, regions, or jurisdictions.""  Its submission is perhaps unsurprising, given Western Union's prior interest in patents related to the tech and its partnership with distributed ledger startup Ripple, first unveiled in April 2015.  The firm also advocated for the imposition of AML controls on digital currency businesses in the run-up to New York's BitLicense regulatory framework.

42399701,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyRDE,1490122130,DAO Manager Aragon Gets Alpha Release,"Aragon, a administrative platform for decentralized organizations built on ethereum, has released a new alpha client for testing.  Unveiled in February, Aragon aims to provide a means for establishing governance mechanisms for decentralized autonomous corporations, or DACs, with support for voting, budgeting and the creation of bylaws, among other features.  In recent weeks, the team behind the project has been quietly bug-testing an early version of the platform with members of the ethereum community, setting the stage for today's publication.  Project lead Luis Cuende, who co-founded blockchain startup Stampery, wrote of the release:  ""And after a lot of work, we are comfortable and proud with the current state of the product. Proud enough to make it public. So, today, we are releasing Aragon Alpha to the world.""  Though not live on the public network, Aragon is available for experimentation on the Kovan testnet, which was launched earlier this month and is backed by a number of startups working with ethereum. The alpha software has been released for MacOS, Linux and Windows.  The software publication also builds on past work. According to Aragon, more than 130 DACs have been established on the platform, while also drawing over 300 participants to its developer Slack channel.

42399693,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyR6L,1490116814,Ethereum Developers Publish Roadmap for EVM Upgrade,"Plans to build a new version of the ethereum virtual machine (EVM) are moving ahead.  A group of developers is working to replace the existing EVM – which enables the utilization of scripts on ethereum – with one built on the WebAssembly, or wasm, programming language. WebAssembly was launched in 2015, backed by a team drawn from Google and Microsoft, among other companies.  In a new blog post published today, Martin Becze, the Ethereum Foundation's JavaScript client developer, outlined the next stages of the eWASM initiative, which will include the launch of a test network sometime this year.  According to Becze, that testnet will serve as a hub for continued experimentation, including work on a planned shift to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, dubbed Casper.  Becze wrote:  ""The testnet work will: enable hands-on work with eWASM for a wider audience...[and] enable related work, such as experiments with Casper to be done by providing a flexible platform for experimentation.""  The eWASM implementation has many perceived advantages. The language change would allow for script executions at ""near-native speed"" by taking advantage of hardware capabilities. This would further enable a wide array of uses that typically require high performance and throughput capacity.  According to the blog post, the eWASM team is also developing tools to support the incorporation of WebAssembly, as well as a further integration with the Solidity smart contract programming language in preparation of a future hackathon.

42399706,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyRGB,1490113205,Sell and Short: Bitcoin Traders Are Preparing for a Possible Fork,"Traders are reducing their exposure to bitcoin ahead of what they say is the increasing likelihood that its network could split into two competing blockchains with two separate assets.  In conversation with CoinDesk, a wide range of traders are reporting they are preparing for a potential split by pulling capital from the market or otherwise placing bets that the digital currency's price will decline in the short term.  The development is the latest that stems from the increasing discussion about whether bitcoin could see a ""hard fork"", a process by which new software could be introduced that alters the existing rules of the network.  Harry Yeh, managing partner at Binary Financial, a firm that helps high net-worth individuals purchase bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, said the company has exited the market in anticipation of volatility ahead.  Yeh told CoinDesk:  ""We liquidated our position in bitcoin. We still have some, but the majority of our holdings are just sitting on the sidelines.""  Tim Enneking, chairman of hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, an industry veteran who formerly served as a partner for a firm that had nearly 100,000 BTC under its management, indicated a similar strategy.  ""We've moved almost entirely out of bitcoin. We don't think much is going to [happen] until the fork,"" he said.  The comments come amid new attention to alternative software implementations such as Bitcoin Unlimited, the software currently favored by a notable contingent of the industry's largest mining hardware manufacturers and mining software providers.  Recent weeks have seen a recasting of the scaling debate, with miners and developers largely backing separate paths forward for the network.  As this initiative has gained steam, a group of almost 20 exchanges has issued a contingency plan, which details how they would handle a split in an attempt to allow a free market decision on a dominant software.  Big shorts  Other smaller trading firms and individual investors noted a similar sentiment in the wake of recent news.  For example, Vinny Lingham, an investor and entrepreneur, emphasized how important the scaling issue has become to investors.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I have sold the majority of my bitcoin holdings, about 90%, earlier this month, and I do not intend to repurchase any bitcoins for long-term holdings until there is clarity on a path forward.""  This sentiment seemed to cross geographical lines as well, with major over-the-counter (OTC) firms and traders in China reporting that they, too, are taking steps to position ahead of what could be a period of volatility.  OTC trader Zhao Dong and Zhou Shouji, operator of OTC trading firm FinTech Blockchain Group, both reported that they intend to short the cryptocurrency ahead of any decision.  FinTech Blockchain Group boasts $20m in assets under management, while Zhao trades about $250,000 in the digital currency daily.  Money to be made  However, market stakeholders mostly believe a bitcoin network split would be a boon for traders – who can make money ""up or down"" in the market.  Cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff offered a more optimistic point of view, noting how ethereum's network split offered investors both another asset and new trading capital.  In the event of a network split, users would possess an equal amount of cryptocurrency on both networks. This is because their bitcoin private key – a string of code that grants ownership of the coin and allows them to be used – would be compatible with both the original chain as well as the new one.  In Eliosoff's view, traders should adopt a wait-and-see approach.  ""Most holders don't need to make any rash decisions after a split. By default, you now just own coins on both chains,"" he argued, adding:  ""The simple thing to do is hang onto both and let the market sort it out.""

The capital markets infrastructure-focused project was announced last November, with the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Exchange, in conjunction with the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, forming the initial members of the group. On 17th March, a slate of new members was revealed, including Mizuho Bank, Daiwa Securities Group, Merrill Lynch Japan Securities and Nomura Holdings, among others.  The project has attracted the participation of several key regulators, including Japans's central bank and the Financial Service Agency (FSA), the country's top markets watchdog. The Japan Securities Dealers Association, an industry self-regulatory organization (SRO), is also taking part.  According to JPX, additional resources are being brought online this month, and that starting in April, software testing amongst the consortium's stakeholders will begin.  The firm said in its announcement:  ""We will be launching a community website for registered participants in March. Furthermore, in terms of the actual testing environment, we plan to release the first user application for this series in April.""  JPX has said in the past that it seeks to explore the distributed ledger technology (DLT) ecosystem for potential applications. Last February, the group announced that it was working with IBM to further experiment with the tech.  That the consortium would grow is perhaps unsurprising, as JPX signaled its intention to expand membership in the months after launch.  “We will seek participation from a wide range of Japanese financial institutions in order to gather broad industrial expertise,"" the firm said at the time.

42399691,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyR3O,1490103774,Nevada Lawmaker Moves to Block Taxes on Blockchain Transactions,"A new bill filed in the Nevada Senate would, if passed, prevent local authorities from imposing fees or taxes on the use of a blockchain.  Nevada Senate Bill 398http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/BDR/BDR79_59-0158.pdf  , filed yesterday and introduced by Senator Ben Kieckhefer, seeks in part to create a legal basis under state law for the use of blockchain-based records and contracts.  Notably, the bill would also prohibit local governments from taxing the use of the tech or requiring the use of a licensure for that purpose.  The proposed legislation states:  ""A local governmental entity shall not: (a) Impose any tax or fee on the use of a blockchain or smart contract by any person or entity; (b) Require any person or entity to obtain from the local governmental entity any certificate, license or permit to use a blockchain or smart contract; or (c) Impose any other requirement relating to the use of a blockchain or smart contract by any person or entity.""  The bill’s impact wouldn’t be limited to those potential economic costs, however.  Kieckhefer's proposal would prohibit the exclusion of blockchain records in ""proceedings"", noting at one point that ""if a law requires a record to be in writing, submission of a blockchain which electronically contains the record satisfies the law"".  ""A smart contract, record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because a blockchain was used to create, store or verify the smart contract, record or signature,"" the bill goes on to state. ""In a proceeding, evidence of a smart contract, record or signature must not be excluded solely because a blockchain was used to create, store or verify the smart contract, record or signature.""  The proposal is similar to a bill put forward in Arizona last month, constituting a further move to legitimize the use of blockchain records at the state level, with a previous effort also being pursued last year in Vermont.

42399692,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyR4N,1490095807,Threat or Opportunity? Blythe Masters Talks Blockchain Jobs Impact,"In the world of blockchain, 'increased efficiency' is becoming the euphemism used to address what could be a decline in jobs brought about by the technology.  With billions of dollars expected to be saved every year by moving transactions to blockchains or distributed ledger systems, what's often lost in the conversation is that much of this money will likely stem from a reduction in salaries currently paid to real, working people.  However, there are signs that this issue is beginning to garner attention.  Addressing the matter last week was Blythe Masters, CEO of one of the industry's best-funded startups, New York-based Digital Asset Holdings.  In her remarks to several hundred industry leaders at the DC Blockchain Summit, Masters shifted the focus to how the wider job market – not just corporate executives – might benefit from blockchain.  Masters told attendees:  ""We actively, as an industry, have to get this technology right, in order to really see it create something foundational that will release the big gains, and the big benefits that will ultimately flow through to your man on the street.""  While industry numbers are only now beginning to be researched, Masters positioned blockchain in the same category as robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence – all industries that she believes need to consider the impact of their innovations on public policy surrounding job creation.  According to Masters' own estimation, blockchain's impact will go far beyond the 5–10% of employees that she says ""any well-disciplined organization will naturally try to squeeze out"" in the process of improving processes.  Instead, she estimates that 30–60% of jobs could be rendered redundant by the simple fact that people are able to share data securely with a common record.  During a 'fireside chat' with the Chamber of Digital Commerce executive director Perianne Boring, Masters became the latest of a growing number of executives in the tech sector to assert that innovators need to do a better job of considering the impact of their inventions on, well, jobs.  Measuring the impact  Still, the study of the potential impact of blockchain tech on jobs has been largely qualitative to date.  So far, the number of jobs created by the industry appears to exceed the number of available professionals qualified to fill them, but some aren't satisfied this trend will continue.  To better understand the impact of blockchain on a wide variety of jobs in the future, the Blockchain Research Institute last week launched a year-long study into the matter.  Further, earlier this month, Aite Group released a report that found the largest employers in the blockchain industry each employ about 100 people.  Masters' own company has about this number of employees, she said, of which she estimates two-thirds are engineers or product specialists. As a result, public policy should have a ""ruthless focus on education in science, technology, engineering and math"", she suggested.  In contrast, Masters also questioned the current US presidential administration’s focus on saving jobs by making policy aimed at controlling trade.  She said:  ""It will be interesting to see whether that vision of what needs to happen is something that gets focused on, or whether we rely on other more defensive things like trade wars, which won’t necessarily, in the long run, in my humble opinion, get us there quite so effectively as focusing on education.""  A larger responsibility?  Masters is the latest in a series of experts to publicly question whether the tech industry might need to be more thoughtful about its impact on jobs.  Most recently, the founder of tech blog Recode, Kara Swisher, credited the popularity of President Donald Trump to his promise to create jobs by controlling trade.  What those in blockchain might refer to as 'increased efficiency', Swisher described as ""negative externalities"" that are being ""shrugged off"" by inventors.  At the conference, Masters echoed Swisher’s own question about whether anyone was thinking about the ""repercussions"" of disruptive technology,  Comparing the potential impact of blockchain tech on jobs to that of AI-powered, self-driving cars on Uber's employees, she said:  ""Initially, the disruption is to the dispatchers and the corporations, but medium term that’s going to be to the drivers, because Uber is going to have driverless vehicles, and what does that mean for employment consequences?""  Trickle-down effect  While much of Masters' time was dedicated to urging the audience to think about the potentially negative impact their work could have on jobs, it wasn’t all doom and gloom at last week’s event.  Masters also took pains to assert the potential benefits of the technology beyond merely saving companies money, saying: ""Here is an opportunity that is both a threat and an opportunity.""  Specifically, the CEO hinted that the efficiencies afforded by distributed ledger technology should someday result in a normal investor receiving ""an extra 50 basis points on his savings so he actually has a chance of retiring comfortably"".  She concluded by saying:  ""That’s where the industry is trying to get to now.""

42379313,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SBL,1490088671,Aborted ENS Launch Marks Latest Setback for Ethereum Apps,"Ethereum developers had to shutter a highly anticipated app last week when two critical bugs provoked security concerns shortly after launch.  Armed with a countdown clock and a big vision, the Ethereum Name System (ENS) was perhaps one of the most-anticipated projects on the network to date – notable in that it was briefly launched on the main network and that development was led by Ethereum Foundation employees Nick Johnson and Alex Van de Sande.  Launched on the main network on Monday, the idea behind ENS is to offer a decentralized way to register domain names on top of ethereum.  Yet, soon after the app went live, bugs came to light – including one that would have allowed bidders to claims domain names without paying for them. After a second error was found the same day, the team decided to reel in the project, at least temporarily.  ""We'll back off, improve testing and validation, write a postmortem, and relaunch when ready,"" Johnson tweeted.  Van de Sande, told CoinDesk:  ”I felt like having the rocket on the launch pad and aborting the launch during the countdown. It's frustrating, but much better than seeing it all blow up.”  While observers have noted that the bugs are evidence that ENS wasn't yet ready for the main ethereum network, it's worth noting that the team has been applauded for halting the project so quickly.  And no one lost money from the initial bids, Johnson said.  The bugs  As many supporters argue, bugs are to be expected on any new platform.  However, in ethereum, code issues have proven uniquely hazardous, since its smart contracts are supposed to be 'immutable' (that is, they can't be changed after the fact), including any and all errors.  The most notorious coding issue so far was ethereum's biggest project, The DAO, which collapsed as a result last summer. There have been lesser-known bugs too, such as one in the programming language Solidity.  Developers have been treading more carefully since, working more vigorously on new security tools in the wake of The DAO, such as software that proves code is free of particular types of vulnerabilities.  It perhaps has to be asked, since ENS ran on ethereum's testnet, Ropsten, for a period, why weren't the bugs detected before launch?  ""We did find and fix a few significant bugs on the testnet due to community feedback. I think it's definitely the case that the extra attention of a launch can bring with it the increased chance of finding a bug, though,"" Johnson told CoinDesk.  ""It is said that in order for an air accident to happen, multiple errors have to happen in sequence,"" Van de Sande said, implying that the spotting the errors was somewhat complex.  He further said that some of the code wasn't tested on Ropsten, so these issues ""were not in the testnet contract, they were introduced in code changes to the contract for issues found on the testnet"".  Others have argued that the launch of the main network saw higher traffic than in testing, which may have been why the bugs were found so quickly.  The ENS team indicated that it plans to unveil a more formal postmortem, a document outlining lessons learned, in the coming weeks.  Déjà vu?  Despite the rollback, the community's tone has been generally supportive of the technical team since the event, though some have expressed concerns, even comparing the project's failure to The DAO.  While not so much money was at stake this time round, issues in both projects were caused by errors in smart contract design.  One contributor to the project disagreed with comparisons to The DAO, however. Pseudonymous ENS contributor 'Maurelian' said that, for the domain project, the developers had used fail-safes aimed at preventing a similar disaster – including a smart contract that was partially centralized.  ""One lesson of 'TheDAO' was that some degree of central control should be maintained over smart contracts, especially in the early years of nascent ethereum technology development,"" the developer wrote.  Another developer, Taylor Van Orden from MyEthWallet, further warned against user complacency and trust in ethereum developers, saying:  ""Any time you trust someone to do something or expect something to go a certain way, based solely on their affiliation with a brand or past reputation, you're going to have a bad time.""  Highly awaited  Going forward, the plan is to relaunch the project once the team is confident the bugs are fixed.  When asked whether ENS is still a viable project, Johnson said that he believes so.  He said:  ""Yes, absolutely. It's worth noting that the bugs were in the registrar – the component that lets users register new domains. The ENS registry itself hasn't had any major bug findings. For the registrar, I feel we can improve it to the point we're confident in its security.""  Van de Sande added that the developers plan to proceed more cautiously next time.  ""We're now considering how to make the launch even more low profile,"" he said. This might even mean initially limiting the domain names available for purchase, in case something goes wrong.  Despite the setbacks, however, ethereum users seem to be still eagerly anticipating the app's relaunch.  Aragon, a platform that helps companies craft their own DAOs, indicated it plans to incorporate ENS into its offering one day.  Ethereum Foundation developer Nick Johnson suggested the community won't likely suffer serious delays before they can experience that ENS app.  He concluded:  ""We're optimistic the delay won't be a long one.""
