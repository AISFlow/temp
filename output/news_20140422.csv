42425602,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfnh,1398210840,Dorian Nakamoto Thanks Bitcoin Donors on YouTube,"Dorian Nakamoto, the California man who is Satoshi Nakamoto – but not the one the media is looking for – has appeared in a YouTube video thanking the bitcoin community for its support.  Bitcoin entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos organized the fundraiser as partial compensation for Nakamoto's recent troubles, after a Newsweek cover story 'revealed' him to be bitcoin's mysterious originator.  The appeal has raised over 47 BTC (roughly $23,000) and Nakamoto says he plans to keep his ""bitcoin account"" open and become a user.  In the three-minute video, Nakamoto appears alongside Antonopoulos and holds up a copy of Newsweek's now-infamous 'Bitcoin's Face' edition, repeating his denial that he was involved with bitcoin or its creation in any way:    ""I'm sure you guys will know that Satoshi Nakamoto is not me. But Leah [Goodman] thinks so, and Newsweek said so. But it's not true.      I'm very thankful for all these people in the US, Europe, Asia, in South America and Africa who supported me throughout. Thank you very much. I want to hug you, this 2000 of you who donated.""    He also mocks the notion that anyone wanting to anonymously unleash the world's most disruptive cryptocurrency to date would use their real name in online communications.  Newsweek and Nakamoto  Nakamoto, 64, who has suffered both unemployment and health problems in recent years, was hounded by the media after Newsweek's cover story appeared, causing him, he has said, further hardship.  Today's video is Nakamoto's first public statement since he hired a lawyer and made an official denial of Newsweek's claims in late March.  Newsweek and journalist Leah Goodman say they stand by those claims that Nakamoto created bitcoin, and the research behind them.  The magazine used the story to relaunch its print edition after its acquisition by new owner IBT Media, but was accused by many in the bitcoin community of rushing to release the story based on flimsy circumstantial evidence.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | RESEARCH,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/22/dorian-nakamoto-thanks-bitcoin-donors-on-youtube,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fa54d7f6bbe1bfb755d0559dcfcea2b39227c4b-1273x718.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425593,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfVh,1398205283,Voting Underway for Bitcoin Foundation Board of Directors,"The Bitcoin Foundation is now conducting elections to fill the two open industry seats on its Board of Directors.  The seats have been empty since the arrest of Charlie Shrem and the subsequent resignation of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, whose Japan-based bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.  Nominations began in February, with voting officially starting on 21st April. Voting is expected to last one week, and all Bitcoin Foundation industry members are eligible to vote.  Campaigning is now taking place via forums on the organization's website.  Current board members  The two winners of this week's election will join the five existing members of the group's Board of Directors. The only industry seat currently filled is held by Micky Malka, founder of Ribbit Capital.  Brian Goss, chair of the organization's election committee, explained to CoinDesk that the board was originally expanded from five members to seven last July, due in part to difficulties that resulted from a small number of members.    ""The way the board is set up, having five people on the board is tough to get a majority when you need it. It made it tough to pass anything when people were there, except the motion to adjourn.""              As such, these latest elections could be welcome to the current board, though no operating issues at the Foundation have been reported in the absence of Shrem or Karpeles.    Other members of the board include executive director and CoinDesk contributor Jon Matonis, chief scientist Gavin Andresen, Coinlab CEO Peter Vessenes and Bitcoin Magazine communications manager Elizabeth Ploshay.  Technical issues  So far, the elections have had a few technical hitches, resulting in the polling being briefly suspended until the problems were resolved. Goss took to the Bitcoin Foundation's forums today to address the matter.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Goss indicated the issues stemmed from how the system was reading the names of companies, which in turn led to issues with ballot deployment. A separate, earlier issue involving the use of the wrong mailing list was another cause for delay.  Goss wrote on the forum:  ""Sorry for the rough start, but, remember, we are shooting for as transparent an election as possible.""  Goss said that the voting system bug had been discovered and resolved within a short time, and that no further issues are anticipated.  Seeking strong candidates  Earlier this year, members of the Bitcoin Foundation's Board of Directors spoke with CoinDesk about the types of candidates they hope to attract in this election.  At the time, Matonis remarked that a new board member should know how to make the argument for bitcoin.  He said:  “A good candidate would understand bitcoin’s fundamental importance in the world and have a demonstrated capability of articulating that vision to a global audience.”  With voting underway for the rest of the week, it remains to be seen which two candidates will come out on top.  Each candidate has been asked to provide answers to questions from voters. To learn more about the candidates and their platforms, visit the Bitcoin Foundation's forums here.

42425596,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfbh,1398203112,US State Bank Supervisors to Discuss Bitcoin at Public Hearing,"In late February, the US Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), a membership organisation for state banking regulators that liaises with Congress, announced it would launch a new task force aimed at investigating emerging payments issues, including topics related to bitcoin and other digital currencies.  That effort, which is now just underway, will find the CSBS speaking to a wide range of payments industry stakeholders. To date, nine state banking officials have joined the task force, including New York Department of Financial Services superintendent Benjamin Lawsky.  The organisation's fact-finding mission will take one of its first steps on 16th May, when the CSBS will hold a public hearing on emerging payment issues in Chicago, Illinois.  Margaret Liu, Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of the CSBS, told CoinDesk that though this will be one of the task force's first actions, that doesn't mean that the task force has been inactive.  Liu said:  ""There's a lot of planning and learning going on.""  The hearing will be open to the public and to the media, though specific speakers have not yet been named.  Progress so far  Throughout the interview, Liu stressed that the CSBS task force is looking at a broad range of topics in the payments space, not simply digital currencies.  As such, it is still conducting research and has not yet identified specific areas of interest in the digital currency sector.  Said Liu:  ""We're looking at the hearing as an educational opportunity, as an opportunity to learn more about all the innovations in payments.""  Long term, the CSBS hopes to develop educational and training resources related to new payment mechanisms, and Liu suggested it may even discuss coordinated approaches to state regulation if necessary.  The later statement could please those in the bitcoin industry that have long lobbied for a standardised approach to US regulation that limits startup costs for new businesses.  Supporting role  CSBS members include state officials responsible for regulating banking in their states, however, it has no authority over their decision making. Liu clarified that each regulator operates under the authority of their respective state laws.  As such, the CSBS does not have an influence on policies, such as those put forth by New York and Texas regarding digital currencies.  Explained Liu:  ""We support them through efforts like this hearing, but they make their own decisions pursuant to their states laws and regulation.""  The CSBS Task Force is currently seeking proposals from potential presenters, though it also is taking a wide-lens approach to filling these positions, stating that it has intentionally sought a ""very broad"" approach to assessing potential speakers.  Those interested in finding out more about the hearing can do so via the CSBS website.

42425606,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfvh,1398195615,Inventor Creates Commercial Bitcoin Fuel Pump,"Despite the advancement of bitcoin at a number of major online retailers and in small businesses worldwide, certain major sectors still have yet to see any serious digital currency adoption.  For example, earlier this year, one gas station in Greeley, Colorado, became what was widely considered to be the first to begin accepting bitcoin, and three months later few, it seems, have followed suit.  This sluggish adoption could change, however, thanks to the efforts of bitcoin enthusiast and thermodynamics researcher Andy Schroder, who on 1st April revealed a prototype for a diesel fuel dispenser that accepts bitcoins.  Named the Bitcoin Fluid Dispenser II, the prototype was constructed from scratch by Schroder. The result is a fully functional gas pump that he says handles bitcoin's specific requirements while following the necessary guidelines for dispensing fuel commercially.  How it works  To begin, Schroder explains that users simply remove the fuel nozzle, and a unique bitcoin address will appear on the device displaying the current price of bitcoin per litre of gasoline.  From there, users scan the QR code, send their desired payment to the pump and collect their receipt.  The machine currently accepts only bitcoin, though Schroder told the Gliph company blog that additional forms of payment may need to be added for his invention to have market appeal.  The release follows Schroder's first attempt at a bitcoin-enabled fluid dispenser, after his original design in August 2013.  Ready for market  While certain improvements may still need to be made for the machine to become widely used, Schroder has indicated via his website that his current model is ready for pilot installation.  He notes that the ideal home for the unit would be at an independent, privately owned fuel station in the greater Cincinnati area that sells diesel fuel or kerosene.  Future features planned for the pumps include Bluetooth and NFC support, Bitcoin Payment Protocol integration and compatibility with more volatile fuels such as automobile and aviation gasoline.

42375624,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Ngf,1398192047,Is This Shape-Shifting Image the Logo Bitcoin Needs?,"UPDATE (May 18, 2022, 17:30 UTC): Clarifies that the designer was a student at the time and that the logo proposal was a school project.  A graphic design student has proposed that his new, multisided, shape-shifting bitcoin logo – a representation of the dynamic nature of the decentralized money, should be the symbol adopted by the bitcoin community.  The design, undertaken as a school project, is the latest development in an ongoing debate in the digital currency community. Years after bitcoin's creation, there still isn't consensus on what bitcoin's logo should be, with many arguing that the classic orange logo no longer suits the technology's goals.  The idea, as explained herehttp://jpbnyc.com/186441/2977939/work/bitcoin-graphic-identity, is to represent bitcoin not as a physical item, like money is today, but as something digital and thus more malleable.  📷  Behind the design  The student, named J P Brennerhttp://jpbnyc.com/186450/about, explained his rationale for the design in a lengthy post on his own website. There, he indicated his belief that bitcoin's lack of brand identity is contributing to consumer confusion regarding the technology.  Explained Brenner:  ""There is no need to visualize bitcoin as a physical gold coin as we know them today. After all, the bitcoin is about as much of a coin as an MP3, GIF or any other binary file.""  As a result, Brenner based his idea off of a shape known as a heptagon, a 7-sided polygon that can create an endless number of forms. He went on to say that the number seven has importance to bitcoin given it's goal of worldwide adoption - there are seven continents, and because the word bitcoin has seven letters.  Feedback on the proposal  Reaction in the bitcoin community toward Brenner's proposal was mixed.  Some, like Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of exchange platform Coinsetter, took issue with the design. He told CoinDesk:  ""I assume this is just a random person’s thought though and not a real movement.""  Others, like Vaughn Blake, the head of marketing and strategy for CoinMKT were more supportive:  ""Aesthetically, I'm a big fan, in some strange way it's changing nature gives the image a kind of tangibility. That said, it's too abstract to catch on with the mainstream.""  Marshall Hayner, co-founder of Quickcoin, says there isn't a better bitcoin logo design that improves from the original:  ""If the idea was to confuse, then I would call Brenner's logo a success. For now, I have yet to see a better logo than the current design.""  Reaction on Twitter has been similarly mixed.  — Jordan Semar (@jordansemar) April 22, 2014  Bitcoin's current logo  The current logo for BTC, which is used in storefronts and at point-of-sale systems around the world, has been used for some time now. The problem that has emerged, however, is that the logo is not in unicode, which makes it difficult to translate across different fonts.  📷  A proposal to use ‘Ƀ’ for the bitcoin symbol has been floated since it does work well as an existing unicode symbol.  Companies such as ATM manufacturer Lamassau already use it, and it doesn't require getting Unicode Consortium approval for acceptance; it just needs consensus.  In fact, using Brenner's design as bitcoin's logo leads to a problem in that it's more of a design than a usable symbol in text.  Even if a shape-shifting logo were suitable for bitcoin, the digital currency would still need some kind of representation in font form.  So, what's the best logo for bitcoin over the long haul?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/22/is-this-shape-shifting-image-the-logo-bitcoin-needs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/010d4de7adcac215321c2aa5b939f1af5e2e1868-600x446.gif?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425603,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfph,1398187217,BitPay to Match 1 BTC in Donations for BitGive Clean Water Campaign,"Update: (10th September 18:30 BST): The BitGive Foundation has announced that it has surpassed its $10,000 fundraising goal, raising more than $11,000 for The Water Project.      Georgia-based bitcoin merchant processor BitPay has announced plans to support the BitGive Foundation in its efforts to raise money for The Water Project, a non-profit that seeks to provide for safe drinking water in Africa.  BitGive is aiming to raise $10,000 in BTC, and kickstarted the campaign by donating the first 2 BTC earlier this year. Now, BitPay has pledged to match 1 BTC, provided bitcoin users first donate the equivalent amount.  The second major project headed by the BitGive Foundation, this effort aspires to fund an entire water project for one community in Sub-Saharan Africa, and was first launched on 24th February. To date, BitGive has raised $3,739.81 toward its $10,000 goal.  Said Connie Gallippi, BitGive's executive director:  “We are excited to launch this first project with BitPay and get the support of the Bitcoin community. Their donations will directly improve the lives of those in the Sub-Saharan Africa.”  The effort notably follows a similar campaign launched by the Dogecoin Foundation in March. That effort ultimately raised more than $50,000 to fund the creation of two water wells in support of World Water Day.  BitGive previously raised more than $4,500 for Save the Children's Philippines Typhoon Haiyan Children’s Relief Fund.  About BitGive Foundation  Announced in July 2013, the BitGive Foundation soon made its first appearance at the inaugural Inside Bitcoins NYC. It has thus far received significant donations from major bitcoin companies such as ButterflyLabs, KnCMiner and BitPay, its website says.  The BitGive Foundation's Board of Directors include general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation Patrick Murck; nonprofit industry veteran Madeline Finch; and software systems expert Stephen Pair.  Connie Gallippi, the sister of BitPay founder Tony Gallippi, also serves on its staff.  About The Water Project  The Water Project first began accepting bitcoin for donations on 23rd January, when its president, Peter Chasse, authored a detailed post on its site about the decision.  The message embraced all manner of digital currency donations, mentioning dogecoin, worldcoin and litecoin, among others.  However, The Water Project, which uses Coinbase as a processor, is not accepting donations in these currencies directly. First, those who wish to donate altcoins of their choice are encouraged to convert their holdings into bitcoin.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42425607,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIcfxh,1398185445,Manchester Co-op Gets a Hand From Dogecoin to Smash Fundraising Target,"A group of Mancunians fundraising for an ethical coffee shop and creative space have received a helping hand from the city’s small dogecoin community.  Manchester-based Future Artists Live Creative Coop was raising money to open The Home of Honest Coffee on King Street, which currently houses at least eight empty shop spaces. Halfway through their Kickstarter campaign, they were slightly behind their targets when the dogecoin donations started coming in.  Mark Ashmore, one of the key figures driving the campaign, was not exactly sure what to do with the $10 worth of dogecoin when he first received them.  “I knew about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but I didn’t know about dogecoin,” said Ashmore.  Dogecoin miner and enthusiast, Chris Buckey of Pixel Kicks was the first person to donate doge to the campaign.  “He donated $10 worth, which apparently is quite a lot,” said Ashmore.  “I didn’t know how to accept it, so he walked me through the process of how to set it up and the explained the exchange rate. Now I have a dogecoin wallet on my mobile phone and you can put donations in and I can take cash out.”  Buckey also set up Dogetipbot on Reddit, along with tweeting about the campaign to garner exposure.  The Kickstarter campaign has already surpassed its £5,000 goal and raised £5,571, at least £25 of which came as dogecoin donations. Ashmore says that dogecoins keep coming in everyday and on last check he had received about 90,000.  Buckley, who drove the dogecoin donations by publicizing the campaign, recognizes that £25 (or $40) isn’t a lot of money. However, he thinks the exposure helped Ashmore and the gang.  Buckley said:  “Dogecoin gave The Home of Honest Coffee a little bit of extra exposure that was needed and a week later, they hit their target. It was not directly through the money we raised with dogecoins, but with added exposure.""  And in return, Buckley met other dogecoin enthusiasts in the Manchester area after he took the lead on publicizing this initiative.  “There are quite a lot more than I actually thought,” said Buckley about the dogecoin community in Manchester. “I have been introduced to 5 or 10 people in the area after this.”  This isn't the first time the dogecoin community has come together to support a fundraising campaign. In January, they raised $25,000 for the Jamaican bobsleigh team which enabled them to participate in the Winter Olympics. The Dogecoin Foundation also raised $50,000 for Kenya's water crisis in March.  The Home of Honest Coffee  The idea behind The Home of Honest Coffee is to create a not-for-profit café, which would serve fair trade coffee and pump profits back into the community for health and well-being initiatives, businesses and startups. Above the coffee shop will be a co-working space that anyone can use for 5p a minute. It’s aimed at freelancers and small start-ups.  “You don’t need to use it everyday,” says Ashmore. “There is no membership fee. You could just drop in and drop out. There are a few examples of this set-up in London but there is nothing like this in Manchester.”  The Next Steps  Now that the team have exceeded their fundraising target, it’s time to start planning for the launch.  They are holding at meeting with their 155 or so backers next Tuesday to get their input on how to get things going. They are aiming to open the café in August and Ashmore says they’ll be accepting dogecoin and bitcoin from day one.  “We could accept digital currencies before we can accept normal ones,” he said.  As someone who just recently learned about accepting virtual currencies, Ashmore seems quite sold on the idea already.  “I got sent a cheque for a couple of grand for my business the other day. I took it to the bank to cash it in and it was a bank holiday and they said it would take 10 days for that £2000 to be available. On the other hand, these people sending me dogecoins are just tweeting it. And it’s in my account. There is no percentage going to anybody.”  So, Ashmore is excited about accepting dogecoin at The Home of Honest Coffee and Buckey is excited about spending his doge in Manchester, which currently lacks retail outlets accepting digital currencies.  “When it opens in August, I will be going to get a coffee and I will pay in dogecoins and hopefully be the first person to do so,” said Ashmore.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/22/manchester-co-op-gets-a-hand-from-dogecoin-to-smash-fundraising-target,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3e9ca40561ef5bf311378bde506fa41317d4be3-615x409.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

La Maison du Bitcoin  is the brainchild of entrepreneurs and bitcoin enthusiasts Thomas France (co-founder) and Eric Larchevêque (CEO and co-founder), who previously founded the price comparison and shopping app Prixing.  Sited right at the heart of the French capital – 35 Rue du Caire – the 220-square-metre space will offer flexible co-working space and assistance for bitcoin companies, along with workshops, hackathons, meetups and a Lamassu bitcoin ATM.  There will even be scrypt GPU and bitcoin ASIC mining rigs in operation, albeit for demonstration purposes rather than raising funds.  Startup focus  Larchevêque, who has been involved in Internet startups since 1996, told CoinDesk:  ""La Maison du Bitcoin is mainly dedicated to entrepreneurs with a co-working space and an incubator for bitcoin-related projects. We want to make it the place to launch and work on bitcoin startups in Paris.""  Larchevêque explained that, although bitcoin still has a low profile in France, he was not deterred: “[Paris] was an obvious choice as we are based here. Many observers told us, with sometimes good reasons, that we should relocate our project elsewhere in Europe, but we are strong believers in the French ecosystem in the long term.""  The project is funded by himself and co-founder France, said Larchevêque.  ""We are seasoned entrepreneurs, with already a few exits ... We are in talks with investors willing to back the incubator, or some of our early projects."" he added.  Raising bitcoin's profile  While France has yet to really catch on to the potential of digital currencies, recent events indicate that change is afoot.  In early April, major French retail chain Monoprix announced plans to start accepting bitcoin payments on its merchant website later this year.  Furthermore, Larchevêque indicated that Paymium, a French startup, will soon provide an e-merchant solution for bitcoin payments.  La Maison du Bitcoin aims to further raise the profile of digital currencies in the nation. As well as catering to new bitcoin businesses and enthusiasts, the aim is to educate the general public about bitcoin too.  Said Larchevêque:  ""We'll also have an area open to the public, where we'll install the first French bitcoin ATM, and experiment selling of bitcoin-related goods or services – miners, hardware wallets, goodies, and so on.""  ""Things are changing quickly,"" he added. ""The French Bitcoin community is getting bigger. It is true that there are right now only a few operating startups. This clearly demonstrates the need for a Maison du Bitcoin! France has a strong reputation for its IT and math engineers, there is no reason why the next big bitcoin company wouldn't be French.""

42397565,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYbV,1398169886,Vault of Satoshi Announces Proof-of-Solvency Service,"Bitcoin exchange Vault of Satoshi today launched a full public proof-of-solvency service for its customers, saying it is the first digital currency exchange in the world to do so.  The ""unapologetically Canadian"" company has embarked on a string of compliance and transparency initiatives in the past months. In March, it received a full Money Services Business licence to operate in all provinces of Canada and serve international customers in listed countries.  Vault of Satoshi  (VoS) said its new proof-of-solvency system is ""not just an audit"", but provides full proof via cryptographic trees that it holds all the bitcoins it claims to have in reserve.  Said Director of Marketing Adam Cochran:    ""At Vault of Satoshi we have always tried to embody the mantra of being an open, honest and transparent exchange. We feel it's our duty to do so when you make the decision to place your funds in our hands.      For this reason we have long sought after a way to prove our reserves to the public in a safe and reliable manner, while most exchanges issue a third-party audit, we felt that simply wasn't open enough – so today at Vault of Satoshi we are proud to announce full proof of solvency and the publication of our cold wallet.""    VoS said there may be a 5-6% discrepancy in total reserve value, as it has chosen not to publish its hot wallet address for security reasons.  Registered users can self validate both their balance and the overall reserves of the exchange by selecting 'BTC Proof of Solvency' in in the company's online Security Center.  ""From there, load the partial tree list, select 'online tools' and copy paste in the relevant information to validate the holdings,"" Cochran explained.  Demand for transparency  The announcement comes at a time of increasing exasperation at the number of bitcoin-related services (and their proprietors) that have suddenly vanished along with their customers' money. There is also a noticable reluctance to act, at least in a timely manner, on these cases by financial authorities or law enforcement.  Rather than lobbying for greater regulation, however, bitcoin users are instead calling on exchanges and wallet services to be more transparent in their operations, and to provide other guarantees that customer funds exist and are secure.  It's likely the digital currency world will soon see a rush to transparency as trust becomes one of its most valuable commodities.  Exchange Kraken recently passed an independent audit of its reserves with flying colors. In turn, Ripple's Stefan Thomas published the results of his proof-of-solvency audit of Bitfinex on The Bitcoin Talk forum earlier this month, revealing a reserve ratio of 102.82%.  Blockchain has always allowed its users to retain full control of their private keys. Other wallet services, like China's Bifubao, have unveiled cryptographic 'Merkle tree’ checking techniques that customers can access for greater peace of mind.  Enhanced features  Vault of Satoshi's new licensed Money Services Business status gives its Canadian and some international users a greater range of options when buying and trading digital currencies. It allows buying and selling via cheques, certified cheques, bill payments, the 'Interac' debit system, money orders, bank drafts, and bank wires.  The company also recently launched a 'Coin-to-Coin' feature that allowed customers to exchange any digital currency for another without needing to trade through one of the major currencies (ie: BTC or LTC). Non-verified users, who do not deal in any fiat currencies on the site, may also access this section of the exchange.

The wallet project has web, Android and even iOS versions. The Airbitz team was backed by Amir Taaki and Pablo Martin from the Dark Wallet and libbitcoin projects.  A P2P market for everyone  Dark Wallet developer Amir Taaki delivered the hackathon presentation, though he forgot to mention exactly what the team hacked. That was left to Airbitz developer William Swanson, who explained the DarkMarket concept in detail:  DarkMarket is a decentralised P2P marketplace  which cannot be shut down. It can be joined by anyone and in many respects it looks rather mature, with identity and reputation rankings, seller pages, multisig escrow, private messaging and privacy features.  DarkMarket is not envisioned as a black market for illicit goods. It is designed to level the playing field and help out emerging markets. The Attack Surface blog explains:  “The free market is any trade unregulated by the state. The term 'black market' arises from the inability of the state to see and thereby control trade, but applies equally to trade over which the state asserts no control. In a free market each exchange is a voluntary agreement between two parties.”  Hackathon winnings used for development  The blog cites World Bank research which found a strong correlation between formal account penetration and GDP per capita.  The results indicate that people in wealthier nations are more likely to rely on banks. Thus, businesses in developed markets would lose their competitive advantage if similar services were available in every market.  At the same time, a P2P market could – in theory – reduce the regulatory burden, allowing businesses to reduce their costs and improve competitiveness. Attack Surface concluded:  “The catch is that free markets do not exist on a large scale. The means of exchange itself is heavily regulated. In order to trade freely one must either accept unreasonable risk by lugging around piles of cash or join the heavily regulated financial system, with all of its various financial and privacy costs. [Cryptocurrency] is disrupting this model by enabling trade that does not rely on 'formal accounts'. People can trade in cash on a larger scale.”  Having stolen the show and walked off with $20,000 in bitcoins, the team say they will use their hackathon winnings to further develop libbitcoin, a project headed by Taaki and Martin. Some aspects of libbitcoin will be used in the development of Airbitz wallet.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/22/darkmarket-team-win-toronto-bitcoin-expo-hackathon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1aba2279319fc2fb77e71c23839f3ce0af8128e7-1228x914.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374523,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlClR,1398159399,MEVU's Wearable Bitcoin Wallet Can Make Payments With a Gesture,"Wearable technology startup MEVU has announced the first wearable bitcoin wallet that tracks movement in order to make payments.  Users of MEVU’s proof-of-concept bracelet – which is powered by Coinbase’s wallet API – will easily be able to send bitcoin with just a flick of the wrist.  Apurv Mishra, CEO and co-founder of MEVU, said that the use case for the company's wearable wallet is for small transactions such as tipping, whether in BTC, altcoins or perhaps even something else:  ""If we use bitcoin or any other currency, if it has the facility for tipping, I think that’s what people would want.""  The idea came from his fascination with community-based payments that are powered through software like Dogetipbot.  He explained:  ""[MEVU] could add a layer of payments for smaller value transactions: parking, tipping, and so on.""  The reason Mishra and his team think that microtransactions are the best fit for wearable wallets is that any amount larger than $20 probably requires more confirmation than just a gesture. Two-factor authentication using a mobile phone in conjunction with MEVU's device could help facilitate larger transactions, however.  The technology  The MEVU wristband is similar in form to the Nymi biometric wallet, but employs an advanced InvenSense motion sensor for its gesture functionality:  The transactions are transmitted to a point-of-sales (POS) device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is a common wireless feature on many mobile devices today. Said Mishra:  ""In BLE, we know the proximity, and then you use the gesture to authenticate the transaction.""  The decision to go with BLE as a remote method for bitcoin transactions comes from the technology's prevalence on a number of devices, according to Mishra:  ""Most iPads that are point-of-sale devices actually use BLE. So it can be really intuitive without adding any additional infrastructure.""  Apple issues  The problem currently, of course, is that Apple is not friendly to the idea of bitcoin wallets in its iOS ecosystem.  Mishra said that MEVU is developing a version of its software that will be compatible with Android. Many Android devices also use BLE, so the concept will easily port to that platform once the company has it ready within a few months.  Said Mishra:  ""With bitcoin, as we know, there are some challenges. We cannot bring this app to the Apple App Store. But I thought that demonstrating this is what we need, this is the direction, would be really interesting.""  Recently, PayPal CEO David Marcus cited BLE and wearables as two of three core ideas that could change retail payments. MEVU's concept is one realization of the future trends Marcus discusses in that blog post.  The best currency?  It's easy to question whether bitcoin is the best answer for microtransactions, since there is a good degree of speculative holding occurring.  The reality is, though, that for a startup like MEVU, it's really easy to hook up a bitcoin concept with Coinbase's wallet API, as opposed to integrating with other digital currencies, like dogecoin, which don't have readily accessible wallet APIs quite yet.  Furthermore, there are at least a million people with at least some bitcoin, so there could be market for technology that makes it easier to spend it.  About MEVU  As a wearable technology company, MEVU has previously focused on ways to capture motion in order to correct behaviors. Perfecting yoga postures and golf swings were applications that the company focused on in the beginning. That makes sense, given the sports appeal that wearable devices have right now.  Said Mishra:  ""We made sure that this motion sensing technology was so precise that we could use it for a number of applications.""  The company also said it is opening up its Linux-based ALIVE OS – MEVU's software platform – for developers to come up with other gesture-based applications.  MEVU was included in Boost VC's recent Winter Class of startups, which also invested in three bitcoin companies. Mishra said being around those bitcoin startups made the company want to do something that involved cryptocurrency:  ""My background is in wearable technology. But being [at Boost], I was like: 'Hey we have to do something in bitcoin'.""  Pre-orders for the wearable MEVU device will start within a month. The ALIVE OS early access for developers is now available from the company's website.
