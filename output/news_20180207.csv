42428533,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8eFh,1518042657,"Crypto Should Try Self-Regulation, CFTC Commissioner Says","Regulators are here to stay.  That was a common thread in the conversations Wednesday at Yahoo Finance's cryptocurrency event in New York.  Whether that's a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion. But even for those wary of government oversight, it's perhaps a less unpleasant thought in light of the previous day's hearing before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, where the chairmen of the SEC and the CFTC expressed a generally open attitude toward crypto.  Against that backdrop, Brian Quintenz, a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, pointed out that the Tuesday hearing was free of the scaremongering pronunciations that some in the ecosystem perhaps expected.  ""One of the other takeaways from yesterday was you didn’t hear either chairman say 'no, absolutely not, this is not safe, we must stop this at all costs.' No one said that,"" Quintenz said at the Yahoo event during an onstage interview with CoinDesk managing editor Marc Hochstein.  Noting that any congressional action to fill in jurisdictional gaps identified by the SEC and CFTC will likely take a long time, the commissioner called on the industry to consider forming a self-regulatory organization.  Successful examples of this model include the Financial Regulatory Industry Authority and the National Futures Association, he said. Such an organization would provide necessary oversight of the spot market and exchanges ""between now and however long Congress chooses to act,"" he said.  Quintenz went on to add:  ""We don’t want to be saying no to innovators, or to advancing technology.""  Speakers drawn from the startup ecosystem likewise struck diplomatic notes toward regulation.  Adam White, general manager of the Coinbase-operated digital asset exchange GDAX, said that government oversight was something the company welcomed.  ""I think we embrace regulation at Coinbase,"" he said. ""We recognize that regulations are a complementary part of the financial system in many ways.""  Ripple's 'revolution'  Similarly, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, stressed his company's longtime friendly posture toward regulators (which made it stand out from the libertarian early adopters of bitcoin), saying:  ""I don’t think the US dollar's going away in my lifetime. I don’t think the US government's going away in my lifetime. The revolution isn’t happening outside the system. The revolution's going to happen inside the system.""  For others, including BitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiello, regulation is an everyday reality, especially for businesses that serve as bridges between cryptocurrencies and government-issued money.  ""In an ideal world, we wouldn't have regulation. But in the real world, my customers ask me: 'Do we work with companies which [comply with investor rules]?” she said.  On the investor side, speaker Alex Sunnarborg, founding partner of hedge fund Tetras Capital, described how lack of regulatory oversight could have a significant impact, for example in Simple Agreements for Future Tokens. What if those future tokens are never delivered?  ""The big fear there is you enter into a SAFT which gives you a discount or allocation into a sale in the future … but the sale [doesn’t happen],"" he said.

42428522,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8dth,1518040820,New York Mandates Stronger Fraud Controls for Crypto Companies,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is pushing for companies that offer cryptocurrency services in the state to beef up their protective measures against fraud and market manipulation.  In a Wednesday statement, the office – which several years ago developed the BitLicense regulatory framework – released new guidance for firms, including those that have been issued either a BitLicense or a money transmission by the state.  The new guidance will require those companies to implement written policies that evaluate ""the full range of fraud-related and similar risk areas,"" including market manipulation, in addition to providing procedures and controls to safeguard consumers and investors from these risks. The guidance also mandates that virtual currency entities take steps to investigate fraud and wrongdoing, and upon the completion of a given investigation, to issue a statement summarizing the actions taken to resolve any fraud and wrongdoing.  Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement:  ""As the cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, DFS is directing virtual currency companies to take the necessary steps to guard against fraud, and to be extra vigilant about manipulation. By these actions, the market can evolve with strong regulatory supervision.""  The DFS' new guidance builds on New York's BitLicense framework, which was greenlit in 2015 in a move proved controversial within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, prompting the departure of several prominent startups. To date, only a handful of companies have been formally approved to offer such services in the state.

Do you research before investing any cryptocurrency, the audience was repeatedly warned. Especially if you don't understand it.  Goodwin Procter LLP partner Grant Fondo perhaps put it best, remarking that ""at some point, you may lose.""  ""Things go up and down,"" he continued. ""Some people put everything into one project, and I think that's a bad idea no matter how good an idea it seems.""  His fellow panelist, Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring, framed that point from the perspective of greater control on the part of the investor.  Such control, she warned, brings with it the need for research and critical thinking about where one's money is actually going.  She explained:  ""For the retail investor who wants to get involved in the blockchain ecosystem, whether through an [initial coin offering] or through other means, you really need to educate yourself. For the first time in, possibly, history, you can have control – but with that increased amount of control comes an increased amount of responsibility.""  The panel on which Boring and Fondo appeared was one of a number that touched on a range of subjects, including regulation and investor demographics in the crypto space, as well as what trends may shape the coming months and years in terms of the tech's trajectory.  'Faux blockchain'  As for what kinds of things would-be investors should be wary of, Blockstack's Ryan Shea named one in particular: Companies falsely claiming the mantle of decentralization through the use of blockchain.  ""Watch out for faux decentralization, and faux blockchain, because we're going to see some hybrids. But some companies are going to say ‘Oh yes, we’re decentralized and blockchain,’ but they’re not,"" Shea said. ""Watch out for these.""  Speaking more broadly, CoinDesk's director of research, Nolan Bauerle, suggested that those thinking of approaching the space – regardless of an intent to invest – need to do so in a ""serious"" manner.  ""I would say we are dealing with an extremely powerful technology, dealing with cryptography...don't come out with an unserious mind, come out with a serious mind,"" he commented.

42428536,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8eNh,1518019309,Grayscale Launches Fund for Top Cryptos (ETH Included),"The creator of the Bitcoin Investment Trust is today launching its fourth fund aimed at giving accredited investors a way to explore cryptocurrencies.  Unlike Grayscale's previous funds, which focus on bitcoin, ethereum classic and zcash, the offering, formally called the Digital Large Cap Fundhttps://grayscale.co/digital-large-cap/, is designed to give investors exposure to the five largest cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization.  At launch, the fund's shares will be solely invested in a basket of crypto assets that will initially include bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), ripple (XRP), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC).  The decision to include new currencies, and to sidestep other cryptocurrencies that are already offered by Grayscale, was based on the total value of the assets, according to Grayscale managing director, Michael Sonnenshein.  ""Investors are looking for broad market exposure to the digital currency asset class,"" said Sonnenshein, in interview today.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This gives them the ability to make a singular investment that is going to give them exposure to approximately 70 percent of the market via this one vehicle.""  Investors will buy shares in the private placement investment vehicle, which is backed by actual cryptocurrency, valued at 4:00 p.m. EST. The valuation will be based on the Digital Asset Reference Rate provided by institutional trading technology firm, TradeBlock.  Each digital asset will be evaluated, less the fund's expenses and other liabilities.  To account for changes in cryptocurrency market caps, it will be rebalanced on a quarterly basis, potentially removing existing digital assets and adding new assets. The fund is a passive investment vehicle that is not actively managed.  In addition to market cap, liquidity, operational requirements and the availability of custodial solutions will also be factors weighed during listing.  Additionally, the fund will not offer a redemption program at launch, meaning there is no assurance that the value of the shares will approximate the actual value of the assets held by the fund. The fund is offering shares on an ongoing basis to certain accredited investors as described by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Interestingly, the total assets under management by Grayscale, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, has decreased by almost $1 billion in the past couple months. In December, Silbert, the founder of DCG, tweeted the firm was managing $3 billion. In the current statement, that number has decreased to $2.1 billion.  As some of Grayscale’s previous fund can attest, the shares may trade at a substantial premium over the value of of the underlying asset if quoted on any secondary market in the future.  According to the official press release, Grayscale may eventually seek regulatory approval to operate a such a redemption program.  Sonnenshein further said that the firm intends to follow the path set forth by their first investment vehicle, the Bitcoin Investment trust, which trades over the counter with the ticker symbol, GBTC:OTCQX.  Sonnenshein said:  ""It will be our intention to create a public quotation about this in about a year's time.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.

42428528,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8e5h,1518006656,Token Trader Templum Just Bought a Broker-Dealer,"Blockchain startup Templum has acquired Liquid Markets Group's broker-dealer and alternative trading system Liquid M Capital LLC.  The regulated ""tokenized asset"" trading platform hopes to enable users to trade cryptocurrencies in compliance with U.S. securities regulations, notably treating digital assets as securities, the company announced in a press release today. Prior to the acquisition, Liquid M was a partner to Templum, enabling it to act as a digital exchange.  The firm also unveiled its board of advisors, which notably features former Securities and Exchange Commission Troy Parades, who served as a commissioner at the U.S. regulator between 2008 and 2013. The board also includes Jeffrey Bandman, a former FinTech advisor to Commodity Futures Trading Commission who was the architect and founding director of the agency's LabCFTC initiative; Lightning Labs co-founder and CEO Elizabeth Stark; and David Weild IV, a former vice chairman of NASDAQ.  Liquid M is a part of both the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a non-profit organization set up to protect customers in the event a broker-dealer fails, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory group aimed to protect investors from malicious securities firms.  Liquid Markets Group chief executive Vince Molinari said in the release that combining Templum's team with Liquid M's existing alternative trading system (ATS) and other assets will help ""position Templum to drive the evolution of this asset class.""  He continued:  ""We believe Templum's platform, standardization and commitment to investor protection will make Templum the leader in facilitating the offering and secondary trading of digital assets offered as securities.""  Last October, Templum raised $2.7 million in a seed funding round, which it intended to use to launch its trading platform. At the time, the firm's founder and CEO, Chris Pallotta, said that utilizing an ATS allows Templum to provide investors protection from possibly risky initial coin offerings.  The announcement is notable for its timing, coming just a day after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Jay Clayton noted that no company offering an ICO had registered their tokens as securities to date. During his testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, he stated that every ICO he had seen looked like a security offering.

As of writing, global average prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) are around $8,120. On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, bitcoin (BTC) moved above $7,944 – the confluence of 200-day moving average (MA) and 5-day MA – earlier today and was last seen changing hands at $8,200  The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 26 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Also, prices are up 38 percent from the previous day's low of $5,947.40, as per the BPI.  Across social media, the sharp rise in BTC is being attributed to the cautiously optimistic tone set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at a Senate hearing yesterday. Investors seem to have taken heart from the fact that members of Congress and the SEC see potential in blockchain technology. Also, industry observers were impressed by the measured and sophisticated nature of the dialogue.  So, it appears bitcoin has moved out of the hot water, and the technical studies seem to confirm that a bottom has been made.  4-hour chart: Bullish price RSI divergence  Daily chart: High-volume recovery        Weekly chart: Bearish MA crossover  The long-tailed candle indicates strong dip demand.  BTC is attempting a break above the trendline sloping upwards from the April 2017 low and July 2017 low.  The 5-MA and 10-MA bearish crossover (short-term MA cuts long-term MA from above) that occurred last month indicates that the long-run outlook still remains bearish.  View  BTC looks set to cut through the descending trendline hurdle (1) and rise towards the downward sloping 10-day MA currently seen at $8,925 in the next 24 hours.  A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA would open doors for a test of $10,000 – $10,623 (weekly 5-day MA). Further gains appear unlikely just yet, given the bearish crossover on the weekly chart.  Bear scenario: Failure to hold above the 10-day MA, followed by a close below the 200-day MA would revive the bearish outlook. In such a scenario, prices may drop to $5,000 levels.

In a European Parliament meeting on Feb. 5, the ECB's president, Mario Draghi, commented that the central bank is not seeing a ""notable holding of cryptocurrencies"" among banks in the region.  ""Actually, the credit institutions established in the European Union are showing a limited appetite for digital currencies like bitcoin, notwithstanding the high level of public interest,"" he added.  Yet, he indicated the belief that recent development in the market, such as the launch of bitcoin futures contracts in the U.S., may spark growing interest among the EU's financial institutions.  He also offered a warning that banks should be wary of the risk of holding cryptocurrencies due to high volatility and risk, as well as the absence of a specific supervisory framework.  While Draghi has stated before that the ECB has no authority to regulate cryptocurrencies, he concluded that exploration of their potential impact on the establishment is currently in progress through the Single Supervisory Mechanism. This allows the ECB to perform a supervisory role in monitoring financial stability among participating nations.  Draghi's comments also follow remarks made in October 2017 in which he said that cryptocurrencies are still too low-impact to be worth regulating within the EU.  Currently Europe is home to some of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitstamp and HitBTC, which together saw over $1 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore's deputy prime minister and chairman of Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said in a written response to MPs yesterday that cryptocurrency and related trading activity currently do not pose any threat to Singapore's finance system.  He stated that MAS has been ""closely studying these developments and the potential risks they pose. As of now, there is no strong case to ban cryptocurrency trading here.""  The comments came as a direct response to lawmakers Saktiandi Supaat, Lim Biow Chuan and Cheng Li Hui, who questioned the PM over possibility of banning cryptocurrency in Singapore, according to an order paper prior to a parliament meeting on Feb. 5.  The deputy PM wrote:  ""For now, the nature and scale of cryptocurrency trading in Singapore does not pose risks to the safety and integrity of our financial system. Its use in making payments is small, and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies in Singapore are also not high – they are much smaller than in countries like the U.S., Japan and South Korea.""  As such, Shanmugaratnam said, regulators ""do not have broader, systemic risk concerns with regard to cryptocurrencies.""  The comment is also in line with an October 2017 report in which Ravi Menon, managing director of MAS, indicated that the central bank would not regulate cryptocurrencies.  Yet, Shanmugaratnam stated in his written response that the institution is aware of the possible use of cryptocurrency in illicit activities such as money laundering and is taking relevant measures to tackle the issue.  MAS will be imposing anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) requirements on intermediaries that buy, sell or exchange cryptocurrencies, he said, adding: ""We set out this AML/CFT regulatory framework for virtual currency intermediaries last year as part of our public consultation on the proposed Payment Services Bill.""

42428538,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8eRh,1517995214,Bitcoin Up Over 20% as Crypto Markets Regain Poise,"Cryptocurrencies are trading in the green today after a tumultuous seven days.  In the last 24 hours, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has increased 25 percent to $352 billion, as per data provider CoinMarketCap. The total value had dropped to $276 billion yesterday – the lowest level since Nov. 26.  Though a welcome development, that figure is still down at least 30 percent from last Wednesday's high above $500 billion. Further, it's still 57 percent down compared to the record high of $830 billion seen in January.  As of writing, the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are reporting double-digit gains.  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has appreciated by 22 percent in the last 24 hours, again according to CoinMarketCap. As of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is showing the average price across global exchanges at $7,845.  So why the upturn? For one, market observers have told CoinDesk that the U.S. Senate's softer approach to regulating bitcoin, publicly discussed yesterday, bodes well for cryptocurrencies.  Furthermore, as per technical studies, the bitcoin sell-off looked overdone and a correction upwards was overdue. BTC could also be pulling up other cryptocurrencies, given the tight correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  However, the leading cryptocurrencies have regained poise today, but are still not out of the woods if we consider the negative week-on-week performance.  In particular, NEO stands out with a 50 percent appreciation in the last 24 hours, although on a weekly basis, it is still reporting a 30 percent decline.  Also, another 15 percent rise in litecoin prices and the cryptocurrency would be reporting gains on a week-on-week basis.

42428532,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8eBh,1517994055,Ethereum Users Are Losing Money and Devs Don't Quite Know What to Do,"Ethereum is once again at a familiar crossroads.  As the price of its cryptocurrency ether has soared (and then corrected) in 2018, one thing has remained constant – users continue to lose money due to hacks, faulty code and human error. It's an issue that in the past has split the platform into rivaling forces and left lingering debates – and, as recent activity on GitHub shows, tensions are escalating again.    Pumping new life into the debate is the resurgence of a chat channel formed in the wake of the loss of 513,000 ether by startup Parity last year. In particular, the forum has reignited with the release of a sketch for how fund recovery proposals could be standardized to make them easier to implement.  It's the second major action the team has taken, after first helping arrive at possible methods to return the lost Parity funds, a proposal that was hotly rejected.  Led by developer Dan Phifer from Musiconomi (an ICO issuer that saw 16,475 ether lost in the Parity freeze) and two developers from a startup called Tap Trust, the document offers a way to make it easier for ethereum clients to implement so-called state changes, or system-wide upgrades that would require all users to upgrade their software to versions reflecting redistributed fund balances.  Yet, some vehemently disagree that such a mechanism is needed, going so far as to suggest the idea is out of line with the guiding ethos of the world's second-largest blockchain protocol.  Already, it has been rejected by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, prominent developer Yoichi Hirai and communications manager Hudson Jameson – three of the six that manage the ethereum repository and thereby have the power of green-lighting changes to the platform.  Hirai, for instance, argued the proposal is ""at odds with the ethereum philosophy,"" stating in a blog post that he is ""not going to move a finger"" for such changes.  Likewise, Alex Van de Sande, the founder of ethereum's Mist browser, wrote on Github that the changes required to return lost funds should be ""rare and increasingly exceptional.""  However, such sentiments are in marked contrast to developers recommending the standard, such as Parity's Afri Schoedon, who told CoinDesk:  ""State changes are not a bad precedent. It shows we are a working platform that is able to heal wounds.""  Revealing old scars  All of this controversy harks back to the 2016 DAO hack that saw 3.6 million ether – worth $2.6 billion at today's prices – taken from users' wallets by a person exploiting a loophole in the code.  In response, developers implemented an update that reversed the DAO theft, even though a significant group of community members were against the idea. Because of the heated debate around the philosophy, a group of enthusiasts even hard forked off ethereum to create a competing cryptocurrency, ethereum classic, now valued at $1.7 billion.  That event ""left many scars, a split community and talking points that ethereum detractors seem to want to point to forever,"" Van de Sande told CoinDesk.  When the Parity exploit happened, tensions surrounding the issue re-emerged.  While Parity was quick to offer a solution, it was one which would require all users to upgrade software again, and many people criticized that move. Joining the discussion was a shower of voices that felt ""no fork"" should occur, with the fervor echoing the DAO infighting the previous year.  However, while the DAO fork pushed many ethereum developers to err on the side of caution, others maintain a more liberal approach.  As Schoedon told CoinDesk:  ""I think a lot of people are scared about the repercussions after the DAO hard fork. It caused a lot of bad press. But honestly, it was a great move, it showed the ethereum community is not stubborn about 'code is law,' but rather able to act quickly.""  Simply, not so simple  Still, some think there's merit to considering all options, and the new proposal does promise fund returns could be achieved in a simpler manner, one that would involve both affected organizations and known and trusted influencers.  The later comments, however, have proved a lightning rod, as they are perceived as encouraging a centralized method of management.  In response to the statement, Hirai wrote on Github:  ""The authors are still looking for a certain class of people who can make judgments. They are looking for authorities … single points of failure and the need of trust [is] what ethereum tries to avoid.""  Hirai continued in a blog post, saying that it's his personal belief the ""each user of ethereum is responsible for their use of ethereum.""  And as such, funds lost on the platform should be made up for by donations, rather than changes to the ethereum software itself, he continued.  Discussion on the Github thread mirrors Hirai's conservatism, warning that while the standard for fund recovery is meant in good faith, it could be liable to corruption, bribery, and ""a system that can be terribly abused later,"" Van de Sande told CoinDesk.  Livelihoods on the line  Yet, in the same vein, questions have emerged as to whether the developers who have spoken out against the proposal have the authority to actually block the change before it would be put to users.  Schoedon contends that Hirai's refusal to allow users to consider the code is a ""conflict of interest,"" shedding light on how prominent figures already heavily influence development decisions.  Ethereum developer Nick Johnson, who is also listed as an ethereum repository editor, has taken a similar position, writing on a thread:  ""The role of editors here is not to determine what requests should be included on the chain, but merely which requests pass the minimum bar of being factually accurate.""  Elsewhere, a leading voice behind the proposed shift, Musiconomi's Phifer, urged the community to accept the risk of recovery when there is ""no perceivable downside"" and the loss impacts users ""businesses and livelihoods."" He continued, saying that the problem with lost funds will likely only worsen as adoption continues to grow, putting a strain on the nascent network.  Phifer is not alone in his perspective there.  While the DAO hack and Parity freeze comprise some of the more high-profile incidents, cases of lost funds among users are said to be relatively common.  A typo in a wallet address could permanently delete funds, and attacks on insecure smart contracts are fairly frequent (litecoin creator Charlie Lee went so far as to call ethereum a ""hackers' paradise"" in a conversation to CoinDesk last year).  Addressing the necessity to refresh code in response to errors, Schoedon said:  ""Ethereum is not static construct. Ethereum is what we want it to be. It's always a process, a transition. And that includes discussions, and yes, this includes resolving conflicts. And in the end there will be always consensus.""

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Picture two $1 bills. One is crisp and immaculate, newly arrived from the U.S. Mint. The other is crumpled and covered with crumbs and boogers.  Each is worth exactly the same as the other. It doesn’t matter if the crumply one previously belonged to a coke dealer or a Koch brother. It’s still good for bus fare.  That’s fungibility. It’s one of the essential properties of money that we take for granted. But in cryptocurrency, fungibility is at risk, thanks in part to the transparent nature of the blockchain, where wallet addresses are pseudonymous but the flows of funds between them are exposed for all to see.  Last week brought a reminder of that risk when Bitfury, a startup, introduced Crystal, a set of software tools to help track illicit activity on bitcoin’s public ledger.  As CoinDesk’s Michael del Castillo reported, the platform is Bitfury’s attempt ""to help bitcoin once and for all move past its association with black market transactions."" Valery Vavilov, Bitfury’s CEO, said Crystal will enable users to ""see if this bitcoin address that you're getting money from is green or black.""  Stepping back, Bitfury, which started as a mining operation, is not the first company to offer this sort of snooping service – as CoinDesk’s article noted, Chainalysis, Elliptic, and Skry (now a part of Bloq) are already in the market.  And to be sure, catching criminals, all else equal, is a worthy goal. (For the sake of argument, let’s assume that all the ""crimes"" being solved here are actual crimes, the kind with victims.)  Further, the surveillance provided by these companies may produce another benefit by helping other startups get or keep accounts with traditional financial institutions. Banks have been reluctant to serve the sector because of its association with illegal activities. If they could demonstrate that their clients aren't moving ""dirty"" money, they might get their regulators comfortable with the industry.  But the use of the blockchain in this manner could also have perverse effects.  Blacklisted balances  As Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar write in their book ""Cryptoassets"":  ""A danger for bitcoin, especially for balances known to have been used for illegal activity, is that if an exchange or other service blacklists that balance, then that balance becomes illiquid and arguably less valuable than other balances of bitcoin.""  Woe to the merchant who sells a pair of alpaca socks to a drug pusher and then can't spend the tainted coins.  And that's not the half of it. Burniske and Tatar go on:  ""While subtle, losing fungibility could be the demise of a digital and distributed currency, hurting the value of all units, not just the ones used for illegal activities.""  Cryptocurrency developers are well aware of this danger and have been working for years to strengthen user privacy, which in turn would preserve (or restore) fungibility.  Some of these techniques, such as zk-snarks and ring signatures, have been pioneered on altcoins like zcash and monero, respectively. (Loss of fungibility, Burniske and Tatar write, ""is one problem that monero does not have to deal with."") Other privacy enhancements, such as TumbleBit, are being developed for bitcoin itself.  ""Ultimately I think the challenge will be for any analytics tool to keep up with the variations on cryptocurrencies, with a particular emphasis on the challenges posed by those that appear designed for anonymity,"" said Jason Weinstein, a strategic advisor to Bitfury and former 15-year veteran of the U.S. Department of Justice who now practices law at Steptoe & Johnson LLP  Yet these enhancements may compound the regulatory challenges.  “If you make the accounting layer as private as zcash, you might sacrifice an entire market,” said Charles Hoskinson, founder and chief executive of IOHK, a company developing several blockchain projects including Cardano.  For example, Japan's Financial Services Agency, which must approve cryptocurrencies before they are listed on the country's licensed exchanges, ""may never whitelist a token that's high-privacy,"" he said.  On the other hand, ""if you don’t build these types of features,"" once de-anonymized, a user’s ""entire financial history from the beginning of time"" will be exposed.  ""That’s worse than the conventional banking system,"" Hoskinson said.  Double standard?  All told, it seems that cryptocurrency is being held to a higher standard for ""clean money"" than fiat, at least the physical version. Very few people are reading serial numbers on dollar bills. (To be fair, the comparison isn’t apples-to-apples, since you can't zap a briefcase full of banknotes across the globe.)  Satoshi created bitcoin so people who don't trust each other could transact over the internet. Exposing all transactions on the blockchain was the price paid for trust in the system, and he (or she, or they) thought pseudonymous addresses would mitigate the privacy leak.  Radical transparency is often touted as a feature of blockchain technology, which it may well be for enterprises and governments. And in bitcoin, it produces secondary benefits for ordinary users as well. For example, keeping an eye on withdrawals from an exchange's wallet may help spot a run.  But in the use case of money, the blockchain's openness could also turn out to be a bug. Even for law-abiding citizens.

He suggested that Google should take a similar course to Facebook, and restrict ad content for binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies.  ""There's just been an explosion of different ICOs and new tokens and crazy offerings. You're seeing ICOs that are raising large amounts of money and there's nothing behind them in certain cases, but members of the public are so hyped that they're throwing money at them,"" Roy told The Times of Israel.  Facebook announced its ban on cryptocurrency-related ads in a Jan. 30. blog post. The company's product management director, Rob Leathern, wrote at the time:  ""We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.""  Roy's comments to the Israeli news site coincide with with more general regulatory chatter from authorities who are increasingly seeking to reign in cryptocurrencies.  On Tuesday, the chairmen of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission testified that ICOs must be treated, and therefore regulated, more like securities than they are at present.
