14263955,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540001,1687908628,Nevada FID Files Petition To Take Control Of Troubled Prime Trust,"The Nevada Department of Business and Industry’s Financial Institutions Division (FID) has taken action against Prime Trust, LLC. This US-based financial institution specializes in custody and settlement services for digital assets. The FID has alleged that Prime Trust has violated Nevada regulations and has a shortfall in customer funds, which has deteriorated to a critically deficient level. As a result, the FID has filed a petition to place Prime Trust into receivership. This means that a court-appointed receiver will take control of the company’s assets and operations to protect the interests of creditors and other stakeholders. Prime Trust Accused Of Using Customer Assets To Buy Back Crypto The allegations against Prime Trust are significant, with the FID claiming that the firm lost access to legacy wallets in 2021 and used customer assets to buy back crypto. Prime Trust reportedly owes its customers $85,670,000 in fiat currency but only has $2,904,000, while it owes $69,509,000 in digital currency but only has $68,648,000. The receivership of Prime Trust could potentially have significant implications for the firm’s customers. If the court grants the petition filed by the Nevada FID, a receiver will be appointed to take control of the firm’s assets and operations. Related Reading: PEPE Coin Shines Among Top Gainers, Tallies 78% In Last Week During the receivership, the receiver will manage and administer Prime Trust’s assets and liabilities. This could include selling off assets to pay off creditors, negotiating with customers to resolve outstanding issues, and taking other actions to wind down the firm’s operations. For customers of Prime Trust, the receivership could lead to delays and disruptions in accessing their accounts and assets held by the firm. The receiver may need to freeze or restrict customer accounts while they assess the firm’s financial position and develop a plan for winding down its operations. Customers who have assets held by Prime Trust may also face the risk of loss if the firm’s assets are insufficient to cover its liabilities. While the receiver will work to maximize the recovery of funds for creditors, the outcome of the receivership is uncertain, and customers may not receive the full value of their assets. The petition to place Prime Trust into receivership will be subject to a hearing, where the court will determine whether the firm should be placed into receivership and whether a receiver should be appointed. The Majority Of Prime Trust’s Digital Currency Holdings Tied To AUDIO The news of Prime Trust’s receivership filing has sent shockwaves through the digital asset community, particularly for investors in AUDIO. According to Connor, Director at Coinbase, 88% of the digital currency held by Prime Trust is AUDIO, the native token of the Audius music streaming platform. This news could trouble AUDIO investors, as the receivership process could result in significant losses for those holding the token. While the receiver will work to maximize the recovery of funds for creditors and stakeholders, the outcome is uncertain, and investors may not receive the full value of their AUDIO holdings. Related Reading: BLUR Up By 11% Following This Announcement The situation is especially concerning, given the recent volatility in the digital asset markets. AUDIO has experienced significant price swings over the past months, and investors may be hesitant to hold a token that is so heavily concentrated in the hands of a single custodian. At the time of writing, the value of AUDIO stands at $0.1853. This represents a 1.7% decrease in value over the last 24 hours. The token’s price has remained relatively stable following the news of Prime Trust’s receivership filing.

42393263,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhINQL,1687906860,UK Needs Bespoke Legal Framework for Using Crypto as Collateral: Law Commission,"The U.K. should create a tailored framework for using crypto as collateral, a Law Commission funded by the Ministry of Justice said in a Wednesday report.  The scope of such a regime would go beyond existing U.K. regulations for collateral arrangements for traditional finance, the commission told CoinDesk.  The commission also doubled down on its previous call for the U.K. to treat crypto assets as a new type of property. It also wants the government to set up “a panel of industry-specific technical experts, legal practitioners, academics and judges” to advise courts on complex legal issues relating to digital assets.  The report was the result of what the Law Commission of England and Wales claimed was the first ever government-commissioned analysis in the U.K. on how existing legal frameworks can accommodate crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The independent body is made up of lawyers, judges and professors, and makes recommendations for law reform that the government could decide to take forward. The commission’s proposals don’t apply in Scotland or Northern Ireland, which have their own legal systems.  While the legal systems of England and Wales are well-placed to support the U.K. government’s attempts to bring crypto into the scope of existing legal frameworks, some areas may need specialized treatment to accommodate digital assets, the Commission said in a press statement shared with CoinDesk.  “The flexibility of the common law means that the legal system in England and Wales is well placed to adapt to this rapid growth,” said Professor Sarah Green, commissioner for commercial and common law in the statement. “Our recommendations for reform and development of the law therefore seek to solidify the legal foundation for digital assets.”  Collateral arrangements  Although existing laws in England and Wales provide options for the use of crypto as collateral, the commission said those options are “inadequate.”  “As such, we recommend that, as a matter of priority, the Government sets up a multi-disciplinary project to formulate and put in place a bespoke statutory legal framework that better and more clearly facilitates the entering into, operation and enforcement” of certain crypto collateral arrangements, the commission said.  Such a framework would need to be tailored to the way crypto works, from how assets are held, transferred and controlled, the body added.  For one, existing Financial Collateral Arrangement Regulations (FCAR), don’t apply if either party is an individual. But this limitation will need to be considered “given the level of individual participation” in crypto markets, the commission said.  The FCAR defines financial collateral as “cash, financial instruments or monetary claims of certain types,” while typical collateral arrangements include charges over deposits, lending of stocks and repo arrangements.  “What the Law Commission is proposing goes beyond crypto lending as it relates to using crypto as collateral for a range of arrangements,” it added. “The FCARs outlines a scope of arrangements where collateral can be used but we are not necessarily restricting as far as the FCARs.”  The Commission previously said its recommendations on crypto align with the Conservative administration’s plans to turn the U.K. into a hub for digital assets under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s leadership.  “Our reputation for straight dealing, use of the English language and flexible common law attracts business across the world. This, combined with our straightforward approach to regulating crypto assets puts the U.K. at the vanguard of innovation to drive growth in digital assets and boost our economy,” Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury, said in a statement.  Griffith added that he “will carefully consider” the commission’s findings and recommendations.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/27/uk-needs-bespoke-legal-framework-for-using-crypto-as-collateral-law-commission,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f9520e902777756be42e2c835552a12c59c9947-4267x3200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393261,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhIN5p,1687906427,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Shares Rally to a One-Year High, Discount Dips to 30%","Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s (GBTC) share price surged to a one-year high on Tuesday as a report about investment asset manager Fidelity Investments preparing to follow BlackRock’s application for a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) with its own, renewed optimism about converting the trust into an ETF.  GBTC closed at $19.47 Tuesday afternoon, gaining 7.1% through the day. This was the highest closing price since last June, according to TradingView data. Meanwhile, BTC traded mostly flat, except for a brief spike to $31,000 following the Fidelity news.  The discount on the GBTC’s share price relative to its net asset value – a widely followed metric in the digital asset space – dropped to 30%, according to a CoinDesk calculation. The last time the GBTC closed the day around this level was last September, according to historic data by Ycharts.  Tuesday’s price surge extended GBTC’s recent rally, which was spurred initially by BlackRock’s filing on June 15, and continued as financial services giants Invesco and WisdomTree reapplied to offer spot BTC ETFs. GBTC has gained nearly 50% in less than two weeks since BlackRock’s application. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager with $9.1 trillion in AUM.  Investors are betting on GBTC because of the “BlackRock filing and optimism that [the firm] may have cracked the code on an ETF, giving hope that Grayscale could also convert and remove the discount,” Doug Schwenk, CEO of crypto data provider Digital Asset Research, said in a note to CoinDesk.  Traders are also increasingly optimistic about the outcome of a lawsuit between Grayscale and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Schwenk said. The firm sued the agency earlier this year for denying its application to convert the closed-end GBTC fund into an ETF that would allow redemptions and close the gap between the share price trading on secondary markets and the net value per share of the fund’s BTC holdings.  “A positive outcome for Grayscale would lead to greater potential for listing as an ETF and removing the discount,” he added. “Of course, some believe that BlackRock's filing is also a view on the potential for Grayscale to have success in their lawsuit.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/27/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-shares-rally-to-a-one-year-high-discount-dips-to-30,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b394311f6e25424d614c8c27a3165db3dd50f78-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Benjamin Cowen, CEO and founder of ITC Crypto, recently underscored this premise and spotlighted Cardano (ADA) for its performance amid the prevailing crypto bear market. Related Reading: Cardano Poised For Consolidation In This Price Zone Prior To Attempting Reversal In a series of Twitter posts, Cowen shared insights comparing ADA’s current performance with its past trajectory, with implications for ADA’s investors and potential adopters. A Historical Perspective: ADA’s Bear Market Performance Cowen’s analysis brought to the fore an observation. According to Cowen, Cardano’s resilience in the current bear market outpaces its performance during the 2018-2020 bearish phase. He used a snapshot of ADA’s Return on Investment (ROI) to illustrate this, wherein two distinct trends emerged. Comparing #ADA bear markets Blue Line (Jan 2018 – Mar 2020) Orange Line ( Sep 2021-Present) So far, we are seeing diminishing losses as a function of time. The orange line will reach the length of the blue line on Nov. 13th, 2023. pic.twitter.com/XXKKSjiEmF — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) June 26, 2023 The graphic showcased a blue line depicting the bear market spanning January 2018 to March 2020, while the orange line represented the ongoing bear market that commenced in September 2021. Notably, the orange line displayed a trend of diminishing losses over time. Navigating The Bear Market: Cardano’s Improved Resilience Cowen’s observations suggest a slower rate of decline for ADA price in this bear market compared to its previous cycle. Projections place at the end of the current cycle around November 13, 2023, when the orange line is anticipated to reach the same length as the blue line. These insights could signal a less severe impact on ADA’s price amid the existing bear market compared to the previous cycle. Although ADA has experienced a decrease in price over the last 24 hours, the broader analysis paints a picture of enhanced market resilience. Although the asset declined in the past day, it is worth noting that ADA has been bullish over the past week, up by nearly 10%. The asset currently trades at $0.28 with a trading volume above $185 million and a market cap of $9.8 billion. Over the past 7 days, more than $500 million has been added to ADA’s market cap following the asset market capitalization surge from $9.1 billion seen last Tuesday. ADA has also recorded a surge in its trading volume, indicating rising trading activity. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Soars 10% In The Last Week, More Rallies Ahead?

Asset managers appear to believe that prices will rise, and have increased their long positions.  The recent moderation in prices has accompanied lower-than-average volume.  Bitcoin price action has begun to consolidate, following the 21% increase between June 15 and June 23. While investors appear to be pausing in spot markets, the Commitment of Traders (COT) report shows an increased appetite for long positions within derivative markets.  The COT report, published weekly by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, details the open interest, and directional position of bitcoin futures traders across institutional categories of various sizes. The report is a proxy for sentiment, as traders disclose the extent to which they are long or short, bitcoin futures.  Long positions spike  The most recent COT report shows that asset managers increased their open long positions by 495 contracts last week. Leveraged funds by comparison, increased their long positions by 1,449 contracts, following a reduction of 538 contracts the week prior.  Asset managers with reportable positions are now 94.87% long bitcoin. This figure has been as high as 99% in prior COT reports. Leveraged funds with reportable positions are now 19.58% long and 80.42% short bitcoin.  The rise in long positions is an understandable reaction to recent market dynamics. The potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF has given derivative markets the same type of boost that has occurred within spot markets.  The options open interest put/call ratio is 0.32, according to data analytics firm Coinglass. A put/call ratio below 1.0 implies a higher demand for buying than selling.  While not an ironclad sign of where prices are going next, the lack of bearish bets, following a 20% increase, indicates that investors are not looking to sell into the recent rally.  BTC’s chart shows three consecutive negative days prior to today's price action. Trading volume on the down days was below BTC’s 20-day moving average however, indicating that the momentum behind the decline was relatively weak. Some of the decline is a byproduct of decreased weekend trading, but the trend held on Monday as well.  Key levels to watch to the downside are $30,000, as well as $27,800. The $30,000 level marks a growing area of support, as well as a psychologically important level where buy and sell orders are likely to cluster.

However, it has struggled to break through a significant resistance level, causing it to remain stagnant. Despite this, the technical analysis of UNI shows bullish signals, with notable buying strength and a significant increase in both demand and accumulation. Related Reading: Robinhood To Lay Off 7% of Full-Time Staff In Latest Restructuring While UNI has seen an appreciation of over 20% in the past week, the pace of gains has slowed down on the daily chart. A potential rally could occur if UNI surpasses the important overhead resistance. The performance of Bitcoin, which has been above the $30,600 price mark, has positively impacted most altcoins, including UNI. To move beyond its current price ceiling in future trading sessions, the altcoin’s price movement is closely tied to the broader market strength. Conversely, if UNI cannot break the immediate resistance zone, it may experience a decline toward its support zone. The increased market capitalization of UNI suggests the potential for further gains and extended bullish sentiment. Uniswap Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, UNI is being traded at $5.20. The altcoin is anticipated to face significant resistance at the $5.40 level or resistance zone (highlighted in blue). Breaking through this resistance at $5.40 can propel the altcoin to $5.80 and ultimately to $6, triggering a rally. Conversely, if the Uniswap price fails to sustain its current price level, it may drop to $5, and an inability to remain above $5 could result in UNI trading near or below the $4.80 price mark. Notably, an increase in trading volume has been observed in recent sessions, indicating an influx of buyers into UNI. Technical Analysis Following a rebound from the $5 price level, UNI has experienced a notable increase in buying strength, resulting in consistently positive demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates an upward trend, with the index just below the 60-mark, indicating heightened buying volume. Additionally, the price of UNI has moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers are currently driving the price momentum in the market. Strong buy signals on the daily chart show increased demand for UNI. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), is a tool that reflects price momentum and trend shifts. It displayed green histograms associated with buy signals for UNI. This indicates a bullish sentiment for the altcoin, suggesting the potential for future gains.

14260370,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/new-pepe-memecoin-to-launch-on-bnb-chain,1687899422,New PEPE Memecoin to Launch on BNB Chain,"Eden Island, Republic of Seychelles, June 27th, 2023, Chainwire A new PEPE memecoin is launching, following hot on the heels of its Ethereum namesake. Issued as a BEP20 on BNB Chain, PEPE is a novel memecoin with a number of unique mechanisms programmed into its tokenomics. Like the original PEPE token, which has proven a runaway success in 2023, the BEP20 PEPE draws its cues from the mischievous frog of the same name, whose design was derived from the webcomic ""Boy's Club."" The market capitalization of the original PEPE token, which debuted on Ethereum in April, exceeded $1 billion on May 5th, prompting a new wave of memecoins, including a number of frog-themed efforts. Unlike subsequent memecoins, the PEPE (BEP20) has several unusual features programmed in including a syndication system designed to support price stabilization. The team behind the BNB Chain PEPE aren’t settling for just one memecoin either: they plan to launch multiple PEPE projects, all based on the loveable frog. 13 such launches have been cued up for 2023 alone. Although each PEPE project will operate independently, the introduction of a ""Burn & Drop"" system will govern the consortium. Burn & Drop is a first-of-its-kind system in which burning one token leads to the airdrop of another. To initiate a Burn & Drop, two types of tokens are required. For example, this could involve a scenario in which Token A is priced at $1 and PEPE (BEP20) is also priced at $1. However, if the price of Token A were to drop to $0.8, Token A holders would have the option to burn their tokens on the Burn & Drop platform, automatically receiving PEPE (BEP20) through an airdrop, and with Token A having been burned, its total supply would decrease. By initiating the Burn & Drop process between tokens, excess volatility can be reduced while possibly providing trading opportunities for arbitrage and intra-token trading. This logic is a fundamental component of PEPE (BEP20), and one which users can engage with directly within the platform. In addition, PEPE (BEP20) has plans to introduce numerous services that will further extend the token’s utility. To further increase interest in the project, PEPE (BEP20) is currently running an airdrop campaign on Twitter that’s open to everyone. About PEPEBEP20 PEPE is a project launched on the Binance Smart Chain, taking the form of a BEP20 token. The Pepe Syndicate and the unique ""Burn&Drop"" mechanism of Pepe are designed to manage the token's price volatility. This is not a guarantee of price stability, but a mechanism to potentially mitigate price fluctuations. Furthermore, various projects that participate in the ""Burn&Drop"" system collaborate with each other, fostering a robust Pepe Syndicate network. For more information regarding the campaign, please visit PEPE BEP20's Twitter (@pepecoinbep20) or Join PEPE BEP20's Telegram https://pepe.markets/ PEPEBEP20 is the source of this content.

Although the exact role of XRP is still under scrutiny, notable signs suggest a growing interest in its potential. Ripple’s Resilience In The Legal Battle In a recent twist to the SEC v. Ripple case, XRP holders’ attorney and legal representative, John Deaton, took to Twitter to share a rollercoaster of emotions. Initially filled with anticipation, according to Deaton, he received an email filing related to the case with SEC. However, his hopes were swiftly crushed when he discovered that the email merely announced a lawyer’s withdrawal from the proceedings. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Blasts SEC Chair For Anti-Innovation Stance, XRP Bulls Remain Optimistic Deaton promptly clarified that this departure holds no significant impact on the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Additionally, it is crucial to note that the lawyer’s exit should not be misconstrued as a settlement or any substantial change in the case. And Deaton concluded that the withdrawal does not alter the course of the litigation. Surge in Active Addresses Data from Santiment highlights a surge in active addresses for Ripple’s XRP in the past weeks. Analysis of the chart reveals that this upward trend commenced in late May and has continued to gain momentum throughout June, ultimately reaching an all-time high. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi The average number of active addresses was close to one million. However, a discernible upward trajectory emerged, pushing the average to approximately 1.1 million. At present, the number of active addresses has surpassed 1.1 million, indicating a sustained growth pattern. XRP Price Stagnation And Potential Reversal Before now, Ripple’s XRP experienced a distinctive price pattern that deviated from the broader market, displaying an upward trajectory. However, in recent days, its price movement has become stagnant, lacking a clear indication of either an upward or downward trend. XRPUSD daily chart at $0.4801 | Source: TradingView At the time of writing, XRP was trading at approximately $0.48, reflecting a decrease of more than 4%. It is worth noting that the overall trend appears bearish, as evidenced by the positioning of its Relative Strength Index (RSI) line. Nevertheless, the bearish trend observed in XRP’s price movement has displayed a relatively subdued strength, leaving room for the possibility of a sudden upswing that could propel it back into a bullish trajectory. Additionally, it is worth noting that XRP’s current trading price remains above its short Moving Average (represented by the yellow line), which also acts as an immediate support level for the cryptocurrency.

14258464,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539951,1687894211,BTC Continues Uptrend As Fidelity Plans To Submit Bitcoin Spot ETF Filing,"Financial market titan Fidelity is reportedly preparing to throw its hat into the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) ring. An insider source reveals that the asset management colossus is in the advanced stages of preparing a filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF. If true, this move would make Fidelity the latest entrant into the burgeoning field of issuers vying to be the first to launch such a product. This potential development follows BlackRock’s recent ETF proposal. BlackRock’s move, announced on June 15, has ignited a flurry of activity among asset managers eager to introduce their own spot BTC funds. With a filing potentially submitted as early as Tuesday, Fidelity seems set to follow suit. Fidelity In The Bitcoin ETF Spotlight Fidelity’s rumored filing marks its second foray into Bitcoin ETF territory. In 2021, the company initially submitted a proposal for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund dubbed the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. However, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected the filing in early 2022. Related Reading: BlackRock Inches Closer To Launching Bitcoin ETF: Potential Impact On BTC Price The introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF is seen as a pivotal moment in the market, offering investors exposure to BTC without the necessity of handling the asset itself. Didar Bekbauov Bekbauov, founder and CEO of Bitcoin mining company Xive told NewsBTC the renewed clamor for Bitcoin ETF is hinged on three key factors. Bekbauov noted: Firstly, it is the provision for a large number of investors from traditional stock markets to invest in Bitcoin. Secondly, the possibility of a huge amount of capital flow into the ETF which will overflow into Bitcoin which, in turn, will push the price of Bitcoin up. Also, another factor driving the hype is that more people, more investors and large investment companies are considering Bitcoin as a serious investment. Indeed, Fidelity is a comparable giant in the financial world. Boasting tens of millions of retail brokerage clients and $11 trillion in administrated assets, the company has long been a player in the crypto space. Since 2018, Fidelity has provided institutional custody and trading services. Moreover, it has been offering fund products to European clients via Fidelity International since February 2022. BTC Continous Uptrend Fuels Market Optimism As Fidelity’s potential ETF filing is currently in anticipation, Bitcoin’s price action over the past week adds a layer of intrigue to the narrative. BTC has seen an uptrend, with the asset marking a 14.9% increase over the same period. At the time of writing, Bitcoin currently trades at $30,822 nearing the $31,000 region. The asset is currently up 0.6% in the last 24 hours with a 24-hour trading volume of $15.9 billion. It is worth noting that the uptrend is in tune with the increased interest from institutional players such as Fidelity and BlackRock. Particularly, it’s a reflection of growing confidence in the long-term prospects of the digital asset, providing further evidence that BTC is fast becoming a mainstay in the broader investment landscape. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts: Bitcoin (BTC) To Reach $69,000 And Above In 2023 While the imminent filing for a Bitcoin ETF by Fidelity remains unofficial, its potential impact on the financial landscape cannot be overstated. Not only could it cement Bitcoin’s place in the mainstream investment universe, but it could also underscore the growing recognition and acceptance of cryptocurrency in the world of traditional finance.

Azuki “Elementals” was first teased last week at a holders-only event held in Las Vegas titled “Follow the Rabbit.” A portion of the 20,000 NFTs, which are based on the four Azuki elements of earth, fire, lightning and water, were airdropped to holders.  The remaining NFTs were available for purchase beginning on Tuesday at 9 a.m. PT. Holders of Azuki NFTs were given a 10-minute presale minting window while holders of BEANZ – a derivative project – were given presale access 10 minutes after that. At 9:20 a.m. PT, a public sale was meant to commence.  To participate in the presale, Azuki and BEANZ holders were required to put down a deposit of 2 ETH. The entire collection sold out within 15 minutes, eliminating the need for a public sale.  According to data from Etherscan, the wallet address that holds the Elementals mint funds amassed 20,000 ETH, worth just over $38 million at the time of writing.  Many eager buyers expressed their frustration over the minting experience, sharing how they were unable to obtain an Elemental NFT even though they were holders of Azuki or BEANZ NFTs. Some chalked it up to technical issues on the minting platform while others bemoaned the short minting window.  Chris Lepensky, data lead at DAO operations firm Utopia Labs, claimed that many Azuki holders were unable to mint due to “website errors and contract issues,” calling the experience “a major L.”  Location tba, one of the co-founders of Azuki and its parent company Chiru Labs, tweeted shortly after that the mint experience “was not up to the Azuki standard.”  “We underestimated the time needed for phase 1 and phase 2 of the presale for Azuki and BEANZ holders respectively,” they tweeted. “We should have extended the duration to more than 10 minutes to allow a sufficient buffer in the case of any issues (of which there were).”  Of the 10,000 NFTs available during the presale, 7,600 were minted by Azuki holders, while the rest were minted by BEANZ holders, they added.  “The team and I feel gutted over what happened,” location tba wrote.

This one could potentially bring in as much as $460 million in revenue over 3 years. The Company also announced a shelf offering for up to $125 million in new common stock shares at the market. This is rather significant dilution. While I'm still personally long the stock, I think it's wise to wait for another conference call before adding any long exposure. When I last covered Applied Digital ( APLD ), the stock was working on a 300% year to date rally that was largely fueled by the announcement of a cloud services customer in the artificial intelligence space. That service agreement could provide up to $180 million in revenue over 24 months for APLD. For a company that has less than $41 million in trailing twelve month revenue, it's potentially a big deal. Given what I viewed as an irrational explosion in the stock price since the announcement, I've taken a far more cautious approach and locked in some profit. I detailed why in a May article. There were a lot of comments questioning my pivot from ""buy"" to ""hold"" and some of those comments were very good. With the benefit of a month of new information and market performance, those who have steadfastly held APLD shares rather than taking profit have done well. The stock closed the June 26th session at $9.19 - up 400% on the year - and that's after a retrace from a high of $11.62 on June 23rd. Data by YCharts Of course, this is just price moves. There have been a lot of new developments for Applied Digital since my May article and we'll try to unpack them in today's update. Second Cloud Services Customer On June 23rd, Applied Digital announced a second cloud services customer in the AI industry. This time, the agreement has the potential to be for substantially more revenue than the first one with customer #2 potentially leading to as much as $460 million over 36-months. Similar to the customer #1 announcement, details on the agreement with customer #2 were very limited. There was no figure given for baseline revenue expectations, no timetable, and unlike the first announcement there was no prepayment mentioned regarding customer #2. While Applied Digital isn't publicly naming who these customers are, on June 24th, APLD CEO Wes Cummins tweeted a link to a Bloomberg article titled ""These Are the 10 AI Companies to Watch Right Now."" In the tweet, he indicated both of Applied's cloud services customers were mentioned in the Bloomberg post: Wes Cummins Tweet 6/24/23 (Twitter) While some readers may not be able to access the Bloomberg link because it has a paywall, the following are the 10 companies mentioned in the article: OpenAI Stability AI Runway Hugging Face Cohere Anthropic Character.AI Midjourney Scale AI Abnormal Security With the exception of Midjourney, which is self-funded, every single one of these companies has at least 9-figures in funding and billion dollar valuations. Most of them have multi-billion dollar valuations. Comments on Cummins' tweet requested more details regarding exactly who Applied Digital has agreements with, Cummins responded with this: I would love to announce them and eventually we will. There is some sensitivity on our customer’s side right now. Basically don’t want to rock the boat with their current provider until our capacity is ramped. This is an interesting comment for a variety of reasons. In my opinion, it does add an element of concern knowing Applied Digital's clients are already being serviced by other providers since we don't actually know what the baseline revenue expectation is from these agreements. For me, it reads a little too close to ""if you build it, they will come."" But I recognize you can't realize revenue from capacity you don't actually have. Applied Digital has been attempting to scale that capacity and recently energized its Ellendale, North Dakota facility in March. Between the company's Ellendale and Jamestown sites, Applied Digital has 280 MW of total hosting capacity in the state of North Dakota. There is an additional colocation services facility in Garden City, Texas. According to Applied Digital, the company has 240 MW online servicing crypto mining customers with an additional 246 MW planned. Revenue vs Projections In a recent filing , Applied Digital is guiding for 4th fiscal quarter 2023 revenue of $22 million - which is below market expectations. The degree of the miss varies depending on which financial resource one chooses to use: APLD Rev Estimate (Yahoo Finance) Citing 7 analysts, Yahoo Finance was projecting over $30 million in revenue for the current quarter while Seeking Alpha's $23 million estimate was far closer to what Applied Digital is now guiding for. Regardless, $22 million is an underwhelming figure given all of the lofty revenue figures that have been shared in recent cloud services client announcements. Customer Months Revenue Potential Quarterly Rev Potential Cloud Client 1 24 $180,000,000 $22,500,000 Cloud Client 2 36 $460,000,000 $38,333,333 Source: Analyst calculations By my count, the recent cloud services client revenue agreements could produce as much as $60.8 million in quarterly revenue potential before factoring in the revenue from hosting Bitcoin (BTC) miners. If we call that $20 million flat going forward, at roughly $80 million in quarterly revenue, Applied Digital is trading at 2.8 times future sales. This would be a significant improvement in valuation since my last APLD article and would put the company very much in line with sector median. But again, it prices in perfection and doesn't take into account changes to one of the most important inputs in the valuation multiple, shares outstanding. Dilution Coming We've known since shortly after the first AI cloud services client announcement that dilution has been on the horizon and after market on June 26th we received some clarity on that front. Applied Digital entered an agreement to sell up to $125 million in common stock at the market. At current share price levels, this offering would amount to roughly 15.5 million shares sold on the open market: Data by YCharts And there will probably be more dilution to come judging by the $175 million shelf announcement from mid-May. This dilution is unfortunately necessary because Applied Digital doesn't have a lot of cash and doesn't benefit in the upside of Bitcoin price increases to the degree that a self-mining operation might. Other Risks I think it also has to be mentioned that Applied Digital's CEO and CMO apparently are or have previously been in a personal relationship with each other. According to Applied Digital, there was an internal investigation into ""a threat, but not a formal assertion, of a sexual harassment claim"" by Regina Ingel, the company's CMO. According to filings : Based on information obtained through the investigation, the Audit Committee determined that the relationship between the parties was consensual and the allegations of workplace harassment are unfounded. The Board has reaffirmed Mr. Cummins's role as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and will consider any additional actions that may be appropriate with respect to this matter. I'm choosing to be delicate with my assessment of this; when I see things like this, I get nervous as an investor and I'm going to leave it at that. Summary I want to reiterate, I'm still personally long APLD shares. Though much fewer shares than before. I expect the share price will come back down in the weeks ahead. Even if one takes the view that Applied Digital will be able to reach the maximum potential of these AI cloud services agreements, it's going to be expensive to continue building out the capacity to do so. But to be clear, I don't think this is necessarily bad dilution if the capital raised is used for scaling operations for clients with known demand. But from here, I think we need another earnings report with a fresh conference call before we get too ahead of ourselves.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613929-applied-digital-if-you-build-it-will-they-come?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14258153.jpeg

In the meeting, 3AC liquidators -- comprised of two partners at consultancy firm Teneo -- were said to have accused the founders of causing the firm to take on outsized leverage between May and June 2022, after suffering significant losses on luna ( LUNA-USD ) tokens as well as other crypto bets. The liquidators are now taking action against the founders in a British Virgin Islands court to repay creditors, the person told Bloomberg .

Attestation provider The Network Firm’s examination revealed on June 23 that $26,434 worth of TUSD backing assets “were held at a U.S. depository institution which has communicated to customers that the institution has been ordered by state regulators to halt deposits and withdrawals for fiat and digital asset accounts.” It added that $26,269 of the funds “relate to customer withdrawals for redeemed tokens.”  A TrueUSD spokesperson said that the particular balance relates to fund withdrawal by users for redeemed coins – burned coins that no longer belong in TUSD circulation – so it is not TUSD asset by legal or token definition.  The Network Firm didn’t specify the U.S. institutions where the funds were held.  TUSD issuer previously said that it had “no exposure” to the imploded crypto custodian Prime Trust, which acted as the stablecoin’s banking partner in the U.S. The issuer tweeted it paused minting tokens via Prime Trust on June 10, adding that “minting and redemptions services remain unaffected” through other banking rails.

According to data by CoinMarketCap, BLUR has gained by 11.75% in the last 24 hours, emerging as one of the top gainers in today’s market. Looking at its price overview, BLUR has shown a rather mixed price movement in the last seven days, although resulting in an overall price gain of 12.43% However, the token’s monthly chart data tells a different story, with BLUR losing over 26% of its value in the last 30 days. During this period, BLUR fell to its lowest price this year, trading as low as $0.297. Listing Announcement Causes BLUR Market Surge BLUR experienced a sudden hike in its price this morning, leading to the token trading around $0.43 for the first time since the beginning of the month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Expect Retrace, Will BTC Move Against Crowd Once Again? Analyzing BLUR’s price action, on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain has noted that BLUR’s price gain appears to be due to a recent listing by a crypto exchange. According to Lookonchain’s report, BLUR’s market price surged by over 27% after popular Asian exchange Upbit announced plans to list the token on its KRW market in the early hours of today. Upbit is well-known as the first licensed digital exchange in South Korea. Established in 2017, the exchange serves over 10 million users, accounting for over 80% of the Korean exchange market. That said, it is worth noting that BLUR’s price peaked at $0.43 following the announcement but has since been on a downtrend, losing about 12% of its value in the last seven hours. At the time of writing, BLUR is currently exchanging hands at a price of $0.38 based on data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, its daily trading volume hovers around $277 million, having gone up by 11.83%. BLUR Trading At $0.380 | Source: BLURUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Money Maker Conducts Puzzling Transactions Amidst BLUR’s Price Boost In other news, Lookonchain also spotted a rather “unusual market behavior” from prominent DeFi market maker Wintermute amidst the recent price boost in the BLUR market. Related Reading: Robinhood To Lay Off 7% of Full-Time Staff In Latest Restructuring Wintermute reportedly received 10 million BLUR tokens – valued at $4.2 million – from Coinbase custody wallet and deposited these tokens on the Kraken exchange several hours before the BLUR’s price hike occurred.

For now, Wintermute’s intention following these transactions is unknown but appears to be drawing much attention, perhaps to the company’s recent troubles.

For all users of LBank Exchange, the DIS/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading. Disney (DIS) is a meme token issued by the relevant communities of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mining. Introducing Disney LBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the upcoming listing of Disney (DIS), a meme token that was initiated by Miningtw Technology Co., Ltd., a collaborative team based in Hong Kong and Taiwan. This token was issued by various communities involved in blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mining. The token is intended for use in various capacities such as interactive activities, event rewards, gifts, charitable endeavors, and aspirational purposes. With an economic model in which 50% of its circulating supply is committed to pledge mining for a period exceeding 5 years, users are rewarded proportionately per second based on the total amount of their pledges. The goal is to create a value that is worth holding and collecting over the long term. However, it's worth noting that DIS has no association with Walt Disney and their similar names are purely coincidental. Despite sharing a similar name, they operate in distinct domains and scopes, with the meme tokens existing purely for the sake of amusement and enjoyment. DIS token is a meme cryptocurrency, created with the intention of fostering fun and innovation. It is committed to building a democratic, transparent, and equitable community grounded on blockchain technology. The token was conceived by DaddyPig, a Hong Kong native who immigrated to Taiwan in search of democratic freedoms. In collaboration with Taiwan, DaddyPig established Miningtw Technology Co., Ltd. Starting off as a cryptocurrency miner, the company branched out to construct large mining facilities, dedicating itself to the development of several blockchain projects. These projects include the creation of a decentralized exchange (DEX) and several other blockchain ecosystem initiatives. DaddyPig has actively participated in blockchain development endeavors, such as Ethereum's PoS fork, the maintenance of EthereumFair (ETHF) under a PoW consensus mechanism, and the fork of DogeCoin from the Scrypt algorithm to the ETHASH algorithm, resulting in DogeW. Upholding the principle of decentralization, DaddyPig has invested significant resources in anticipation of the potential and future prospects of Web3. About DIS Token Based on BEP-20, DIS has a total supply of 100 million (i.e. 100,000,000). In a move to incentivize DIS token holders, a five-year liquidity mining program has been launched, dedicating 50 million tokens, or half of the total issuance, to the staking mining reward pool. Approximately 27,397 DIS tokens will be distributed daily, or around 0.317 DIS per second, based on the total number of staked tokens. Additionally, 10% of the total DIS issuance, which equates to 10 million DIS tokens, will be locked for staking over a five-year span, with economic model and deflation mechanism, please refer to the white paper for details. It was listed on LBank Exchange at 9:00 UTC on June 27, 2023, investors who are interested in DIS can easily buy and sell it on LBank Exchange now.

Picture yourself earning revenue effortlessly, without having to lift a finger. Moreover, crypto exchange platforms are upping the ante with their enticing welcome rewards. Among these are KuCoin and Plynk, but a newcomer is making waves: Caged Beasts Coin has joined the rank of Top passive income cryptos. Unlock the secrets of these offerings and maximise your profits. Plynk Has “$50 For You” Plynk is an SEC-regulated trading app designed for US investors. It provides a user-friendly platform where beginners can trade various instruments like stocks, fractional shares, mutual funds, and ETFs. In collaboration with Paxos Trust Co., Plynk introduced crypto trading in 2022. Users can trade and hold popular coins such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) through Paxos. Existing Plynk app users can apply for a crypto account offered by Paxos. Currently, Plynk is offering a $50 promotion. To qualify, open a new account on the app and link a bank account. You receive a $10 bonus just for signing up. When you deposit at least $25 within 15 calendar days of linking their eligible bank account, $50 will be credited to your account within 30 days of the Qualification Period, which starts when the bank account is linked. Avail KuCoin’s New User Rewards The crypto exchange Kucoin offers great advantages such as high liquidity, low fees, and fast withdrawals. It was established in 2017 by Leon Kuensingh, who observed a shift of traders from Binance to Coinbase due to the recent ban on crypto trading on US exchanges. New users who register on KuCoin can enjoy rewards of up to $100 USDT. These rewards are earned when users complete their first deposit or crypto purchase, make their first trade, and engage in pro trading. The rewards include USDT and valuable coupons, which can add up to a total worth of 3200 USDT. To receive these rewards, users need to fulfil the designated tasks within 60 days of signing up for their KuCoin account. It's important to note that each user can only receive each reward once. Caged Beasts’s 20% USDT Commission Caged Beasts Coin (BEASTS) is no ordinary cryptocurrency. Aiming to overthrow the dominance of a privileged few and redistribute financial power to the masses, the BEASTS are out to start the DeFi Revolution and here’s why they might just do it. Community is at the heart of the BEASTS ecosystem. The referral scheme, for example, allows holders to bag a 20% USDT commission instantly. All you have to do is visit the website, select the 'Earn USDT' option, connect your wallet and generate a referral code to share. Each user can earn a generous 20% of any deposits made by their referrals, which is automatically added to their wallet. That’s not all: the user who uses the referral code also receives a 20% share. The token tells the tale of Rabbit 4001, who embarks on a quest to gather a group of rebels. During the token's presale journey, Rabbit 4001 bestows young animals with mutagens and cybernetic enhancements, symbolising the growth and accumulation of locked funds over time. The name itself, Caged Beasts, is a clever take on the concept of Caged Liquidity. The referral system aims to cultivate a united and expanding community that rewards its members, while the project as a whole thrives through active involvement and contributions from individuals. The Takeaway With their respective welcome bonuses, KuCoin & Plynk are top-notch platforms to consider for trading crypto. However, in the quest for the top passive income cryptos, Caged Beasts Coin emerges as a contender. Brace yourself for the imminent DeFi Revolution, spearheaded by none other than the mighty BEASTS.

This integration enables faster and more secure transfers of USDC across several blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Avalanche, and now Arbitrum. Enhanced Functionality with CCTP CCTP facilitates the movement of USDC across different blockchain networks by employing a burn-and-mint mechanism. Native USDC tokens on the original chain are burnt, and an equivalent amount is minted on the receiving chain. This mechanism enhances the efficiency and security of USDC transfers. Arbitrum is the third chain to support CCTP, and the protocol is live on the official Arbitrum Bridge. The addition of CCTP to Arbitrum follows Circle's recent announcement of a native version of its stablecoin on the Arbitrum network. Integration with Other Protocols Several other bridge projects and interoperability-centric protocols, such as Celer Network, Li.Fi, Wormhole, O3 Labs, Wanchain, and Router Protocol, have incorporated CCTP into their systems. These integrations enable USDC transfers via their respective platforms. Notably, the integration of CCTP with Arbitrum is expected to replace the traditional ""lock-and-mint"" bridging process typically used for transferring tokens between chains. This conventional mechanism has been associated with security issues in the past. Using CCTP instead can expedite bridge transfers, improving efficiency and security. The Growth of USDC USDC is currently the second-largest centralized stablecoin in the market after USD Tether, boasting a supply close to $28 billion. Its increasing adoption and the integration with Arbitrum underline the significant role it plays in the crypto landscape. Circle expressed its enthusiasm for the CCTP integration with Arbitrum in a series of tweets. The company highlighted that the integration simplified the process of moving USDC natively to Arbitrum, enabling direct transfers to and from Ethereum and Avalanche. As a many-to-many messaging protocol, CCTP can now burn and mint USDC through six unique routes between its three supported chains. Each new chain added automatically connects to all existing CCTP chains. Users receive native USDC with CCTP, eliminating the need for lock-and-mint bridging. This development brings added security and capital efficiency to the process of sending USDC across supported chains. The protocol also allows for a swift return of USDC to Ethereum, bypassing withdrawal delays when moving liquidity from Layer 2 solutions to Layer 1. Circle's CCTP offers developers the opportunity to build applications offering native cross-chain deposits, swaps, purchases, and more. As such, the integration promises significant improvements to the cross-chain capabilities of the ecosystem. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

On the other hand, Tradecurve (TCRV) has emerged as a promising player in the crypto market, fueled by its unique approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). Tradecurve's native token is aiming for a more bullish price movement after crossing the $0.018 mark. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Polygon (MATIC) Struggling To Break Past $0.60 In recent days, Polygon has experienced a significant price decline, dropping below the crucial $0.750 support level and entering a bearish zone. However, the cryptocurrency has found some stability as a low point formed near $0.5432. Currently, it is attempting to regain its value and follow the upward trend observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Notably, there has been a positive development in Polygon's price movement. At first, bulls struggled to cross the resistance around $0.605 before finally soaring above $0.64 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours), signaling a potential recovery. However, it faced resistance around the $0.725 level. To continue its upward momentum, MATIC would need to break above this resistance level with the next significant resistance awaiting near $0.78. On the other hand, failure to surpass the $0.725 resistance level could lead to a fresh decline in MATIC's price. In such a scenario, immediate support can be expected around the $0.65 level. At present, Polygon is trading at $0.666567, a decline of 4.40% in the last 24 hours. Tradecurve Aiming For A Further Increase While Polygon is aiming to surpass the $0.725 resistance, Tradecurve's utility token, TCRV, is aiming for a further increase. Over the last week, the TCRV token experienced a 20% price surge to set a new trading high of $0.018. Based on its current trajectory, market analysts have predicted that the token has gathered enough momentum to potentially reach $0.025 in the coming week. The strong bullish performance of TCRV can be linked to the growing attention its parent Tradecurve exchange is enjoying. Unlike other exchanges such as OKX and Kraken, Tradecurve offers more tradable assets apart from cryptocurrencies. These tradable assets include forex, commodities, stocks, indices, and CFDs. Additionally, Tradecurve offers several advantageous features, including low trading fees and access to a diverse range of tradable assets and derivatives. As a hybrid trading platform, Tradecurve will also allow users from around the world to trade anonymously. TCRV token holders enjoy various benefits, such as staking rewards, voting rights, and discounts. Now in the fourth stage of its presale, crypto market experts predict that the price of the token price could increase by a further 40% in the fifth stage. As demand for Tradecurve and its TCRV token increases, leading industry experts predict a potential 50x increase in value before the end of its presale. Furthermore, market analysts anticipate a remarkable surge of 100x by the end of 2023.

PEPE’s rally coincides with days of incredible performance across the crypto market. Bitcoin gained 15.03% last week, while the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, has scored 9.56% over the past seven days. Pepe Coin topped charts over the past few days and still maintains a 12.43% 30-day price increase among top-gaining coins despite a slight pullback. Possible Factors Behind Pepe Coin’s Price Moves As of the time of writing, Pepe Coin’s trading volume has declined slightly by 8.07%, suggesting the ongoing rally isn’t coming from inflows. PEPE traded with little liquidity due to the prevailing selling pressure from the previous downtrend. So the most plausible reason for the rally could be the Pepe developers who previously sold their pre-mines at high levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Expect Retrace, Will BTC Move Against Crowd Once Again? The cash-out plus the recent market recovery could’ve catalyzed PEPE’s price rally. The bullish sentiment must have generated enough buzz to push the PEPE price since it is a community-driven token. Pepe Hits Market With Unparalleled Performance Amid Heightened Volatility The frog-theme-inspired meme token hit the market with a disruptive wave, adding growth percentage in thousands, gaining it a front seat in the hearts of meme enthusiasts. However, the enthusiasm died down when the meme coin succumbed to a long dark tunnel of a bearish trend. But that didn’t last too long, as PEPE quickly picked pace with substantial growth that saw its price rise to $0.00000164 on June 23. PEPE closed June 22 trading session at $0.00000138, with a 29.5% price increase after rallying 13% on June 21. The meme token also scored a nearly 20% price increase over the weekend and 3.9% on Monday, June 26, when most coins traded sideways. These consecutive gains brought the token to a price of $0.00000165, with a 3.52% increase at press time. Besides the price rise, PEPE’s market cap-to-volume ratio has increased by 36.58% within a 24-hour time frame, according to CoinMarketCap data. PEPE has bounced above its primary support level at $0.0000013675 and is fighting to defend the $0.00000163 resistance level. A break above the current price position could trigger more rallies for the meme token. Irrespective of the meme coin’s incredible performance over the past few days, the bulls must press on to sustain the momentum. Otherwise, PEPE might plunge back into an all-time low.

The NFT WaaS tech stack allows firms to create smart contracts and send NFTs via email, as well as generate wallets for NFT collectors.

42393244,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhIMGX,1687886606,Nevada Files to Place Crypto Custodian Prime Trust Into Receivership,"Nevada's Financial Institutions Division filed to take over crypto custodian Prime Trust and freeze all of its businesses, the regulator announced on Tuesday.  The move comes mere days after fellow custodian BitGo called off its bid to acquire Prime Trust, and follows a Nevada cease-and-desist order which alleged Prime Trust was near insolvency. Tuesday's request for receivership states that Prime Trust owes its clients north of $85 million in fiat, and has about $3 million in fiat currency on hand. The company owes a further $69.5 million in crypto, and has $68.6 million in crypto on hand, the filing said.  The filing said Prime Trust was also operating with a $12 million equity deficit.  Part of this shortfall comes from Prime Trust being unable to access ""legacy wallets,"" the filing said.  Prime Trust entered an agreement with Fireblocks to have the latter company manage its crypto assets, which was completed in 2020. In 2021, after Prime Trust saw new management, it set up ""legacy wallet forwarding,"" for wallets that were either on Fireblocks' platform or set up to forward to wallets on Fireblocks' platform, the filing said. However, in December 2021, Prime Trust ""discovered that it was unable to access"" its legacy wallets or cryptocurrencies held in those wallets.  ""It is understood that from December 2021 to March 2022, to satisfy the withdrawals from the inaccessible Legacy Wallets, [Prime] purchased additional digital currency using customer money from its omnibus customer accounts,"" the filing said. ""[Prime] is reported to have been making efforts to regain access to the Legacy Wallets. However, as of the date of this Petition, [Prime] has been unable to do so.""  Fireblocks communications head Gaby Hui told CoinDesk in a statement that the legacy wallets were all controlled by Prime Trust, and no funds held by Fireblocks are in limbo.  ""After Prime Trust became a Fireblocks customer, new management made a decision to deposit Prime Trust’s customer assets in old legacy wallets. Once management moved those assets to the legacy wallets, the customer assets were not recoverable. These legacy wallets were not Fireblocks wallets,"" the statement said.  Prime Trust's management – and any receiver who takes over – will have full control of any wallets maintained by Fireblocks.  A Prime Trust official declined to comment.  The company's condition ""will only progressively worsen as customers continue to withdraw,"" according to the state's filing.

The filing also asks for preliminary injunctive relief, saying it would be in the public's interest and that there is a ""threat of immediate, irreparable harm.""

In the meantime, the filing asks for a court to ban Prime Trust, as well as its officers, directors, stakeholders and others, from disposing of any of Prime Trust's assets or conducting any transactions.  According to an affidavit signed by O'Laughlin, Prime Trust and FID both agree that former Bank of Nevada CEO John Guedry, Meadows Bank Director Paul Huygens or former Meadows Bank CEO Arvind Menon are qualified as possible receivers.

42393259,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhING5,1687886109,Jack Dorsey Questions Apple's Tim Cook Over Bitcoin Support as Damus Deplatforming Looms,"Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who now heads the Bitcoin-focused financial services firm Block, is going straight to the top in his quest for answers on why Apple, the giant computer and smartphone maker, doesn't offer bitcoin (BTC) support for its mobile payment service, Apple Pay.  On Tuesday, after Apple signaled to the Bitcoin-friendly social media app Damus that it would likely be kicked out of the App Store for violating the platform's terms of service, Dorsey tweeted at Apple CEO Tim Cook: ""Why doesn't Apple Pay support bitcoin @tim_cook?""  He quoted a tweet from Damus that appears to show an App Store reviewer recommending Apple Pay as one way to resolve the violations.  Damus founder William Casarin told CoinDesk on Monday that the tech giant has threatened to remove Damus by Tuesday for violating the company’s in-app purchase guidelines by allowing tips or “zaps” on content paid for with bitcoin instead of using Apple Pay, which doesn’t support crypto.  The spat has renewed questions of whether Apple has too much power over consumer applications, and in some ways validated cryptocurrency advocates' push for a financial system that's resistant to censorship.  Cook, who tweets roughly a few times a week, has not responded to Dorsey’s question.  Incorporating bitcoin into Apple Pay – which has over 500 million users by some estimates – would result in a significant boost in mass adoption for the cryptocurrency.  Damus is a decentralized social media platform that runs on the Nostr protocol, which is popular with bitcoiners partly because most implementations of it support payments over the blockchain's Lightning Network. (Nostr is an acronym for “notes and other stuff transmitted by relays.”)  The app went live in the App Store earlier this year, only to be threatened with delisting on June 13 because of “zaps” – a special Damus feature that allows users to send small amounts of bitcoin (BTC) over the Lightning Network to tip their favorite content creators, much like Twitter’s “tip” feature. Lightning is Bitcoin’s second layer payment network for cheaper and faster transactions.  “Two weeks ago, we identified a feature in the Damus app that allowed users to send a tip in connection with digital content in the app, which violates App Store Review Guidelines 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 (vii),” Apple told CoinDesk.  Casarin said that Apple wanted the zap button removed from all “notes” or content sections – a configuration Apple deems tantamount to selling digital content according to Casarin – although it was fine to have a zap button on user profiles.  “​​I had a call with Apple and they told me that they don't want zaps to be used for selling,” Casarin explained. “I thought one of the compromises we can do is we’ll actually remove all note zapping functionality.”  He said he modified the Damus interface such that zap buttons would still appear on notes, but the zaps themselves wouldn’t be associated with any notes and would only be sent and processed at the profile level. Casarin says Apple wasn’t satisfied with his compromise.  “I spent the last two weeks removing the ability for users to see zaps,” Casarin said. “I resubmitted it and they just gave the exact same response.”  Apple confirmed it had engaged Casarin and clearly explained to him how to resolve the issue.  “As we previously communicated to this developer, they were to address the issues we outlined to them by their next update,” Apple explained. “Upon receipt of their latest submission, we found the issues were unresolved and rejected their app.”  None other than former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to criticize Apple's decision, arguing that ""tips aren't unlocking content."" Earlier this month, he had tweeted that a move by the tech giant to cut off Damus could restrict Bitcoin adoption and thwart the “one opportunity to build a truly global payment protocol for the Internet.”  Dorsey, who is now CEO of Bitcoin-focused financial services company Block (SQ), has donated millions towards the protocol’s development.  It’s unclear if the looming removal is simply a misunderstanding by Apple or part of a broader crackdown to restrict certain types of bitcoin-focused apps. On June 14, the company rejected an updated version of the non-custodial Lightning-enabled bitcoin wallet Zeus, but it was subsequently approved the next day.  “We review all apps against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers,” Apple said.  Casarin and others have criticized the company’s approval process, calling it “opaque.”  “The frustrating thing is that whenever you get feedback from Apple reviewers, they don't tell you specifically how you're breaking the guidelines,” Casarin said. “It's very frustrating. I think a lot of Bitcoin apps are at risk.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/27/jack-dorsey-questions-apples-tim-cook-over-bitcoin-support-as-damus-deplatforming-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bab97c4d72de76ec75c143d61fe2ed592d734162-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Altcoins demonstrate persistence Just when everyone thought that the crypto space was dead it has just got up and started walking around again. Like Lazarus from the dead, the altcoins have started to come back to life. The SEC seeking to destroy the fiat on/off ramps, its targeting of the two biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in Binance and Coinbase, the pulling down of the three main banks associated with the crypto sector - all designed to bring the entire crypto industry crashing to its knees. Obviously these actions, as well as many others, have affected the crypto sector. However, who would have thought that after such anti-crypto news had dropped, that within just a couple of weeks or so crypto would have made back all the losses and more. Gary Gensler of the SEC might want to look into how new technology will always rise, no matter what any heavy handed regulator might think about it. Even the banks are now finally starting to recognise the potential for such crypto innovations as tokenisation and alternative payments systems. USDT Dominance struggling at support Back to the altcoins, and USDT Dominance is fighting for survival at the 7.25% level. It has lost 7% over the last couple of weeks, and granted, much of that will have been lost to bitcoin, but even so, a rising bitcoin floats all altcoins. Having said that, “all altcoins” most certainly will not be the case. The vast majority of altcoins are arguably going to zero, and it might be said, the sooner the better. ""The vast majority"" will definitely leave a handful of incredibly disruptive altcoins that will be able to flourish and fulfil their incredible potential. Total 3, which charts all altcoins without bitcoin or ethereum, tells this story. The chart is still in a downtrend but there are signs that it is picking up, having been down to the 0.786 Fibonacci level, and having followed a downward channel since mid-2022. Be that as it may, altcoins will still for now have to rely on the ascension of bitcoin. The pattern would appear to be a strong upwards move from BTC and then accumulation. It is at this point that value will be diverted out of bitcoin and into altcoins, with the best of these making the running. Can there still be an altcoin season? The altcoin seasons of before have been epic in their proportions. If enough liquidity comes into bitcoin and the crypto space in general, then why not? However, with far more regulation coming to crypto there are more uncertainties as to how altcoins will behave. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42393247,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhIMQn,1687881702,Judge Rejects FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried's Motions to Dismiss Criminal Charges,"The federal judge overseeing FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's criminal trial denied his pretrial motions to dismiss criminal charges against him, writing that the exchange's founder did not have standing to dismiss many of these charges and didn't meet the ""extraordinary"" circumstances for a dismissal.  Bankman-Fried, who faces wire fraud, bank fraud, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, bribery and campaign finance charges, filed to dismiss the bulk of these charges last month across seven pretrial motions. After a court hearing earlier this month, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the last three of those motions.  On Tuesday, he denied Bankman-Fried's motions to dismiss the bank fraud, money transmitter, campaign finance, bribery, wire fraud and other fraud charges.  The judge's 41-page memorandum details his reasoning for rejecting the four remaining pretrial motions to dismiss, addressing questions of venue and whether prosecutors have alleged valid property right claims in bringing fraud charges.  ""The Second Circuit has deemed dismissal an 'extreme sanction' that has been upheld 'only in very limited and extreme circumstances,' and should be 'reserved for the truly extreme cases,' 'especially where serious criminal conduct is involved,"" the judge wrote.  Judge Kaplan had previously allowed Bankman-Fried and prosecutors to sever five of the 13 charges brought against the onetime FTX CEO, setting a March 2024 trial date for those charges.  Bankman-Fried argued that the Bahamas had to consent to charges brought post-extradition, an argument a Bahamas court agreed to prior to this month's hearing.  The judge noted that the Bahamas had not objected to any of the charges yet, though a ""renewed motion"" may be filed if that changes.  However, prosecutors are now set for an Oct. 2, 2023 trial date on the first eight charges they brought against Bankman-Fried.

CertiK, a blockchain security firm, confirmed that the developers behind Chibi Finance had stolen approximately $1 million worth of various tokens, according to their analysis of blockchain data shared to the CryptoDaily Editorial team. This factor led to the price of the CHIBI token to plummet by 98%. The Scam and its Execution Chibi Finance's exit scam unfolded as the developers, having gained control of the platform's smart contracts, proceeded to steal a significant amount of users' funds. The scam was orchestrated using a malicious contract set up by the deployer of Chibi Finance. By establishing this malicious contract as the _gov address, the developers gained the ability to invoke the panic function. This function enabled them to trigger an emergencyWithdraw of funds to the exit scammer's address. Approximately 256,012.95 USDC, 94.67 WETH, 4.25520843 WBTC, 115,049 USDT, and 89,563.95 ARB were siphoned off from the project's contracts. The stolen assets were subsequently swapped for 555 ETH, which were then bridged from the Arbitrum network to the Ethereum network. These funds were ultimately laundered through Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused Ethereum mixing service frequently used to obscure transactional activity. Aftermath and Indications of Fraud In the immediate aftermath of the scam, the price of the CHIBI token plummeted, registering a staggering 98% drop. Adding to the distressing developments, Chibi Finance also deactivated its Twitter account and took down its official website, thereby leaving no room for doubt about the fraudulent nature of the operation. The exit scam came as a shock to the users of Chibi Finance, which had launched around April 2023 and had promoted itself as a yield-optimizing service on the Arbitrum chain. In addition to auto-compounded yields, Chibi Finance had touted several other features typically associated with yield farming. The platform had undergone its first audit on May 31 and had recently reported $500k in Total Value Locked (TVL), with ambitions to reach $1 million. As recent as June 26, Chibi Finance announced that it had been listed on CoinGecko. Scams on the Arbitrum Network: A Growing Concern This exit scam is unfortunately not an isolated incident. CertiK reports that over $14 million has been lost to scams on the Arbitrum network across 12 different instances in 2023 alone. The growing number of such fraudulent activities underlines the need for greater vigilance and more stringent security measures in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. These scams, commonly referred to as ""rug pulls,"" typically involve developers gaining legitimacy on social media, hyping up their projects, and raising substantial amounts of money. Once the project's tokens are offered to the public, the developers abruptly withdraw the liquidity, leaving the token holders high and dry. This incident serves as a cautionary tale, underscoring the importance of thorough due diligence and careful assessment of risk when investing in DeFi projects, especially those operating on relatively new platforms such as Arbitrum. The security and integrity of smart contracts remain crucial factors to consider, and potential investors are advised to be wary of any red flags that may indicate possible fraudulent intentions.

42410294,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF4S0,1687879448,The Second FTX Asset Recovery Report Is Packed With Bombshells,"The second report of John J. Ray III and his FTX restructuring team (the “debtors”) was released on Monday, June 26, and it’s a doozy. The report firms up our sense of specific financial flows, including the use of customer funds for political donations and venture capital investments at defunct crypto exchange FTX and related hedge fund Alameda Research. Among those are many flows to entities controlled by friends and family of Sam Bankman-Fried, reinforcing the picture of a vast and coordinated criminal effort.  More explosively, the report claims that FTX executives were aware as early as August 2022 that the exchange was missing more than $8 billion in customer funds. This recasts many statements made by executives like Caroline Ellison, and especially by FTX CEO and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried himself, in the following weeks and months.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     Even more damning, the report describes Bankman-Fried getting very hands-on in furtherance of the overall fraud.  Two notes before diving in: First, all of the following are allegations made by the FTX liquidators. The claims may or may not surface or be confirmed in the separate criminal trial against Sam Bankman-Fried, currently scheduled to begin in October. And second, for clarity, I’ll be referring throughout to “customer funds” interchangeably with “commingled funds,” because by their nature, the vast majority of commingled funds would likely have been customer funds.  Into the spaghettiverse  While the details are spicy, the main course of the report is the following big bowl of spaghetti, representing the flows of FTX customer funds. Note how many flows end at “to be determined” – the recovery team’s work, clearly, is not yet done.  Highlights of this mess include the claim that $20 million of FTX customer funds went to Guarding Against Pandemics (GAP), a quote-unquote “nonprofit” run by Gabe Bankman-Fried, Sam’s brother. Though this funding was already known, the report seems to be the first authoritative claim that funding to GAP came from specific bank accounts full of commingled (that is, customer) funds. This deepens existing questions about the Bankman-Fried family’s knowledge of and participation in the fraud.  Throughout the report, we see SBF’s closest friends and associates eagerly gobbling up the stolen funds. The FTX Foundation, another quote-unquote “nonprofit” entity that was itself funded with customer money, donated $400,000 to an unnamed Effective Altruism organization that made YouTube videos promoting that troubling ideology.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried's Altruism Wasn't Very Effective | Opinion  Then there are the (again quote-unquote) “venture investments.” These were seemingly not real investments, but rather financial cutouts primarily created to recycle and obscure stolen FTX user funds. The new report specifically describes the “investment” of $450 million worth of FTX customer funds into an entity called Modulo Capital.  Modulo Capital had been founded by two known Bankman-Fried associates, Duncan Rheingans-Yoo and Xiaoyun “Lilly” Zhang. According to the New York Times, Yoo was only two years out of college, and Zhang (like Caroline Ellison) was a former romantic partner of Bankman-Fried.  Smoking guns  Finally on the money front, we get some new insight into the massive personal loans that went to FTX executives, many meant to fund political donations (themselves wildly illegal). The debtors report makes the important claim that “the evidence identified by the Debtors indicates the transfers were ‘loans’ in name only.”  Way back in November of last year I described these loans as a “smoking bazooka” indicating clear criminal intent – the new report appears to be confirmation of that assessment. And there’s more where that came from – the report is packed with tidbits that suggest goings-on at FTX were overtly and intentionally criminal.  For one, the report claims that “by August 2022, the FTX Senior Executives and [Caroline] Ellison privately estimated that the FTX.com exchange owed customers over $8 billion in fiat currency that it did not have. They did not disclose the shortfall.” This $8 billion shortfall was hidden in a fake account with a negative $8 billion balance, referred to internally as belonging to “our Korean friend.”  That account was known, but I’m not aware of any similarly authoritative source making specific claims that execs knew about the shortfall as early as August. This would be incredibly bad for Sam Bankman-Fried, who made countless representations to FTX’s rock-solid finances after that, further clarifying his fraudulent machinations.  But the report also makes a claim that would somehow be even worse for SBF if it were demonstrated in his criminal case. It describes a “Payment Agent Agreement” intended to make the flow of FTX customer deposits through Alameda Research bank accounts look intentional, rather than some mix of negligence and fraud.  While the debtors found that the payment agreement document was created in April of 2021, it was backdated to an “effective date” of June 1, 2019. This was seemingly intended to create the impression that FTX customer funds had always flowed through Alameda. In fact, of course, that flow was an exigent strategy to circumvent banking controls, and it seems to have underpinned the larger fraud.  In short, the payment agent agreement document is evidence of a criminal conspiracy.  And according to the debtors report, Sam Bankman-Fried signed the fraudulently backdated document with his own, actual hand: “Notably, while Bankman-Fried regularly executed agreements electronically using DocuSign, which electronically records the date and time of execution, Bankman-Fried signed the Payment Agent Agreement with a wet signature.”  This is just radioactively bad for Bankman-Fried’s criminal defense, for two reasons. First, the one-time use of a physical signature indicates a clear strategy to avoid generating Docusign metadata that might reveal the document was not signed in 2019. That clearly indicates Bankman-Fried was engaging in conspiracy to commit and conceal fraud.  See also: FTX's Bankruptcy Fees Already Topped $200M, Court Examiner Says  Second, a physical signature means it’s possible someone actually saw Bankman-Fried sign the document, and/or that it can be clearly established that the signature is his. This would eliminate even the farfetched hypothetical defense that Bankman-Fried’s electronic signature was somehow faked and he was actually unaware of the document.  To reiterate, it’s not certain that these and other facts claimed in the debtors report will become part of Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial, but it seems very likely most will.  So while we were already pretty sure Sam Bankman-Fried was cooked, it’s starting to look like he’s downright deep-fried.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | RESEARCH,David Z.

42410283,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF3uw,1687877493,Don’t Overlook Tokyo and Hong Kong as Crypto Hot Spots,"As CoinDesk publishes its list of global crypto hubs, there are two striking omissions. Tokyo and Hong Kong are very publicly welcoming crypto at a time when other jurisdictions, notably the United States, are sending a far less friendly message. So why didn’t they make the list? One possible reason is that even though neither are new to crypto, both retreated from the spotlight for some period of time. But now, Japan and Hong Kong are poised to become increasingly important players in the crypto world.  Emily Parker is CoinDesk's executive director of global content.  Let’s start with Japan, which is actively trying to position itself as a Web3 powerhouse. To be clear, Japan is hardly a newcomer. But after the cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck was hacked in early 2018, the country went into something like hibernation. Regulators tightened the reins, and the mood in the crypto community was not particularly upbeat.  Now, Japan is clearly back. Regulators learned lessons from the Coincheck hack and that of Mt. Gox before it, and put in place safeguards to protect users. So when much of the crypto world was reeling from the collapse of FTX, FTX Japan users were relatively protected. Some politicians in Tokyo are actively seeking to lay out clear rules of the road for crypto.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Hong Kong is another hub that is hardly new to Web3, but in recent years its appeal may have been tempered by COVID-19 restrictions and headlines about mainland China’s crackdown on the crypto industry. But now, Hong Kong is making a clear effort to position itself as a global crypto destination. Hong Kong began accepting licenses for crypto exchanges in June, and has reportedly pressured banks to take on crypto exchanges as clients.  Where the United States sees risk, Hong Kong sees opportunity. In the midst of Coinbase’s battles with the SEC, a Hong Kong lawmaker invited the U.S.’ largest crypto exchange to apply to operate in the region. Hong Kong’s position is striking given the history of crypto crackdowns in mainland China, which appears to at least tacitly support Hong Kong’s welcoming stance. For now, at least.  This is not to say that it will be easy to operate crypto exchanges in Hong Kong or Tokyo. Operating in these jurisdictions comes with significant rules and restrictions, and some global companies may find it difficult to survive there. Both Kraken and Coinbase recently left Japan, for example.

Social Media Users Have Turned Bearish On Bitcoin As explained by the analytics firm Santiment, traders have come into the new week expecting the price of the cryptocurrency to retrace towards the $27,000 to $29,000 range. The relevant indicator here is the “social volume,” which measures the total number of social media text documents that are making mentions of a specific term or topic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Stagnates At ATH, What Does This Mean? The text documents here refer to posts/threads sourced from various popular social media platforms like Reddit, Telegram, and Twitter. Something to keep in mind is that the metric only measures the unique number of such documents, meaning that regardless of whether a post mentions the term one time or five times, the contribution towards the social volume will still remain one unit. This indicator helps us gauge the amount of discussion that a topic is receiving across social media right now. It can also be used to measure the market sentiment if some specific terms are applied. To separate the Bitcoin discussions related to positive and negative sentiments, Santiment has taken the total social volume related to the cryptocurrency market and has then filtered it using terms like buy, bottom, and bullish for the former, and sell, top, and bearish for the latter. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the social volume of these terms over the past week or so: The value of the red sentiment seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the social volume related to negative sentiment has spiked recently. The positive sentiment, on the other hand, has remained at low values. This would suggest that the majority of the Bitcoin traders on social media are bearish on the asset and are expecting it to register a drawdown in the near future. Historically, BTC has tended to show price moves in the direction that the average investor isn’t expecting. The more heavily the crowd leans toward any particular side, the more the probability of such a reverse price move taking place becomes. From the chart, it’s visible that the bearish sentiment has seen multiple spikes during the last week as the latest rally in the cryptocurrency’s price above the $30,000 mark has occurred. Interestingly, one of these surges in the metric happened right before this rally started. The local top so far, however, also coincided with such a spike, but it’s also true that the positive sentiment was also elevated during it.

This decision, which constitutes the third round of job cuts happened within a span of slightly over a year. This was stated in an internal communication by the firm’s chief financial officer, Jason Warnick, and it was attributed to the need for adjustments of team structures. The 150 employees from its workforce constitute around 7% of its total staff. A Robinhood spokesperson stated: We’re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload, org design, and more. Robinhood has experienced a noticeable decline in trading activity, especially within the crypto sector. In May, the company reported a significant 30% year-on-year decrease in crypto trading revenue. Related Reading: Chainlink Bulls Must Defend Support Zone To Prepare For Another Rally Robinhood’s decline in performance could be further impacted by its decision to delist various cryptocurrencies, including Solana and Cardano. The delistings come in the wake of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s legal actions against prominent exchanges Coinbase and Binance. This layoff report also comes after Robinhood’s recent acquisition of credit card firm X1 in a deal worth $95 million. Third Round Of Workforce Reductions At Robinhood Last year, Robinhood implemented workforce reductions, reducing its headcount by 9% in April. Subsequently, in August, they conducted another round of layoffs, resulting in a significant 23% reduction of the remaining staff. These measures collectively led to a loss of over 1,000 employees for the company. During its peak in the second quarter of 2021, Robinhood witnessed remarkable success with 21.3 million active users and revenue surpassing $565 million. However, recent times have been challenging for the brokerage firm. The Q1 2023 results indicate a significant downturn, with a 44% decline in monthly active users and a 30% year-over-year decrease in revenue for Robinhood. Robinhood is not the only company undergoing the effects of a less active crypto market though. Lower trading volumes across the industry have resulted in reduced profits for companies involved in facilitating crypto trades. Companies such as Robinhood, whose revenue is heavily dependent on trading volumes are always trying to adapt to the evolving market dynamics. This is to ensure the sustainability of their operations and also to stay competitive. As the market continues to evolve, brokerage firms and exchanges will likely need to reevaluate their strategies and offerings in order to attract and retain users. It may be necessary for them to explore alternative revenue streams to mitigate the impact of reduced trading volumes. The recent acquisition represents a significant milestone for Robinhood as the company endeavors to diversify its range of offerings and revenue streams. Related Reading: Binance Rescinds Decision To Remove Privacy Coins From European Market Currently, Robinhood shares are trading at $9.63, reflecting an 18% increase since the beginning of the year.

The funding was led by digital asset manager Scytale Digital, with participation from prominent investors such as ARK Invest, Andreessen Horowitz and Animoca Brands.  The extension follows a $150 million Series C round in November, 2021, which was led by a16z and valued the company at $1.25 billion. The Seattle-based firm plans to close the extension round later this year and anticipates raising $20 million to $30 million in additional capital.  Mythical Games is known for its Mythical Chain blockchain and gaming ecosystem, Mythical Marketplace and popular blockchain-based games NFL Rivals and Blankos Block Party. NFL Rivals topped a million downloads last week, two months after its launch.  ""Our goal for 2023 is to further optimize our business and achieve profitability,"" co-founder and CEO John Linden told CoinDesk in an email. ""These funds will primarily be used to achieve that through platform updates, infrastructure developments and enhancements, and the development and subsequent launch of additional games in our pipeline.”  Mythical Games raised a total of $200 million in 2021, including $75 million in June as well as the Series C. Other backers this time round included PROOF VC, Stanford Athletics, MoonPay, WestCap, Gaingels, Signum Growth, and Struck Capital.  The company hit rougher waters last year, losing three top executives in early November and a day later announcing job cuts that hit 10% of the workforce. The former executives went on to form Fenix Games, and Mythical Games sued the trio in December for secretly raising $150 million for their new firm.  Looking forward, Mythical Games will launch Nitro Nation World Tour in late July. The racing game for mobile and desktop will feature car brands like Aston Martin, Jaguar, Pagani and Lotus and allows players to race around the world to collect digital vehicles.  In addition, feature updates to the Mythical Marketplace, including a new in-game marketplace for NFL Rivals, are in development and should roll out in a few months, Linden said.

Still, technical analysis research provider Fairlead Strategies remains long-term neutral on the world largest cryptocurrency by market value.  Per Fairlead, the long-term outlook will flip bullish once prices cross above ""Ichimoku cloud"" resistance at $31,900"" and momentum indicators like the MACD histogram validate the move.  ""We remain long-term neutral on bitcoin, but a breakout above the weekly cloud and a monthly MACD 'buy' signal would dictate a bullish bias,"" analysts at Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients on Monday.  Created by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, the Ichimoku cloud is primarily used by traders and analysts to define support and resistance levels and identify momentum and trend direction. It comprises two lines – the leading span A and the leading span B. The gap between the two lines forms the cloud. Crossovers above or below the cloud are widely taken to represent bullish or bearish trend change.  The MACD histogram is a moving average-based indicator used to gauge trend strength and changes. Crossovers above zero represent a bullish shift in momentum, while crossovers below zero suggest otherwise.  The weekly chart (above left) shows bitcoin is looking to extend past week's 15.5% rise, the biggest since March.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $30,700, with the cloud resistance located at around $31,900.  The renewed positive reading on the weekly chart MACD and the upturn in the stochastic indicator suggest scope for a breakout above the cloud resistance, per Fairlead.

In the meanwhile, users are able to send each other Bitcoin for fees of 0.0029% or free on the lightning network. However, the lightning network's potential is stunted due to the fact that Bitcoin is not a widespread currency. When coupling the lightning network with financial institutions offering on- and off-ramps, remittances can be made for a fee as low as 2% and will be settled in both users' local currency. The fruition of this system is unclear, but it would unlock incredible utility value for Bitcoin itself. I. Introduction: The Lightning Network One thing that I have realized from following Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for some time is that Bitcoin is not a static digital currency protocol, rather it's a continuously developing ecosystem. Because of this Bitcoin has two layers. Layer one is the core Bitcoin network that includes a distributed ledger, network nodes, and the proof of work consensus mechanism ( Trustmachines.co ). The second layer includes software projects that increase the use case of the fundamental layer one. One such second-layer solution is The Lightning Network. The Lightning Network was released in a beta version in 2018, which allowed users to instantly and securely send Bitcoin to each other without needing on-chain verification ( Bitcoinmagazine ). The best thing of all is that users could send each other this digital money nationally or internationally at a percentage fee of 0.0029% ( Bitcoinke ). Meanwhile, remittance payments incur an average fee of 6.24% and they could take several days to complete ( River.com ). Although lightning is obviously more efficient for money transfer than the established system, the technology's prospect as a solution to the remittance industry is dependent on the traditional banking system as well as lightning service providers ('LSP'). Bitcoin is a volatile asset which makes it unsuitable as a currency, which is why on- and off-ramps from Bitcoin to national currencies will need to be established by banks. Furthermore, for the lightning network to be utilized at scale, lightning service providers are needed to provide liquidity channels. II. Current Use Cases With Lightning Lightning is already being used by countless platforms and apps as a means of payment. Strike, Block Inc.'s ( SQ ) Cash App, Blue Wallet, Wallet of Satoshi, River, and more have all enabled consumers with a lightning wallet address that they can use to send and receive Bitcoin; for Cash App users, the transfer is completely free. Another use case that has been extremely popular is using the Lightning Network to send 'Zaps', which are very small Bitcoin payments sent on a decentralized social media app - Damus - to support others' content. Zapping has also been lobbied for by MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) chairman, Michael Saylor, who wants to build zap functionalities throughout the internet. To give some perspective about zaps, users usually zap each other Bitcoin worth the equivalent of $0.50 or less. These micropayments that utilize the lightning network have been philosophized to be the next 'algorithm' for boosting social media posts. In other words, the rate and amount of zaps that a post receives can be used to order a social media feed to ensure that users are consuming the most relevant and respected content. A large road bump has recently been struck, however. Apple ( AAPL ) has notified that Damus can no longer operate with the zap functionality since it bypasses its rules for having donations in an IOS app be made with in-app purchase methods, among other concerns ( Cointelegraph ). The recent news has severely dampened the optimism of Damus users, Bitcoin activists, and investors alike. Furthermore, it has brought to light how the IOS app store monopoly cripples freedom. Given the disruptive nature of this technology, pushback is inevitable. But, one thing is here to stay: borderless payments. As digital wallets around the world, such as the ones I mentioned above, integrate lightning people will be able to send Bitcoin between each other for little to no fees. This means that people in the U.S. can instantly send Bitcoin to people in Africa, South America, Europe, etc... Countries with unstable national currencies have widely accepted Bitcoin as a store of value and mode of exchange, which increases the utility of Bitcoin lightning immensely. However, in order to completely become a remittance solution, payments must be sent and delivered in national currencies with on- and off-ramps. III. Lightning As a Solution to High Remittance Fees During the Bitcoin Conference 2023 in Miami many speakers, including those representing Block Inc's subsidiary TBD, spoke of the idea that with the future remittance, the consumer will not know that payments are made with the Bitcoin system rather it is simply a back-end technology used to conduct cross-border payments. River displays this process well in the picture below: Bitcoin vs the $156 Trillion Global Payments Industry ""This model uses Bitcoin’s biggest second-layer scaling solution, the Lightning Network, but not in the way many Bitcoiners would expect where they directly interface with it. Exchanges and other financial services are also users of this network. They can transact among each other on behalf of their clients, which has a key advantage: clients never need to understand, own, or use bitcoin. It is simply used as a back-end settlement solution."" The implications of sending remittances through an exchange/broker using the lightning system are that consumers take on no Bitcoin fluctuation risk. So, potential price drops in Bitcoin are the responsibility of the exchange/broker to manage. Although this may challenge these institutions, they are undoubtedly better suited to handle it than individuals on average. In return, the exchange/broker can charge a fee for its service. Another upside to this system is that since consumers receive money in their account directly, counterparty risk against the exchange is largely eliminated (because the lightning system allows for instant transfers). i. On- and off-ramps On- and off-ramps are essentially the act of exchanges/brokers converting a national currency to Bitcoin and converting Bitcoin to a national currency. These institutions will be highly regulated, which allows for a fair framework but can also be vulnerable to quick regulatory actions that undermine Bitcoin. Therefore, Bitcoin as a solution for remittance payments somewhat strides against freedom from the 'state', but a working collaboration greatly increases the use-case for Bitcoin. Using this system will not save users from all fees, though. While sending lightning payments incurs a fee of 0.0029% and sending regular remittance payments incurs an average fee of 6.24%, the on- and off-ramp solution will likely be somewhere in between. Exchanges/brokers will require a fee for converting the payment into a national currency and lightning service providers will charge a fee for opening up payment channels that are used to transfer the payment on the lightning network. The foreign exchange markup charged by online platforms varies from 1.5-4% ( Livemint ). For example, Xoom and Stripe charge a 2% markup fee while PayPal offers a 4% markup fee. ii. Lightning Service Providers (LSP) While foreign exchange (forex) markups make up the majority of the potential remittance fee, LSPs only charge a marginal markup. One of the largest LSPs, Kraken, for example, charges 388 stats for every 1 million sats sent and 628 sats for every 1 million sats received ( amboss ). This equates to fees of 0.00038% and 0.00063% of the transaction value. These fees are incredibly minimal when compared to forex rates and the trade occurs instantly. Amboss iii. Verdict In all, fees for remittance payments using the lightning network and on- and-off ramps could amount to around 2%. This is substantially lower than the current average of 6.24%. To me, this means that this system would be ideal for transferring money across borders, but it doesn't come without any complications. For this system to work, financial institutions need to be involved in order to establish the on- and off-ramps, which is the most important function needed to make the system useful. Given that the idea, technology, and system are yet nascent, we may not see wide adoption by many players (exchanges/brokers) for a very long time. The more players that become involved, though, the less concentration risk will be involved, which would secure the system. While financial institutions and the government has an overall pessimistic view of Bitcoin and crypto, the growth in lightning service providers and lightning capacity is blazing forward. Although it is unclear if the lightning system and the traditional banking system will be able to work together in symbiosis, I am optimistic about how the two could potentially lower remittance fees by almost 70%. This is a use-case for the Bitcoin ecosystem that seems unparalleled with any other and if the collaboration comes to fruition, Bitcoin's utility itself will increase dramatically. V. What A Remittance Solution Means For Bitcoin's Price The digital currency is now hovering around $30,000, up from December lows of ~$16,000 and a rollercoaster in between. Recent articles, "" Bitcoin: Guess Who's Back "" & "" This Bitcoin Rally Isn't Due To Technicals, Will Stay Past $30k "" have pointed out that Bitcoin's dominance in the ""crypto"" space may keep it on a sustained upward trajectory. The articles have also discussed that the recent ETFs that have been proposed, such as the one by BlackRock ( BLK ), are a reflection of the optimism in and popularity of Bitcoin. In the end, Bitcoin's price is based on supply and demand dynamics. The more institutions that buy Bitcoin as an underlying asset or backing asset to their investment products, the higher the demand for Bitcoin will be. This means that the price of Bitcoin should be sustained since the supply is restricted. It is noticeable that Bitcoin's recovery is driven by the popularity it has with individuals due to its ease of use and its utility for government-free monetary exchange. This can be seen clearly, for example, in Block Inc's latest quarterly report where Bitcoin revenue amounted to $2.16 billion in comparison to $1.73 billion in the first quarter of last year ( Block Inc Q1 ). This means that the demand among individual investors has been increasing as the price has been rising. Although the recent news of new Bitcoin ETFs is a strong tailwind to increasing the public trust and hence demand for Bitcoin, it does not provide extra utility to Bitcoin. However, using Bitcoin lightning to resolve the remittance industry does. According to River, remittance volumes equated to $794 billion in 2022 with an average remittance size of $200-300 every one to two months. This is the ideal use case for the lightning network to handle and given that fees can be reduced by 70%, using Bitcoin to transact is a huge value-add. In essence, if financial institutions begin adopting this system, then it means that they will need to hold onto this Bitcoin in order to fulfill transactions. This would dramatically increase the demand and value of Bitcoin, especially considering that the market value of all Bitcoin is currently lower ($593 billion) than the fast-growing remittance industry. Compared to the new ETFs, the remittance use case would create an even larger price increase in Bitcoin and it would additionally create more resistance in the Bitcoin price. As opposed to the ETFs, Bitcoin rails as a solution to the remittance industry are not firmly established yet and will require strict cooperation. But, given the promise of this system to remove the cumbersome and costly aspects that are unavoidable when sending remittance payments, the incentive for cooperation is very strong. For this reason, I believe that the technology will come and it will definitely support further growth in the price of Bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613856-can-bitcoin-lightning-solve-the-remittance-industry?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14249570.jpeg

14249181,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539910,1687869052,"Ethereum Classic (ETC) Soars 22% In One Week, Is $20 Possible?","Ethereum Classic (ETC) bulls have been active over the past week, bullishly pushing the token’s price with significant gains in the last seven days. An over 22% seven-day price increase saw ETC smash the $15.79 resistance level to $18.74 at press time. Bullish signals point to more rallies for Ethereum Classic as the global market cap rallies, gradually propelling Bitcoin toward the $31,000 mark. The token could be charging up momentum to conquer the $20 mark in the coming days. Ethereum Classic’s Price Swings Ethereum Classic (ETC) launched in July 2016 as a hard fork of Ethereum that supports decentralized applications (DApps). The main aim of Ethereum Classic’s launch is to preserve the Ethereum blockchain’s originality. Earlier in June, ETC’s price retraced from its key support level of $18.25. It plunged into a bearish swing that caused severe losses for the token. Related Reading: XRP Traders Show Capitulation, Why This Could Be Bullish ETC’s price rapidly nosedived from over $18 on June 4 to less than $15 in mid-June. The token traded sideways between June 10 and June 20 before shooting up to $19.17 on June 24, with an over 27% price increase. Fortunately, ETC recovered momentum after several days of bearish movement. And Ethereum Classic was among the coins that benefited from the buzz generated by multiple Bitcoin ETF filings by leading US-based asset managers. The token shows bullish signs as the market slightly rebounded today after a brief correction in the last 24 hours. As of the time of writing, ETC trades at $18.74, with a 24-hour price increase of 2.52% and a 22.89% seven-day growth in value. Can Ethereum Classic Bulls Defend The Ongoing Rally? Buyers took charge of the market between June 23 and 24. The increasing buying pressure pushed the trading volume from $151.66 million to over $500 million on June 24. Though there was a pullback, another uptick in trading volume is noticeable, with a 43.29% increase in the last 24 hours. This suggests the bulls are determined to claim the $20 level and could achieve the target if the uptick in trading volume continues. Ethereum Classic’s key support level currently stands at $18.42 on its TradingView daily chart. The bulls are working with the $19.44 resistance level in mind. But the ETC price may shoot above $20 once the bulls successfully push the token off the $19.44 resistance. Related Reading: How High Can Bitcoin Price Rise Due To Spot ETFs? Running The Numbers The cryptocurrency market outlook shows recovery signs as most coins trade in the green zone. But the overall market outlook suggests a mixed investor reaction since some coin prices are still red. Bitcoin, the chief cryptocurrency, has increased by 0.91% in 24 hours with a 14.20% seven-day gain, while Ethereum still fluctuates between the red and green zones. Chances are high that ETC would sustain its rally if the market sentiment becomes fully bullish.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The European Union (EU) on Tuesday secured a political deal on new bank-capital legislation, including for crypto assets, after lawmakers sought “prohibitive” rules to keep unbacked crypto out of the traditional financial system. The agreement was announced in a tweet from the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee after a meeting among representatives of the European Parliament, national governments and the European Commission, which had first proposed the new rules back in 2021. The deal must now be voted on by member states in the EU’s Council to become legislation, a process that could take several months.  Cryptocurrency custody technology provider Fireblocks has started offering support for cloud service providers Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, Thales and Securosus, the company announced Tuesday. The moves are part of Fireblocks’ effort to make its services accessible to a wider range of businesses and allow it to serve a market of banks whose IT infrastructure is deployed on premise and cloud-based solutions, a spokesperson said. With the new additions, the enterprise platform is covering the majority of the cloud industry's market share.  OKX has launched “Nitro Spreads,” a feature on its over-the-counter (OTC) institutional liquid marketplace that allows traders to make complex basis trades in one-click. Basis trading refers to trading the difference between an asset’s price on two separate markets in an attempt to generate returns, for example, on spot vs. futures markets. OKX’s Nitro Spread automates this kind of trade into one-click. Traders can apply this feature across any combination of spot, perpetual and futures contracts listed on the exchange, said the company.""In the current complex market environment, institutions demand reliability, predictable returns and genuine innovation when choosing a trading venue,” said Lennix Lai, global chief commercial officer at OKX. “This is especially true in basis trading, where precision and flawless execution are paramount,” he added.

Market Insight  Digital asset investment products last week witnessed the largest single weekly inflows in a year after nine consecutive weeks of outflows, according to a report from European digital asset manager CoinShares.  Bitcoin-related products were the primary asset for inflows, with $188 million, or 94% of the total. Short-bitcoin products saw total outflow of $4.9 million, their ninth consecutive week of net exits, according to the report.  The rush of inflows came alongside a big rally in the price of bitcoin as a number of high profile traditional financial (TradFi) institutions followed BlackRock’s lead in filing for a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). These applications included re-filings for previously rejected spot bitcoin ETFs from tradfi asset managers like Invesco and WisdomTree.

Gemini Enables Voyager Funds Recovery In a statement posted on Sunday, June 25, the Gemini team announced a fund recovery program for those affected by the Voyager bankruptcy. The customers who hope to reclaim their lost funds will need to join the Gemini platform and will have time till July 23, 2023, to avail of the offer. Additionally, the team is also presenting a promotional offer of $5 BTC for every new verified Voyager customer from the United States who joins the Gemini platform. The statement reads, “Through July 23, 2023, Voyager customers impacted by the Voyager bankruptcy can create a Gemini account to withdraw their crypto in-kind, pursuant to the claims of the distribution process. We are pleased to offer a promotional welcome to all Voyager customers who join Gemini. New U.S. customers from Voyager will receive $5 in BTC after they sign up and become verified within 30 days of opening their account.” Customers To Recover Gemini-Supported Tokens Gemini has been powering through the current crypto landscape, especially seeking expansion opportunities in the APAC countries. The company has, in fact, applied for its UAE license. It has now taken on the responsibility of being the full-reserve exchange and custodian for all client funds on the Voyager platform. The company also clarified that the fund recovery would only be applicable to tokens supported by Gemini. If a Voyager customer sends tokens not supported by the Gemini platform, they might be lost and completely unrecoverable. A similar loss of funds might affect the transition of tokens to Gemini over an unsupported network. Furthermore, if users do not withdraw their funds from the Voyager platform within the stipulated time, they will be liquidated and distributed back in cash. Voyager’s Bankruptcy Struggles Just a few weeks ago, there were reports of a Voyager bankruptcy plan which claimed that the bankrupt firm was going to restart customer withdrawals to refund 35.72% of what was owed. After facing financial difficulties and declaring bankruptcy almost a year ago, Voyager Digital struggled with securing deals to reopen customer withdrawals. In fact, the company had two prior unsuccessful attempts. The first was the $1.4 billion deal with FTX US that fell through when the latter’s bankruptcy scandal broke. Voyager’s second attempt was a $1 billion deal with the US division of prominent cryptocurrency firm Binance. However, this, too, failed to materialize as Binance withdrew from the agreement, citing concerns over a ""hostile and uncertain regulatory climate"" in the United States.

In the last several weeks alone, three exchanges including Binance, Bybit and OKX, have exited Canada altogether. Gemini announced it would dramatically boost headcount and operations in Singapore. And venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has named its first non-U.S. outpost – in London.  This is a fluid time for crypto companies as it seems the regulatory landscape is shifting eastward from North America, where both the U.S. and Canada are seen as unfriendly. In the past year or so, Dubai established the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), with neighboring city Abu Dhabi seeking to pass its own crypto-friendly regulatory framework this year, the European Union passed the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation in April and just this month, and Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission began accepting license applications for crypto exchanges.  The lack of a global regulatory framework for crypto has made it possible, if not imperative, to practice regulatory arbitrage. Last year, directors of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Monetary and Capital Markets department called for a global framework to “bring order to the markets, help instill consumer confidence, lay out the limits of what is permissible, and provide a safe space for useful innovation to continue.”  The absence of such a coordinated worldwide effort would lead to national regulators “locked into differing regulatory frameworks.” Ultimately, crypto professionals would be compelled to “migrate to the friendliest jurisdictions.”  Read How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.  That is the reality of the crypto industry today. With the strong popularity of remote work, crypto companies really cannot ignore the possibility of relocating or at least expanding to more crypto friendly jurisdictions. The countries or regions where regulations are in place are attracting attention and interest from even the biggest companies.  It’s not a coincidence that after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Coinbase (COIN), the largest U.S. crypto exchange, for allegedly trading unregistered securities, a politician in Hong Kong then invited the company to apply for licensing in the city-state. Or that Coinbase has publicized its meetings with authorities in the United Arab Emirates to discuss establishing a hub there.  Startup founders and digital nomads alike are surveying the landscape and developing a rubric for deciding where to put down roots, said Janina Pietrowska, an attorney at Rechtsanwälte Lennert Partners in Liechtenstein that advises crypto clients on choosing where to incorporate, especially security token offerings.  She said regulation, though important, should not be the entire consideration. Other important factors include a favorable investment environment, the ease of doing business and low taxes.  The world is your oyster  If you could relocate anywhere in the world, where would you go?  This is basically the question CoinDesk is answering in Crypto Hubs 2023 with a ranked list of the best places to live and work for crypto professionals.  We put ourselves in a crypto startup founder’s shoes and collected then weighted data for eight different criteria that range from regulatory friendliness, digital infrastructure to quality of life. Our results, a ranked list of 15 crypto hubs, may contain some surprises. And we hope it will spark discussion.

42410291,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF4LO,1687866145,Zug: Where Ethereum Was Born and Crypto Goes to Grow Up,"Tiny is mighty when it comes to Zug's performance across all the criteria in our Crypto Hubs 2023 rubric. With a small population, Zug scored highest overall for opportunity measures due to the richness of its per-capita crypto-related companies and events. The hub also had the highest ranking in the two heaviest weighted criteria overall, regulatory structure (a “driver” and 35% of total weight,) and quality of life (an “enabler” and 15%). Across the board, Zug had no glaring weaknesses.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     The most iconic origin story in crypto is the Bitcoin white paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. The runner-up? The Ethereum launch in 2015 by a baby-faced Vitalik Buterin, who feverishly worked out of a small apartment in Zug, Switzerland, alongside other coders.  “It was like a shoe box. A family house. People were living there on mattresses, almost like a hostel,” Bernd Lapp, an early member of the Ethereum Foundation’s advisory board, told me a few years ago. He remembers that Buterin was “very kind, very nice” and would shop for groceries, peel carrots and then hand them out to the coders.  The birthplace of Ethereum is one reason why Zug is “literally the crypto cradle,” said Alexander E. Brunner, a former member of Zurich’s parliament and author of the book “Crypto Nation Switzerland.”  Another reason is the Swiss government. “You can deny it or you can face it,” Dolfi Müller, the former mayor of Zug once said of the emergence of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. “We always said we have to face it, because these things are coming if we want or not.”  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  So Zug faced it, working proactively to brand the region as “Crypto Valley,” their answer to Silicon Valley. For example, the government experimented with allowing citizens to pay their taxes with bitcoin. Then there was the clear regulatory framework. “Switzerland was the first country to have a guideline,” said Brunner.  Whereas regulatory limbo – or what some call “Operation Choke Point 2.0” – has soured crypto companies on making a home in the United States, in Switzerland you know precisely what you’re going to get, and they make it easy for you. There are even local “crypto banks” like SEBA and Sygnum, which provide crypto start-ups the basics like tax statements, coin storage and deposit insurance, said Brunner. (Rarer to find elsewhere in the world.)  This crypto-cozy environment is why the Ethereum Foundation, Cardano, Cosmos and hundreds of other projects came to Zug. Taxes are low, there’s fintech everywhere, Zurich University has a strong blockchain center, and the Zug government just pledged 39 million Swiss francs (~$43.7 million in USD) towards a blockchain research center.  Although there’s one bit of nuance: Zug itself isn’t packed with bars and crypto bros. It’s a small city. The population is less than 30,000 and as Brunner said with surprising bluntness, “It’s boring.” This is why, realistically, the idea of Zug as a crypto “hub” also factors in the larger cities of Zurich (only a 20-minute train ride away) and Bern and Geneva. “It has sort of spread across all of Switzerland,” said Brunner.  Not a dev nation  And while Zug might be a convenient place to legally park your company, it’s not always – or even usually – where you pay people to do the actual work. Switzerland is one of the few places on the planet that makes New York City feel cheap. “A lot of the developer talent doesn’t live in Switzerland,” said Brunner. “If you’re looking for the developer or coding community, Switzerland is not the place to be.”  Then again, it is very much the place to be if you want regulatory clarity, easy access to banks and VCs or just a relaxing dose of Swiss tranquility. Zug is almost cartoonishly pleasant. I spent a month in Zug in 2019, taking jogs by the lake and basking in the clean serenity. I went to a crypto meet-up in the CV Labs, billed as “the heartbeat of Crypto Valley,” a gleaming, five-story coworking space – focused on Web3, of course – that had, on its top level, floor-to-ceiling windows with imperial views of the Swiss alps.  But the vibe of these meet-ups have changed. Hoodies are out, suits are in. When Brunner went to crypto meetups a few years ago, people would say things like, “Bitcoin is going to kill the banks! We’re going to create a better financial system!”  You rarely hear that anymore in Zug crypto meet-ups. Instead, there’s a newfound appreciation for regulatory compliance, licenses and even partnership with the banks. “The more fringe side of crypto has kind of moved away,” said Brunner. Some might bristle at the loss of crypto’s wilder side, but the way Brunner sees it, “Crypto is growing up, in Switzerland.”",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/zug-where-ethereum-was-born-and-crypto-goes-to-grow-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3df77c5c82cd8279fcec8b29fae1c019a37c42df-995x540.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410295,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF4Em,1687866067,Singapore: The Center of Asian Crypto Wealth Is Ready for a Reset,"Known for governmental efficiency, the city-state of Singapore scored highest overall for the three measures it could control: regulatory structure (35% of the total score and included in the drivers category), digital infrastructure (12%) and ease of doing business (10%), which are both part of the enablers category. That was enough to be firmly ensconced in second place despite middling scores for quality of life – due to a very high cost of living – and per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events, which comprise the opportunities category.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     Despite the crypto industry’s well-earned reputation as the Wild West, crypto founders tend to prioritize predictability and clear regulations when shopping for a place to incorporate. That’s why the well-regulated, efficiently governed city-state of Singapore hosts the headquarters or satellites of some of the biggest brands in crypto, including Binance, Coinbase and Crypto.com. But after the spectacular failures of its homegrown darlings Terraform Labs and Three Arrows Capital plunged the ecosystem into Crypto Winter, Singapore’s crypto community is licking its wounds – and beginning to look to the future.  Singapore still has a strong reputation: it received the most mentions for best crypto hub in a select CoinDesk survey sent to about three dozen globetrotting crypto professionals this spring. The Red Dot has all the ingredients of a strong crypto hub, with the highest rating in the world for digital infrastructure (as measured by the Tufts/Fletcher Digital Evolution Index) and second-highest ranking in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index.  It is the most competitive fintech hub in the Asia Pacific region, according to the 2023 Global Financial Centres Index, edging out Hong Kong, and a regulatory leader for crypto. In 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) passed the Payment Services License Act. “There were all these companies that were all rushing to Singapore to apply for the license because it was actually the first regulator in the region that had a proper digital-assets licensing framework,” said Pamela Lee, head of APAC sales at Talos, developer of institutional-grade technology for digital-asset trading.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Prakash Somosundram, founder of Enjinstarter, a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform for early crypto projects, described having had a “front row seat” to the Singaporean crypto scene since 2015. “In the early days, when it came to crypto, from a regulatory perspective, it was very pro. So this is where a lot of crypto influencers moved their capital,” Somosundram said. And with no capital gains tax, “It is an ideal place for the crypto affluent to actually come here.”  A highly educated workforce and institutional fintech know-how have been a potent mix for Singapore. Among the first initial coin offerings (ICO) were Singaporean startups such as cryptocurrency payment platform TenX, which raised $43 million in just seven minutes in 2017. That year, Singapore even surpassed the U.S. with $1.5 billion versus $1.2 billion in ICO funding, an astounding amount for a locale that is roughly the landmass of New York City, with just two-thirds of the population.  Until the current Crypto Winter, Singapore was a magnet for a stereotypically brash strain of crypto celebrity culture and lifestyle. That world centered on the wealthy enclave of Sentosa Island, which Somosundram calls “Crypto Island.“ Sentosa is the only place in the city-state where foreigners can own property, and wealthy expats have flooded in. Sentosa’s inhabitants have included Chengpeng “CZ” Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance, and crypto thought leader and U.S. investor Balaji Srinivasan. Back then, crypto meetups, conferences and events were held in villas or even on yachts, Somosundram said.  Sooner than later, CZ and Balaji moved on, though. Zhuling Chen, founder and CEO of staking access startup RockX, his second crypto startup in Singapore, said that his view of the local crypto community is decidedly different from a luxury island for conspicuous billionaires. He describes a racially and gender diverse community, one that has diversified its cryptocurrency ecosystem as well. In addition to the ICOs, “Singapore had one of the earliest Ethereum communities,” he said. “When you go to NEAR meetups, or Solana, you see different people at each. There’s a strong fanbase” for a lot of different token projects.  The residents of Singapore come from around the world, with roughly 30% of the population non-citizens, or expats. “Singapore’s years of being a fintech hub attracted talent from all over the Asia-Pacific region,” Chen said. “We find it’s reasonably attractive to find good talent here.” Indeed, Chen said his 40 employees represent eight different nationalities.  “We don't want to be seen as crypto bros,” said Lee, who is on the Women in Blockchain committee of the Blockchain Association of Singapore. “I don't think that that's the mindset that Singapore really wants to build. What we want to be is a fintech hub that has a very innovative environment for people to collaborate and grow together.”  As Singapore resets itself, both the MAS and crypto investors are a little more wary than before. The government-owned conglomerate and VC, Temasek Holdings, reportedly wrote off $200 million in losses to Sam Bankman-Fried’s now-defunct FTX. While Chen said Singapore is maintaining its commitment in terms of promoting blockchain, he acknowledges that there is tightening on the banking side, with more attention paid to know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering measures. The cautious posture may drive the crypto affluent to move to Dubai and Hong Kong, said Somosundram, where recent pro-crypto regulations are attracting companies and VC funding.  He said he is moving his Enjinstarter’s tokens from an offshore entity to Dubai and has applied for the first phase of the startup’s license there. “We are losing our lunch to Hong Kong and Dubai,” Somosundram said. Both Chen and Lee say that although momentum may be moving toward Dubai and Hong Kong as hot spots, Singapore is not losing ground to them.  “Because of how comfortable we are in Singapore, it's actually not so easy to move an entire business that has been set up here, to Hong Kong,” Lee said. “You would rather just stay here and set up a smaller office somewhere else.”  In any case, Singapore is wildly better-positioned in the crypto regulatory space than the world’s top financial hub, New York City. Earlier this month, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini, announced that it would increase the headcount of its Singapore outpost to over 100, compared to a reported 500 employees worldwide at present.  “Our Singapore office will serve as a hub for our larger APAC operations,” Gemini stated in a blog post. “We believe that APAC will be a great driver of the next wave of growth for crypto and Gemini.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,Jeanhee Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/singapore-the-center-of-asian-crypto-wealth-is-ready-for-a-reset,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a77e048d4490985fc537703282c8b33de1adbb5b-4572x2572.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chainalysis ranked the U.K. 17th in the world. Only the U.S., at fifth, was ranked higher. Another plus: top-10 score for ease of doing business (10%), in the enabler category.

For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     Old meets new in London. The city that is home to the world’s oldest and most trusted stock and foreign exchanges is positioning for the future by embracing cryptocurrencies.  London’s self-declared efforts to become a global crypto hub were rewarded handsomely in June when venture-capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) chose it as the home of its first office outside the U.S.  The city is the world’s top marketplace for foreign exchange. Its “London session” is one of three trading sessions that keeps the forex market open 24 hours a day. And the London Stock Exchange is more than 300 years old. With this extensive traditional finance infrastructure in place it is already a global hub for trading of liquid assets, including crypto.  “This puts London in pole position to serve the world as a hub for crypto, as businesses and institutions seek trusted and reliable trading partners,” Nick Philpott, co-founder of institutional crypto trader Zodia Markets, said.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  London is often seen as a gateway to Europe’s jurisdictions, offering connectivity to international markets, which brings with it a wide range of sources of investment, from venture capitalists to angel investors. Chris Dixon, founder of a16z’s crypto division, cited the U.K.’s “predictable business environment,” as one of the factors behind its decision to open an office there.  Furthermore the U.K. is home to some of the world’s most esteemed educational institutions which help to feed top-class talent into London’s startup scene.  “There are around 363,000 individuals that work in the financial sector, dwarfing any other city in Europe, such as Paris where there are 144,000 and Frankfurt where there are 65,000,” said James Butterfill, head of strategy for CoinShares.  “We are hiring,” he added, “and are finding many European potential employees are keen to move to London as they consider it the fintech hub of Europe.”  London’s interest in crypto is not just top-down and corporate. The U.K. has a healthy grassroots adoption rate, with YouGov estimating that around 10% of the adult population have bought cryptocurrency as of January 2023. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis placed the U.K. in the top 20 countries for crypto adoption.  The key to London’s continued viability as a crypto hub, however, will hinge on the sort of regulatory environment that is fostered by its lawmakers. Local crypto startup founders are watching closely.  Having left the European Union in January 2020, the country should have the freedom to offer greater flexibility to create a helpful environment for digital assets and blockchain technology. Where the E.U. has established a bespoke regime with its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in April, the U.K. is looking to work crypto in its broader Financial Services and Markets Bill.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made his desire to turn the U.K. into a crypto hub well known, but the window to turn aspiration into reality may be closing with the 2024 election.  “The big question is whether the U.K. will act fast enough to keep up with smaller markets like Dubai, who have even more to gain,” said Paul Ridley, founder of London-based crypto asset manager Old Street Digital.  “Rishi Sunak's tweets are great and all,” Ridley said. “But can he get actual legislation passed before the next election?”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/london-the-worlds-capital-for-foreign-exchange-adds-cryptocurrencies-to-its-ledger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51633824cb9ebc7f8ee53c94afa2ee82ebc2ca74-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its grassroots’ embrace of crypto puts the country within the top 15% of the world in the crypto adoption index. But as the most populous hub in our final 15, it was hurt by a low opportunities score, which is a measurement of per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events.

It later became evident that this was just another example of how Korean retail investors have the power to move global markets. At the time UpBit, Korea’s biggest exchange, led global XRP trading volumes with more than $790 million in tokens traded over 24 hours, overtaking volumes on Binance, the largest exchange in the world.  This is just one instance. Korean retail traders are known for pushing up other coins as well – and no, that’s not just smaller altcoins. The Korean won is consistently in the top three national currencies traded against Bitcoin, according to Coinhills. More generally, awareness of and interest in crypto is relatively high. Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) reported in September that there were nearly seven million registered crypto users in Korea. That’s roughly 14% of the total population.  It’s not surprising that such a powerful retail market would help vault Seoul onto a list of global crypto hubs. But Seoul is appealing in plenty of other ways: It’s a fast-paced and entrepreneurial city in an often fast-paced and entrepreneurial region. It’s no secret that Asia’s prominence in crypto is on the rise, especially after regulatory crackdowns in the United States.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Members of South Korea’s crypto community explained Seoul’s appeal in a few ways. One was an openness to experimentation. Another was Korea’s prowess in gaming. A third was simply its community of “builders.”  It certainly doesn’t hurt to have good Internet connectivity and a relatively mobile-savvy population. Literally nearly all South Koreans – 99.9% according to the government – have broadband internet access at home, and no other country comes close to South Korea’s 5G download speed of 432.7 Mbps, according to Statista. Some say that not knowing Korean can be a bit of an obstacle, but others say that the tech community knows English and people are also willing to learn.  A bigger obstacle, at least for now, might be Korea’s regulatory situation. President Yoon Suk-Yeol’s came to power with the promise of a crypto-friendly agenda. But he took office in May of 2022, the same month as the spectacular crash of the algorithmic stablecoin project Terra Luna. Terra Luna’s crash had a special impact in Korea — as its Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon was born in Korea and the project was extremely popular there. Korean media reported some 200,000 local victims of the crash. The project’s collapse seems to have dampened political enthusiasm for crypto, at least temporarily. Some in the Korean community complain that regulation is mostly focused on fighting crime like money laundering, rather than on fostering growth and development of the industry.  With Do Kwon’s arrest in Montenegro, the political mood may finally be thawing. But even if not, the next bull run could be all that it takes to give an extra push to this already vibrant market. Or as one Seoul-based crypto executive told me, “Crypto craze during a bull market is exciting anywhere in the world, we turn it up a few notches and make it f**king amazing in Seoul.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/seoul-asias-retail-crypto-capital-moves-on-after-do-kwon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2fcea22a4023261c7022bad3a430a7667a313ae4-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As such, the sharp price moves were likely a result of above-average buying pressure amid relatively low liquidity. CoinGecko data shows that on Uniswap - where $3 million worth of OX were traded in the past 24 hours - a buy order of just $66,000 worth of ether (ETH) can move OX prices by 2%.  Trading volumes for OX on OPNX were even lower: Just $69,000 in the past 24 hours. Elsewhere, FLEX saw an even meager $500,000 in cumulative trading volumes across centralized and decentralized exchanges.  Meanwhile, blockchain data for OX tokens show the number of unique wallets holding the tokens stands at just 1,700 as of Tuesday - even as they have surged to a market capitalization of above $105 million.  In comparison, projects with a similar capitalization have a significantly higher number of holders. Metis blockchain boasts 17,000 holders of its METIS tokens, while crypto bridge Synapse has 7,612 holders of SYN tokens.  These numbers do not account for the token holders who may have purchased these assets via a centralized exchange.  Zhu and Davies were previously founders of the defunct crypto fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which imploded last June as its massive bets on Terra (LUNA) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) went awry.

42410293,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF4Oh,1687865849,Dubai: Launching a Crypto Regulatory Arm to Become a Global Financial Power,"Dubai and its sibling hub Abu Dhabi were rated tops in the regulatory structure, the most heavily weighted criterion at 35% of the total score. But the impact was blunted by the UAE’s bottom-quintile crypto adoption score, indicating that the larger population of the UAE is not as crypto-savvy as the residents in these two hubs. Despite the low overall drivers category score, Dubai cemented its place in the top five with high scores in opportunities category, which measured per-capita crypto events, companies and jobs. The emirate also achieved the second-highest quality of life score in our entire sample. Part of the enablers category, quality of life was the second-heaviest weighted criterion, at 15% of the total score.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     The biggest names in crypto seem to be gravitating to Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Binance co-founders Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and He Yi have made it their home, Coinbase’s Brian Armstong has met with its regulators. And Wazirx, one of India’s largest exchanges, is moving its headquarters there. It seems Dubai’s master plan to enter the top echelon of global financial centers, joining New York, London and Hong Kong, is working.  Dubai has been growing as a business and financial services hub for the Middle East over the last few decades by embracing innovation. That’s particularly evident in how it approached crypto with deliberation and intention.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  In 2014 the local government engaged IBM to advise it on new technologies, Saqr Ereiqat, then IBM’s head of public sector consultancy in Dubai, said. He described how conversations kept coming around to blockchain, which eventually led the city-state to officially announce in 2016 that it was discussing a legal framework for cryptocurrencies. Six years later in March 2022, Dubai established the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), the world’s first independent crypto regulator.  As the crypto industry’s demands for clear regulation in the United States are met with a slew of lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the UAE has emerged as a viable alternative. “It's unfortunate, the U.S.’ current position on the [crypto] space,” Bader Al Kalooti, executive director of Binance MENA, told CoinDesk. “But that doesn't mean that the rest of the world isn’t open to crypto. And Dubai and other markets in Asia have opened the doors.”  According to the Dubai Statistics Center, as of 2022, over 3.2 million of the Emirate’s total ~3.5 million population is non-Emirati, making it a “melting pot of people” as Al Kalooti explained. With such a diverse population, blockchain technology has numerous use cases in the city, ranging from remittances for those working in Dubai and sending money home or facilitating the flight of capital for those taking refuge from unstable economies.  Expansive use cases  What makes Dubai and the United Arab Emirates unique as a crypto hub is that “it offers a home for all those types of use cases,” Al Kalooti said. Indeed, shortly after establishing VARA, the government unveiled the Dubai Metaverse Strategy and its intention to create “one of the world’s top 10 metaverse economies as well as a global hub for the metaverse community.” The country aims to attract 1,000 blockchain and metaverse companies and create 40,000 virtual jobs by 2030.  Situated in proximity to Northern Africa, Asia and Europe, Dubai is not just a travel destination for those seeking a beach vacation, but also fosters global networking and collaboration. The city is the host of GITEX (Gulf Information Technology Exhibition), a leading tech conference featuring blockchain and Web3 as two of its 18 focus areas, that according to local reporting had 170,000 attendees in 2022. There is no shortage of crypto events in Dubai, including Binance Blockchain Week and Dubai Fintech Week.  After leaving IBM, Ereiqat co-founded Dubai-based Crypto Oasis, which develops blockchain ecosystems modeled after the Crypto Valley in Zug, Switzerland, the No. 1 spot in CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023. For those looking to build a team in Dubai, Ereiqat said, “the UAE’s most unique element is the access to talent [...] within three hours you have access to three billion people.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Dilin Massand,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/dubai-launching-a-crypto-regulatory-arm-to-become-a-global-financial-power,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9de1d229c33e4cc48767d7b7b0d0357e870eaeef-4800x2700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410301,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF4bv,1687865796,Abu Dhabi: A Wealthy Middle-East Capital Creating a Bridge From TradFi to Crypto,"The United Arab Emirates’ hubs of Abu Dhabi and Dubai had identical scores for crypto regulatory structure and crypto adoption, two of the most heavily weighted criteria in the ranking overall. But while the UAE’s regulatory structure is top tier – and accounts for 35% of its total score – its crypto adoption score (measuring 10%) was in the bottom quintile. Arguably, the low score is a reflection of the greater Emirati population, rather than the behavior of the residents of Abu Dhabi and Dubai themselves. In nearly every other criteria we measured, the capital of the UAE trailed Dubai by a hair, including quality of life, ease of doing business and digital infrastructure (all criteria in the enablers category) and per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events (which comprise the opportunities category).  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the quieter counterparty to the flare and bustle of Dubai. While Dubai is widely recognized as a crypto hub, Abu Dhabi remains under the radar.  “Abu Dhabi’s always been a bit more of an institutional-focused market, whereas Dubai has been more of a consumer-focused market,” said Basil Al Askari, co-founder and CEO of MidChains, an Abu Dhabi-based digital-asset trading exchange and custodian for global institutions. Therefore, if you’re looking for a crypto hub where blue-chip bank executives shake hands with players in the digital asset space, Abu Dhabi is the place for you.  The capital city’s financial services industry is centered in Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), an offshore, economic free zone with an agenda and regulatory framework that can be valuable to those looking to bridge the gap between institutions and crypto.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  ADGM aims to foster four areas of focus within finance, one being fintech. As a result, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are integrated into the ecosystem’s regulation.  “What Abu Dhabi is great at is creating clarity around digital assets for more institutional-type financial systems like prime brokerages, lending, asset management, etc.,” Pascal St-Jean, president of Canadian digital-asset manager 3iQ, told CoinDesk. ""3iQ is exploring a license"" from the ADGM, according to a spokesperson.  Additionally, the economic sandbox fosters open dialogue between those in the fintech/crypto industries and the free zone’s authorities. Al Askari recounted approaching ADGM on behalf of MidChains in 2018 before there was an established regulatory framework for crypto: “We pitched our idea and said, well, can you regulate us, and initially thought within 10 minutes of the meeting they were gonna kick us out […] But to our surprise, it was a really productive meeting and they invited us to give commentary on the draft guidance, which eventually did come out later that year.”  Proximity to the sovereign wealth fund  Along with licenses and clear regulation, the inclusion of digital assets in the ADGM’s growth ambitions has led to substantial investment, making it a hotspot for entrepreneurs seeking to raise capital in the region. ADGM is a backer of Hub 71, a physical center on Abu Dhabi’s Al Maryah Island that houses tech startups, investors and incentive programs to boost innovation. Earlier this year, the Hub 71+ Digital Assets initiative was announced, where a $2 billion fund will be dedicated to supporting Web3 projects. Abu Dhabi is also the home of Mubadala Investment Company, the country’s sovereign wealth fund.  Venom Blockchain Foundation, a layer 0 blockchain project focused on empowering Web 3 developers in the Middle East and North Africa region became the first protocol to be fully licensed by ADGM in July of 2022, highlighting the free zone’s commitment to harboring innovation in the digital economy.  Abu Dhabi has not been immune to the effects of the crypto winter, however. In February, crypto exchange Kraken announced it was pulling up stakes less than one year after receiving a license to open in Abu Dhabi. But new entrants in Abu Dhabi like 3iQ are finding community alongside familiar brands, St-Jean told CoinDesk, as some of the industry’s biggest players like Coinbase are reportedly engaging with the ADGM to make a regional base in the capital city.  “The next five years are going to be explosive” for crypto in Abu Dhabi, St-Jean declared.  CORRECTION (June 27, 20:20 UTC): 3iQ does not have a license from the ADGM.

14247941,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539817,1687865647,ETHBTC Just Hit A 300-Day Low. What To Expect Next,"While crypto traders have been emboldened by Bitcoin’s impressive rally, especially in light of the SEC’s recent lawsuits against major crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase, one key trading pair has nevertheless suffered as a result. Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETHBTC), the widely watched trading pair which combines the crypto market’s number two coin with its number one coin by market cap, just closed at a 300-day low. Why is this happening and what’s happened in the past after similarly weak periods for ETHBTC? Let’s take a closer look at the price history to find out. Bitcoin’s Dominance Explodes Higher Just a few weeks ago, ETHBTC closed at a multi-week high and looked poised to move higher, but the recent surge in Bitcoin Dominance caused ETHBTC to hit a 300-day low, just shy of a new 52-week low. The popular Dominance metric can be calculated for any crypto market asset and is simply a measure of any coin or token’s share of the total cryptocurrency market’s capitalization, expressed as a percentage. Bitcoin Dominance now sits at just over 51% after climbing from below 42% at the start of the year. Why the surge in Bitcoin’s Dominance? A variety of factors appear to have contributed to the sudden jump in Bitcoin’s Dominance chart, with Blackrock’s recent filing for a new spot Bitcoin ETF arguably being the key driver. ETHBTC and Bitcoin Dominance Comparison | SOURCE: TradingView.com While both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have moved sharply higher in recent sessions, Bitcoin’s recent relative strength to Ether has pushed ETHBTC to a multi-month low. Let’s take a look at what past 300-day lows for ETHBTC have meant for this key crypto market ratio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Just Gained Over 18% In Seven Days: What’s Happened When This Has Occurred In The Past? As always, because the number of occurrences will vary depending on holding time, we’ll start by listing the number of times that ETHBTC has closed at a 300-day low next to our hypothetical hold times of 7 days, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days. Holding time is defined as the amount of time one held an asset before exiting. For example, if one had hypothetically purchased ETHBTC following the trigger event (i.e., the close at a 300-day low) and sold it 90 days later, this would be a holding time of 90 days. ETHBTC Occurrences of 300-Day Lows by Holding Time (Inception – Present) 13 occurrences using a 7-day hold time 10 occurrences using a 15-day hold time 7 occurrences using a 30-day hold time 5 occurrences using a 60-day hold time 5 occurrences using a 90-day hold time 4 occurrences using a 180-day hold time 3 occurrences using a 365-day hold time As we can see, there have been relatively few closes at 300-day lows for ETHBTC, especially with longer holding times. Ethereum Relative Strength May Be Poised To Climb While 300-day lows may sound bearish, the data suggests that ETHBTC may now be poised for a bounce, particularly with a longer holding period. Hypothetical short-term holding times from 7 days to 60 days show a modest average result, and historically positive across the board. In other words, past instances when ETHBTC has hit a 300-day low have seen a modest bounce higher, coming in at just over 5% on average when using a 15-day, 30-day, or 60-day hold time. ETHBTC Average Trade Result with Various Hold Times | SOURCE: Tableau Related Reading: Ethereum Poised To Break $2,000 As $12 Million Short Seller Nears Liquidation From an intermediate-term perspective, however, history shows that ETHBTC gains far more significantly, from +24.1% with a 90-day hold, to an astounding +223.2% with a 180-day hold, to an impressive 108.1% with a one-year hold. While many Bitcoin maximalists may be calling for significantly higher Bitcoin Dominance readings and lower ETHBTC levels as a result, the data says otherwise. While the past does not predict the future, ETHBTC may eventually be poised for higher levels, though patience might be required in the short-term.

42410296,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF4Yc,1687865591,Wyoming: Regulatory Clarity and Crypto-Friendly Banks Fuel Blockchain Revolution,"Surprise! Wyoming is the top-ranked U.S. hub. Many of CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023 criteria were measured on a national basis, so all of the U.S. hubs were hampered by a middling crypto regulatory score, a measure in the drivers category and the most heavily weighted criteria – 35% – of the total. This negative was partially offset by the highest crypto adoption score (another drivers criteria) in our sample, however. Given that the regulatory and adoption scores were based on countries, Wyoming broke from the U.S. pack with its high quality of life (at 15%, the second-heaviest weighted criteria, and part of the enablers category) and other individual measures. The least populous U.S. state benefited from its eye-popping per-capita figures for crypto, blockchain and Web3 jobs, companies and events, which comprise the opportunities category.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     Though it’s the least populous U.S. state, with 2.3 times more cattle than humans, Wyoming has been on a campaign to become its most crypto-friendly.  Since 2016, the state has passed over 35 laws regulating one or another aspect of the crypto industry. That work has been bearing fruit, said Steve Lupien, director of the Center for Blockchain and Digital Innovation at the University of Wyoming.  “We’re seeing a lot of companies that are moving to Wyoming, last time I checked there were over 3,000 companies that domiciled in Wyoming, and there are probably more now,” Lupien told CoinDesk.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  These companies are bringing well-paying tech jobs, he added. As a university professor, Lupien has watched a lot of his graduates leave Wyoming over the years (70% of University of Wyoming graduates end up leaving the state). But now, finally, there is a chance to mitigate that brain drain.  “It gives my university graduates an opportunity to work in the digital-asset space and not have to leave the state,” he said. “A number of my graduates are now working for Wyoming companies, or [have] started Wyoming companies.”  Lupien believes that what attracts crypto businesses, such as the major exchange Kraken and IOG, (formerly IOHK, the organization behind the Cardano cryptocurrency), is the greater regulatory certainty, which is in short supply in the United States as a whole.  Wyoming can’t boast an especially lively business or cultural scene, compared to other more populous crypto destinations like New York, Austin or the West Coast tech hubs. However, it has been passing crypto legislation at a pace unparalleled elsewhere in the country.  In 2018, Wyoming passed a law exempting utility tokens from the securities regulation, resolving on the local level the most daunting legal challenge of the U.S. crypto industry. Tokens get the exemption if they are issued and sold to buyers exclusively for “consumptive purpose,” meaning, to be exchanged for goods or services.  Later, other laws exempted cryptocurrency-related activities from the purview of the state money transmitter law, allowed companies to maintain their corporate records on blockchains and exempted virtual currencies from the state property tax, among other things.  The state has recognized a new kind of bank, a special-purpose depository institution (SPDI), that is a regulated custodian for crypto assets. Crypto exchange Kraken and Custodia Bank, led by crypto evangelist Caitlin Long, are among a handful of firms that have acquired the SPDI status since 2020.  Another boost for crypto in the state: During bankruptcy proceedings, cryptocurrencies in Wyoming are considered on par with cash, meaning that crypto, like cash, are considered free from any legal incumbrances. That would provide clarity in cases when crypto companies go bust, Lupien pointed out.  Earlier this year, the state passed the Wyoming Stable Token Act, authorizing state authorities to issue a stablecoin backed by dollars or U.S. Treasury bonds. The stablecoin is expected to be issued at the end of this year, and will give Wyoming “some notoriety,” said David Pope, co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition and former member of the Wyoming Legislative Blockchain Task Force.  In February, Wyoming's House of Representatives passed a bill that prohibits the forced disclosure of private crypto keys by the U.S. state's courts.  Fighting the Fed  One thing that is currently holding back Wyoming’s stride into the bright blockchain future is the ongoing legal battle for the fate of SPDIs. The fight is being led by Custodia, which was recently denied access to Federal Reserve banking services. This prevents Custodia from executing its banking functions.  The Wyoming crypto advocates believe that Custodia will win its case, and that as soon as it does, crypto businesses will rush into the only state providing specialized banking services with fully-reserved crypto banks. “It will be a snowball,” Pope said.  Moreover, unlike the U.S. regional banks that failed during a recent banking bout, SDPIs are prohibited from lending customer savings, offering a banking alternative that may be attractive to more than just bitcoiners.  “When Custodia prevails, Wyoming will be ground zero for digital assets banking because there are four Wyoming SPDIs standing by, ready to operate as soon as the Fed relents, which the court will make them,” Lupien said. Other SPDIs are Kraken Financial, Commercium Financial and Wyoming Depository and Trust.  The local crypto community includes startup founders, miners, lawyers and accountants catering to the industry, and local influencers. At a typical Wyoming meetup at a coffee shop in Cheyenne, you would usually see a mix of people like “business leaders, accountants, lawyers and enthusiasts,” Lupien said. The state is also represented in the U.S. Senate by “Crypto Queen” Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), who co-authored the bipartisan “Responsible Financial Innovation Act,” that is aimed at creating a regulatory framework for the industry.  According to Pope, an average Wyoming resident might not have noticed the effects of the state’s crypto friendliness, but it’s “something future generations will certainly feel.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/wyoming-regulatory-clarity-and-crypto-friendly-banks-fuel-blockchain-revolution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9274fb8b8d74d2f1b7048f93ae402c56531fe845-2000x1055.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410300,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF4lq,1687865515,Silicon Valley: The Mecca for Venture Capital May Be Cooling on Crypto,"Silicon Valley was the second-highest ranked U.S. hub in CoinDesk's Crypto Hubs 2023. Several of the eight criteria were measured on a national basis, so all the U.S. hubs were hampered by a middling crypto regulatory score, a drivers criteria, which at 35% was the most heavily weighted overall. This poor performance was partially offset by the U.S.’s high crypto adoption score, another drivers criterion, represented 10% of the overall score. Among the U.S. hubs, Silicon Valley generally trailed Wyoming just a hair in opportunities, which is based on per-capita rate of crypto jobs, companies and events. Due to its high cost of living, Silicon Valley suffered from a lower quality of life score, weighted 15% and a measure within the enabler category. But the coastal Silicon Valley area had the upper hand in other enabler measures including digital infrastructure and ease of doing business.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     Silicon Valley does not need advertising as a launchpad for the world’s most successful tech companies, like Google, Apple, Facebook – you name it. And it’s been home for some crypto startups, too, including blockchain analytics company CipherTrace and stablecoin issuer MakerDAO.  The Valley, centered on the city of San Jose about 55 miles southeast of San Francisco, offers an unprecedented concentration of top tech talent, historically supplied by local world-class universities including Stanford. It is also a center of venture capital, with giants like Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners that have been systematically supporting crypto startups.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  This combination presents a promising environment for any young tech ecosystem, including crypto. However, the still-young blockchain community is facing competition from other emergent tech sectors.  “For those looking for VC funding for crypto, the Valley is almost closed,” says Gene Hoffman, CEO and president of Chia, the company behind the namesake blockchain.  Two years ago, the crypto industry was sucking talent out of the more established, “traditional” tech firms like Google, Amazon or Apple, but now, the industry doesn’t look as hot for the VCs and entrepreneurs here.  The reason? Artificial-intelligence startups are stealing thunder. And the recent SEC offensive against crypto, including investigations of the major global exchanges Binance and Coinbase, doesn’t help. “All but the diehards are now worried about buying coins,” Hoffman said. “We are going nowhere because the SEC isn't a blocker for us,” he added, explaining that the SEC's actions are not of concern for Chia.  Finding money for a new crypto project is still possible, of course. But the roster of VC funds willing to invest is much smaller these days, and those that do have “definitely retrenched to early stage [funding] mostly,” he said, adding that funds like a16z, Paradigm Capital, Haun ventures and Electric Capital remain active in the space.  Competition from other U.S. tech hubs  And while there is no exodus of crypto companies out of the Valley, new startups appear to be opening shop in newer U.S. tech hubs like Seattle, Austin or Miami, Hoffman said. Expensive housing prices in Silicon Valley might be one of reason why. Some firms are mulling leaving the U.S. altogether for friendlier regulatory regimes.  VCs are also looking elsewhere, if not exactly leaving so far: a16z, one of the key backers of crypto startups since the birth of crypto, in June announced it will open its first non-U.S. office in London, where the government has been more welcoming to crypto.  The demise of Silicon Valley as a crypto hub is still a long way off, however. The South Bay boasts a high concentration of tech ideas, money and workforce, with plenty of events and greenhouses for startups like YCombinator, all of which are crucial for fledgling crypto businesses.  The community of tech professionals, more importantly, is still there, Hoffman said: “For us, the Valley is a fine place where we source good talent.”  CORRECTION (Jun 28, 2023, 17:33 UTC): Corrects Gene Hoffman's quote about not leaving Silicon Valley.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/silicon-valley-the-mecca-for-venture-capital-may-be-cooling-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f23c0938709d9941b0a4c1643fd31ecde8c0cbec-3074x2306.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Many of the Crypto Hubs’ criteria were measured on a national basis, so all of the U.S. hubs were hampered by a middling crypto regulatory score, which counted for 35% of the total ranking calculation. This negative was partially offset by the highest crypto adoption score in our sample, weighing 10% of the total. Among the U.S. hubs, Austin had the highest quality-of-life and ease-of-doing-business scores, but trailed Wyoming and Silicon Valley in opportunities, with lower per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events.

Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, Austin ranked atop many lists of the best U.S. cities for remote working – thanks to its good connectivity, affordable housing costs, and thriving tech scene anchored by Dell and the University of Texas.  This is to say nothing of the intangibles like Austin’s outdoorsy vibe (it has temperate weather year-round except for three scorching summer months), creative food scene and renowned live-music venues.  All of that put the Texas capital on the map for a blockchain industry that, as much as any, has been remote-friendly for its 14-year history. Plus the allure of zero state income taxes proved too much to resist for many untethered-to-the-office crypto workers, and the scene now encompasses a wide range of developers, executives, traders, venture capitalists and Bitcoin miners.

As a lead organizer of several local Bitcoin meetups, he would know.  In particular, the city has attracted some of the savviest and most passionate bitcoiners. This includes developers Jimmy Song and Bryan Bishop, Blockstream’s Lisa Neigut, Lightning Labs’ Ryan Gentry and the podcaster Marty Bent.  “Once the gravitational force starts, it feeds itself,” Lewis, who’s now writing a book on Bitcoin, said in an interview.  He also helps to manage Bitcoin Commons, a coworking and events space that opened in January 2022. It is next to Unchained’s headquarters in the 117-year-old Littlefield building in downtown Austin. For $400 a month, Bitcoin-focused workers can plunk down at a shared working space that offers conference-room privileges, a full kitchen and drinks and snacks. One corporate sponsor of the space is Austin-based Trammell Venture Partners, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm led by Dustin Trammell, who says on his bio that he was the second node on the Bitcoin network.  Another early figure in helping to build the Austin Bitcoin community was Justin Moon, the co-founder of local startup Fedi that raised $17 million in May in a Series A fundraising and describes itself as a “federated operating system.” Bitcoin mining companies including Core Scientific and Riot Platforms have headquarters or operations in the Austin area; it goes without saying that the oil-rich state and its politicians have a history of supporting the energy industry and energy-intensive industrial operations.  Apart from Bitcoin, Austin’s Multicoin Capital, led by Kyle Samani and Tushar Jain, is one of the world’s biggest crypto-native investment firms, with exposure to foundational crypto projects from Algorand and Aptos to Solana and Worldcoin. The studio of NFT artist Tyler Hobbs, whose Fidenza collection fetches a floor price above $140,000, is from Austin.  Secret and not-so-secret meetups, festivals and fun  But it’s not all about work, Austin is home to several regularly-occurring crypto events, including meetups held in a privately-funded events space called Keiretsu in Austin’s swanky South Congress district. An organization called CabinDAO offers “creator residencies” funded by ether (ETH) contributions at a 28-acre retreat in Johnson City, an hour’s drive west of Austin in the Texas Hill Country.  Any article mentioning the crypto scene in Austin would be remiss if it didn't mention the conference that gathers the global crypto community (and no, I’m not talking about the Permissionless conference co-hosted by crypto media firms Blockworks and Bankless that’s scheduled for September). For the past two years, CoinDesk’s Consensus crypto festival, held at the Austin Convention Center, has helped put Austin on the map. And it’s happening again, soon.  ATX DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization formed in October 2021 and focused on “making Austin the crypto capital of the world,” has sold 153 memberships at a price of 1 ETH (about $1,900), according to co-founder Mason Lynaugh. The group’s website says the organization aims to “unite Austin’s crypto communities, enable artists and local businesses to participate in the crypto ecosystem and educate the government about the benefits of Web3.”  A lifelong Austin resident and University of Texas at Austin grad, Lynaugh says he recently quit his job at a database company to devote more time to ATX DAO – because the growth opportunity looks so promising.",POSITIVE,ETH,ALGO | BTC | ETH | TRADING | APT,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/austin-where-remote-work-crypto-developers-actually-choose-to-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a4b8bb51507e9c28c0de08c489163b7b0c87515-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410304,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF4vl,1687865410,Berlin: The Center for Decentralized Finance – and Techno Music,"Berlin had a strong showing in crypto regulatory structure and crypto adoption, which make up the drivers, the most heavily weighted category in CoinDesk’s rubric. Against this sample of 25 mostly high-performing and economically well-developed hubs, however, the German capital rated solidly in the middle of the pack in the opportunity scores that measure per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events, and enabler scores including ease of doing business and digital infrastructure.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.  Berlin’s crypto scene may not be as famous as the city’s techno music, nightlife or architecture but its quiet influence on decentralized finance (DeFi) is undeniable. If the city were a painting, several brushstrokes trace the beginnings of Ethereum, with Berlin even playing host to the first ever Ethereum developers’ meetup DEVCON 0 in 2014, just months before the blockchain went live. Kreuzberg district’s Room 77 was the first bar in the world to accept bitcoin (BTC) as payment.  Since those early days of crypto, Germany’s capital – which was already a tech hub in its own right with Google and Facebook having opened offices in the city – has been a big draw for the blockchain-inclined, Patrick Hansen, director of EU strategy and policy at stablecoin issuer Circle, said.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Hansen moved to Berlin in 2017 and quickly became an influential voice in blockchain policy in Europe just as Germany emerged as one of the first countries in the world to make a serious go of regulating crypto. He said the city’s crypto scene is “decentralized,” aptly reflecting its community favoring source code and core infrastructure over big centralized exchanges or custodians.  “There's … the Berlin Blockchain Week, by far the biggest conference, but even that is very decentralized. It's not one main event, but it's like hundreds of events that take place during the same week,” Hansen said. According to its website, “Blockchain Week Berlin is a decentralized community-organized initiative. There is no single owner. It is an agnostic movement based on the premise that self-organization is the backbone of the ecosystem.”  Aside from the flagship event, in Berlin, there is something for any kind of blockchain aficionado (DeFi, CeFi, NFTs – you name it!) with opportunities for diversity and growth, Santiago Abraham, association manager at BerChain, a member-led nonprofit that supports and promotes Berlin’s crypto community, said.  “The community is really decentralized,” Abraham echoed Hansen, adding that in any given week, there’s a myriad of blockchain-focused meetups, events and your pick of spaces to work from or hold friendly gatherings over drinks – called “Stammtisch.”  Don't Forget the Nightlife  Berlin resident and crypto veteran Julian Grigo said he chose to move to the city because “it's such a livable, vibrant city, the most international, the most culturally interesting.” For techno music and partying, Berlin is still the place to go, Grigo said. “This kind of flavor Berlin has is different to many other cities in Europe.” Hansen added that Berlin’s cost of living is still favorable compared to other cities in the region, which are suffering from rising food and energy prices.  For Grigo, Berlin’s crypto scene reflects a broader appreciation in Germany for crypto’s promise of financial security and autonomy. Surveillance under East Germany’s “Stasi” secret police during Cold War times is still in the nation’s collective memory, Grigo said. That and a general fear of hyperinflation has left the country’s population somewhat amenable to crypto.  This national sentiment may be one more factor that allows projects that call Berlin home – from regulated DeFi platforms like Swarm to privacy-preserving portfolio tracking app Rotki – to thrive, and what helps to draw talented developers from all over the world to Berlin-native conferences like ETHBerlin and Dappcon, organized by GnosisDAO, which builds decentralized infrastructure for Ethereum.  ""Why Berlin and not Munich or Frankfurt? After all those are the German financial centers, right? Frankly ... I don't think this could have happened there,"" Lefteris Karapetsas, the creator of Rotki, said. Karapetsas, who says he was at the Ethereum office on Waldermarstr street in 2015 when the mainnet was launched, added that ""Berlin has the unique combination of talent, crazy, passion, dirty and even ugly stuff that combined together make it the capital of crypto for Europe.""  Grigo also noted that Germany is only behind the U.S. globally in terms of the number of Bitcoin nodes and Ethereum validators hosted despite having one-fourth of the population.  “I think this is a strong indicator that crypto is very deeply rooted in Germany,” Grigo said. “And the heart of the German tech scene, and also its crypto scene, is definitely Berlin.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | GMO,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/berlin-the-center-for-decentralized-finance-and-techno-music,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/389377c40c7bd21528f51fda49e9a31d2d08dd65-5107x2873.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410298,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdF4fE,1687865300,Los Angeles: Where Hollywood Magic and Creativity Meet Web3,"Los Angeles’ 11th place globally put it fourth among U.S. hubs, behind Wyoming, Silicon Valley and Austin, Texas. Many of the Crypto Hubs’ criteria were measured on a national basis, so the U.S. hubs collectively were hampered by a middling crypto regulatory score, which is the main factor in the drivers category and counts for 35% of the total weight. LA also had a lower-than-average quality-of-life score, due to its high cost of living and bad pollution and traffic congestion. Among the U.S. hubs, only the territory of Puerto Rico, which didn’t make it into our final ranking, fared worse for quality of life. To its advantage, LA had a strong opportunities score that measures per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     For sheer creativity per capita, no place beats my adopted home of Los Angeles. Name a recent trend in art, fashion, music or design, and it likely has roots in the City of Angels. The city’s vibe is crypto’s vibe – fresh, daring, a little on the outer edge of anything that has been previously contemplated.  LA also possesses an often overlooked importance in tech. Modern rocketry, the enabler of moon missions and space exploration, sprouted in the 1930s from Caltech researchers who founded Pasadena’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The rudimentary predecessor to the internet, ARPANET, got much of its start at UCLA in the late 1960s via a federally funded program that sought ways for computers to communicate with one another (sounds positively blockchainish). LA gave us skateboard aerodynamics, the bangs and twangs of the electric guitar and Barbie’s dimensions, which are a sort of science fiction.  In LA today, crypto communities revolving around NFTs, Web3 and other protocols riffing on the city’s larger-than-life entertainment industry dot the landscape from the revitalized Downtown Arts District inland to neighborhoods hugging the coast and various points in between.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Yes, the Walt Disney Company recently dismantled its much-ballyhooed NFT initiative and cut 50 metaverse-focused jobs, but given that there were 7,000 employees laid off worldwide, the Web3 reversal was likely a casualty of larger mismanagement issues that have been plaguing the company for years. Disney CEO Bob Iger has been famously upbeat about the metaverse and the potential of using new technologies to tell stories.  Meanwhile, a number of other major movie studios, music labels and talent agencies that have defined LA’s image remain steadfast in their commitment to create virtual worlds and blockchain-based projects.  In 2021, Fox Entertainment, best known as the home of The Simpsons, pumped $100 million into its Blockchain Creative Labs, to create, manage and sell NFTs and other digital assets tied to new and existing shows and other content. ViacomCBS and Lionsgate, among others, have also inked deals in recent years with NFT platforms, and agency powerhouse UTA – Harrison Ford’s representatives – added Larva Labs, the creator of Crypto Punks, to its roster of clients in 2021.  “Whether we like it or not, NFTs have become well-known beyond our industry bubble and are recognized by a much larger audience than we might think,” Theta Labs head of business development, Andrea Berry, wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed in April. “However, it's important to note that Hollywood has only begun to explore the potential of blockchain technology and Web3, indicating that there may be much more to come for the industry.”  This year’s Outer Edge LA conference (formerly NFT LA) featured more than 250 speakers from the crypto, sports and entertainment world, including Yat Siu, co-founder and chairman of Web3 game developer and investment firm Animoca Brands, former NBA All Star-turned producer/entrepreneur Baron Davis and Nadya Tolokonnikova, a founding member of the Russian feminist performance and art group, Pussy Riot.  On the subject of jobs in Web3, not only did LA score high in CoinDesk’s opportunities category for its per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events, but the jobs are at companies you’ve heard of or want to know more about. Ethereum development shop Consensys, and games developers Fun Gi and Mythical Games are hiring.  But what about the food?  To be sure, the city must fight the same regulatory headwinds that are slowing crypto’s ascent throughout the U.S. But LA’s grassroots interest in Web3 generally is hard to beat. Special crypto events, including blockchain weeks and more casual meet-ups, have become part of the city’s business calendar. Even the police department in sleepy Burbank will soon hold a lecture on the dark Web.  LA’s relatively low quality-of-life score woefully underestimates its mountain-to-sea access, temperate, year-round climate, acceptance of individualism, and most of all, its food scene. No city does Oaxacan, Yucatan, Thai, Vietnamese, Szechuan, Syrian or whatever-you-want-to-eat food trucks, pop-ups, backyard restaurants and farmers markets like LA.  You have to eat well to do great blockchain, right?  Okay, real estate prices have soared over the past 15 years and LA’s infamous traffic can be gnarly.  So stay off the freeways and settle into one of LA’s creative communities, which you’ll find filled with people as passionate about their projects as the founders of any protocol.  Plus, LA has the best movie stars.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/los-angeles-where-hollywood-magic-and-creativity-meet-web3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09e7c7e7be8f3ccc047f10a7b32a6224746d3852-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420084,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmjV,1687864821,New York City: A Crypto Sandbox in a Big Business Playground,"At 12th place globally, New York City came in fifth among the U.S. hubs in CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023. Many of the Crypto Hubs’ criteria were measured on a national basis, so all the U.S. hubs were hampered by a middling crypto regulatory score – part of the drivers category and the single-most heavily weighted factor overall at 35%. There were seven U.S. hubs in the initial 25-hub sample. All of them scored well in the enabler category for digital infrastructure (12%) and ease of doing business (10%) and opportunity measures including per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events (6% each). But New York’s high cost of living and congested traffic dragged it down, giving it a low quality-of-life score, which at 15% of the weighting was the second-most important criteria in our rubric.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.  New Yorkers pride themselves on being the best at many things: building skyscrapers, jaywalking and making money. (And, the list, any New Yorker will tell you, could certainly go on.)  So, it should come as no surprise that the Big Apple has big ambitions when it comes to fashioning itself into a first-in-class crypto capital.  “New York is the center of the world, and we want it to be the center of cryptocurrency and other financial innovations,” Mayor Eric Adams told his supporters after clinching the city’s chief executive role in late 2021.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  And, while New York City is admittedly a hub for hubris, it's not so bizarre to imagine the city as a center for crypto too. This was true before the crypto market crash last year and will likely continue amid a period of regulatory uncertainty. New York was one of the first jurisdictions to think seriously about crypto regulation, putting the so-called BitLicense into effect in 2015. Some firms, like Kraken, found the rules onerous and pulled out of the financial hub, but, for many, any amount of clarity was appreciated.  New York City Hall signaled its commitment to crypto, encouraging municipal employees to convert their paychecks to tokens using U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase in early 2022 (before the chilling effects of Crypto Winter). Adams even boasted about converting his own cash for coins when he took office in January last year, taking his first three paychecks into bitcoin (and swallowing a $1,000 loss).  Even before he took office, Adams floated the idea of spinning up a New York-inspired cryptocurrency a la Miami Coin. And while the plans for NYC Coin never panned out, the project encapsulated the momentum behind Adams’s digital money mission.  Working with Wall Street  Beyond the hallowed halls of City Hall, amid the hustle and bustle of Wall Street, the cryptocurrency industry has garnered its fair share of supporters – and, more importantly, some much-needed capital. As the financial epicenter of the U.S., New York is THE place to court banks and money management mammoths, some of which are already dipping their toes in the industry.  Between 2021 and 2022, Goldman Sachs poured nearly $700 million into crypto analysis firms like CertiK and Coin Metrics. Meanwhile, BNY funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into Fireblocks, a crypto infrastructure company.  Gotham remains a crypto magnet, despite the concrete jungle's comparatively high operating costs. There are 96 crypto companies based in New York as of publication time, more than twice the number of those in London, Miami and Austin combined, according to crypto data provider The Tie's database. Those firms include heavyweights like crypto exchange Gemini, stablecoin issuer Paxos and data intelligence provider Chainalysis.  “So, you’ve heard of Silicon Valley, right,” The Tie CEO Joshua Frank told CoinDesk. “Well, I call [Manhattan’s] Nomad district ‘shill-a-coin alley’ because every crypto company is within a four or five block radius.”  In such a crowded city, it's easy to draw out the crypto crowd.  Frank's company throws regular in-office networking events, bringing in more than 100 attendees at a time.  ""In what other city would we have been able to just throw a little happy hour in our office and have 150 people show up?"" Frank asked.  Aa a crypto company executive, that access to clients and investors makes New York an easy choice for a place to live and work, even if the living itself – ridiculous rents, overburdened transport systems and terrible traffic – is infamously awful.  ""I don't think anybody wants to be here,"" Frank said.

42420086,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmlZ,1687864610,How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology,"Ranking crypto hubs worldwide with some level of accuracy and credibility is fraught with challenges. We had basic questions like: What is the right geographic boundary (cities, states, countries)? What criteria should be used? What happens when data sources are hard to come by or only available for some of the cities/regions being evaluated?  Even which cities/regions should be considered is not always obvious.  As the editor and consultant to CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023, we aim to provide insights into the methodology and data sources we used to resolve these questions. We admit our list is far from perfect but we hope it helps advance the conversation regarding which places around the world are crypto hot spots.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Jeanhee Kim is senior editor for lists, rankings and special projects. She is a veteran journalist who launched the inaugural Forbes Asia ""100 to Watch"" in 2021. Early in her career she was a reporter on Money Magazine's Best Places to Live. Boyd Cohen is CEO and co-founder of Iomob, which is building the Internet of Mobility network and WheelCoin Move2Earn to gamify green mobility. He produced the ""Smartest Cities in the World"" for Fast Company.  Step 1: Selecting Cities & Regions  The team first debated what should constitute a hub. Could it be a city, could it be an entire state or even a small country? In the end, we said yes to all as the reality is that depending on population density, tolerance for commuting and embedded connectivity across a geography, any of the above could constitute a crypto hub.  The next challenge was to create the initial sample of hubs we should collect data for. Both of us have worked professionally in the past on rankings that began with a sample of hundreds of metro areas. But our time and resources are not unlimited; we sought to shortcut the process by reaching out to dozens of crypto experts representing media, blockchain clubs, venture funds, founders of layer 1s, 2s and decentralized applications, players in DeFi, ReFi and more. We sought diversity wherever we could: race, gender, sexual orientation and nationality, at least. We asked these experts to independently respond to a survey to indicate five to 10 or more crypto hubs around the globe they felt deserved being considered for the ranking. We also asked them to explain in a sentence or two what each hub had to offer and how they would prioritize criteria to be used in the ranking.  After communicating with more than three dozen experts around the world we received 18 responses. We also harvested from published lists of the prior year and a half, including Decrypt’s Most Influential Crypto Cities in the World, Recap.io’s The Rise of Crypto Hubs and Quantilus’ The 10 Most Crypto Friendly Cities in the World. From those, we gleaned 38 hubs for possible inclusion in our initial sample. Finally, we winnowed down to the 25 that were identified by two or more of the sources. These 25 hubs became our initial sample. All of our subsequent data research would be focused on these hubs only.  Step 2: Identifying Criteria and Data Sources  Next, the team reviewed the comments from the experts on the reasons they gave why certain hubs were among the top in the world. Looking at all factors we found, combined with what other previous crypto rankings had examined and our own internal discussions, we identified eight indicators across three primary categories: Drivers of Crypto Growth, Base Enablers and Crypto Network & Opportunities. Below we discuss the criteria and data sources in more depth.  Drivers of Crypto Growth  For a hub to be a vibrant place for the crypto community it is reasonable to expect the governing bodies in the region to have created regulatory support for the industry and that there is popular support among residents to engage in crypto ownership and trading.  Crypto Regulation Perhaps the most widely discussed and debated topic in crypto is the state of the regulatory environment in jurisdictions around the globe. While places like Hong Kong, Dubai, the United Kingdom and Europe have made waves in recent months for their proactive attempt to create a regulatory environment conducive to successful crypto markets while also protecting retail users, the U.S. has been making headlines for the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s regulation-by-enforcement approach and lack of regulatory clarity.  We reviewed several solid attempts to create objective ratings of crypto regulation worldwide but each of them had a serious drawback for our purposes, whether it was lack of inclusion of a large number of our 25-hub initial sample, outdated results that did not factor in developments such as Dubai’s VARA or the European Union’s MiCA, or a lack of nuance in scoring (according to one source we examined, 24 of our 25 hubs had the same regulatory score).  We ultimately decided that no single source was sufficient, so we developed our own scoring system that leaned or borrowed from the PWC Global Crypto Regulation Report (published in Dec. 2022), Solidus Lab’s Global Crypto Regulation Index (published in Summer 2022) and discussions with consultants knowledgeable about newer developments in crypto regulation around the world. We landed on a five-point scoring system: a nation received full credit if it had national crypto regulation in place with an operating history of at least one full year. Hubs received lower credit for having national regulations in place less than a year, local regulations only, not recognizing crypto as money, or having no established regulations at all (regulations pending).  Crypto Adoption The annual Chainalysis Crypto Adoption Index aims to quantify the level of grassroots, retail adoption of crypto in 172 countries via three metrics: 1) on-chain crypto currency value received; 2) on-chain retail value transferred; and 3) peer-to-peer exchange trading volume.  Base Enablers  Even a ranking of places to live and work in the tech industry must consider general factors such as quality of life, digital infrastructure (particularly having fast internet capability) and ease of doing business.  Quality of Life We chose Numbeo’s quality of life index as our source of data due to its approach of collecting data from expats around the world on key lifestyle metrics such as: Cost of living and purchasing power, pollution, crime, health care and traffic. Numbeo’s data allowed us to find an index number for nearly every hub on our list. And, when we could find no results for certain hubs, or the index number for a hub was based on scant data, we used Numbeo’s suggested next-closest site, or an average of two of them.  Digital Evolution Whether crypto professionals work remotely or in offices or co-working spaces, they increasingly rely on high-speed and reliable internet connectivity. Blockchain engineers, traders, designers and commercial crypto professionals all rely on a growing array of digital tools to participate in the protocols, exchanges, metaverse and dapps driving the crypto revolution.  To obtain a holistic assessment of how the prospective crypto hubs rate in these areas, we relied on the Digital Intelligence Index from Tufts University which collects 160 indicators to evaluate the vibrancy and ubiquity of the digital economy and infrastructure in the majority of countries around the world.  East of Doing Business Since 2005, the World Bank has been scoring and ranking 190 countries by how conducive the regulatory environment is for starting and operating a local business. The 10 criteria for its Ease of Doing Business index include getting a construction permit, registering property, getting credit, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency.  Crypto Opportunities  We wanted to gain a sense of the career and networking opportunities within each hub. So we leveraged data on jobs, companies and events with a focus on crypto in the region. We used the same source and applied the same search terms for each hub and completed all the searches within a single day, which allowed us consistency, but exposes our results to the risk that culture or language might skew the results for some of the hubs. For example, would LinkedIn be the app of choice for placing a job ad in non-English language hubs such as Ljubljana or South Korea? Finally, all of these indicators were converted to per-capita rates to provide more fairness regardless of population size.  Jobs We searched LinkedIn to source open jobs published in the target hub that mentioned the words “crypto,” “Web3” or “blockchain.” This gross number was then adjusted to a ratio based on population.  Companies Similar to jobs, we used LinkedIn to search for companies in the target hub area that mentioned the words “crypto,” “Web3” or “blockchain” in their description. This gross number was then adjusted to a ratio based on population.  Events We used Eventbrite and Meetup to capture the number of “crypto,” “blockchain” or “Web3” related events in each target hub. This gross number was then adjusted to a ratio based on population.  Step 3: Weighting the Categories and Indicators  The most controversial part of the ranking process is likely to be the choice of relative weights of each indicator. Clearly they are not all equal and some categories matter more than others. What makes it even more difficult is some experts we spoke with have substantially different views on what is most important when ranking crypto hubs.  We took the feedback from a range of expert opinions and did our best to develop a weighting system we felt was appropriate.  Drivers of Crypto Growth (Violet, 45% total weight)  This category is the most important for determining the strength of a crypto hub. It reflects openness and interest from both government and the people and is an indicator of the current and future growth of the crypto ecosystem in the hub.  Crypto Regulation (35%)  The most heavily weighted criteria in our rubric, the regulatory score reflects the existence of laws on the books, what level of government the laws are in, and whether the laws allow crypto. What we were unable to measure is how effective the laws are and how well they are enforced, both of which would likely lead to different scores for all of our hubs. Enforcement of the laws could be a local quality that no global analysis could determine.  Crypto Adoption (10%)  Chainalysis’ methodology of looking at retail adoption of crypto reflects a decentralized view of adoption and therefore is one of our favorite criteria in this project. Reassuringly, the 2022 index included all but one of the countries included in our 25-hub sample. We calculated an approximate 2022 index value for the missing UAE data using its relative placement in the 2021 index.  Base Enablers (Blue, 37% total weight)  This category and the weight we placed on the criteria may be among the most easy to challenge. We debated how heavily to weigh measures that had no connection or impact on crypto at all. But in the end, Crypto Hubs is a ranking of places to live and work, and fundamentally, qualities that reflect the ease or hardship of daily life and business had to be factored in.  Quality of Life (15%)  A good quality of life is what attracts the creative class to move to a region. This Numbeo index is comprehensive and includes nearly every hub in our sample, but among the factors not included are the quality of schools or the natural beauty of a locale.  Digital Evolution (12%)  Digital infrastructure, especially a reliable network of broadband capabilities, is a must for a crypto-related ranking. While this index from Tufts University does an outstanding job, it was measured in 2020. Furthermore, it did not include the Caribbean or Latin America, which Tufts last measured in 2018. For these reasons, we put less weight than might seem necessary, and also note that in the global south people are overcoming digital divide challenges to become active crypto participants. Ultimately, when crypto is desired, the infrastructure limitations can be overcome.  Ease of Doing Business (10%)  The World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking was last produced in 2020, from which we took our scores. Not only did the list include all of the countries included in our 25-hub sample, but it also gave a separate score for the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. After the 2020 list was published, however, an investigation revealed that a handful of governments may have interfered with the objective reporting of their data, including the UAE. We did not penalize the UAE, but note that its ranking in the top 10% of all countries may not be an accurate reflection of its ease of doing business.  Crypto Opportunities (Green, 18% total weight)  These criteria were a way to get a sense of the vibrancy of the crypto ecosystem. However, many crypto professionals are digital nomads and the actual presence of crypto companies or crypto jobs within the physical borders of a hub is not important because they can work anywhere in the world.  Jobs (6%)  We put the lightest weight on this criteria because it measured job ads on Linkedin that included the words “crypto,” “blockchain” or “Web3.” This is an indicator for actual jobs, but not a true measure. And LinkedIn, while global and searchable for all 25 places in our hub sample, could have lower utility in the non-English language hubs.  Companies (6%)  Since we used Linkedin to find crypto companies we were relying on self-reporting rather than an objective measure. LinkedIn, while global and searchable for all 25 of our hub sample, could have lower utility in the non-English language hubs.  Events (6%)  While events may seem less important than jobs and companies, we gave it equal weight. If a crypto nomad lives in a city, they don't care about companies and jobs as much as they care about opportunities to engage with other people from the local and global crypto community on a regular basis.  Conclusion  This is CoinDesk’s first attempt to rank global crypto hubs. We expect – and welcome – rigorous debate over our results and our methodology. The limitations of time, available data and our own resources were all factors at play in the choices we made. Our efforts were earnest and our decisions, we feel, were justifiable. That said, we are eager to hear from policy makers, crypto entrepreneurs, venture funds and the broader crypto ecosystem regarding the best places in the world to put down roots and engage in the crypto ecosystem.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,"Jeanhee Kim, Boyd Cohen",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/how-we-ranked-coindesks-crypto-hubs-2023-our-methodology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b10915d629efb1633e4b3c6eca0625709e40d49a-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420085,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmkX,1687864532,Vancouver: A Boutique Hub for Crypto Early Adopters,"The only Canadian hub to make it into our final ranking, Vancouver had a strong showing in per-capita opportunity measures including crypto jobs, companies and events, as well as a particularly high score for quality of life, in our enabler category. But like its neighboring U.S., Canada’s crypto regulatory structure score was just middling, sitting at three of a maximum score of five. The regulatory criteria, part of the drivers category, is the most heavily weighted at 35% of the total score. Another drivers criteria, the crypto adoption score, was similarly average. This pulled Vancouver to 13th place overall.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     Despite its relatively small size, Vancouver, Canada punches above its weight when it comes to its attractiveness as a tech and crypto hub.  Not only is the City of Glass one of the world’s most livable cities, but also a hotspot for early crypto adoption. It is home to the world’s first bitcoin ATM, installed in 2013 by Robocoin, as well as CryptoKitties developer Dapper Labs and some miners, including Hive Blockchain (HIVE).  The city in southwest Canada, just over the border with the U.S., is a “growing hub, but not fully global yet,” said Al Leong, a chief marketing officer and board member for Web 3 companies who spends several months out of the year in Vancouver  Broadly speaking, Vancouver saw the biggest growth in high-tech jobs in 2020 and 2021 compared to any other city in North America, according to commercial real estate firm CBRE. That’s likely thanks to its relatively low tax rates, world-class aities and diverse population. Geographical proximity to Microsoft’s hometown of Seattle, Washington and stunning natural beauty does not hurt either.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Crypto natives will find signs of grassroots adoption of Web3 and crypto throughout the city. An art installation launched two years ago transformed the underside of a bridge into an augmented reality experience exploring blockchain, thanks to Colombian artist Jessica Angel. Vancouver is also home to at least three bitcoin and one Ethereum meetups, said members of a 200-member Telegram group chat related to a broader crypto meetup.  “Vancouver has greater access to the Asia Pacific hubs and networks and seems to act as a launchpad for other jurisdictions, but works in coordination with Toronto to some degree,” Leong said. Historically, Vancouver has had a large Asian diaspora, including making a claim as a hometown of Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. Zhao moved to Vancouver at the age of 12 from China, and grew up there until he left for university in Montreal. When he is referred to as Chinese, he corrects the speaker, and says he has Canadian citizenship.  The sword of Damocles  CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023 placed a heavy weight on the structure of each locale’s crypto regulations and grassroots adoption of crypto. Unfortunately, these were two criteria where Canada – and therefore Vancouver – scored relatively low. Indeed, in May Binance announced that it would cease operations in the nation, citing the challenging regulatory environment.  “We had high hopes for the rest of the Canadian blockchain industry,” the company announced. “Unfortunately, new guidance related to stablecoins and investor limits provided to crypto exchanges makes the Canada market no longer tenable for Binance at this time.”  Regulators in Canada tightened rules for crypto operators in February, leading to the high-profile exits of two other major crypto exchanges Bybit and OKX, as well as crypto firms Blockchain.com and Paxos.  This has left space for competitors like U.S.-based Kraken to gain market share and help contribute to shaping future regulations. Kraken’s Managing Director for Canada Mark Greenberg said he appreciated the attention given to users’ security in the country's policy mandates, but argued the limits on trading offerings makes it difficult to find areas to expand into.

British Columbia, Vancouver’s province, imposed an 18-month moratorium on new mining operations in December 2022, citing the increased demand for energy.  Although there are policy changes affecting businesses across the country, it's likely Canada's answer to Silicon Valley will continue to play a pivotal role in the development of this technology.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/vancouver-a-boutique-hub-for-crypto-early-adopters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1424d25893aa8175dfaf2e687b3ef3752c68017d-1919x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420082,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmhR,1687864417,Ljubljana: It’s a Beautiful Life in This Crypto Payments Hotbed,"Ljubljana is a study in contrasts when it comes to factors that measure grassroots crypto enthusiasm and activity. Its opportunities score, based on the rate of per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events, is outstanding, but its crypto adoption score, in the drivers category, was second-lowest of the entire 25-hub sample. The poor performance could be explained by the fact that crypto adoption is measured on a national scale, reflecting all of Slovenia, and not just Ljubljana itself. On its own, Ljubljana had a top-10 quality-of-life score, which enabled it to break into our top 15.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     In discussions of cryptocurrency-friendly locales, one city comes up far more than most would guess: Ljubljana, Slovenia.  Americans in particular might have trouble locating this little gem on a map, much less pronouncing it (LEE-ub-LEE-yana, more or less). But it’s hard to think of any global city whose recent ascent has been more subtly remarkable – whether in crypto, or more generally.  Slovenia was part of the Yugoslavia until 1991, when Slovenes played an important role in pushing for the republic’s breakup. The young country is now nestled between Austria to its north, Italy to its west, Croatia to the south and Hungary to the east – not a flawless neighborhood, but nothing to sniff at. The independent Slovenia rates with Poland and the Czech Republic as success stories of economic and civic development – though it’s a far smaller one, with a population of just over two million.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Slovenia’s broader vibrancy has fed into significant crypto activity. It may not have the sheer gravitational pull of a finance megahub like Hong Kong or London, but Ljubjana punches well above its weight, particularly in the development of crypto retail payments. As an EU member nation, it enjoys regulation under the promising new MiCA standards, which have been quite positively received by the crypto sector.  The city is home to the nonprofit Blockchain Alliance Europe and has its own Slovenia Bitcoin Association. It’s also home to a number of firms creating crypto infrastructure, particularly Eligma, which largely does business as GoCrypto.  GoCrypto over the past four years has created a checkout system, also known as GoCrypto, that includes both crypto payment options, and more familiar credit card processing. GoCrypto CEO Dejan Roljic told me that making things seamless for retailers was a conscious strategy to grow crypto adoption. That seems to be working: according to one 2022 study, Ljubljana, with a population comparable to Boise, Idaho’s, has hundreds of retail locations, bars and other venues that accept crypto payments.  There’s another serendipitous crypto connection, thanks to the Ljubljana-based firm The BTC Company. Despite the name, they’re not a Bitcoin operation, but a property manager and developer – according to company history, the name dates as far back as 1993. But according to Roljic, the company hasn’t shied away from the association, letting its conveniently-named BTC City shopping complex serve as a testing ground for the GoCrypto point-of-sale system.  Despite his involvement with the global crypto movement, GoCrypto CEO Roljic also told me that he has decided to stay put in his native Slovenia simply because “the quality of life is so good here.” Among other selling points, Roljic told me you can get “to the beach, or to the mountains, either one, it’s two hours” from Ljubljana.  Slovenia is not just physically beautiful, but has a fast-growing reputation as an advanced, sophisticated nation. There are concrete metrics, such as the country’s life expectancy, which is currently higher than that in the United States. Slovenia is also a European Union member of notable standing, having joined in 2004, when it became the first former Yugoslav republic to do so. Close to 70% of Slovenian adults speak English, according to 2011 data.  Good looks, and brains, too  Slovenia’s most notable achievements, though, come in less easily measured arenas: architecture and philosophy.  Photos of Ljubljana look like a real-life Wes Anderson movie, all bright primary colors and wedding cake filigree. And as you walk among those marvels, you might bump into Slovenia’s most famous son: philosopher Slavoj Žižek (pronounced SLAH-voy ZHEE-zhek). Žižek’s unlikely career began with impenetrable tomes interpreting the arcane works of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Jacques Lacan, but has culminated in prominence as a political commentator and the host of a string of neuron-firing and scandalously-titled documentaries. Roljic said he once found himself sitting next to the philosopher in a dentist’s waiting room – it is, indeed, a small city.  Those perks do come at a price. According to data from Nomadlist.com, the cost of living in central Ljubljana is relatively high, comparable to Western European cities like Berlin, and significantly higher than costs in nearby Belgrade. But, according to the same data, life outside of central Ljubljana is cost-competitive with the likes of Mexico City and even Bangkok – places where, among other tradeoffs, English is spoken less widely.  So if you’re looking for a crypto hub without the furious grind of life in the U.S. or Asia, and perhaps a bit more frontier spirit than you’d expect in France or Germany, Ljubljana may be just right.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,David Z.

42420078,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmeL,1687863999,Bitcoin Cash Sees Largest Bets in 2 Years as BCH Doubles in a Week,"Key takeaways  Bitcoin cash open interest surged to over $400 million.  Rising open interest indicates higher inflows and improved sentiment.  Plans for scaling system 'CashTokens' have also added to renewed interest.  Open interest in futures tracking Bitcoin Cash (BCH) tokens has surged to May 2021 levels as the Bitcoin offshoot network experiences a revival of activity and value.  BCH prices have doubled in the past week, data shows, becoming one of the top-performing tokens above a $1 billion market capitalization. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) added 13% and 8% respectively in this period.  Data shows BCH open interest, or the number of unsettled futures contracts, surged to over $400 million on Monday from just $75 million the week prior. Most of the trading interest arose from the crypto exchange Binance, where traders opened $240 million worth of BCH long or short positions.  Rising open interest either means that new money is flowing into the market or existing participants are increasing their allocation. The metric can be used as an indicator to determine market sentiment and the strength behind price trends.  A network upgrade and an influential exchange listing have likely served as two key catalysts for the sudden trading interest in BCH.  Bitcoin Cash underwent a network hard fork in May which improved the security and privacy of the fledgling network and introduced plans for “CashTokens” – a scaling system that would allow developers to build decentralized applications directly on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.  Other improvements were the introduction of smaller transaction sizes – which help speed up transactional times – and smart contracts functionality that will allow Bitcoin Cash-based applications to offer recurring payments, derivatives trading, and crowdfunding opportunities, among other uses, to Bitcoin Cash users.  Elsewhere, BCH has also likely benefited from the launch of EDX Markets, according to crypto research firm Santiment.  The new exchange is backed by traditional finance heavy-weights Fidelity Digital Assets, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities, and opened trading last Tuesday, supporting BCH along with bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC).  The sudden price move has attracted retail trader attention, with social discussions about the token rising to their highest in three years and trading volumes this year hitting a record, Santiment last week.",POSITIVE,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/27/bitcoin-cash-sees-largest-bets-in-2-years-as-bch-doubles-in-a-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97680ac486719a8a5b760015e03428c85845dcce-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420083,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmiT,1687863917,"Lisbon: A Buzzy, Affordable Mecca for Buy-and-Hold Crypto Nomads","The final hub to make the cut into our top-15 ranking of crypto hubs, Lisbon had an above-average rating for crypto regulatory structure, 4 out of 5. That important criteria, in the drivers category, was worth 35% of the total score on its own. But Lisbon scored in the solid middle- to lower-middle of the 25-hub pack on nearly every other measure, from grassroots crypto adoption (another driver) to opportunities criteria including per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events. What lifted the popular expat destination into the final 15 was a higher-than-average quality-of-life score, in the enablers category, worth 15% of the total.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.     In the fall of 2017 I sold everything I owned, left New York City, and bought a one-way ticket to a city where I would stay indefinitely: Lisbon.  This was the start of my three-year “digital nomad” journey. Digital nomads hunt for destinations that have both a high quality of life and a low cost of living. It’s a form of geographic arbitrage. Nomads crave cities with high-speed internet, active co-working spaces, a frisky nightlife, culture, sunshine, good food and cheap drinks.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  I started my journey in Lisbon, because Lisbon oozes all of these things. It’s a digital nomad wonderland. The Portuguese government realized they had a good thing going, and leaned into it further by creating a digital nomad visa in 2022. Coders, devs, entrepreneurs, and creatives flock to Lisbon for top-shelf Europe at discount prices. (That discount, of course, has narrowed as Lisbon has grown in popularity.) And even back in 2017, many of these digital nomads were obsessed with crypto.  “I really want to buy bitcoin, but I feel like the price is too high and I missed the bull run,” someone told me in a Lisbon bar. This was in 2017; bitcoin then traded at $7,000. And since then the crypto scene – and prices – have exploded.  “The best thing about Lisbon for the Web3 ecosystem is that everyone is here,” says Inês Bragança Gaspar, a blockchain lawyer who has lived in Lisbon all her life. “You have big projects. Small projects. Entrepreneurs.” There are so many recurring events and meet-ups, says Gaspar, that she can literally go to one every day of the week. There’s Web3 Wednesdays, Crypto Fridays, and larger conferences like NEAR-Con and NFT Summit.  Tax-friendly for crypto  One reason for the crypto boom is a friendly tax environment. “Until the end of last year, crypto was not taxed in Portugal,” says Gaspar. “It used to be a crypto tax paradise.” Even the new taxes are relatively painless; if you hold cryptocurrency for over a year and then sell it, you pay exactly zero Euros in tax. So your incentive is to buy and hold instead of short-term trading. As Gaspar puts it, “The government is trying to make us hold our coins.”  In another perk from the Portuguese government, if you earn capital gains from overseas investments, that’s also taxed at 0%. This isn’t specific to crypto, but it helped lure businesses and workers to Lisbon, adding more talent to the ecosystem. “It’s quite easy to hire high quality tech talent at a competitive cost,” says Gaspar.  Perhaps most surprisingly, the Web3 enthusiasm hasn’t slowed during crypto winter. You could argue it accelerated. After the FTX collapse, many events had a theme of “how to build in a bear market,” and those who were serious doubled down on their work. “In a bear market, that’s where you need community the most,” says Gaspar. “Even if you just want to vent about the prices of your crypto going down.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/lisbon-a-buzzy-affordable-mecca-for-buy-and-hold-crypto-nomads,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9394fcc55c425f4bd56fb6a7e59b65641a358cc2-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14247199,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/bitcoin-about-to-reignite-its-strong-uptrend,1687863688,Bitcoin about to reignite its strong uptrend,"With bitcoin gathering strength above $30,000 another strong move to the upside could be on the way. A safe haven - but do people know it? Having taken all that could be thrown at it by government and financial agencies, bitcoin appears to be doing exactly what it was built for, and that is providing a safe haven for the peoples’ wealth outside of a fast-crumbling fiat financial system. The real shame of the matter is that a lot of the mud that has been frantically slung at the crypto sector by mainstream media on behalf of the banks has undeniably stuck, with the vast majority of people not feeling that they can trust one of the only life rafts available to them. However, if bitcoin can continue its current strong trend to the upside the mainstream media will find it increasingly difficult to ignore and will be able to manufacture less reasons to stop the average retail investor from buying it - as long as the SEC hasn’t destroyed all the on/off ramps from the banks. Momentum about to pick up Momentum indicators are starting to go bitcoin’s way. The huge pump in price from $24,800 to around $31,400 wasn’t something that could be sustained, and bitcoin has had to go downwards and sideways for the last few days in order for the RSIs (momentum indicators) to reset. This has happened for both the shorter term 4-hourly and 8-hourly, and the 12 hourly is on the way down. Looking out at the long term weekly timeframe things do look good for bitcoin given that the weekly Stochastic RSI has crossed upwards and has pierced through the 20 level signalling strong upwards momentum. Continuing with this more macro outlook, closing a weekly candle above the $30,000 price level was an extremely bullish action for bitcoin. It could certainly be argued that this is the all-important level for it to get above since it has been support and resistance since early 2021. Last week’s candle was also the first to break out of the weekly Gaussian Channel since it was entered for the first time in July of 2021. Once a bull run starts in earnest the price never goes back inside this channel. Reducing returns Even though many commentators and analysts might be calling for well over $100,000 for this cycle it would be good to look into the reducing highs over time for bitcoin. This would point towards a high of around $100,000, much less than many are predicting. Be that as it may, a 3x from here amid the carnage of bank failures and a collapsing economy is not such a bad return. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14247179,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539867,1687863603,"XRP Traders Show Capitulation, Why This Could Be Bullish","On-chain data shows that XRP traders have been selling at a loss recently, unlike investors of the other top assets. Here’s why this can be bullish for the coin. XRP Loss Transactions Have Outweighed Profit Ones Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, XRP has differed from the rest of the top cryptocurrencies in terms of the loss-taking behavior of the investors. The relevant indicator here is the “ratio of on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,” which, as its name already hints, tells us about how the profit-taking volume of a specific coin compares with the loss-taking volume. This metric separates these two volumes by going through the chain history of each coin being transacted to see what price it was previously moved at. If this previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot value, then that particular coin is now being sold at a profit. Naturally, all such coins will contribute towards the profit-taking volume. On the other hand, the coins of the opposite case will add to the loss-taking volume. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this ratio for some of the top assets in the sector over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been positive for most of the coins | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the indicator has recently had positive values for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA). Whenever the metric has such green values, it means that the profit-taking volume is more than the loss-taking volume currently. This profit-taking spree from the investors of these cryptocurrencies isn’t unexpected, as the prices of the various assets have observed a significant uplift during the past week. Following such sharp rallies, at least some holders tend to harvest their gains. The odd one out here is XRP, however. From the graph, it’s visible that the metric has turned negative for the asset recently, implying that the investors have been participating in a net amount of loss-taking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Stagnates At ATH, What Does This Mean? The reason behind these holders selling at a loss would be the poor performance of the coin relative to the other top assets, as XRP has in fact registered a decline of 1% during the past week. Usually, loss-taking is a sign that the investors of the asset have started to give up, as they likely believe that the coin would only see a further downtrend in the near future. Such capitulation, however, has historically actually been bullish for the cryptocurrency’s price, as weak hands exit the coin during these events, while stronger hands buy up their tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Plunges The deeper the investors capitulate, the more likely a rise in the price becomes. The XRP investors, though, have only been participating in a slight amount of loss-taking recently. But nonetheless, it’s still a bullish sign for the asset, even if not a particularly major one. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.48, down 1% in the last week.

42420080,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmgP,1687860517,Whale Drives Ether-Bitcoin Volatility Spread Lower Ahead of Options Expiry,"Options contracts tied to ether (ETH) worth $2.3 billion are set to expire on dominant crypto derivatives exchange Deribit this Friday.  Ahead of the pivotal quarterly settlement, the market is witnessing a low spread between Deribit's forward-looking 30-day implied volatility index for ether (ETH DVOL) and bitcoin (BTC DVOL).  According to Deribit, the negative spread indicating relative ether stability results from an increased institutional interest in ""overwriting"" or selling ether call options. The dynamic has set the stage for major market shifts around Friday's expiry.  Overwriting involves selling or writing overvalued call options or bullish derivative bets, typically against long-term buy-and-hold positions. It's a popular way of generating additional income on top of spot market holdings. A call seller offers protection to the buyer from price rallies in return for a fixed compensation.  Since the beginning of the year, the market has seen large reflective overwriting flows in ether, which have lowered ETH implied volatility. Implied volatility (IV) refers to traders' expectations for price turbulence and is positively impacted by the demand for options.  With June contracts set to settle this Friday, overwriters may roll over their positions. In other words, short positions expiring on Friday may be squared off and moved to the July or September expiry. That could cause significant shifts in how IV is priced in the bitcoin and ether markets.  ""ETH has witnessed substantial institutional selling activity [in call options], earning a trader the moniker of the 'ETH overwriter' aka an ETH volatility selling whale! Remarkably, this has resulted in a scenario where DVOL (implied volatility index similar to VIX) in ETH is lower than that of BTC,"" Deribit's Chief Risk Officer Shaun Fernando told CoinDesk.  ""As these substantial positions near their expiration, it could lead to captivating shifts in volatility as participants consider rolling over their positions,"" Fernando added.  At press time, the ETH-BTC DVOL spread stood at -2.5, having hit a three-year low of -7.8 last week, according to data source Amberdata. Implied volatility, or IV, represents traders' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period and is positively impacted by the demand for options. A call option represents a bullish bet on the underlying asset, while a put represents a bearish bet.  While rollovers may influence the ETH-BTC DVOL spread, ether's price is likely to stay around $1,800-$1,900, according to over-the-counter liquidity network Paradigm.  ""In terms of ETH dealer gamma heading into expiry, we predict $1,800-$1,900 strikes to be a magnet for spot, predominantly because dealers have largely got long due to previously discussed overwriter flows,"" Paradigm said in its market update.  Being long gamma means holding buy (long) positions in options. When market makers are long gamma, they buy low and sell high to keep their overall exposure market neutral. The hedging often ends up keeping prices rangebound.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/27/whale-drives-ether-bitcoin-volatility-spread-lower-ahead-of-options-expiry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90a52243af644b90d6fcfb7bb2ddf4d8b05abb0f-7757x3660.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
14245959,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539868,1687860451,How High Can Bitcoin Price Rise Due To Spot ETFs? Running The Numbers,"The recent Bitcoin rally has led to speculation that the price could rise further with the introduction of spot ETFs. The arrival of ETFs, especially from reputable companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity, could boost institutional investor confidence and lead to a surge in the Bitcoin price. The one million dollar question, however, is: how high? Clues to answering this question can come from various metrics and data. One such data point was provided yesterday by CoinShares’ Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors via Twitter. As she writes, the Bitcoin spot ETF news is not the only story. Many of the largest financial institutions in the US are currently actively working to provide access to BTC and more. In total, there are more than $27 trillion in client assets waiting on the sidelines. With BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager has filed a Bitcoin ETF application. Rumour has it that the world’s number three, Fidelity Investments, is also flirting with a Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin ETF applications from Invesco and WisdomTree (both top 10 ETFs) are a fact. How High Can Bitcoin Rise? All-Time High? Quadruple? If just a fraction of the $27 trillion in client money managed by the largest asset managers were to go into Bitcoin spot ETFs, the impact on price would be gigantic. Just 1% would amount to over $270 billion (rather more because not all Bitcoin ETF applicants are included in the chart). In comparison, the Bitcoin market cap is currently $590 billion. Related Reading: Momentum: Why The Bitcoin Train Is Ready To Leave The Station As NewsBTC reported two weeks ago, the performance of the gold price after the first gold ETF in November 2004 could also be a metric that provides a glimpse into the future. The launch of the first gold ETFs led to a fabulous gold rally. While the price of gold was still at $400 at the time of approval, it reached $600 in 2006 and $800 in 2008. Seven years after approval, in 2011, gold reached its preliminary high of almost $2,000 (+359%). Renowned expert Will Clemente commented via Twitter: Shown below is when GLD launched, allowing easy access to Gold exposure for investors. If/when Blackrock’s (who has a 99% ETF approval) Bitcoin ETF launches (very similar structure to GLD), expect similar price action as it unlocks access to Bitcoin exposure for the masses. As Bitcoin is the digital gold of the 21st century, it is also worth looking at the market capitalizations of both assets in comparison. While BTC stands at $590 billion, the gold market capitalization is around $12 trillion. If Bitcoin were to gain just 10% of gold’s market share (around $1.2 trillion), this would be a doubling of BTC’s current market capitalization and, to put it simply, a doubling of Bitcoin’s current price. That this target is by no means impossible is shown by BTC’s all-time high of around $67,000 at the end of 2021, when its market capitalization was already around $1.2 trillion. Another benchmark is the total market capitalization of the global stock market of over $100 trillion. Apple accounts for about 3% of this. The company is thus five times as capitalised as Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Plunges One factor that also needs to be taken into account when determining the price is the supply side. As expert Alessandro Ottaviani writes, BlackRock and Fidelity would only have to move 0.3% of their managed capital into Bitcoin to buy all existing BTC on the exchanges at the current price. The on-chain analysis service Glassnode has published research on this. The analysts write that after a period of weaker relative US demand, there is a revival in 2023. This encounters a highly illiquid market. Currently, there is a continued transfer of wealth to HODLers, while more and more coins are being withdrawn from exchanges. According to Glassnode, there are currently only 2.28 million BTC left on exchanges (11.9% of circulating supply), a short term holder supply of 2.65 BTC (13.6% of circulating supply) while 14.47 BTC are held by long term holders (74.5% of circulating supply). All the above metrics and data suggest that Bitcoin is facing a huge bull run led by institutions. However, there is no guarantee for this. One thing to consider is that the US Securities and Exchange Commission could reject the Bitcoin spot ETFs despite BlackRock’s fantastic success rate. On the other hand, BlackRock and others need to buy BTC on the spot market for it to have a direct impact on the price. But one possibility is that BlackRock could buy Bitcoin over-the-counter (OTC). For example, the asset manager could buy the BTC seized by the US government (over 200,000) over-the-counter. This could lead to a “buy the rumor sell the news” event. But even if they bought over-the-counter from the US, this could be beneficial in the long run, as it means that the US government will no longer sell its BTC on the open market as it did in the past. At press time, the BTC price stood at $30,388.

The company, whose customers use the platform to trade stocks, options and crypto, made cuts as it adjusts to a slowdown in customer trading activity, the WSJ said. The number of active traders had dropped to fewer than 11 million in May, down from a peak of 21 million a month in second-quarter 2021, according to the newspaper. Crypto trading volume for May fell 68% from a year earlier, the company said.  ""We’re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis.

42420067,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmW5,1687860053,Crypto Bankruptcy Investor Ouroboros Eyes Smaller Claims,"Boutique investment firm Arceau has developed a platform to automate the process of verifying cryptocurrency bankruptcy claims in firms like FTX or Celsius, allowing it to buy out smaller creditors who found it hard to access traditional bankruptcy markets.  Last year saw a number of large crypto firms collapse, making unwitting creditors out of thousands of investors, whose assets are now trapped within interminable bankruptcy processes.  One avenue open to those whose assets are locked up in a bankruptcy estate is to sell their claims at a discount at marketplaces such as X Claims or Claims Market. But there are very few providers of liquidity for relatively small claims of around $50,000 because of the cost of the due diligence, according to Ouroboros co-founder Louis d’Origny.  “We’ve created a software tool that automates the process of proving you have an FTX claim,” d’Origny said in an interview. “It’s a lot of work for a fund to prove that you have a claim in the FTX case, and most funds will not buy a claim that's under $2 million.” That's a limit makes it almost impossible for small creditors to sell their claims.  Joining d’Origny and other Arceau co-founder Michael Bottjer on Ouroboros, is crypto bankruptcy investor Thomas Braziel, a partner at 507 Capital.  “Ouroboros is going after smallish claims and making liquidity for them, and yet they are sophisticated buyers,” Braziel said in a message. “I think it’s great for the market and I’m happy to be part of it and maybe bring in some capital.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/27/crypto-bankruptcy-investor-ouroboros-eyes-smaller-claims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/978a30e6f27436d2fec10f3002fa98c75d1390cf-4368x2912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The inaugural class of 10 designers includes fashion house Pet Liger, fashion artist Stephy Fung, photographer GlitchofMind, digital artist Calvyn Dylin Justus, spatial computing artist Taskin Goec, visual artist Fanrui Sun, fashion brand Nextberries, 3D artist Gustavo Toledo, footwear designer Felipe Fiallo and immersive creator Jacqueline Assar.  With the goal of “disrupting” the traditional fashion industry, the cohort will work together to develop their individual brands and pave the way for the fast-evolving world of digital fashion. Working under the mentorship of SYKY founder and CEO Alice Delahunt as well as industry leaders including CMO of Calvin Klein Jonathan Bottomley, founding member of digital fashion platform Red DAO Megan Kaspar and non-profit the British Fashion Council, the cohort will be releasing their first collections on SYKY later this year.  Delahunt told CoinDesk that the company’s mission is to decentralize creativity and bring new mediums into the traditional fashion world.  “There's still a lot of cynicism about digital designers … the metaverse and NFTs had an absolutely mainstream hype cycle and then we went into the trough of disillusionment and kind of felt discarded a little bit,” said Delahunt. “I think that we had to really cut through the noise … there are designers who are designing in these spaces, and there are consumers who are in digital worlds consuming and expressing their identity.”  Taskin Goec, one of the designers selected to participate in the cohort, told CoinDesk he’s looking forward to expanding his design skills alongside a group of artists and mentors who are well-versed in digital fashion and Web3.  “I think that none of us started designing in a vacuum and I think we're all making culture together,” said Goec. “I don't want to work just by myself in my own case, but I want to actually join this family so that we can create something bigger together.”  In addition to learning new skills, the cohort is also focused on diversifying the industry. Delahunt said that The SYKY Collective aims to break down barriers to entry into the fashion world by empowering new artists.  “The more houses that can exist at a grassroots level that can scale, the more creative, more inclusive and more diversified the fashion industry will be,” said Delahunt. “When we look back in 100 years' time, although there's been a lot of work done to break down barriers and diversify, it’s still a very gatekept industry.”  Adaku Emenike and Oluchi Nwachukwu, the Nigerian duo behind Nextberries, told CoinDesk that the barriers to entry to digital design are particularly high in Nigeria due to a “traditional mindset” and lack of access to digital resources.  “The traditional fashion industry, even here, continues to gatekeep, so now we want to be the change, we want to make a difference,” said Nwachukwu. “With the collective, this is what we are looking to change in Nigeria and Africa as a whole because the digital world isn’t yet [as familiar] here.”  While digital fashion has primarily been discussed in terms of events including Metaverse Fashion Week, SYKY has spent the past year building out its community to help foster decentralized creativity ahead of its platform launch. In January, it announced a $9.5 million funding round led by Seven Seven Six, a VC firm founded in 2020 by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. In addition, it released its Keystone Pass, a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that grants access to its private community of 987 fashion leaders, collectors, designers and enthusiasts.

Trading volume across numerous altcoins has increased significantly.  Open interest is at record highs for several altcoins.  A series of decentralized finance and NFT-related altcoins have posted double-digit gains over the past week as capital begins to flow from larger assets like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) to more speculative tokens like blur (BLUR) and arbitrum (ARB).  Over the past 24-hours Blur, which is the native token of its namesake's NFT exchange, has risen by more than 22% after it was listed on South Korean trading platform Upbit.  The move coincided with a notable spike in trading volume, with $241 million being racked up in the past 24-hours - a 1,240% increase on the previous day, according to CoinmarketCap data.  The magnitude of the rally represents a shift in sentiment from three weeks ago when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went on the offensive against altcoins that it labelled securities.  With Bitcoin trading comfortably above $30,000 following a fortnight of stubborn price action below $26,000, traders are beginning to flock to lower liquidity trading pairs.  On Monday, Near Protocol's native token (NEAR) spiked by more than 20% after it signed a deal to use Alibaba's cloud services.  Arbitrum, meanwhile, has surged by 33.2% in the past 12-days as activity on the layer 2 blockchain continues to mount. Total value locked (TVL) on Arbitrum-based platforms like GMX and Radiant has increased by 12.5% and 9.3% in the past seven days, according to DefiLlama, as traders demonstrate an appetite to capture DeFi yields.

The recovery comes against the backdrop of a new investigative report that has been released by the now-collapsed cryptocurrency exchange. $7 Billion In Liquid Assets Recovered The FTX collapse was one of the most controversial developments in the cryptocurrency industry, having rocked the entire ecosystem. The exchange was once the blue-eyed boy of the industry but was eventually exposed as one of the biggest fraudulent operations in the industry when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year. However, there has been significant progress since then, with the new FTX management announcing the recovery of $7 billion in liquid assets, calling the development “substantial progress” in asset recovery. The new FTX management also published an investigative report, with the new CEO laying bare the reality of the exchange. The FTX Report According to the report, the Sam Bankman-Fried-led crypto conglomerate made several false statements to banks about accounts related to the use of trading firm Alameda Research’s accounts for customer transactions. This was after the banks in question raised several queries about Alameda Trading’s wire transfers and started rejecting them. The report documented a specific instance where a bank representative asked if an Alameda Research account that received customer deposits would be used to settle trades for the FTX exchange. In response, the report alleges that a senior FTX executive directed an Alameda employee to lie and state that customers occasionally end up confusing FTX and Alameda but that all incoming and outgoing wire transfers were used to settle Alameda trades. The report also alleged that FTX created a new entity called North Dimension Inc. which was falsely advertised as a crypto trading firm with an average monthly trading volume of $10 million and 2000 counterparties. However, in reality, North Dimension Inc. was a shell company that FTX utilized to receive customer deposits and fund withdrawals. When an attorney discovered this, the company ended up firing the attorney. John Ray III, the CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX entities, stated, “From the inception of the FTX.com exchange, the FTX Group commingled customer deposits and corporate funds and misused them with abandon at the direction and by the design of previous senior executives.” A Web Of Lies The complicated relationship between FTX and Alameda Research was the primary reason behind the unraveling of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led crypto empire. According to the report, the former CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, in private notes written in March 2022, estimated that FTX.com alone had a cash deficit of over $10 billion. According to Ray, the report is in line with the new management’s objective of greater transparency. He further added that FTX’s reputation as a customer-focused entity was a mirage, stating, “The release of this report furthers our stated objective of transparency. The image that the FTX group sought to portray as the customer-focused leader of the digital age was a mirage. We will continue to report our analysis and findings as our work progresses and remain committed to recovering as much value as possible for creditors.” Subsequent reports are expected to be released at regular intervals, with later reports bringing in further revelations about FTX and its day-to-day operations.

After feedback from several projects and the community, Binance had earlier revised its operations to comply with EU regulations and delist several privacy coins. Binance Goes Back On Initial Decision The European Union’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations triggered the move to delist privacy coins in the European markets. These new regulations called for increased transparency and information sharing when it came to cryptocurrency transfers and transactions. Binance stated in a press release issued on the 26th of June, “After carefully considering feedback from our community and several projects, we have revised how we classify privacy coins on our platform to comply with EU-wide regulatory requirements.” It also added that because Binance conducts operations as an exchange registered in several European Union jurisdictions, the exchange is obliged to follow local regulations. These require them to monitor transactions for the coins that are listed on the platform. The exchange had previously announced that it was shuttering trading services of 12 privacy-focused tokens. These included several well-known coins such as Dash, Monero, and Zcash, along with lesser-known ones such as SCRT and XVG. The move came in the face of growing regulatory pressure on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and would impact users based in France, Spain, Poland, and Italy. Delisting the tokens meant that users in these jurisdictions could not purchase these privacy tokens, dealing a significant blow to privacy coin enthusiasts. Binance had stated at the time, “While we aim to support as many quality projects as possible, we are required to follow local laws and regulations regarding the trading of privacy coins to ensure we can continue to serve as many users as we can. “As part of Binance’s ongoing compliance processes, we have reached out to affected users to notify them that they will no longer be able to purchase or trade privacy tokens on our platform after the 26th of June.” Binance is not the only exchange that has moved to delist privacy tokens. Several other prominent exchanges, such as Huobi, Kraken, and Bittrex, had already removed several popular privacy tokens, such as Dash and Monero, from their listings. Furthermore, several governments, such as those in Japan, South Korea, and Dubai, have taken a hawkish stance against privacy coins, with some even banning them outright. Projects Rush To Reassure Users According to email communications sent to users, several cryptocurrencies, such as XMR, MOB, BEAM, ZEN, and FIRO, are still subject to restrictions. However, with the ban retracted, several cryptocurrency projects took to Twitter to reassure their users that their projects would remain unaffected. Verge Currency had posted an update as early as the 22nd of June, stating, “We are pleased to inform you that $XVG will remain unaffected by @binance’s trading restrictions on #privacy coins in certain EU countries. Verge utilizes a public #blockchain with visible transactions, amounts, and wallet addresses.” The Secret Network also posted an update for its users, stating that it is not included among the currencies Binance planned to delist. “You spoke, and Binance listened! @binance will not be delisting $SCRT, along with six other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, in European countries.” The Current Regulatory Landscape Binance’s decision to reverse the delisting of privacy coins comes after receiving feedback from the crypto community and reviewing its operations to comply with regulatory requirements in the European Union. The initial move to delist the coins was the result of the European Union’s Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which was signed into law on the 31st of May. The regulation also includes a “travel rule” for transactions, requiring more transparency and information sharing. This clashed with the very nature of privacy coins, leading to several concerns when it came to compliance. However, the cryptocurrency industry has been welcoming of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulations, stating that it provides regulatory clarity for digital assets. Crypto payments service provider Ripple is one company that has expressed considerable appreciation for the clarity ushered in by the MiCA regulations. Furthermore, the European Securities and Markets Authority is also planning a MiCA consultation process, set to begin in July. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42420079,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmfN,1687851998,"Zimbabwe's Gold-Backed Digital Token Won't Fix the Country's Currency Woes, Economists Say","Zimbabwe’s gold-backed digital token is not going to stabilize the country’s local currency as the central bank hopes, two economists told CoinDesk.  On May 8, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe issued gold-backed digital tokens, which are a form of electronic money backed by the country's gold reserves. Gold-backed digital token investors will be able to hold and exchange their tokens in the first phase of the project, and in the next phase be able to trade and make payments, the RBZ said.  An official at the central bank told the local Sunday Mail in April that the RBZ was issuing this digital token to try and stabilize the Zimbabwean dollar, which dramatically collapsed in 2008 setting record inflation rates at the time as high as 79,600,000,000% per month.  Zimbabwe’s struggles with hyperinflation has since been making headlines. In 2009, inflation was so devastating that the country issued a new Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL), shedding twelve zeros from the earlier currency (ZWD). By November 2022, the annual consumer price inflation for a compressed basket of goods was at 107% in the country and in June, inflation rose to 175.8% following devaluations of the local currency. Researchers are not convinced that a digital token will solve the country’s currency woes.  “It's not the panacea to the challenges it’s wrestling,” Prosper Chitambara, senior research economist and policy advisor at Labour and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe (LEDRIZ) said.  The reason experts are skeptical of the gold-backed digital token’s prowess is because it may not be enough to stop money supply growth, which is the real problem at hand. A digital token, without strong macroeconomic policies in place, cannot reduce the amount of money circulating in the economy, Chitambara said.  The issue  In Zimbabwe, people can now use both the new Zimbabwean dollar and the U.S. dollar. However, for most locals like Chitambara, the “Zim” dollar can be seen as a “hot potato” – once people get their hands on it, they want to immediately exchange it for the less volatile U.S. dollar, he said.  Central bank officials in the country want the gold-backed digital currency to replace the need and demand for foreign currency.  “What we have noticed is that demand for foreign currency, apart from being driven by the need to import goods and services in Zimbabwe, is also viewed as a store of value,” RBZ Governor John Mangudya told the Sunday Mail in April. “It means anyone with the local currency would want to convert it to foreign currency.” And he added that there has been a limited supply lately in foreign currency.  In a situation of hyperinflation, like the one Zimbabwe is in, people are always going to “look for a store of value, something that is going to protect their purchasing power,” Paul said.  So the RBZ wants the gold-backed digital token to help address this demand for a store of value, Mangudya told the Sunday Mail.  Too many Zimbabwean dollars have been chasing U.S. dollars and this has caused the local currency to depreciate, Chitambara said. The idea is to introduce the gold-backed digital currency to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar and eliminate that exchange rate volatility, said Varun Paul, central bank digital currency and market infrastructure director at institutional crypto custody platform Fireblocks.  But a gold-backed digital token “in itself cannot be the solution,” Paul said.  Solutions  Paul and Chitambara say the gold-backed digital token may have some short-term benefits as it may offer investors a way to diversify their portfolios and perhaps even act as a store of value. But the token's slow uptake is already an indication that it's powerless to tackle hyperinflation all by itself.  When the gold-backed digital token was first issued, there was some interest in it. Only four days after issuance, the token had 135 applications worth around $12 million dollars at the time – 132 of those applications were from individuals or companies looking to convert their Zim dollars.  However, this did not stop the depreciation of the currency against the U.S. dollar. On May 8, when the gold-baked tokens were issued, $1 U.S. was worth 1,109 new Zim dollars, up from 949 a month earlier, according to Investing.com.  The demand for the token has since plummeted. According to the latest June figures from the central bank, there were only 35 new applications for the gold-backed currency at that time.  To truly help better the country's local currency dilemma, Zimbabwe has to put sound policies in place, Chitambara and Paul said.  “I don't think there's any substitution for really sound macroeconomic management,” Paul said.  Chitambara says the RBZ has implemented restrictive monetary policy, whereby central banks reduce the amount of money circulating in the economy by raising interest rates or hiking banks’ reserve requirements, while keeping its fiscal policy expansionary. That has meant public spending has continued to rise in Zimbabwe despite the bank’s attempts to control the money supply.  Zimbabwe’s gold-backed digital token is not going to help stabilize the local currency, because “the solution is to control the money supply growth,"" Chitambara said.  Last year, the RBZ announced it planned on doubling its spending but, as a countermeasure, the central bank also raised interest rates from 140% to 150% in June, which are considerably higher than many other countries.  Some economists have suggested that Zimbabwe should just scrap its local currency altogether – something the government doesn't want to do.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has held discussions with Zimbabwe about clearing its substantial debt with international financial institutions, is also uncertain about the effectiveness of the gold-backed digital token initiative.  “IMF staff would require more details and information about the design, implementation, and operation of RBZ’s gold-backed digital token initiative, and safeguard policies to ascertain the efficacy of the proposed measure,” the IMF said in response to a question about their thoughts on the gold-backed digital token.  As a solution to the country’s currency struggles, Chitambara said: “Don’t spend what you don’t have.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/27/zimbabwes-gold-backed-digital-token-wont-fix-the-countrys-currency-woes-economists-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1645330d63b3b3206921f49a2c110c385446a0be-4000x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The upgrade comes with several major enhancements intended to improve user experience and network performance. Despite these advancements, $XTZ, the blockchain's native token, saw no significant impact on its price. The Nairobi Upgrade: Boosting Transaction Throughput and Streamlining User Experience Collaboratively created by numerous teams including Nomadic Labs, Marigold, TriliTech, Oxhead Alpha, Tarides, DaiLambda, and Functori, the Nairobi upgrade introduces a range of mainnet improvements. A key highlight of these improvements is the increased transaction throughput which allows for faster processing of transactions and lower transaction fees. Following the upgrade, Tezos' throughput has skyrocketed by eight times, a boost applicable to various operations including transactions, smart contract calls, and Smart Rollup maintenance operations. Notably, with the Nairobi update, Tezos now offers support for Smart Rollup functions. The blockchain platform has introduced new functions and internal Layer-2 messages, enabling Tezos to seamlessly synchronize rollup kernels with future protocol upgrades. Additionally, for better understanding and communication, Tezos has improved its terminology. Enhancements for faster consensus have also been made, particularly through the increased speed of pre-attestation propagation. Tezos Ecosystem DAO: Streamlining On-Chain Funds Deployment The Nairobi upgrade coincided with the launch of the Tezos Ecosystem DAO, aimed at improving on-chain funds deployment and treasury management for vital initiatives within the Tezos ecosystem. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) enables community members to submit funding requests for Tezos-related initiatives which are then subjected to curation, voting, and the distribution of XTZ. Ensuring transparency and accountability, all DAO activities will be publicly visible. Initially, the DAO will be governed by a three-out-of-five multi-sig setup, with organizations such as Trilitech, the Tezos Foundation, and the Tezos India Foundation holding the keys. Despite these major advancements, the XTZ prices remain under pressure. As of June 26, XTZ is trading at $0.80, up 13% from the lows of June 2023. The current bearish trend, down 45% from February highs, persists even as the overall cryptocurrency market appears to be bottoming up. Looking Ahead The Nairobi upgrade marks a significant milestone in Tezos' journey, highlighting the blockchain platform's commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. By boosting transaction throughput, improving terminology, and launching the Tezos Ecosystem DAO, Tezos has not only improved its network's performance but also streamlined user experience. Despite the current XTZ price trends, these advancements pave the way for a promising future for the Tezos network. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42420069,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmSz,1687848410,EU Seals Deal on Crypto Bank-Capital Rules,"The European Union (EU) on Tuesday secured a political deal on new bank-capital legislation, including for cryptoassets, after lawmakers sought “prohibitive” rules to keep unbacked crypto out of the traditional financial system.  The deal was announced in a tweet from the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs committee, after a meeting among representatives of the European Parliament, national governments and the European Commission, which had first proposed the new rules back in 2021.  The political deal, which also introduces sweeping and controversial changes to how banks assess the risk of corporate and home loans, must now be voted on by member states in the EU’s Council and by lawmakers to become legislation, a process that can in practice take many months.  The new rules, which also adjust the risk weighting for banking assets such as corporate loans, ""boost the strength and resilience of banks operating in the Union,"" Swedish Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson, who chaired the talks on behalf of EU member states, said in a statement.  The Council statement also confirmed the deal includes a ""transitional prudential regime for crypto assets,"" without providing further details.  International standard-setters at the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are currently finalizing what a global crypto banking rulebook would look like – but details already out suggest they’ll take a tough line, assigning the maximum possible 1,250% risk weight to free-floating cryptocurrencies.  That would mean banks have to issue a euro of capital for each euro of bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) they hold, giving them little incentive to buy into the market. EU parliamentarians appear keen to see those measures take effect sooner rather than later.  Under a compromise privately proposed by the European Commission late during the talks, that strict stance would be somewhat softened for regulated stablecoins – which appears to have found favor among EU governments, who must also agree before the bill becomes law.

You have mature spot markets, well-regulated custody infrastructure, and good market surveillance,” he said during an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum. “Many of the past concerns are being addressed, suggesting that these kinds of products are more likely to be approved for general investor access.”  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications from blue-chip asset managers such as BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ).  Many believe that the creation of a market surveillance mechanism is the secret to getting these spot ETFs approved, much as regulators in Ontario wanted to see a mature custody ecosystem in place before approving the first bitcoin ETFs to trade in Toronto.  ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), a bitcoin futures fund, recorded the highest weekly inflow in over a year, with investors pouring in $65 million, CoinDesk recently reported, demonstrating that the asset class still has considerable interest from investors.

Basis trading is a strategy built around trading the difference between an asset's price on two separate markets, such as spot vs. futures, and can generate returns when executed properly. It typically requires both legs of the trade to be managed simultaneously, which can be cumbersome. OKX's Nitro Spreads automates this complex trade into one click, leveraging the platform's superior liquidity and low latency for maximum user benefit. Nitro Spreads is also one of the only basis trading tools in the crypto market in which the two legs of the trade are executed via a central orderbook, eliminating leg risk between markets. Before execution, traders can also select a guaranteed spread for a trade, mitigating unexpected price slippage. Trades are then matched and settled immediately. OKX Global Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai said: ""In the current complex market environment, institutions demand reliability, predictable returns and genuine innovation when choosing a trading venue. This is especially true in basis trading, where precision is paramount. Nitro Spreads raises the bar for the industry for efficient basis trading, and we invite institutional traders everywhere to see how it can enhance their strategies and contribute to their success."" A variety of basis trading strategies can be executed by institutional traders through Nitro Spreads' easy-to-use interface. Institutional traders can employ popular delta one spread strategies like calendar spreads, future rolls and funding rate farming - all in an orderbook format. The on-demand OKX Liquid Marketplace provides access to deep institutional liquidity and a number of crypto trading strategies, including futures spreads, large options block trades or spot OTC, to run at scale. In April, OKX announced that the Liquid Marketplace exceeded USD1 billion in trading volume during the first three months of 2023.

Basis trading refers to trading the difference between an asset’s price on two separate markets in an attempt to generate returns, for example, trading the difference of an asset on spot markets vs. futures markets. OKX’s Nitro Spread automates this kind of trade into one-click. Traders can apply this feature across any combination of spot, perpetual and futures contracts listed on the exchange, said the company.  ""In the current complex market environment, institutions demand reliability, predictable returns and genuine innovation when choosing a trading venue,” said Lennix Lai, global chief commercial officer at OKX. “This is especially true in basis trading, where precision and flawless execution are paramount,” he added.  Nitro Spread is one of the only basis trading tools in crypto where two legs of the trade are executed via a central order book, according to the press release. Before making the trade, traders can select a guaranteed spread, reducing price slippage.  “Traders can place resting orders with a fixed spread - they do not need to worry about immediate execution,” said Lai. “If the actual spread moves against their chosen spread, their orders will remain passive and not be executed.”  “Spread order book prices are generally more stable than outright books as the instruments are delta neutral,” he continued. “We are working with a variety of liquidity providers to ensure that our users can trade effectively and take advantage of spreads.”  Traders can also execute popular delta one spread strategies like calendar spreads, future rolls and funding rate farming, all in order book format, said the press release.

14240623,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/hsbc-hong-kong-expands-support-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs,1687845600,HSBC Hong Kong Expands Support For Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs,"HSBC Hong Kong, a subsidiary of one of the world's largest banking and financial services organizations, has recently added support for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). This move expands access to digital asset derivatives in the flourishing Asian crypto hub. Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs, believes that ETFs deliver ""simplicity and convenience"" for newcomers to the crypto space. Broader Exposure to Digital Assets As of Monday, HSBC Hong Kong customers are now able to trade ETFs that offer exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures based on derivative contracts listed on commodity exchanges. These ETFs, treated as securities, were listed on HSBC Hong Kong's mobile app ""Easy Invest."" HSBC Hong Kong has confirmed to Decrypt that the specific offerings are CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF. The news was initially reported by Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu, who underscored that HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, is the first lender in the region to grant its customers access to digital asset ETFs. According to Jeff Feng, including ETFs on its investment platform provides HSBC Hong Kong investors with access to derivatives, which they might otherwise seek on unregulated exchanges. This new offering represents a clear opportunity for the bank to take the lead and fulfill a clearly identified customer need. The CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF and CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF are managed by CSOP Asset Management. This firm listed the two products on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December of last year, marking the first time ETFs in Asia had tracked digital asset futures. Both ETFs invest in futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), providing a straightforward way for investors to participate in the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Safer Path Through Regulatory Scrutiny Despite the strong demand for spot access to crypto among retail investors in Hong Kong, Feng noted that the demand for derivatives is equally high, if not higher. ETFs offer companies a way to provide crypto exposure without exposing themselves to regulatory risk in a rapidly evolving industry. Hong Kong's financial authorities have recently signaled a shift toward a more open stance on cryptocurrencies. The regulatory scrutiny around centralized exchanges has led to caution in launching new platforms. ""If all of the centralized exchanges are getting this much regulatory scrutiny, it wouldn't be too wise to go out and try to launch another,"" Feng stated. ""It's much safer to do what's already been proven. There's a clear playbook."" In the United States, futures ETFs related to the performance of digital assets have become more common. Despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) not yet approving a spot-based Bitcoin ETF, ProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF was launched on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021. ""When you have simplicity, what you eventually will get is volume,” he said. ""People will eventually speculate because it’s just so easy,"" Feng said. According to Feng, the ""simplicity and convenience"" offered by ETFs make them an attractive option for retail traders, particularly compared to other derivatives like options, which require an understanding of more complex concepts.

This significant rise ranks the cryptocurrency as one of the year’s best-performing assets. Over the past week, the INJ token has been on an upward trend, adding more than 26% to its value. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Soars 10% In The Last Week, More Rallies Ahead? Injective Price Records Daily 8% Gain – Price Action INJ, the native token of the Injective ecosystem, has maintained its recent bullish momentum, registering an 8.3% increase in the last 24 hours. As of this writing, the token is valued at $7.53, according to data from CoinGecko. However, a broader look at the market reveals that the Injective price has been range-bound for the past few weeks. Since reaching a yearly peak of $9.32, the INJ price has moved mostly sideways, albeit 19.2% from its 2023 high. With the choppy market condition, it is quite difficult to determine which overall trend is forming. The on-chain indicators seem quite indecisive at the moment. The token rebounds at the $6 price point, acting as a support zone. INJUSD trading at $7.513 | Source: INJUSD chart from TradingView The INJ token boasts a market capitalization of nearly $600 million, ranking it the 73rd biggest cryptocurrency. Additionally, the coin has a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $75 million, representing an increase of 131.2% in the past day. According to the price prediction site CoinCodex, the general sentiment surrounding INJ is currently bullish. The team expects this token to maintain its bullish run and gain a further 13.08% in the next five days to trade at $8.59. In addition, CoinCodex makes a bold prediction of INJ reaching a market price of $16.72 in the next 30 days, indicating a plausible 126.25% price on the token’s current price. Injective Protocol Continues To Make Positive Waves The decentralized Injective protocol has been on an ascent since the start of 2023, evolving in innovation and adoption. These developments have been crucial to the positive sentiment surrounding its token (INJ), contributing to its price growth and the enhanced activity on the Injective blockchain. On June 23, Injective announced that it had reached its network’s 240 million transaction mark. This is perhaps the most significant evidence of the decentralized blockchain’s growing popularity. Another of Injective’s recent developments is the Open Liquidity Program (OLP), which launched on the 13th of June. This program allows Injective users to provide liquidity on the protocol’s on-chain orderbook infrastructure while earning INJ rewards. Eligible participants can earn 60,000 INJ tokens within 28 days.

This move signifies the third wave of job cuts the company has undertaken in just over a year, reflecting its ongoing adjustments to fluctuating market conditions. Aligning to Volumes and Team Structures As per an internal message obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Robinhood CFO, Jason Warnick, stated that the layoffs were part of a plan to ""adjust to volumes and to better align team structures."" The company's spokesperson has not issued any statement to confirm or deny the layoffs, but asserted that the firm continually strives for ""operational excellence."" The representative's statement read: ""We’re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload, org design, and more."" Possible Reaction to Recent Acquisition and Decreasing Margins News of the layoffs follows shortly after Robinhood's acquisition of credit card company X1 for $95 million, which took place just five days prior. It's worth noting that the company had already conducted two rounds of significant job cuts in 2022, reducing its total headcount by 9% in April and by a further 23% in August. The move was seen as a response to dwindling trading activity and decreased prices of equities and cryptocurrencies, both of which considerably squeezed the firm's profit margins. Together, these layoffs accounted for a loss of more than 1,000 staff members. Three weeks ago, the firm mulled the delisting of a number of tokens due to an SEC citation. It later went on to delist Solana, Cardano, and Polygon. Dwindling User Base and Revenue Decline At its peak in Q2 2021, Robinhood boasted a user base of 21.3 million active users, generating more than $565 million in revenue. However, recent financial figures paint a less rosy picture. The firm's Q1 2023 results indicated a stark 44% decline in monthly active users and a 30% year-over-year decrease in revenue. Despite the turbulence, Robinhood shares have seen some positivity, trading at $9.63 per share, representing an 18% increase year-to-date. However, this is significantly down from its August 2021 all-time-high, having fallen more than 82% since then. The latest layoffs at Robinhood underline the shifting dynamics in the financial technology sector, illustrating the necessity for firms to adapt rapidly to the ever-changing market environment.

In a release, the 14th network improvement went live at block #3,760,129, tagging along platform enhancement and the simultaneous unveiling of the Tezos Ecosystem DAO. Even so, while the upgrade is bullish for network users, there was no significant impact on XTZ prices. As of writing, XTZ, the native currency of the Tezos network, has been lower in the past 24 hours and is yet to reverse June 2023 losses. The Nairobi Upgrade The Nairobi upgrade was the network’s 14th update and a collaborative effort by numerous teams and has introduced several mainnet enhancements that could improve user experience. Teams include Nomadic Labs, Marigold, TriliTech, Oxhead Alpha, Tarides, DaiLambda, and Functori. Key improvements tagged by the Nairobi upgrade include enhanced transaction throughput meaning transactions can now be processed faster, and transaction fees will be lower. With this release, the Tezos protocol is faster, as its throughput has increased eight times. This improvement applies to various operations such as transactions, smart contract calls, Smart Rollup maintenance operations, and management operations. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Soars 10% In The Last Week, More Rallies Ahead? Moreover, the blockchain now also supports Smart Rollup functions. With new functions and internal Layer-2 messages, Tezos can synchronize rollup kernels seamlessly with future Tezos protocol upgrades. Specifically, the blockchain has also improved its terminology for better communication and understanding. For faster consensus, the upgrade enhances the speed of pre-attestation propagation. Tezos Ecosystem DAO The Tezos community welcomes the Tezos ecosystem DAO to streamline on-chain funds deployment and treasury management for vital initiatives within the Tezos ecosystem. With its launch, the decentralized automated organization (DAO) allows community members to submit funding requests for Tezos-related initiatives. These requests undergo curation, voting, and distributing XTZ. The DAO will be transparent, ensuring all activities are publicly visible to enhance trust and accountability within the community. Related Reading: Kaspa (KAS) Takes Altcoin Market By Storm With 60% Growth Initially, the DAO is governed by a three-out-of-five multi-sig setup, with participating organizations like Trilitech, Tezos Foundation, and Tezos India Foundation holding the keys.

However, even with optimistic traders, XTZ bulls have failed to push prices above $0.95, marking June 2023 highs. Overall, the cryptocurrency market appears to be bottoming up but is yet to close above crucial liquidation levels marking complete reversals from 2022 pits.

This move comes as the latest in a series of legal repercussions following the collapse of Terraform Labs' crypto project in May 2022. The confiscated crypto assets, previously held at the Zurich-based Sygnum Bank, belonged to Do Kwon and Han Chang-joon, former CEO and CFO of Terraform Labs, respectively, according to the news outlet Digital Asset. Swiss authorities executed this action in response to a request from the New York Federal Prosecutor’s Office and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, the amount seized—$26 million—doubles Bloomberg's prior reports, which suggested that Kwon stored $13 million in Sygnum Bank. This disclosure from June 8 also noted that Kwon had moved an additional $29 million of cryptocurrency outside of the Swiss account. The seizure comes as authorities in the U.S. and South Korea continue to seek separate charges against Kwon and his associates following the spectacular failure of Terraform Labs and its various projects. The Collapse of Terraform Labs and Kwon's Troubles Terraform Labs and its algorithmic stablecoin project, Terra-Luna, collapsed in May 2022, erasing $40 billion in market cap and sending ripples through the broader crypto market. South Korean authorities subsequently charged Kwon in September 2022 for violating its Capital Markets Act and issued a warrant for his arrest. Shortly after, the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) issued a red notice for Kwon, a South Korean national. The notice is essentially an international arrest warrant, instructing law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and detain him on charges of fraud. U.S. Federal prosecutors also indicted Kwon with multiple counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy. Both South Korea and the U.S. are currently seeking Kwon's extradition. Kwon and his associate Han Chang-Joon were sentenced to four months in jail by a Montenegro district court for forging travel documents. The co-founder of Terraform Labs was arrested in March in Podgorica, the Montenegro capital, while attempting to travel to Dubai with a forged passport. Despite being released on bail in June, the duo has remained in custody, with their detention time to be included in the four-month sentence. Notably, Kwon and his associates reportedly fled multiple countries in 2022 after Terraform Labs' project failure. As investigations continue and more assets are seized, the full scope of the fallout from Terraform Labs' implosion becomes clearer. What remains to be seen is how the pursuit of justice will continue in this complex, cross-border case involving crypto-assets and high-profile individuals.

14235076,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539802,1687831215,Optimism Bedrock Upgrade Sends Network Transactions Soaring By 67%,"Optimism (OP) is a layer 2 scaling solution that operates on top of the Ethereum mainnet, providing faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum users. It was launched in 2020 and has quickly become one of the most popular scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. On June 6, Optimism released its much-anticipated Bedrock upgrade, which promised to improve the network’s transaction speed and reduce gas fees. Related Reading: Ripple Emails Reveal: XRP Buybacks Were On The Table To Prop Up Price Optimism Upgrade Delivers On Promises The upgrade has since delivered on its promises, with daily transactions on the network increasing by about 67% to around 500,000 transactions, and gas fees reduced by approximately 50% to around $50,000. According to Nansen, a leading blockchain data analytics platform, the Bedrock upgrade has been a significant milestone for Optimism. The increased transaction speed and reduced gas fees have made the network more efficient and cost-effective, attracting more users to the platform. Furthermore, the Bedrock upgrade by Optimism has brought significant improvements to the protocol, enhancing the network’s performance and user experience. One of the most notable improvements is the enhanced transaction throughput, which has significantly increased the number of transactions processed per second. This has substantially increased daily transactions on the network, enabling users to execute transactions quickly and efficiently. In addition, the upgrade has also introduced lower gas fees on the Optimism network, reducing the cost of transactions for users, which is especially beneficial for those previously deterred by high gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet, making the network more cost-effective and accessible for all users. The Bedrock upgrade has also introduced several improvements to the developer experience on the network, including better documentation and tooling, making it easier for developers to build and deploy applications on the Optimism network, driving innovation and growth in the platform. Moreover, the Bedrock upgrade has also increased the network’s decentralization, making it more resilient to attacks and more secure overall. This has boosted user confidence in the network and attracted more users to the platform. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Soars 10% In The Last Week, More Rallies Ahead? Overall, the Bedrock upgrade has significantly improved the Optimism network, delivering enhanced transaction throughput, lower gas fees, improved developer experience, and increased decentralization. These improvements have cemented Optimism’s position as a leading Ethereum layer 2 solutions and are set to drive the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Ethereum network. As of the time of writing, OP’s expectations for further recovery and bullish momentum have diminished. Currently, OP is trading at $1,286, and it has been on a minor downtrend since it encountered its nearest resistance wall at the $1,508 level, which it lost in March 2023. As seen in the chart above, the daily chart of OP’s Average Directional Index (ADX) shows a significant decline, indicating the loss of its bullish momentum and the entry of a new downtrend test. Despite this, OP investors are depending on the $1.087 support floor in case of further drops to surpass its yearly high of $3,323, which it reached on February 24th.

Shaun Fernando, Chief Risk Officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk in a note that bitcoin’s ‘max pain’ point, or a part of the market when option holders will experience the most financial loss, while option sellers can be the ones who profit the most, is currently at $26K, which should alleviate some of the downward pricing pressure after the coming options expiry.  “With an impressive open interest of over $350 million at the 30k strike, the approaching quarterly expiration promises an exhilarating conclusion, carrying the potential for price turbulence amidst diverse gamma hedging strategies,” Fernando said.  Fernando noted that ether has witnessed substantial institutional selling activity, but its implied volatility remains lower than bitcoin.  Until then, all eyes are on Friday when the quarterly options expire.

And for the most part, they are right.  Over the weekend, 8btc, one of China’s first crypto publications, announced it was abandoning the field entirely and pivoting to primarily covering AI and the metaverse.  Venture Capitalists, seemingly bored of blockchain and crypto, have found a new interest in AI. PitchBook data shows that venture capital funding for crypto is down 80% in the first quarter of 2023, from $12.3 billion to $2.4 billion. PitchBook’s data also shows that AI startups raised $1.6 billion this quarter, and another $10 billion in deals have been announced but have yet to close.  For all the hype the AI bulls have for the technology, after putting it through its paces, AI is still somewhere between the peak of inflated expectations and trough of disillusionment on a hype cycle. Its slow, expensive, and 15-20% of what comes out of ChatGPT’s artificial mouth is a hallucination.  Certainly, there are some similarities between the hype cycles of AI and enterprise blockchain.  Enterprise blockchain was supposed to unlock billions in value through efficiencies, but those that tried to implement it weren’t all that impressed, so much so that IBM dismantled most of its blockchain team because of low revenue, and Microsoft phased out its Azure-based blockchain cloud services.  Even at the height of blockchain mania, the prelude to the Covid bull market, there wasn’t the same fervor as there is with AI. One would think that given the disappointment of the enterprise blockchain bubble bursting, stakeholders would have learned their lesson about enthusiastically embracing new technology.

14232259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539785,1687824026,"Crypto Investment Inflows Reach One-Year High, Reveals CoinShares","Crypto investment products are once again proving their market allure, with inflows hitting their highest level since July 2022. European asset management firm, CoinShares, noted an influx of $199 million just last week, signaling revived interest from investors in the crypto space. The surge is seen as a correction, compensating for almost half of the outflows observed in the preceding 9 weeks. CoinShares attributed the surge to recent filings for physically backed ETFs from high-profile issuers. Particularly, the crypto market is evidently witnessing a rebirth of enthusiasm as global asset management giants, such as BlackRock, file for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Takes The Lion’s Share In this wave of increased inflows, Bitcoin emerged as the undisputed front-runner. Bitcoin-centric investment products saw inflows of $188 million last week, according to CoinShares. On the other hand, short-bitcoin continued its trend of nine consecutive weeks of outflows, reaching $4.9 million. These contrasting trends are a testament to Bitcoin’s persistent allure amid market fluctuations. Ethereum also registered inflows, albeit at a comparatively lesser scale of $7.8 million. CoinShares’ data implies a currently subdued investor appetite for Ethereum as compared to Bitcoin. Notably, despite the Bitcoin and Ethereum domination, there’s a visible, albeit “very minor”, flow towards alternative cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Solana. This points to a diverse market interest, even if it doesn’t match the scale of the major cryptos. The improved market sentiment is also persuading investors towards multi-asset investment ETPs. These ETPs saw an inflow of $8 million last week, which further emphasizes the ongoing diversification of investor interests in the crypto asset class. Record High For Crypto Assets Under Management With the increased inflows, the total assets under management (AUM) across fund managers have now also reached $37 billion. This is the highest level noted since before the collapse of Three Arrows Capital. It underscores not just the resilience of the crypto market, but also the continued faith that investors place in it. It is worth noting that alongside the surge in crypto investment inflows, the crypto market particularly large crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has seen a rebound from its losses amid the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. In the past day, Bitcoin experienced a slight dip of 0.6%, but its trading price continues to hover above the recently regained $30,000 benchmark. The past week has seen an addition of over $70 billion to Bitcoin’s market cap, boosting it from a low of $514 billion the previous Monday to exceed $580 billion today. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been on the fence in the last 24 hours with no significant movement. The second-largest asset by market cap currently has a daily trading volume above $8 billion and a market cap of $226 billion.
