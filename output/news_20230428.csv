12177265,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529046,1682722843,"Ripple’s Q1 Report Shows That Investors Are Still Bullish On XRP, Here’s Why","Ripple is a cryptocurrency firm that has been on the radar of United States regulators for years and its native token XRP has suffered greatly for it. However, despite the legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple has not backed down and it looks like investors are increasingly bullish on the cryptocurrency. Ripple’s Q1 Report Exceeds Expectations In a Q1 report that was posted by Ripple titled ‘Q1 2023 XRP Markets Report’, there has been tremendous growth for the firm in the first three months of 2023. The first thing that stands out from this report is that Ripple has been experiencing rapid adoption during this time period. Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop At a time when other cryptocurrencies were seeing a decline in new users and adoption, the crypto firm reports that over 114,000 new wallets were added in the first quarter of 2023. Furthermore, the number of transactions for this time period also crossed 116 million. The decentralized exchange (DEX) volume for XRP also grew to over $114.5 million compared to the $85.7 million figure recorded in Q4 of 2022. However, transaction fees were higher compared to the previous quarter and its price did not perform as well, closing at an average price of $0.40 compared to $0.42 for Q4 2022. Ripple sees impressive growth in Q1 2023 | Source: ripple.com This rise in transaction fees, as well as the increased number of transactions, saw the total XRP burned for transaction fees reach 140,993 for Q1 2023 compared to 101,968 XRP for Q4 2022. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) contributed greatly to this volume as the report notes that over 1.2 million NFTs have been minted since XLS-20 went live on mainnet. Thus, Ripple has emerged as a Top 10 chain for NFT trading volume as well. Community Turns Bullish On XRP The expectations of the XRP community have returned to bullish territory given the numbers published in the quarterly report. It has instilled a sense of confidence given that it shows rapid adoption for Ripple despite its troubles over the years. XRP price trending at $0.47 | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com XRP’s price has also responded positively with a 2.34% gain in the last 24 hours, data from Coinmarketcap shows. Its trading volume also saw a similar uptrend, rising 2.31% on the day to reach$1.67 billion at the time of this writing.

42420639,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqTVd,1682722328,Edward Snowden: Researchers Should Train AI to Be ‘Better Than Us’,"AUSTIN, Texas — Artificial Intelligence (AI) models might soon surpass humans’ capabilities, but only if we stop teaching them to think like us and allow them to “be better than us,” Freedom of the Press Foundation President Edward Snowden said at Consensus 2023.  The former National Security Agency whistleblower, who joined the conference virtually from Russia, shared his cautiously optimistic views on the future of AI, the technology that exploded into the mainstream after OpenAI’s ChatGPT rollout last fall. While Snowden at times echoed some experts’ warnings that AI technologies might empower bad actors, he also considered positive use cases for the emerging technology.  Snowden argued AI models could obstruct government surveillance rather than fuel invasive intelligence programs.  ""Maybe they could stop spying on the public and start spying for the public,” Snowden said. “That'd be a net good.""  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  However, he also warned that the launch of ChatGPT and other increasingly sophisticated AI models, could fuel big tech and government-driven initiatives to encroach upon users’ privacy.  In order to prevent bad actors from co-opting AI technologies, people must fight for open AI models to remain open, Snowden told CoinDesk.  “People are going to be raising the red flag of 'software communism,' where we need to declare the models must be open,” Snowden said.  He aimed his criticism specifically at emerging AI models that are becoming less and less open, calling out OpenAI specifically.  ""It's a poor joke, right? They refused to provide public access to their trading data, their models, the weights and so on – but they're a leader in the space. They're being rewarded. They're being rewarded for antisocial behavior.""  How the technology is used, he argued, boils down to how researchers train AI engines. Much AI training currently entails spoon-feeding the AI large amounts of online content, including social media comments, which Snowden says is not ideal.  ​​”They're training [AI models] on Reddit threads,” Snowden said. “It's like the internet equivalent of YouTube comments. But you want to create something decent, good, that's creative and useful.”  Current training methods, he also observed, revolve around teaching AI models to “think like us,” which could limit the technology’s potential to better humanity.  “As with children, we don't need machines to be like us,” Snowden said. “We need them to be better than us. And if they aren't better than us, we did a terrible job.”  Read more: What’s the Relationship Between Crypto and AI?

42420634,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqTRV,1682721146,U.S. House Will Have Crypto Bill in 2 Months: Rep. McHenry,"AUSTIN, Texas — The U.S. House Financial Services Committee and House Agriculture Committee will put together legislation to oversee the crypto sector in the ""next two months"" after holding joint public hearings starting in May, said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R–N.C.), chair of the House Financial Services Committee.  When asked whether such a bill could be signed by President Joe Biden in the next 12 months, McHenry told a crowd at CoinDesk's Consensus 2023 event, ""yes."" The key lawmaker was quick to provide a rider that it's always a challenge to legislate something new into existence.  ""What we plan to do over the next two months is report a deal out,"" McHenry said. He added that the bill will address both securities and commodities regimes and issues that are hard to fix on either side.  Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), the other panelist during the session, said she looked forward to coordinating those efforts with McHenry, adding that the House of Representatives had a better chance than the Senate at getting legislation through earlier. She said if the House moves first on crypto, it would ""improve our chances"" in the Senate.  ""We have tried to keep partisan tinge off this subject,"" Lummis said. ""This is a bipartisan subject we need to address before the 2024 election.""  The U.S. Congress has so far been unable to get comprehensive legislation on crypto passed despite a number of bills making progress on Capitol Hill last year.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  But this month Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee took a swing at finding bipartisanship support for a second effort at stablecoin legislation, though bipartisan support remains uncertain. Republicans introduced a discussion draft that may mark a new starting point for negotiations with Democrats.  Lummis, who has been dubbed the Senate’s “Crypto Queen,” had introduced the bipartisan “Responsible Financial Innovation Act,” aimed at creating a regulatory framework for the industry, last year with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).  Lummis told the crowd at Consensus that a new and improved version of the bill will be unveiled in six to eight weeks.  ""We are probably going to have a stronger section on national security. You will see a stronger cybercrime aspect to our bill,"" Lummis said.  A bipartisan bill introduced in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on Thursday calls for the federal government to study crypto use cases for illegal activity, including studying how terrorists or other criminals might use cryptocurrencies.  Last week, McHenry's committee grilled U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler over his refusal to say whether ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is a security.  ""Congress needs to provide sufficient guidance there,"" said Lummis. ""I anticipate we will still be using the Howey Test"" in the most modern way expressed by U.S. courts.  While the deadlock in Congress between Republicans and Democrats continues, lawmakers have been facing increasing pressure to legislate the industry after the meltdown of the FTX crypto exchange and the more recent collapse in crypto banking.  McHenry also said that crypto's recent role in the U.S. banking crisis, which has left the industry's banking relationships strained, is fair to call ""Operation Choke Point 2.0.""  “We have to fix this problem, we have to provide certainty that you can bank in a safe and sound manner,"" he said. ""This is a great example of why Congress must legislate and provide clarity.”  Meanwhile, jurisdictions such as the European Union have approved the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law, making it the first major jurisdiction in the world to introduce a comprehensive crypto law. The EU’s agreement puts the bloc in the lead on Web3 technology, McHenry told CoinDesk earlier.  ""Several jurisdictions are ahead of us,"" Lummis said, mentioning MiCA and other efforts. ""We are falling way behind. These countries are telling us to catch up.""  Regulators in Japan and the United Arab Emirates have also moved toward regulating the space while Hong Kong and the UK are revisiting how they approach crypto.

Yeah, those days feel like ancient history, even though they were less than a decade ago.  Samir Tabar is the CEO of Bit Digital.  Everything is harder about bitcoin mining today, from overhead cost to competition to the looming scrutiny of lawmakers and ire of climate activists. But there are still good days ahead if the industry revolutionizing finance can adapt to a new environment. These days call for a different kind of bitcoin mining business and a different kind of business leader. Everyone in the industry has a handful of months to decide if they’re up for the challenges of mining in a very different reality, and we all have a role in future-proofing bitcoin mining.  The Halving is an endogenous challenge  ""Halving” will cut the amount of bitcoin that can be mined from roughly 900 per day to 450, making the asset even scarcer while providing a deflationary measure to bolster it as a store of value. Bitcoin investors own bitcoin because they believe it will rise in value, and next year’s halving event – if history is any indication – may very well deliver this. In the past, bitcoin has rallied the year ahead of halvings; bitcoin rose by 19% in the 12 months leading up to its last halving on May 11, 2020, while the halving before that in 2016 saw a 142% increase.  Even a year out, bitcoin seems to be pricing in this next quadrennial event, rising roughly 25% since the beginning of March. Bitcoin hasn’t completely decoupled from traditional financial markets to the extent many in the space have hoped, and its current rally could just mirror passing relief in the stock market as war and inflation remain risks. Still, it’s nice to have a reprieve from all the post-FTX carnage fueled by the U.S. Federal Reserve aggressively hiking interest rates.  This same halving event that will likely increase bitcoin’s value will also decrease the profitability of mining. Fewer minable bitcoin means less profit. Rising costs of running operations create a bottom-line challenge, squeezing miners on both ends. Even sitting atop considerable bitcoin reserves, with a higher post-rally price and new underlying support levels for the asset, mining companies must prepare for a lower margin environment with reduced cash flow. This will make the miners who have run good, lean businesses with clean balance sheets and break miners who have only optimized for short-term gains.  Bitcoin’s price plummet in the second half of 2022 caused a cascade of bankruptcies of companies that took on too much debt and pursued high-priced growth, and a similar dynamic is likely on the horizon.

Not only should asset creators have strong balance sheets, they must also resist the temptation to over-expand and take on unnecessary risk. Given how quickly market conditions can change with broader economic uncertainty and the fluid regulatory environment, it is important to remain conservative. Miners must build not for the peak of the cycle but for the middle, providing enough flexibility to thrive in the upcycles and comfortably survive downcycles.  Bitcoin miners can also take inspiration from rapid innovation happening across Web3 and identify ways to diversify revenue beyond pure mining. With toxic maximalism behind us, the Ethereum network presents a number of opportunities, including the flywheel model, wherein Bitcoin block rewards earned from mining can be converted into ether [ETH] and staked for rewards. Rather than simplistically regarding them as competitors, Bitcoin and Ethereum can work together to establish a future where prosperity is less reliant on cycles and regulatory whims.  By hedging our possibilities, remaining lean and nimble, and diversifying our revenue streams, miners will adapt to the next iteration of crypto and further establish ourselves as a crucial pillar of the crypto community.

Maisel recently launched Mythos Studios, which minted the Ekos Genesis Art Collection earlier this month. The project features original art from the late comic book artist Michael Turner and Peter Steigerwald, who are known for their work across Marvel and DC comics.  “I think there's so much noise that we have,"" he said. ""In our lives there are so many pulls on our time, so many distractions, that for something new to break through ... there needs to be a visual identity to it and a primal feeling from it. And art does that for me.""  In Maisel’s opinion, part of the joy of Web3 and digital art is the ability for it to be shared.  “You don't have to just go to the museum or go to somebody's home,” Maisel said. ""I hope this shows a vote of confidence from someone who hasn't been in the space. I really want to share this art and the possibilities around it.""  While the non-fungible token (NFT) market has been turbulent during the last six months, Maisel said there’s still an underlying value in art that goes beyond prices.  ""The question 'why' comes from the same seed that was in me for Marvel,"" Maisel said. ""I don't think I could do [Web3] if I didn't have that same passion.""

12175893,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529106,1682719254,XRP May Rally Over 10% Upon Breaching Two Critical Levels,"Recently, XRP has been facing significant rejection at its overhead resistance level, including a rejection that occurred just a week ago. On the daily chart, XRP has shown a slight upward movement of 3%. However, over the past week, this altcoin has not made much progress as its price has decreased by 0.4%. This indicates that the XRP price is indecisive over longer time frames. The technical outlook for XRP suggests that the market is bearish. There is a low demand for the altcoin, and accumulation remained less too. However, if XRP manages to move above its overhead resistance, this could trigger a recovery. Related Reading: How Soon Will Litecoin Breach This Psychological Resistance Level? Currently, the BTC price is hovering below the $30,000 mark, and most altcoins have followed a similar trend. If BTC breaks through the $30,000 mark, XRP could attempt to move upwards. At its current level, the altcoin is at a crucial point, as an increase in demand could cause a rally, while a decrease in price could result in a loss of up to 16% of its value. Furthermore, the market capitalization of XRP has decreased, indicating an increase in the number of sellers. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart The altcoin was trading for $0.47 at the time of writing. It is trading underneath its overhead resistance of $0.48. The aforementioned resistance mark is crucial as it has served as a price ceiling previously. A break above the $0,.48 mark can push XRP to $0.50, which might act as another ceiling before the altcoin targets $0.53. A move to $0.53 means over a 10% rally. On the flip side, a fall from the current price level will drag XRP to $0.44 and then to $0.40, thereby bringing bearish influence back. The amount of altcoin traded in the last session was red, indicating a fall in demand. Technical Analysis Since the altcoin dropped below the $0.50 level, demand for the altcoin has failed to recover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that selling strength outweighs buying strength, as the RSI is below the half-line. Additionally, the altcoin remains below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which signifies that sellers have control and are driving the price momentum in the market. However, if demand for XRP increases slightly, it could push the coin above the 20-SMA line. This would signal a return of bullish strength on the chart. In line with other indicators, the altcoin is displaying sell signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which indicates price momentum, has formed red histograms, signalling to sell.

42420635,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqTSX,1682719042,5 Consensus 2023 Takeaways,"Today is the last day of CoinDesk’s yearly Consensus conference and it has been exciting to hear all the fascinating discussions that have arisen from the many speakers and panels at the event.  Members of our CoinDesk editorial team got together on Twitter Spaces today to assess the big picture at Consensus 2023 and share their takeaways on the critical issues that will shape how the industry continues to unfold.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Nick Baker, CoinDesk deputy editor-in-chief  Being a Consensus newbie this year, I am like a small-town yokel blown away by how big and impressive this event has been. Here are a couple of my takeaways:  One, the level of optimism people have about crypto is very high, which is a surprise given just how bad the regulatory outlook is. And I know it's partly self-selection bias at work: People who are going to pay a lot of money to attend this event are going to be optimistic about the space. Still, that juxtaposition of existential questions and lots of optimism is striking to me.  Two, the people I know best are from traditional finance and they, too, remain quite high on the future of crypto and moving TradFi stuff to crypto or crypto-adjacent infrastructure. Now, of course, they’ve been trying for years to show progress along those lines and have little to show for it. But they’re undeterred. This point rhymes with my first point.  Ben Schiller, head of Consensus Magazine  Something that really struck me arose from what Kate Brady, head of communications for Web3 at PepsiCo, said on stage. As you know, PepsiCo is a very mainstream American brand. It's not part of the crypto industry by any means, but it’s looking to get into Web3. And one of the things she said on stage was that she was being stymied in her work and PepsiCo has been stymied in its work by the lack of regulatory clarity, and I thought that was interesting because obviously this is something the industry says a lot that we need to do. There are guidelines from Washington, D.C., from lawmakers and from policymakers. And we think that that conversation or that that issue only affects people in the relatively small world of crypto.  But it really came home to me that actually this regulatory conversation affects all of corporate America, all of anyone who wants to develop in Web3, across the United States. And that's a pretty broad based group of people. So, if somebody from a company like PepsiCo is worried about crypto policy, then it's something that we as an industry, or we as a country, should really be focused on more. If they're saying it, it's something really important for everybody.  Additionally, what's evident is that the lack of policymaking and predictable enforcement in D.C. is a wider threat to the U.S. than we might think. It’s a concern for American competitiveness at large and, at this point, it’s really unforgivable. Europe and much of Asia now have relatively clear frameworks – and in what is supposedly a major hub for blockchain industry, we still don’t. That affects an increasingly large number of people and organizations.  Nikhilesh De, CoinDesk managing editor for global policy and regulation  What's really fascinating to me about the regulatory conversation is we're seeing these discussions happen in parallel with ongoing work in Congress and other jurisdictions, lending a bit more urgency to this week's talks. It has been a very busy week.  Over the last couple days, we've seen Congress introduce a bill to assess how crypto might be used for criminal and other terrorist activities. We've seen multiple hearings addressing cryptocurrencies held at the same time as Consensus – no relation, just at the same time as our panel on various policy issues.  Just this morning the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Government Accountability Office and the New York Department of Financial Services all published reports explaining what they see as the root causes for the failures of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.  We're watching the regulation unfold, even as we hold this conference, talking about the same policy issues that are playing out in real time.It's still debatable whether we'll see any resolutions on legislation or rulemaking but we're seeing progress, and that ain't nothing.  Amitoj Singh, CoinDesk regulatory reporter  My takeaway is on how non-U.S. regulators are thinking about crypto while the U.S. remains in a deadlock both in Congress and among regulators (Commodities Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission). Other major economies won’t frame it in a way in which it sounds like they want to take advantage of the U.S. deadlock. But with the likes of Coinbase threatening to go off-shore, that’s exactly what these non-U.S. jurisdictions are ready for.  The question is when the U.S. does come up with its own regulatory framework, will other jurisdictions adjust their rules in order to have globally coordinated rules that the G-20 nations have said are imperative for successfully overseeing this space?  Cheyenne Ligon, CoinDesk regulatory reporter  The session hosted by Jesse Hamilton on the turf war between the CFTC and the SEC was really interesting. Unsurprisingly, the two former regulators – one from the SEC, one from the CFTC – disagreed about the path forward for finding regulatory clarity for crypto. Brian Quintenz, former CFTC commissioner, called on Congress to legislate the issue, but former SEC lawyer Dan Berkovitz said he didn't think legislation would fix anything.  Everyone agreed that, in the meantime, regulation would continue to be done via enforcement. It was a bleak discussion – and evidence that crypto regulations will probably continue to be a hot mess for a long while yet.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,"Michael J.

And When?,"Summary I see 19% weighted average return to GBTC from a legal opinion that could come by the summer. Conversion to an ETF could close the current 40% discount to NAV almost overnight. However, there is still a good chance the SEC prevails or that the legal process is delayed into 2024-25. Though not without risk, this is an interesting opportunity uncorrelated with broader markets. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holds Bitcoin for investors in its trust. It trades at a significant discount to NAV, as today it's a relatively high fee and complex way to own Bitcoin, and currently there's no way to close the discount. However, Grayscale has proposed converting the Trust to an ETF that would collapse any discount, though the SEC blocked that plan, and GBTC are in the process of appealing the decision. For example, here is an ETF with a 2%+ fee that trades at NAV. Trading very close to NAV is a function of the ETF creation/redemption structure and it should occur regardless of the fee structure or underlying assets. The Courts will rule on Grayscale's case, perhaps in summer 2023. I've written about this trade previously, but now I want to get into greater quantitative detail on win/loss probabilities, base rates and timings. Please reference the prior article for a more general overview and quick reaction to the day of the oral argument, if needed. The SEC Wasn't Unanimous In Its Spot Bitcoin ETF Ruling First off, it's interesting that SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce did not approve the ruling disapproving the spot Bitcoin ETF. Peirce does not vote with the other commissioners reasonably often, so this is certainly not unprecedented behavior. Still it's interesting that even the SEC itself is not full aligned on the decision to block a spot Bitcoin ETF. It suggests that maybe even the SEC can see cracks in its own position. Peirce disagrees with other SEC commissioners (SEC commission votes: https://www.sec.gov/about/commission-votes/2022/commission-votes-2022-06.xml) The SEC Is Does Lose In Court Historical data suggests that the SEC could certainly lose its case against Grayscale. A fantastic resource here is Cornerstone Research , they analyze the enforcement actions of the SEC and the SEC releases its own report . In aggregate, the SEC tends to win around 70% to 80% of legal cases depending on the period studied. However, that data isn't exactly comparable to the Bitcoin ETF case that Grayscale are bringing here, because a lot of these cases relate to things like insider trading prosecution or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These are cases the SEC chooses to bring to trial rather than drop or settle. Decisions on how crypto-currency should be regulated are something of a different animal and Grayscale is bringing this case to court, not the SEC, and doing so at a time when criticism of the SEC for its handling of crypto is growing. Still the SEC certainly can lose in court, just not that often. The SEC has lost cases relating to Wal-Mart and a case on data fees. These are arguably more similar to the Grayscale case in challenging the SEC's regulatory actions. So the SEC does not lose in court much, but that's because of the selection effect in the cases it brings to trial. For the spot Bitcoin ETF case, it is Grayscale, not the SEC bringing this to court and using a former Solicitor General to do so. That may tilt the odds in Grayscale's favor. At the same time, the SEC's general approach to crypto regulation has come under attack from the Senate . Of course, there are political undertones here, but Senators pick their battles and the SEC's crypto regulation has been arguably inconsistent and vague. Politics should not influence the court directly, but arguably others are seeing the same inconsistencies in the SEC's actions that the court may pick up on. The Strength Of Grayscale's Argument Grayscale appears to have a very strong legal argument. Yes, regulators have a lot of autonomy to regulate their field, by design. However, there are some guard rails against arbitrary regulation. This may be the strongest pillar of Grayscale's case. It appears arbitrary for the SEC to have approved Bitcoin futures ETFs like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and to not approve Grayscale's proposed Bitcoin spot ETF. That's because if you're worried about ""fraudulent and manipulative acts"" in the Bitcoin spot market, which the SEC clearly are, then it's pretty hard to argue that the futures market is ok and the spot market is not, because ultimately any futures market literally becomes the spot market at the end of the life of the contract. The Technical Point That May Help The SEC One technical point in favor of the SEC (you can read their initial argument here ) is that Bitcoin futures are run by the CME group. That's a platform the SEC has a strong relationship with for what it terms ""surveillance sharing."" This means that the SEC can get direct information from that exchange about who's trading Bitcoin futures, as a way to detect the culprits if market manipulation were occurring. With spot Bitcoin, almost by design, the SEC does not have the same ability to track market participants and their trades. If there's manipulation, the SEC may not know who to go after. Again Grayscale argues that the creation of a spot Bitcoin ETF gives the SEC more insight into who's trading Bitcoin, not less, as more Bitcoin-related liquidity would trade via the NYSE. However, this technical argument is likely what would help the SEC prevail. Also, for what it's worth other spot Bitcoin ETFs trade on other non-US exchanges and are apparently fine, as well as many 'direct' Bitcoin offerings from entities that the SEC regulates. The Judges - One Appears In Favor Sri Srinivasan, Neomi Rao, and Harry Edwards will rule on the case. Either party, essentially, needs at least 2 judges in support to win (i.e. a 3-0 vote or a 2-1 vote). From her questioning during oral argument Rao appears to offer some support to Grayscale's case. That's encouraging, but at least one other judge would need to align with her and that's less clear. We'll come back to that when we run the numbers below. Timing Of An Opinion - Summer 2023 Looking at prior cases involving the SEC, a ruling between July and September appears most likely. That's based on looking at similar cases involving the SEC and the courts and the gap between oral argument (held in March 2023 in this case) and an opinion. The CEO of Grayscale has said to expect a decision before the end of Q3 , which I think like a lot of CEO guidance, bakes in a little conservatism as a decision could come sooner but he doesn't want to make a statement that is contradicted by events. However an appeals process could delay any final decision by up to year and that matters for the investment case. The biggest question is whether Grayscale receives a favorable opinion, but the second question is whether the SEC then would appeal that decision. Potential Outcomes Potential case outcomes (Author's analysis) So in order for us to see a Bitcoin ETF in summer, then Grayscale must win the case and the SEC must not appeal. Other outcomes imply the discount to NAV will persist for at least a year or possibly indefinitely. Probability of Winning The Case Now we'll estimate the outcome in different ways Method Assessment Probability of Grayscale favorable opinion Past SEC legal outcomes Historically the SEC do win in court frequently, though this sort of case is less proven for the SEC vs. say insider trading cases so taking the lower end of the historical range 30% Assessment of judges questions during oral argument One Judge Rao appears in favor, others less clear, need 2 judges for favorable opinion. 50% chance either other judge is against and if both are against Grayscale lose. (i.e. 1 - (50% x 50%) 75% Strength of legal argument It does seem hard to argue that a spot market can be manipulated and the futures market will not be (as the SEC argues). Their technical argument about market surveillance may prevail, but the court may well want to keep the SEC in check here as they seem ""arbitrary"" in their behavior and are definitely at the fringes of consistent behavior 70% Simple Average of Three Above Methods Average of above three values 58% Then even if Grayscale win, will the SEC use an appeal or some other means to block a Bitcoin ETF? I think this is possible, but given all the heat the SEC is getting over crypto regulation I don't know if spot Bitcoin ETF is a hill they want to die on when a futures Bitcoin ETF already exists. Hence I think there's only a 25% chance the SEC pursues this further if they lose the case. I also for simplicity assume Grayscale do not win on appeal if the initial opinion goes against them. Hence: 58% x 75% (i.e. 1-25%) = 43.5% chance of spot Bitcoin ETF (note: false precision, obviously) Outcomes For GBTC Outcome Return to investors Logic Spot Bitcoin ETF +67% Current 40% discount to NAV collapses to 0% (this is how ETFs work) No Spot Bitcoin ETF (Current Trust Structure) -17% Current 40% discount to NAV increases to 50% (largest historical NAV discount is 47%, assume there is some sell off as a Bitcoin trust is basically an orphaned security when there are plenty of better/cheaper ways to own Bitcoin) Weighted Average Outcome +19% Probability Return Probability Weighted Return Spot Bitcoin 43.5% +67% +29% No Spot Bitcoin 56.5% -17% -9% Weighted outcome +19% Conclusion This is an interesting, uncorrelated setup. The expectation of an estimated 19% return over the next few months appears enticing, and is why this is currently among my largest positions. Of course, that said, if the model above proves accurate you are still more likely to lose money , but the upside case more than offsets that risk in expected value terms. Risks Bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset historically speaking, it's up almost 50% YTD and such swings are not unusual. Even if the above analysis comes out favorably you could lose money because Bitcoin falls in value during the investment period. Or indeed, Bitcoin price swings may make a negative outcome even worse Even though the expected value is favorable here, you still more likely to lose money than make money if the above analysis is correct The above analysis attempts to quantify qualitative variables, which can be risky and create the illusion of false precision There are other edge cases not considered in the above analysis. For example, one is that Grayscale receive a favorable opinion but stick with a trust structure regardless Many legal decisions are slow and it's possible that legal delays here may the expected return unattractive on time-weighted basis If Grayscale do get an unfavorable opinion a lot of participants in this trade may sell out, causing GBTC to trade further below NAV than historically There is also the risk that the Bitcoin held by GBTC are stolen or lost in some other way or that Bitcoin becomes technically obsolete Editor's Note: This article was submitted as part of Seeking Alpha's Best Investment Idea For A Potential Recession competition, which runs through April 28.

At Consensus 2023, for instance, Qureshi argued that CertiK, an auditing firm with a less-than-stellar reputation, was making a mistake by offering to reimburse victims of Merlin, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Certik had recently audited. “This is explicitly insurance,” Qureshi said, arguing that if this move is repeated it would push premiums for audits without necessarily improving their accuracy because firms would expect to have to make payouts. CoinDesk caught up with Qureshi to talk about the state of crypto venture capital, the regulatory environment and why Ponzi schemes will always collapse.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  How has your investment thesis changed in a non-ZIRP [zero interest-rate policy] environment?  The biggest change has been the demand for [decentralized finance]-sourced yield. This was a big theme of what made DeFi attractive in a ZIRP environment. Now the appetite for risk has totally changed, so in order to gain traction with consumers, you have to do more than just create synthetic high-yield products.  You've said in the past that one of crypto's particular selling points is permissionless innovation. Are there emerging trends that have developed this past year that you didn’t see coming.  Nope, I predicted everything perfectly. I also knew you would ask this question.  Don’t you have a hot take on the Cosmos ecosystem?  The Cosmos community is an army of generals. A community founded on the basis of radical independence from other chains is, unsurprisingly, unable to agree on stuff.  Following FTX there have been numerous calls to rethink crypto's market structure. Are there ways to redesign centralized exchanges (like separating trading from custody or adding a centralized clearing house) that you'd support?  Separating trading from custody is the obvious one. Prime brokers like Hidden Road and FalconX are already facilitating this. Post-FTX (and post the Binance Commodity Futures Trading Commission suit), institutional players are no longer comfortable facing risky exchanges directly and taking on counterparty risk. In that regard, we'll see the same disaggregation of financial layers that you see in [traditional finance].  See also: Mike Belshe – The SEC's Custody Rule Would Be a Net Positive for Crypto | Opinion  Do you believe that VCs should be subject to similar lockup periods on token stakes as they currently are on equity stakes?  To be clear, equity stakes are not necessarily locked up. There's nothing that generally stops a company from selling its equity via a secondary transaction (unless the board specifically prohibits such sales). The thing that usually stops them is the reputational damage of doing so. The same is true of tokens. But yes, in general we push for long lockups when we make investments, both for investors and for the team.  In 100 years, will there be more or fewer monies?  Fewer.  Is it better to be able to do what you want or feel compelled to do what you must?  It is better to feel compelled to do what you must. It doesn't feel as good, but it leads to a life better lived.  Are there ways of designing crypto systems that have network effects without ""Ponzi-like"" attributes?  Ponzi schemes don't have network effects (they are not networks). They don't even have economies of scale – that is, they don't get easier to sustain the bigger they get. It's the reverse – the bigger they get, the harder they are to sustain. That's why Ponzi schemes that are small can survive for a while, but the bigger they get, the more likely they are to pop.  Do you think mass automation will finally cause U.S. productivity to increase/time spent working to shrink for most people? Bonus: any thoughts on why the past century-plus of techno progress has not increased leisure time?  I think it will cause productivity to increase, but I think it will lead to very unequal effects on time spent working. Poorer people will work less, wealthier people will work about the same I would guess, because wealthy people tend to like their jobs more.I think the way we are measuring increased leisure time is not well-measured. We do a lot more leisure at work now than we did in the past.

U.S. regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have always engaged in an “arms race” to rein in the cryptocurrency industry. However, the multi-billion dollar collapse of crypto exchange FTX has triggered a particularly “tough” wave of crypto regulatory crackdowns, including those on prominent crypto exchanges including Kraken and Coinbase, Weinstein said.  “I was at the Department of Justice [DOJ] for 15 years, and I’ve never seen a circumstance in which agencies tripped over themselves so aggressively to show how tough they can be on a lawful industry,” said Weinstein.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Recent attempts to strong-arm crypto have also affected a large swath of the industry, including both centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The severity with which regulators have attacked the industry, he said, has much to do with the embarrassment the collapse of FTX caused politicians and less to do with the broader cryptocurrency industry’s activities.  “The FTX case made the [regulatory environment] worse, but the FTX case is not about crypto,” said Weinstein. “It’s about good, old-fashioned fraud and self-dealing – the same kind of s**t we saw in Enron.”  It’s an environment that has caused both startups and more mature companies to seek a life raft to “get the hell out of the United States,” according to Weinstein.  “Startups and mature companies are asking how they can locate outside the United States to try to avoid U.S. jurisdiction, not because they're trying to do something wrong but because the U.S. makes it hard to innovate and build even when you're trying to do it,” Weinstein said.  Rebecca Rettig, chief policy officer at Polygon, warned the tougher regulatory environment could fuel a mass exodus of crypto companies from the U.S.. However, the U.S.' loss will hopefully be another country’s gain, she said.  “This is a global and borderless industry,” said Rettig. “People think this is a real opportunity overseas to bring the next stage of the internet, both financial and technological, into their country. This is good for their economies.”",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MATIC | REGULATION | TRADING,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/28/opportunism-and-demagoguery-fuels-the-us-regulatory-crackdown-steptoe-partner-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53a31a40ba2d32fb24e3808e57139c764220155a-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AUSTIN, Texas — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service hopes to implement a new operating plan for dealing with cryptocurrencies in the next ""12-ish"" months, Julie Foerster, the agency's digital assets project director, said from the stage at Consensus 2023 on Friday.  ""We're here to provide a consistent message,"" she said, ""and also to create a plan and a path forward for, I will say the IRS, the enterprise, ensuring that we are looking at and engaging with you all in this room and a lot of others so we get it right and build a path forward.""  Foerster said she was not able to give a date for when the agency plans to update and clarify its guidance on how it plans to tax crypto. The IRS is looking into other methods to communicate with this industry so taxpayers engaging in crypto can voluntarily comply with the reporting requirements, she added.  Foerster, who stressed her views are her own and not necessarily those of the IRS, said her five-person team was with her at Consensus, presumably moving through the convention center, talking to people about taxes and what the U.S. agency can do better.  ""We are engaging with you all so we get it right and build a plan,"" she said. She later added the IRS ""needs to look at the skills of the people we have today and those we will bring on in the future. ... We need to have the right tools and the right people.""  As it currently stands, the IRS considers cryptocurrencies to be convertible virtual assets that can be used as payment for goods and services, digitally traded between users and exchanged for other currencies.  While not considered to be fiat currency, for federal tax purposes cryptocurrencies are considered property, and as such users are required to report their digital assets activity on their tax returns.  Foerster highlighted that the landscape for digital assets is an evolving one, and emphasized a need to increase communications between the agency and the crypto community. In particular she urged people to comment on a March proposal to tax non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like other collectibles. The comment period closes June 19.  Foerster added the U.S. tax agency is also talking to some of its foreign counterparts – she did not name them – about crypto taxation best practices.  “I will say that we have had countries come in and want to talk to us and in our large business and international division. Events like this and other events that we've attended also are providing us an insight or perspective internationally,” she said.  In the end, however, she said the agency has to find ""other ways to get our message across to assist in voluntary compliance.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/28/crypto-tax-plan-could-come-in-12-ish-months-says-irs-official,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6237b92fd2d3e363be961dae7c1f0295437330c-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420627,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqTOP,1682712043,"Bitcoin Use Cases Are Seeing ‘Explosive Growth,' Trust Machines Says","AUSTIN, Texas – Bitcoin ecosystem firm Trust Machines said has seen “explosive growth in bitcoin (BTC) use cases” during the first quarter of 2023, according to new research by the firm.  The report identified bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFT), bitcoin name services (BNS) and recent developments on the Stacks blockchain – a bitcoin smart contract platform that powers much of the Trust Machines’ ecosystem – as the key use cases driving new growth and adoption.  While the Web3 development has grown exponentially based on other blockchains such as Ethereum, development on Bitcoin has lagged. However, with new use cases and technologies emerging, this is likely going to change, said Muneeb Ali, CEO of Trust Machines and co-founder of Stacks, during a panel Friday at Consensus 2023, titled ""Building on Top of Bitcoin (for Real).""  ""It's the revival of the developer culture that I'm by far the most excited about. It's like bitcoin is fun again because there's a place to build again and that's the best thing that could have happened,"" Ali said.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  The Bitcoin blockchain has historically been restricted to payments. Even Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto rejected non-financial uses for the dominant blockchain. However, new technologies are emerging that has began to use Bitcoin as a layer 1 foundation for evolving the network into Web3.  Bitcoin NFTs made a splash earlier this year with the launch of the Ordinals protocol in January. The protocol uses “inscriptions,” or arbitrary content such as text or images that can be added to sequentially numbered satoshis or “sats” – the smallest units in Bitcoin – to create unique “digital artifacts” that can be held and transferred across the Bitcoin network, like any other sats.  Over a million inscriptions have been minted, according to the research from Trust Machines.  The firm’s research also shows a 400% surge in BNS registrations since 2022 on its sister platform BTC.us. The platform allows users to register human-readable "".btc"" domain names that can be used subsequently to host a site or even send and receive bitcoin. Trust Machines attributes this surge to both Ordinals and the launch of the Jack Dorsey-backed decentralized social media protocol, Nostr.  The Stacks blockchain – co-founded by Muneeb Ali – currently powers most of the applications in the Trust Machines’ ecosystem. Research by crypto data analytics company Messari shows that Stacks’ average daily active users and addresses “increased by 76% and 42%, respectively, in Q4 [2022].”  Stacks published a white paper at the end of last year showing how a new digital asset called “Stacks bitcoin” (sBTC) can be used to make Bitcoin fully programmable.  “While we've seen a revival of Bitcoin NFTs in recent months, there is more development to be done to unlock Bitcoin [decentralized finance] use cases fully,” the research said, adding that one of the biggest efforts to unlock that is sBTC.  Stacks has now launched an sBTC testnet, and is targeting a mainnet launch later this year.

12173022,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529158,1682712024,"Bitcoin Emerges As the King Of Assets,10X Growth Over Gold During US Banking Crisis","Despite the volatile price action of Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency has outperformed every other asset, including gold. Although it is trading below its psychological milestone of $30,000 at $29,000, Bitcoin is expected to grow further in 2023, as it acts as a safe haven for investors amidst the US banking crisis. Related Reading: Chainlink Price Slides As The Bear Try To Take Over, Will A Rally Follow? Bitcoin Reigns Supreme As the Best-Performing Asset Capriole Investment, which provides research and analysis on cryptocurrencies, has reported that the current market cycle favors hard assets like gold, as indicated by the 200-week Gold-to-Stocks ratio. This classic indicator highlights when the market favors safe-haven assets like gold over riskier equity assets. Both gold and Bitcoin have generated some of their best returns during these phases. As the market continues to favor hard assets, Bitcoin has emerged as the preferred safe haven for wealth amidst the US banking crisis and fiat currency weakness. During this period of high correlation, Bitcoin has outperformed gold by 10X in 2023, making it the best-performing asset of the year among major asset classes. The strong positive correlation between Bitcoin and Gold has also increased significantly, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against economic uncertainty. With unsustainable tightening, banking crises, and de-dollarization looming, the market is turning to these safe-haven assets to protect their wealth. According to the report by Capriole Investment, the current Bitcoin rally in 2023 is believed to be organic and spot driven. The report highlights a key metric showing total futures Open Interest as a ratio of the total Bitcoin and USDT market cap. This metric provides insight into the market’s leverage and shows that the crypto market leverage peaked with the FTX fraud in November 2022. Since then, this ratio has been on a one-way downtrend, despite Bitcoin’s price rallying over 80% from $16,000 to $30,000. This indicates that there has been little speculation in the market this year. The report suggests that until this ratio spikes or Bitcoin dominance peaks, the foundations for sustainable price appreciation remain in place. This means that the current rally is driven by organic demand rather than speculation, which is a positive sign for the long-term growth of the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, the report suggests that the decrease in leverage indicates a healthy market less vulnerable to sudden price drops. This is because a high level of leverage can often lead to market instability, causing sharp price swings and potentially resulting in a market crash. BTC’s $30-32K Dilemma According to the report, Bitcoin is trading within the largest technical resistance block on the chart since $20,000. This region, which ranges from $30,000 to $32,000, represents the bottom of the 2021 range and the breakdown point into the bear market that began in 2022. Additionally, it is a major weekly order block level and Fibonacci extension level from the prior cycle. $30,000 is also a major round number level, representing a 50% increase from the 2017 cycle all-time-high of $20,000, and $32,000 marks a 100% appreciation in Bitcoin since the FTX Fraud bottom at $16,000. While Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience in recent months, it is important to note that past performance is not an indicator of future results. However, according to Capriole’s report, if Bitcoin manages to close above $32,000 weekly, it wouldn’t be surprising to see a new trend carry its price into the $40,000 mark.

In this first cross-border use case, the Mastercard Crypto Credential service, announced Friday by Raj Dhamodharan from the stage at Consensus 2023, allows wallets to be identified in transactions that are compliant with requirements such as the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) ""travel rule.""  Mastercard Crypto Credential, a set of common standards for attestation of interactions, uses technology from CipherTrace, the well-known blockchain analytics platform Mastercard agreed to acquire in late 2021.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  “If two people want to transfer value from one country to another country, the level of compliance and verification needed is complex,” Dhamodharan said. “So how do you identify those wallets. And how do you exchange enough information about the other party?""  Cross-border transactions have been a focus of blockchain tracker CipherTrace, the creator of a cryptocurrency system that helps companies comply with the travel rule. Under that rule, whenever crypto worth over $1,000 is transacted between two parties, the crypto service provider of the sender is expected to communicate the personally identifiable information of the sender to the crypto service provider of the recipient, and vice versa.  To roll out the service, Dhamodharan said, Mastercard worked with wallet providers Bit2Me, Lirium, Mercado Bitcoin and Uphold. The firms are working on an initial project to enable transfers between U.S. and Latin America and the Caribbean corridors.  More use cases for the service, such as non-fungible token (NFT) transactions, will follow, Dhamodharan added.

42420638,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqTUb,1682705242,Yuga Labs CEO: 'The Metaverse Is Not New',"AUSTIN, Texas — Gamers want to participate in the creative environment of gaming and be a part of the ecosystem, but will flee if they think that the metaverse and Web3 are just about fleecing them for money, Daniel Alegre, the new CEO of Yuga Labs, said on stage at the Consensus 2023 festival here on Friday.  Alegre joined Yuga Labs – the company behind Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs – in December from Activision Blizzard (ATVI), where he served as president and chief operating officer. During his time at Activision Blizzard, he oversaw some of the company’s most important franchises, including World of Warcraft, which was a metaverse, even though it reached its peak in the mid-2000s.  “The reality is the metaverse is not new,” he said. “World of Warcraft, for all intents and purposes, is a metaverse,” he added. “But what Web3 is enabling is not only new interaction and ways for players to find communities that go beyond necessarily the game itself.”  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  But if you say the word “metaverse” around gamers, they likely won’t have a good response. In December 2021, game publishing house Ubisoft tried to attach non-fungible tokens to Ghost Recon but failed. On-chain data showed that gamers just weren’t interested.  The key to success with Web3 and gaming is to design the game from the ground up with Web3 in mind, Alegre said.  “You can actually really bring the Web 2 players and have them realize, OK, this is what Web3 does,” he said. “If the experiences are excellent, people will follow.”",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/28/yuga-labs-ceo-the-metaverse-is-not-new,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87340bbd888346f485a25362c93bad744ac288aa-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12170221,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529150,1682704851,"XRP Could Be Poised For Another Rally, Here Are Key Metrics To Watch Out","The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a period of volatility, but XRP could be poised to break to the upside. As investors and traders gear up for the upcoming potential gains, several key metrics to watch out for could give insights into the future of XRP’s price. XRP Could Be Poised For A Rally Over the past week, XRP has shown signs of bullish momentum, with the cryptocurrency price rising from $0.46 on April 21 to $0.47 at the time of writing. The surge in price could be attributed to several factors, including the ubiquitous uptrend in the market. According to the XRP price 4-hour chart, a possible uptrend could occur soon. The asset has formed a double bottom on the 1-day time frame and is now set to shape a W pattern fully. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Explains Why XRP Will Not Fall To $0.10 The token has major high liquidity at $0.53, which could support an extension in the bullish trend as major players target it. Though the chart appears imprecise, should the asset continue its upward momentum and not invalidate the marked-out W pattern, it could rally and trade at the $0.5 region in the coming weeks. Key Metrics To Keep An Eye On Alongside the asset validating the W pattern on the chart, XRP trading volume is one of the crucial metrics to watch out for, as it indicates the level of interest among retail traders. These retail investors have the potential to help solidify the current bullish price action for XRP. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the token’s daily trading volume has remained consistently high, indicating strong investor interest and potentially foreshadowing a price increase. the token’s daily trading volume has surged from $1.4 billion seen 5 days ago to $1.6 billion in the last 24 hours. Whale action on XRP’s is another important metric to watch out for. On the XRPL network, significant whale transactions have been recorded through on-chain data, which can potentially sway the XRP coin’s price in favor of further profits. Whale transactions refer to large cryptocurrency transactions, typically carried out by institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. These transactions have the potential to move markets and are closely monitored by traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Dominates The Market: ADV On Centralized Exchanges Surged by 46% In Q1 2023, Report Factors contributing to XRP’s potential rally include the regulatory environment and its legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

""It's not good to put crypto all in the same basket and look at it in a vacuum,"" said Marianne Bechara, senior counsel at the International Monetary Fund.  Regulators worldwide have been working for several years to determine how best to coordinate international crypto regulation. Earlier this month, the European Parliament approved the European Union’s crypto-assets framework, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which some observers have said could form a template for other jurisdictions. Even so, each country or region has issues that are area-specific, the panelists said.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  ""There's some level of coordination, but there should still be some level of space for individual jurisdictions to address their own context,"" said Brian Yeoh, director of fintech at Abu Dhabi Global Markets. ""I think international securities regulation and international regulation as a whole recognizes that there's a need for some level of convergence.""  ""So I think the specific concerns that the U.S. has on how you deal with the definitions of the security may not necessarily apply in other jurisdictions,"" he said. ""There is no commonly accepted definition of a security worldwide.""

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Signature Bank relied heavily on uninsured deposits, didn't have strong liquidity risk-management practices and maintained poor risk management in general. All of that was exacerbated by a bank run spurred by the collapse of the other banks, the report said. That the bank was serving the crypto industry was also cited as a major risk.  “Additionally, SBNY failed to understand the risk of its association with and reliance on crypto industry deposits or its vulnerability to contagion from crypto industry turmoil that occurred in late 2022 and into 2023,” the FDIC said.  The FDIC has been reviewing its oversight of Signature Bank since shortly after the New York Department of Financial Services seized the bank in March.  Despite industry claims that Signature was shut down specifically for serving crypto customers, NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris has repeatedly said the bank had other issues.  The FDIC's report comes on the same day that the Federal Reserve and Government Accountability Office published the results from their own reviews of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature. Like the FDIC, the Federal Reserve attributed SVB's collapse to serial mismanagement made worse by unaccounted-for risks – in SVB’s case, the risks came from interest-rate hikes and liquidity issues.  The GAO noted that Signature had “reduced its exposure to deposits” from the crypto industry over the 12 months prior to its collapse.  “Silicon Valley Bank was affected by rising interest rates and Signature Bank had exposure to the digital assets industry. The banks failed to adequately manage the risks from their deposits,” the GAO report said.  All three reports pointed to a lack of action from federal regulators as a contributing factor, saying the banks’ supervisors could have acted sooner to request more information or otherwise manage the banks and their risks.

Srinivasan, a former chief technology officer of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), is credited by many for predicting the effects of COVID-19 earlier than most. In March, he predicted stupendously bullish prospects for bitcoin in response to the devaluing of the U.S. dollar. He said the price could reach $1 million in 90 days after March 17.

He described his prediction as a ""symbol"" of the ""collapse in full faith and credit in the U.S. financial system,"" because of a proliferation of money printing by the government to prop up a fragile banking system.  Relating the chances of bitcoin reaching $1 million to the probability of some sort of Black Swan event in the U.S. economy, Srinivasan said he thinks there's a 10% chance of a very serious issue in months, a 70% chance of one in years, a 19% chance within decades and a 1% chance it takes a century or more.

He spoke during a panel at CoinDesk's Consensus 2023 conference titled ""Crypto Banished From the Banking System.""  It wasn't clear if Landsberg-Sadie's comments referred to Bernard Madoff’s infamous Ponzi scheme or the more recent, spectacular collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which was not a Ponzi scheme. However, he does think current efforts by U.S. regulators against crypto entities are hurting legitimate companies, such as Caitlin Long's Custodia Bank, which has been at odds with regulators. Long was another member of the panel.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  ""I think Choke Point is the SEC's chemotherapy for a giant gap, for a $14 billion Ponzi cancer, and healthy legitimate organs like Custodia Bank are getting hit,"" he said.  ""It was a tragedy to see what happened, in this case a good actor [Custodia] getting the short end of the stick of a massive crime, that [the] SEC was right to attempt to address,"" Landsberg-Sadie added.  Read more: U.S. Banking Crisis May Be Vindication for Crypto Ecosystem: JPMorgan  Custodia Bank, a three-year-old special purpose depository institution in Wyoming, has been trying to push its way into the U.S. banking system. After a long wait, the Federal Reserve denied Custodia’s bid for system membership in January, citing concerns about the “safety and soundness” of the bank. Shortly after, the Kansas City Fed denied Custodia’s “master account” application. Wyoming is within the Kansas City Fed's jurisdiction.  The recent crisis sparked by the closing of Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley banks has narrowed opportunities for many U.S. crypto companies, pushing them to open bank accounts offshore. This has many in the industry questioning whether they can do business in the country.  ""Events of the last six months have put a damper on entities wanting to bank this space [crypto],"" said another panelist, Richard Booth, chief compliance officer of Fortress Trust Company. ""But it's legal business and I think that every business in this country is entitled to access to banking rails."" He added that ""the regulation, I think, needs to be matured. Congress has clearly advocated what they're supposed to be doing and the regulators are struggling to keep up.""  He also said that a ""perfect model"" for the crypto community for their banking needs would be a ""trust model"" as such financial institutions ""can pretty much do everything that a bank does"" and none of the assets are held on its balance sheet, which means ""there's no single point of failure.""

The significant price movements of Bitcoin, which saw it rally past $30,000 for the first time since June 2022, triggered euphoria and awakened the interests of retail and large cryptocurrency investors. While market sentiments may seem to be positive at the moment, what could have brought about these sentiments? Bitcoin Price Takes The Spotlight Bitcoin has shown grit in its recent price movements and rallies, dragging several altcoins with it as it recorded significant gains. This positive price development of Bitcoin alongside other cryptocurrencies has led to crypto communities calling a start of a bull run and continued price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds At $29,300 As PCE Comes Out Neutral Recently, crypto expert analysts, celebrities, and even some traditional finance analysts have made BTC a topic of major discussion, dropping bullish price predictions for the cryptocurrency. According to a Reuters report, Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, made price predictions for Bitcoin, saying the alpha crypto could reach $100,000 by 2024. Also, Robert Kiyosaki, the famous best-selling author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” recently called a $100,000 price prediction for BTC on his Twitter handle. BTC’s sudden price rise and attention could be attributed to several market factors and happenings in the Tradfi and business world. Recent news of the collapse of bank giants such as Silicon Valley and Silvergate caused a stir in the traditional finance world, with users worried about the security of their funds. Concerns of rising inflation and de-dollarization have also resulted in financial experts and analysts looking to Bitcoin as a “Safe Haven” asset due to its decentralized nature. While the woes of the traditional finance system continue with recent news of the First Republic Bank potentially failing, Bitcoin price is seen looking to close another month in the bullish territory. Bitcoin Chart Analysis On The Weekly TimeFrame On the monthly chart timeframe, Bitcoin price is heading up to close April on a bullish note after its 3-month consecutive run. The weeks of April have witnessed bullish activity and amazing price action from BTC as it rallied past the $30,000 price region for the first time since last year. Bitcoin hovers around key support on the weekly chart timeframe |Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com However, the previous week saw a huge price dump of BTC below $27,000 after it briefly tested the resistance hanging around the sub $31,000 price level.

Digital merchandise was sold at the event also, Ruxandra said.  “A digitally augmented space that is physical as well is a key part of our future,” Ruxandra said.  Web3’s burgeoning relationship with music will continue to live on if artists and creatives in the digital space focus on relevant, future-proof and individualistic ideas, Ruxandra explained.  And not every artist needs to create an NFT project to succeed, Ruxandra added.  “You have to understand who your audience is and start communicating with them generally,” Ruxandra said. “Go where they are and start understanding what they're looking for.”  She recommended creators communicating with fans or their communities through a physical space or discord channel and social media platforms, plus having a long-term road map. Once you build your community, you can drive them into “these experiences,” Ruxandra said.

12166684,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529116,1682694602,"Chainlink Price Slides As The Bears Try To Take Over, Will A Rally Follow?","Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing price volatility today despite its slight gains. The bears aim to take control over the price action as LINK dropped from $8.5764 on April 18 to $7.7704 on April 19, 2023. Its trading volume is up by 97% in the last 24 hours. It also gained 2.27% on its price yesterday. But LINK price shows a decline on today’s chart representing a bear control. Notably, the overall crypto market cap is down by 0.92%, indicating that bears are in control. Top coins such as BTC and ETH display a bearish trend that is most likely pushing other altcoins to decline. What’s Ahead For LINK? LINK has formed a red candle on today’s daily chart, dropping below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a short-term bearish sentiment. Also, it has remained in the sideways trend that began on April 22, 2023, showing that the bears and bulls might be at a stalemate in the market. The price change in this period is slight, but a spike in trading activity is evident for the asset. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential LINK’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 44.58, descending to the oversold region. It implies that further price decline is possible in the coming days. LINK is still above its 200-day SMA despite the price volatility. The 200-day SMA has turned into a support level for the asset at $6.942, indicating a recovery in the long term. Other vital support levels are $6.4 and $6.75. Also, its resistance levels are $7.456, $7.735, $8.8, and $9.48. At the $7.456 resistance, the bears intend to keep LINK’s price down. It will likely descend to the $6.942 support level soon, which can act as a pivot point to spark a bullish rally. Chainlink Upcoming Hackathon Event Sparks Hope Of A Rally The Chainlink Hackathon event promises to bring exciting innovators and developers together. The event will kick off today, April 28, until June 9, 2023. Notably, this event will boost and create awareness in the crypto community.

Chainlink offers Oracle services enabling hybrid smart contracts to function on any blockchain. Despite the current price slump, LINK has retained most of its gains in 2023. It moved from $5.6224 on January 1, 2023, to its current price of $7.03 at press time. The Hackathon and other developments on the network are vital to its hope of a bull run in 2023 and beyond.

42393643,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1jFl,1682693580,"Crypto Exchange Binance's Head of Product Discusses AI, Supercycles and What Gets Him Excited Nowadays","Absolutely no one can say with certainty what artificial intelligence (AI) will do. It may be the boost to brain capacity humanity needs to solve its most intractable problems, or the tool that allows us to destroy ourselves. For now, however, concerns about AI are a little more prosaic. Should your crypto firm deploy AI to save costs? Can you trust this machine to audit a financial contract?  This article is excerpted from The Node newsletter, which will send two editions daily during the Consensus 2023 conference running down the biggest news from the event. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here or get IRL or virtual tickets for Consensus 2023 here.  Mayur Kamat, the head of product at Binance, is a long-time veteran of the tech industry. He’s seen multiple trends take hold and transform the world: the rise of mobile, crypto and now AI. CoinDesk spoke to him during Consensus to get a sense of how the world’s largest crypto exchange plans to use AI and other “aha” moments in tech.  Why do you think crypto startups should start using AI in their operations?  What we are seeing with the recent pace of developments with generative AI, every company in the world will need to include it in their road map or else run the risk of being outclassed by their existing and upcoming competitors. Crypto startups are no exception. The good news is that crypto startups are usually small, nimble and hungry  Could you tell me about the product development cycle for Bicasso? When did you guys first get the idea, and how long did it take to develop?  It was pretty fast. The idea started around November 2022 and by December 2022 we had a working prototype. We launched a small MVP [minimum viable product] and the response from the community blew us away. So now we will keep expanding on the scope and reach. Bicasso is an experiment to explore the boundaries between Web3 and [generative] AI. If AI can create amazing artwork, how do we differentiate it from other gen AI and human artwork? How do we establish ownership and authenticity in this new world? NFTs can play a massive role in this space.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Regarding Binance product development cycle, we do not have a standard template. We have teams doing zero to one products like Bicasso or Binance Tax. Others do small improvements to the user experience. And a lot of teams are working on improving know-your-customer (KYC) and compliance. They all have different requirements and follow the process that allows us to be fast but also flexible.  Is AI a risk for crypto broadly, given that there are countless incentives to exploit cryptographic networks using AI and far less to use AI as a white-hat hacker?  AI is a transformative technology, similar to how the internet was. It will be used for both positive and negative. Will it provide new tools for people who might misuse this technology? Yes. Will it enable new scenarios for Web3? Absolutely. We need good actors to adopt the technology faster and stay ahead of the game.  Do you remember your first ""aha"" moment where you had an epiphany about the power/importance of tech?  I am old, so this goes back a while. [laughs] Growing up in India, buying music, especially English music, was very hard, and expensive. I remember the first time when I put a CD I got from a friend and used an Mp3 ripper to make [an] Mp3 out of it. The fact that music can now be digitized and sent to anyone over the world within minutes blew my mind.  I had a similar epiphany on Web3 recently. My helper sends a significant amount of her salary back home to the Philippines. Every month she stands in line for an hour at a local money exchange and pays 8% to send money back home to her daughter. I showed her how to do it via crypto and the fees associated with it. And she had the same expression I did when I made the Mp3. We live in magical times.  Growing up in Washington [state], how aware of or proud of Microsoft were people?  Microsoft was my first job. I joined as an Intern and loved it so much that I never interviewed with any other company in my last year and joined them straight out of grad school. Microsoft in 2003 was peak tech. My grandma in India knew about Bill Gates. As an intern, I got to go to his house and spend some time with him. I felt on top of the world when I got hired there as one of the first product managers (PM). It still is an amazing company to work for. Some of my friends who joined with me are still working there after 20 years.  I had a similar feeling when I joined Binance as the head of product. My grandma sadly passed away a few years ago, but if she was alive, she would have heard of CZ [CEO Changpeng Zhao].  As someone with a career in the field, would you say that crypto is part of the broader tech industry?  Crypto is as tech as it gets. It's a new platform for encapsulating wealth and enabling freedom of money. It utilizes the core cryptographical principles that enable modern security and commerce and expands on them to create new scenarios. Would you ask a similar question to someone working in AI?  What is the least-discussed, most-important technology of 2023?  I don't think stablecoins get their due worth of attention. Stablecoins at scale will have a similar impact as email did. It makes money cross-border like emails made communications cross-border.  Do you have a favorite Web3 app?  I am a big fan of PancakeSwap. It is a comprehensive decentralized exchange (DEX) but still so fun and playful.  What do you think of the Solana Phone or the idea of something like it?  I have worked on mobile for a while. I was involved in building early versions of Android and working with global phone manufacturers. Hardware is largely a low-margin business for anyone whose name does not start with Apple. It is also a very slow business. It takes two years from concept to seeing users use it. Two years is decades in the crypto world. That said, I am always curious when someone does something out of the ordinary. So excited to see how well [the Solana phone] does.  Do you think there is an end goal for technology?  To grow and push boundaries is what makes humans different from other species. We have evolved to have intelligence and are now pushing the boundaries of what intelligence means for machines. The world tomorrow will be different from yesterday. It may or may not be better, depending on whom you ask. It will make us uncomfortable, and that's where the best innovation happens  See also: Why Bitcoin Needs Philosophy  In three words or less, describe your outlook on crypto in the U.S.  Binance does not operate in the U.S. and it's been a while since I have left the U.S. so I really do not have much to say here than the average layman.

Ethereum Sharks & Whales Numbers Have Gone Up During The Past Year According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, there are now around 380 more sharks and whales in the market compared to 12 months ago. The relevant indicator here is the “ETH Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount of Ethereum that each wallet group in the sector is currently holding. Addresses are divided into these “wallet groups” based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balances right now. The 10-100 coins cohort, for instance, includes all wallets that are holding between 10 and 100 ETH at the moment. The Supply Distribution metric for this specific group would measure the sum of the individual balances of all addresses on the network that are satisfying this condition. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation: HODLers Are Buying 15,000 BTC Per Month In the context of the current discussion, the investors of interest are those holding at least 1,000 ETH, meaning that the relevant range here would be 1,000 to infinite coins. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Supply Distribution for such investors over the last couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter This wallet range of at least 1,000 ETH (worth about $1.9 million at the current exchange rate) includes two very important cohorts for Ethereum: the sharks and whales. These investors can be quite influential in the market as they hold such large amounts in their wallets (with the whales naturally being more powerful than the sharks since they are the larger of the two. Because of this reason, their behavior may provide hints about where the market may be headed in the long term. As displayed in the above graph, the Supply Distribution for the 1,000+ ETH range had a value of 6,712 a year ago. Since then, the indicator has enjoyed an overall uptrend and its value has risen to 7,092 today. This implies that 380 new addresses belonging to sharks and whales have come up on the network during the last year, representing an increase of about 5.7%. Ethereum saw a decline during most of the past year as the bear market tightly gripped the cryptocurrency. Overall, the asset is still down 35% in this period, meaning that these humongous holders have been buying while the value of the asset has been relatively low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flash Crash Triggered By Bogus Data? Here’s What Happened From the chart, it’s visible that the most significant buying spree in this period came just following the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. This suggests that the sharks and whales saw the lows following this crash as a profitable buying opportunity. And indeed, their accumulation there looks to have paid off so far, as those lows now appear to be the lowest point for this bear market. These holders have also continued to buy a net amount in the current rally so far, meaning that they are supportive of the price surge. Naturally, this can be a positive sign for bullish momentum in the long term. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,900, down 1% in the last week.

Algorithmic stablecoins like USTC are backed by a basket of assets, such as LUNA and bitcoin (BTC), without depending on any centralized third party to hold those assets. Most of the tokens, however, fall victim to a “death spiral” – with outflows or sales of backing assets causing a sudden de-pegging of USTC-like projects.  As described by pseudonymous member “RedlineDrifter,” a divergence fee mechanism would charge a fee equal to the difference in price between the peg and market price of USTC, which could range from 0% at peg to 100% at a 50% deviation from the peg. The fees would be paid by users in demand of USTC tokens.  This design is a disincentive for selling below the peg and an incentive for buying to ensure the accrual of the more desirable asset, i.e. USTC or tokens that back it at that time.  The fees retained by the protocol are used to buy back USTC and maintain the peg, and the protocol is implemented across all USTC trading pairs both on and off-chain.  RedlineDrifter proposed a USTC staking tool to drive capital to the token, resulting in its price appreciation, at least on paper.  “We are in a unique situation with USTC in that it is currently viewed less as a store of value and more a speculative asset,"" RedlineDrifter wrote in the proposal. ""The potential to near 50x with a repeg is one of the few drivers of trading as there’s currently no utility.""  “To bring some utility to USTC and take it out of circulating supply in the process, I propose that we create a new savings/staking module for USTC with 1month, 6month and 12month lockup periods with increasing reward rates for longer lockup,"" the proposal continued. ""This module is purely about taking USTC out of circulating supply to accelerate the incremental repeg efforts and put increased positive pressure on USTC price.""  Community members say Terra co-founder Do Kwon “had the right idea” that crypto markets required a fully-decentralized token to create a decentralized economy. As of Friday, markets rely heavily on centralized stablecoin lenders such as Tether Global and Circle, which communities like Terra believe is against the ethos of cryptocurrencies.  Kwon is Terra’s disgraced creator who’s wanted by prosecutors in South Korea for his role in the project. Daniel Shin, the other co-founder of Terra, was indicted in South Korean courts earlier this week.  The Terra network imploded last May as sudden outflows from the protocol caused UST to fall to a few pennies within two weeks alongside a 99% drop in terra (LUNA) tokens, as CoinDesk reported.  The project has since been irrevocably written off, but communities continue to churn, hoping to bring the project back to its glory days.",POSITIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/28/terra-classic-hopefuls-mull-revival-of-failed-ust-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10da654b6710d230b0763d25228323501cf3c50d-7952x4473.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The contracts are the latest indication the prospects for the largest publicly listed miner by computing power, or hashrate, might be improving after it started bankruptcy proceedings in December 2022. The change in market conditions since then led a group of the firm's equity holders to point out in March that the firm's financial position had improved significantly.  Core Scientific will host 6,914 mining rigs for Greenidge Generation Holdings (GREE), 10,000 units for Ault Alliance (AULT) and 1,021 for LM Funding (LMFA). Once fully installed in May, they will bring the total number of machines the firm is hosting to about 70,000. That's on top of the 155,000 machines it uses to mine for itself as of March-end. The contracts are a mix of variable pricing and proceeds-sharing deals, the firm said.  The 18,000 machines will be hosted in Core Scientific's sites in Dalton, Georgia; Calvert City, Kentucky; and Denton, Texas – all sites where Celsius Mining had rigs. After the Chapter 11 filing, Core Scientific shut down 37,000 rigs belonging to Celsius Network's mining arm, which is also in bankruptcy proceedings, as the two are quarreling over their services agreement.  Core Scientific's equity, traded over-the-counter, has gained 887% since the start of the year, TradingView data shows. The shares are now at 40 cents.  The miner has 175 megawatts (MW) of available hosting capacity in its Denton, Texas, facility, and is developing another 915 MW in west Texas and Oklahoma.

However, as the year progresses, Shiba Inu has experienced a downward trend leaving investors wondering: should they hold or sell? Shiba Inu coin’s value on Coingecko is currently at $0.00001027, experiencing a decrease of 3.4% over the last seven days and a more significant slump of 7.8% over the past two weeks. The question on every investor’s mind now is: what move should they make next with the meme coin? Source: Coingecko Key Levels To Watch For Shiba Inu For traders and investors who want to get a clear grasp of SHIB’s price trajectory, it’s important to remember that there are two key levels to consider: the support level and the resistance level. The support level is currently set at $0.0000095. Alternately, the resistance level, which is now at $0.00001 at the time of writing, signifies the price at which sellers are expected to enter the market and sell their SHIB holdings, hence exerting downward pressure on the price of the meme coin. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential The price of SHIB may signify a negative signal and cause traders to sell if it breaks through the support level. On the other hand, if the price rises over the $0.00001 resistance level, it can be a bullish indicator that buyers are flooding the market and pushing the price higher. As such, keeping a close eye on these key levels can help traders make informed decisions when buying or selling SHIB. SHIB’s Growing Community, Shibarium Dev’t Could Make It A Good Buy Shiba Inu could be an attractive buy this month because of several reasons. For one, its community is rapidly expanding with many supporters believing in the project’s long-term potential. Additionally, the Shiba Inu team has been diligently working on a decentralized ecosystem that includes a non-fungible token (NFT) platform, a decentralized exchange, to mention a few. The Shiba Inu community’s enthusiasm for Shibarium has been apparent in recent posts on the Telegram group “Shibarium Tech.” SHIB total market cap at $5.8 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com While there have been attempts to obtain information about the latest developments from Shytoshi Kusama, individuals have not heard anything as of April 27 despite Kusama’s promise of “big news before May.” Kusama responded to the community’s eagerness for Shibarium updates by highlighting the transparency of all activities related to Shibarium, including token transfers. He also emphasized the team’s dedication to making progress and stated that they are working diligently towards their goals.

Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) on May 2-3, all eyes were on the PCE today. The latter is known as the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. (versus CPI). It measures prices paid by consumers for domestic purchases of goods and services and excludes food and energy. The baseline was as follows: February’s core PCE index was +0.3% on a monthly basis, below the forecast of +0.4%. For March, analysts expected an increase of +0.3%. On an annualized (YoY) basis, an increase of 4.5% was expected, a slight drop from the previous month’s 4.6%. Hitting expectations or any “positive” surprises were expected to be bullish for the Bitcoin market. Renowned analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) stated up front: “Bulls want to continue seeing it trend south!” and added the chances for a bullish surprise were good: “CPI + PPI prints earlier in the month, at least for now, suggests that the path of least resistance is for lower inflation numbers.” PCE Slightly Impacts Bitcoin Price These expectations were not met. As reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, core PCE came in at 0.3% on a monthly basis, as expected. On an annual basis, core PCE fell to 4.6%, also delivering the expected number.

Powell also stated that a recession in the United States is likely. “This is what it takes to get inflation down. By cooling off the economy and cooling off the labor market inflation comes down. We don’t know of any painless way for inflation to come down.” In a prank call with a fake Zelenskyy Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, admits at least 2 more upcoming interest rate hikes followed by a long period of high rates with significant negative effects on the US economy and the US labor market. https://t.co/vDb19Ed5ux — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) April 27, 2023 What Will The Fed Make Of The Data? After the latest macro data, Fed Funds Futures traders expect a probability of more than 80% for a 25 basis points (bps) rate hike next Wednesday. The probability according to the CME FedWatch Tool was at 88% before the release of the PCE and remained at this level afterwards. Related Reading: Why This Top Financial Expert Is Saying ‘Buy Bitcoin’ Amid Looming Bank Failures Still, the market is calling Powell’s bluff. Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi shared the chart below and stated prior to the PCE release: Market pricing implies 88% odds of a rate hike next week, up from earlier in the month. Some traders are starting to bet on a hike in June as well, but that’s less certain. Either way, markets still think we’re going to get multiple cuts later in 2023 & early 2024. Today’s release is not expected to change this. On the other hand, a second wave of bank failures is currently brewing in the US. Higher interest rates are likely to push more regional banks to their limit. Bitcoin could once again be the beneficiary, as the Fed can’t hike as high as they would want to.

42393637,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1ikz,1682685000,Jack Dorsey's Block Snaps Up Bitcoin Mining Chip as Intel Winds Down Production,"Jack Dorsey's fintech-payments company Block (SQ) recently bought a large number of bitcoin (BTC) mining chips from Intel (INTC), which will accelerate its plans to enter the mining hardware market just as the chipmaker winds down production.  The purchase will help it bring mining machines to the market as it focuses on developing its cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips. Intel announced in February a last date for the production of its bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) in April 2024 as it discontinues the chip.  Block recently jumped on the opportunity to buy a large quantity of these ASICs from Intel, it said in a Friday blog post. The firm was planning on finalizing its design of a 5-nanometer chip for bitcoin mining this quarter and build machines based on that. The purchase means that the team can focus exclusively on the 3-nanometer design, the post said.  Nanometers in chip design refer to the size of each transistor, millions of which are packed together make up a chip. The smaller the transistors, the more that can fit on a chip so it can run more calculations, making for a more powerful chip.  Block's first-party products will come early next year, said Thomas Templeton, Block's hardware lead, in an interview with CoinDesk. Asked about the quantity of chips the company bought, he said it is enough to bridge the time until Block can design and productize its own 3-nanometer chips.  Block said it aims to improve the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. When it comes to mining, ""the main problem"" is ""the diversity of manufacturing and supply chain,"" said Templeton. ""We want to make more more tools for more people to build and use. When you dig into mining, the ASIC is at the center of mining.""  The mining manufacturing industry is dominated by two players: Bitmain and MicroBT.  In March, Block announced it was working on a mining development kit, which will allow other engineers to create products using Block's chips. This will provide developers with a suite of tools to unlock innovation in bitcoin mining hardware, the firm said. Block is open sourcing this technology and wants the community to contribute to its development, which is why it announced the kit, Templeton said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/28/jack-dorseys-block-snaps-up-bitcoin-mining-chip-as-intel-winds-down-production,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce9ba598e33e8aac5c82fd669aff6bd8f730fc8a-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Despite some volatility in price, bitcoin has risen 7% in the past seven days, trading in a range of between $27,000 and $30,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value rose 1.2% over the last 24 hours to $29,307. Some analysts say instability in traditional banks has helped bitcoin, which is seen as an alternative to traditional finance. One troubled bank is San Francisco-based First Republic Bank (FRC), whose shares dropped 50% on Tuesday after it revealed its deposits fell by $100 billion in the first quarter. That comes as the broader economy is slowing down. On Thursday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew at a 1.1% annualized rate in the first quarter, below analysts’ estimates of 1.9%.  The European Central Bank wants its centralized-financial settlement systems to better interact with distributed ledger technology, as it seeks to keep pace with technological developments in financial markets. The ECB is pondering whether to issue a retail central bank digital currency for use by regular traders and citizens – but it also wants to be able to interact with innovations in wholesale financial markets, including those that use the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is set to begin operations in Japan, according to a notice published on Friday. In November, Binance acquired the regulated Sakura Exchange BitCoin. Existing services on SEBC will be terminated on May 31, and Binance will start a new service called ""Binance Japan"" after June. SEBC now supports 11 trading pairs. Listing tokens on exchanges in Japan requires vetting by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's single-day price movements and the trajectory of its 50-day simple moving average of the cryptocurrency's price since December.  Bitcoin bounced up from its 50-day SMA this week, defying expectations for a deeper decline and keeping the uptrend intact.  ""The bulls have managed to push the price above the 50-day moving average, which is pointing up from $27,000 on Monday to $27,400,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.  ""At the end of March, the market bought bitcoin near this level. In other words, we have strong indications that the first cryptocurrency maintains its uptrend,"" Kuptsikevich added.

Although Litecoin showed a slight increase of 2% in the last 24 hours, it lost 1% over the week, indicating consolidation. The altcoin’s technical outlook suggests a potential bearish takeover, as demand and accumulation for the altcoin have both declined. The crucial overhead resistance level of Litecoin has been a barrier that the coin has failed to surpass previously. In the event of another rejection over the coming trading sessions, bears could successfully take over. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential As Bitcoin approaches the $30,000 mark, major altcoins are following a similar price trend. If BTC successfully crosses this resistance level, Litecoin could experience a rally. However, the market capitalization of LTC has decreased in the last 24 hours, indicating a decline in buying strength. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, LTC was trading at $89.58, and the overhead resistance level was at $90, which the coin has attempted to break through over the past few weeks. If LTC manages to surpass this level, it could potentially trade near the $100 mark. However, for a recovery on the chart to occur, selling pressure needs to decrease. On the flip side, if LTC falls from the $89 mark, it could reach $88. Failing to stay above that level could drag the price down to $84. The last trading session showed a red volume of LTC traded, indicating that sellers were dominating the market. Technical Analysis Following the formation of a tall bearish engulfing candlestick, the price of LTC has been steadily decreasing, and demand has also diminished. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below the 50-mark, indicating that there is more selling pressure than buying strength. Additionally, LTC has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating that sellers are driving the price momentum. However, the price has moved above the 50-SMA line (yellow), suggesting that LTC might attempt to recover over the next trading session. In line with other indicators, LTC has shown sell signals associated with negative price action. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which indicates price momentum and reversals, has continued to form red histograms, signaling sellers to the table. Related Reading: Why Coinbase CEO Believes SEC’s Crypto Warning Is Harmful To The US The Directional Movement Index has also been negative, with the +DI line (blue) below the -DI line (orange). Furthermore, the Average Directional Index has fallen below the 20-mark, indicating that the current price trend lacks strength. However, with an increase in demand and broader market strength, LTC may be able to break through its overhead resistance level in the coming trading sessions.

42393641,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1ivF,1682681269,Bitcoin Held on Binance Surges to Record High of 692K BTC: Glassnode,"The total amount of bitcoin (BTC) held in Binance's wallets has increased sharply in the past four weeks, reversing the outflow that followed the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November.  Data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows the balance held in Binance's wallets has increased by more than 52,000 BTC ($1.5 billion) in four weeks, taking the tally to 692,880 BTC. The global tally (coins held on all centralized exchanges) has increased by more than 27,000 BTC.  The uptick in the balance held on Binance might signify renewed investor confidence in centralized exchanges' ability to keep their funds safe.  Investor confidence was dented late last year after the collapse of FTX, formerly the world's third-largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance also came under pressure after FTX went bust, spurring investors to take direct custody of their coins. In the three weeks before Dec. 19, the number of bitcoin held on Binance fell by nearly 88,000 bitcoins to 580,357.  According to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto financial-services platform Matrixport, the sharp rise in bitcoin held on Binance might be bad news for the market.  ""Large amounts of bitcoin being moved onto exchanges generally means that those are ready to be sold,"" Thielen told CoinDesk.  ""We have seen legacy wallets that have not been used for 10 years suddenly awaken and transfer bitcoin. This could be a sign that long-term holdings are thinking prices might be capped around $30,000,"" Thielen added.  Bitcoin changed hands at $29,315 at press time, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. The leading cryptocurrency has rallied 77% this year and recently hit highs above $31,000.  Macro analyst Tom Dunleavy suggested otherwise, saying the uptick in the exchange balance stems from the demand for dollar alternatives.  ""To me, that's just more renewed interest in BTC the asset as we continue to see signs of struggles with banks in the U.S. and more interest in dollar alternatives,"" Dunleavy said in a Twitter chat.

The outlet cited a message posted to a Telegram group believed to be run by the military wing Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.

The Brigades said in the Telegram post that it will halt bitcoin donations for ""the safety of the donors ... especially in light of the intensification of the prosecution and the doubling of the hostile effort against anyone who tries to support the resistance through this currency.""

Grayscale vs. SEC case and lawmaker pressure on the SEC could result in the conversion of GBTC to an ETF finally being allowed. Anticipation of the next Bitcoin halving, expected in 2024, could lead to a price surge due to scarcity. GBTC's substantial discount and potential ETF conversion offer an attractive investment opportunity. Technical indicators generally support both GBTC and Bitcoin, despite setbacks and uncertainties. Since October 2022, I have been strategically accumulating Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) with a particular interest in Grayscale's crypto funds, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). I plan to retain this investment until Grayscale transitions it to an ETF, consequently eliminating the discount to NAV present in this closed-end fund. Presently, GBTC trades at a substantial 40.4% discount-a notable discrepancy seldom seen in U.S. traded closed-end funds. This significant discount seems unjustifiable, particularly in light of Grayscale's legal action against the SEC (I discussed that case in more depth here ) for preventing the conversion of GBTC into an ETF. The discount is wider than in my last article. Data by YCharts The litigation initiated by Grayscale indicates the firm's intent to transform the closed-end fund into an ETF/ETN, likely driven by obvious business motivations. Converting GBTC into an open-ended product would result in the creation of the largest crypto ETF based in the world. Typically, the largest ETF/ETN within a category begets a significant share of investment flows and therefore a very profitable fund to run. Note that I'm generally bullish on Bitcoin, and I've written countless articles on Bitcoin for Seeking Alpha (from back when it traded sub $1000, and there was still debate whether it should be discussed as an investment at all). If you don't like Bitcoin, you could still like a GBTC position but paired with a short in Bitcoin through the futures or a close proxy like MSTR, but these are advanced tactics, and if you're not an experienced trader, it's probably better to move on to another idea. There are 5 key drivers why I like a GBTC position. 1) Grayscale's oral arguments in the Grayscale vs SEC case went down very well. The court's decision can arrive between now and the end of the year (see timeline here ) 2) The tensions around the financial system are flaring up again driven by the news flow around First Republic ( FRC ). The latest banking crisis has clearly been a catalyst for crypto. I don't think it is a sustainable driver or that it should necessarily be a driver but the market does what it does without my blessing. Bitcoin's popularity is partly a result of the GFR and the resulting widespread unhappiness about the financial industry. That sentiment is now salient again. 3) Representative French Hill (of the Digital Asset Committee) and majority Whip Tom Emmer sent a letter (read the full text here ) to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, expressing concerns about the regulatory inconsistency in the treatment of spot bitcoin exchange-traded product applications. They argue that the SEC's refusal to approve spot bitcoin ETPs is inconsistent and doesn't consider other jurisdictions where similar products have been approved. They also criticize Gensler's differential treatment of bitcoin futures ETPs, which are allowed to trade in the U.S., and bitcoin spot ETPs, which are continually denied. Basically, this letter echoes Grayscale's argument in Grayscale vs SEC. However, I do think it is important there is additional pressure on the SEC to mend their ways. I happen to believe in the long-term viability of Bitcoin. However, I have tons of other investments, and I won't lose much sleep if it goes away. So, I'm biased but I don't think I'm emotionally overinvested in this asset class. While trying to weigh the merits objectively, I really do think the SEC has been treating Bitcoin a bit unfairly Grayscale has a good chance to be vindicated. 4) The next Bitcoin halving is likely less than a year away. In essence, the Bitcoin halving refers to the process where the rewards that miners receive for verifying and adding new transactions to the blockchain are cut in half. When Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, the reward for successfully mining a block was 50 Bitcoins. Since then, halvings have occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020, reducing the block reward to 25, 12.5, and 6.25 Bitcoins, respectively. The next halving is anticipated to take place around 2024, further reducing the reward to 3.125 Bitcoins per block. The reduction in supply (because the reward goes down but also because older mining equipment suddenly turns unprofitable) this tends to create a supply-demand imbalance, which can lead to an increase in the value of Bitcoin. As the number of new Bitcoins entering the market decreases, investors often anticipate a price surge due to scarcity. I browsed the internet looking for a chart that illustrates the effect of the halving and I found this fun chart by Blockchain center : Bitcoin halving chart (Blockchain center) Don't take the rainbow channel too seriously I guess, but the chart shows where the halvings happened and the price action afterward. You would expect traders to increasingly anticipate this event, and I have noticed talk of the halving starting to pick up. I believe that chatter will increase as the date comes closer and when Bitcoin's bullish price action corroborates that narrative. 5) The fifth reason is, of course, the discount. If Grayscale turns the closed-end fund into an ETF that's a 66% uplift by itself. That is compounded by Bitcoin price action. Given the fact that I'm bullish on Bitcoin that's a very attractive proposition. The 6) Technical generally still seem to be supportive of GBTC and Bitcoin. The 50-day GBTC MA just broke through the 200-day which is a classic technical signal but others paint a similar picture (although not exclusively so). Data by YCharts In conclusion, despite the setbacks in the crypto world and the ongoing battle between Grayscale and the SEC, there are compelling reasons to maintain a bullish stance on a GBTC position. The Grayscale vs. SEC case developments, increased pressure on the SEC from lawmakers, the anticipation of the next Bitcoin halving, and the substantial discount on GBTC all contribute to an attractive investment opportunity. Additionally, technical indicators generally support both GBTC and Bitcoin, offering further encouragement for investors. While the future remains uncertain, the potential for asymmetric returns (through the compounding effect of the discount and the price of Bitcoin) makes GBTC an appealing prospect for those with confidence in the long-term viability of Bitcoin and the transformation of the closed-end fund into an ETF.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4597684-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-underappreciated-opportunity-sec-battle-bitcoin-halving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12162634.jpeg

42393636,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1iq7,1682679572,Bitcoin Is Poised to Reclaim Crypto’s Spotlight: Berenberg,"In the next few months bitcoin (BTC) may be able to reclaim much of the attention it has relinquished to other crypto tokens and projects during recent years and the enthusiasm it lost during the crypto winter, German investment bank Berenberg said in a research report Thursday.  As U.S. regulators crack down on the industry, “almost every token appears at risk of being branded a security and becoming subject to an enforcement action,” the report said.  The sole exception is bitcoin, “which, by virtue of the decentralization stemming from the design of its blockchain protocol, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators characterize as a commodity rather than a security,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote.  The bank sees bitcoin’s price appreciation in the last few months as a sign that “more investors are recognizing it as a sensible alternative not only among crypto tokens, but also within a global financial context.”  The recent banking crisis in the U.S. and concerns over the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policies have led some countries to reduce their exposure to the U.S. dollar, which has fueled concerns about de-dollarization, the note said, and “could help to highlight bitcoin’s value proposition.” De-dollarization is the decline of the greenback’s dominance as the world’s global reserve currency.  The fourth bitcoin halving date, scheduled for May 2024, is another potential positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency, the report said, noting that “if history is any guide, then bitcoin could rally ahead of and after this much-anticipated halving.”  “The utility of the Bitcoin blockchain has been highlighted by the increasing traction gained by the Lightning Network,” the report added. The Lightning Network creates a layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain exploiting user-generated micropayment channels to conduct transactions more efficiently.

This even led to the de-peg of the ecosystem’s stablecoin, USTC, leading to another catalyst for the bears to exploit. Despite this, Terra Classic is putting in the work to re-anchor USTC to the US dollar. Recently, a proposal hit the community which could potentially fix the stablecoin situation. Proposal 11487, titled USTC Incremental Repeg, Buybacks, Staking, Swaps, aims to fix the problem through a series of steps that would ensure the stability of the stablecoin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Unload Billions Amid SHIB Price Retreat A Proposal To Fix USTC Fundamentals According to the Agora post dedicated to the proposal, two systems would be implemented if the proposal was accepted by the community, namely the Divergence Protocol and Protocol Buybacks. The Divergence protocol aims to work by penalizing sellers that sell the USTC below the current market price. For example, if the seller creates an order to sell USTC at $0.95, he will only get $0.90 in profit as the Divergence fee will be deducted from the transaction. RedlineDrifter, the mind behind the proposal, also said that the “protocol would be implemented across all USTC trading pairs both on and off-chain but not on regular blockchain transactions.” This means only trading activity will experience this system and not everyday transactions. The Divergence fee would then be used in the protocol buyback system that would automatically buy back USTC to defend the token’s peg to the US dollar.

12161522,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529023,1682676723,"Solana (SOL) Price Holds Ultra Strong, Bulls Target $25 Today?","The price of Solana (SOL) faced a key directional decision in recent days, and currently it looks like the bulls have the upper hand after a tough battle with the bears. However, the SOL price is not out of the woods yet. But a decision could come as early as today. Solana Poised To Rally Above $25? The crypto market is still heavily dependent on macro data from the US. And before the next FOMC meeting is due next week, the PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation metric, will be released today at 8:30 am EST (2:30 pm CET). This makes today the most important day of the week February’s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was +0.3% on a monthly basis, below the forecast of +0.4%. For March, analysts expect an unchanged increase of +0.3%. On an annual basis (YoY), an increase of 4.5% is expected, up from 4.6% in the previous month. If core inflation rates fall, a bullish reaction is expected in the crypto market, and Solana is perfectly positioned to deliver a massive upside bounce. Related Reading: Solana Faces A Trend Decision, But The Bull Case Prevails As we discussed in our analysis two days ago, SOL faced an extremely important trend decision on the 1-day chart over the past days. Already since the end of December 2022, Solana has formed an uptrend. However, the ascending trend line (black) was tested by the bears several times in the last few days. Currently, the SOL price is clearly above the trendline again. Thus, if the PCE in the US is favorable today, Solana could start a run towards the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue). Since Solana fell below the “bull line” on April 8, 2022, it is still technically in bear territory. In mid-April 2023, the first attempts failed. While Bitcoin and numerous altcoins are already trading above the 200-day EMA, SOL is still stuck below the trend indicator as a result of the FTX crash. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Topside Bias Vulnerable Unless It Surges Past $23 Holding the trendline could now be the impetus that catapults SOL price back towards the 200-day EMA and into bull territory. The border line is currently at $25.12. However, to confirm a new attempt, Solana needs to rise above $22.78. If SOL manages to stabilize above this resistance level, the buy side could again target the 200-day EMA. If this succeeds, the yearly high at $27.13 comes into focus, where the 38.2% Fibonacci level is also located. Remarkably, the current strength of Solana can also be seen in the SOL/BTC chart (1-hour). At press time, SOL was just about to break the downtrend in the lower time frame. A move towards 0.0008018 seems possible.

Berenberg initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating and a $430 price target. The shares slid about 2% in premarket trading Friday to $312.  The business analytics software company founded by Michael Saylor, now executive chairman, is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin as a balance sheet treasury asset. It owns about 140,000 bitcoins that it paid an average price of $29,800 for. The stash is worth about $4.1 billion at current prices.  MicroStrategy's shares offer an “attractive way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin and to navigate the digital asset space amidst the ongoing regulatory crackdown,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote.  “Bitcoin has emerged as a safe haven relative to other crypto tokens,” Palmer's note said. If investors “increasingly turn to bitcoin as an alternative currency amidst macro-related fears, then MicroStrategy shares stand poised to benefit.”  The fourth bitcoin halving, scheduled for May 2024, may serve as a positive catalyst for bitcoin's price and by extension, for MicroStrategy shares, the note added.

The ECB is pondering whether to issue a retail central bank digital currency for use by regular traders and citizens, but it also wants to use blockchain technology in wholesale financial transactions.  The central banks that use the euro currency, known collectively as the Eurosystem, are “to look into how wholesale financial transactions recorded on DLT platforms could be settled in central bank money,” according to a statement issued by the ECB on Friday. The ECB is convening an industry group to help, it said.  The announcement reflects mounting interest in the technology from traditional financial markets, including for post-trade infrastructure that completes deals struck in trading venues. Euroclear, a Brussels-based firm that specializes in clearing and settlement, is set to release a new platform for DLT-based bond trading shortly, and Forge, the crypto arm of French bank Societe Generale, has introduced the CoinVertible stablecoin (EURCV), pegged to the euro, to settle transactions that involve digital assets.  In remarks made to the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on Monday, Fabio Panetta, a member of the ECB's executive board, said that “working to make the European payment and financial system more competitive … requires working on several fronts,” not just the retail digital euro.  “We already have a wholesale CBDC – a digital infrastructure that allows banks to make interbank payments,” Panetta said, citing the ECB’s system known as TARGET2. “We are now assessing whether the technology, which we use, the centralized technology operated by the Eurosystem, needs to be updated to be more easily interoperable with intermediaries that might be adopting distributed ledger technology.”  Read more: Bye-bye Brokers: EU Tries Stock Trading, the Web3 Way",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/28/ecb-probes-decentralized-settlement-for-wholesale-financial-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de8cc63ba8197de0a8d402dd54cbae94188374cc-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393652,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1jun,1682671497,"Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Profitable for First Time in 11 Months, Blockchain Data Shows","Blockchain data shows long-term holders of bitcoin (BTC) are profitable for the first in almost a year. Historically, renewed profitability for long-term holders has presaged major market rallies.  The seven-day average of bitcoin's ""long-term holder spent output profit ratio,"" or LTH-SOPR, has crossed above one for the first time since May 2022, according to data tracking firm Glassnode.  The SOPR is the ratio in U.S. dollar value of unspent transaction output, or UTXO, at its creation to the value at which the concerned wallet spends the UTXO on-chain. UTXO is a transaction output that hasn't been used as an input in a new transaction. You can think of UTXOs as leftover change money in your pocket.  If wallet X sends one bitcoin to wallet Y, it is assumed that the former is spending or selling coins to the latter. If the value at which X moved coins to Y was higher than at acquisition, X is said to have realized profit. A SOPR ratio above 1 indicates that coins moved, on average, are being sold for a profit.  The long-term holder SOPR focuses on coins moved on-chain that have a lifespan of at least 155 days.  ""The long-term holder SOPR variant tends to reflect macro market shifts better. Following an extended period of realized losses (LTH-SOPR < 1), the LTH cohort is finally transitioning back into a regime of profitable spending, a structure similar once again to past cycle transition points,"" Glassnode analyst James Check said in a weekly note.  The ratio's latest move above one comes amid bitcoin's recovery from bear market depths. At the current price of $29,500, the cryptocurrency is up 90% from the low of $15,460 recorded last November.  The ratio's previous crossovers dated above one – dated May 2020, May 2019 and November 2015 – also coincided with recovery rallies that eventually translated into multi-year bull runs.  The chart shows extreme sub-1 readings have historically marked periods of investor capitulation, which coincided with market bottoms. Meanwhile, values above 10 have signaled market tops.  SOPR above one to create resistance  While the ratio's crossover above zero might imply a positive market cycle ahead, in the short run, it could slow down the cryptocurrency's rise.  ""The LTH cohort at the moment consists of many 2021-22 cycle holders, many of whom remain underwater and are likely to create resistance throughout the market recovery,"" Check noted.  South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant voiced a similar opinion, saying a return to profitability might inject selling pressure to the market.  ""From an on-chain data perspective, bitcoin's price could be pressured to the downside by higher spending from whales [large investors] and long-term holders taking profits at the highest margin in almost a year,"" CryptoQuant said in a report shared with CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/28/bitcoin-holders-are-profiting-for-first-time-since-may-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ef2fd8ae2c02393377b281969e8c189fabbc760-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SEBC currently supports 11 trading pairs. Listing tokens on exchanges in Japan requires vetting by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association.

12159613,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529033,1682671273,Why Coinbase CEO Believes SEC’s Crypto Warning Is Harmful To The US,"Coinbase Global and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have been at loggerheads for some time, and on Friday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong released a video message calling the SEC’s warning “not constructive” and “not good for America.” The friction between Coinbase and the SEC is part of a bigger attempt by the US government to regulate the cryptocurrency sector. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has called for cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the agency, which is the source of the animosity between Coinbase and the SEC. This warning was issued by Armstrong in response to a Wells Notice that was delivered to Coinbase a month ago. The Wells Notice stated that the staff of the SEC had formed a “preliminary determination” to suggest an enforcement action for Coinbase for violating federal securities laws. Coinbase CEO Opens Up On SEC’s Hardline Crypto Stance In response to the Wells notice, Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States by volume, filed a letter to the SEC arguing that the regulator’s staff’s legal arguments are “flawed and untested” and that an enforcement action “would present major programmatic risks to the commission.” While Armstrong made it clear in his video that he was ready to take on the SEC in court, Coinbase’s written response to the SEC claimed that the agency’s threat of litigation “appears intended to pressure” the organization into agreeing with the SEC’s position that all cryptoassets on the Coinbase platform are securities. Coinbase Lawyer Says They’re Ready To Cooperate With SEC Also featured in the video was Coinbase’s chief legal officer, who indicated the company was ready to visit the SEC at any time to create a feasible future for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States. In the 14 days since 2023 rolled in, the SEC has taken action against crypto entities and individuals with 14 separate orders of enforcement. Crypto staking schemes offered by other exchanges including Bittrex and Kraken have also been accused of offering the sale of unregistered securities. Coinbase has responded by saying it will oppose any regulation of its own staking scheme, which is distinct from Kraken’s. Despite claims from the SEC staff that Coinbase’s staking services constitute investment contracts, Coinbase maintains that it does not list, clear, or affect trading in securities through its platform.

Regulatory bodies and industry participants alike are struggling to find a middle ground between fostering innovation and ensuring the safety of the cryptocurrency market, and the ongoing conflict between Coinbase and the SEC is a microcosm of this broader fight. While the final resolution of this issue is still up in the air, it highlights the importance of maintaining open lines of communication and working together among all necessary parties to promote the success of the crypto business in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. -Featured image from Coinpedia",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-coinbase-ceo-believes-secs-crypto-warning-is-harmful-to-the-us/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42393640,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1jAd,1682669932,Argo Blockchain Slumps to Full-Year Loss on Bitcoin Price Slide,"Argo Blockchain (ARB), the only U.K.-listed cryptocurrency miner, slumped to a full-year loss in 2022 as the price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped and mining difficulty increased, driving up costs as revenue fell.  The London-based company reported a net loss of 194.2 million British pounds (US$240 million), or 40.98 pence a share, compared with net income of 30.8 million pounds, or 7.4 pence, the year before, it said in a statement. The bitcoin price slumped more than 60% last year.  Miners across the board struggled in 2022 as revenue declined alongside the bitcoin price while energy costs soared and the difficulty of mining a bitcoin block, which is when they are rewarded, soared. While rivals such as Core Scientific and Compute North filed for bankruptcy protection, Argo avoided the same fate by agreeing to sell its Helios mining facility in Dickens Country, Texas, to Galaxy Digital for $65 million. It also negotiated a new $35 million loan from investor Michael Novogratz’s crypto-focused financial-services firm, secured by its mining equipment.  Argo's mining margin widened to 45%-50% in the first quarter from 35% in the fourth quarter, while daily bitcoin production rose 5%. Argo said it will now focus on its operations in Quebec, Canada, where it operates two sites totaling 20 megawatts (MW) of power, according to its website.  ""Having navigated challenging market conditions in both the crypto sector and the global economy in the second half of 2022, Argo has emerged stronger and in a much more solid financial position,"" interim CEO Seif El-Bakly said in the statement. Peter Wall resigned as CEO almost three months ago.  The flagship Helios site didn't have a fixed-rate power agreement, which meant costs rose sharply amid the 2022 energy crisis. Argo tried to raise funds to avoid bankruptcy, then eventually decided to sell the site, which has the potential of reaching 800 MW of power consumption.  The firm ended the year with 2.5 exahash/second of computing power, slightly less than the 3.2 EH/s it foresaw in August 2022.  Argo is one of a handful of companies that agreed to buy chipmaking giant Intel's (INTC) bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) in February 2022. It is designed a mining rig using those chips along with hardware maker ePIC Blockchain. Intel last week said it is discontinuing the product line while ePIC Blockchain is promoting the Intel-based machines on its website to other customers.  Argo said it expects to receive 2,870 units of the Intel-based chips early in the third quarter.  Shares of the company fell 5% as of mid-morning on the London Stock Exchange.

Yuen wrote that the HKMA has reminded banks to adhere to a “risk-based approach” when conducting due diligence and refrain from one-size-fits-all approaches to rejecting account opening applications.  He acknowledges that some virtual businesses may present higher anti-money laundering risks and banks may be more cautious when processing account opening applications. He also notes that banking staff have less experience in dealing with new markets and may be turning customers away to avoid hassle.  Hong Kong has been giving virtual asset services providers more regulatory clarity in a bid to attract more companies to the jurisdiction.  The regulator released a circular on the same day to clarify best practices for offering banking services.

Bernstein analysts foresee Bitcoin’s long-awaited mainstream adoption could be potentially triggered by the US banking crisis. The analysts suggest that the current state of the banking system will fuel a “new crypto cycle,” driven by mass migration to self-custody wallets. In a note seen by CNBC, analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal noted: “The safe haven signal will lead to a new crypto cycle, pushing digital wallets as on-chain savings accounts. The gap between Treasury rates and bank deposit rates will continue to hollow out banks, with weak balance sheets leading to another round of mass migration to money markets.” According to Bernstein analysts, with recent events causing widespread financial uncertainty, investors are increasingly looking towards alternative investment options such as Bitcoin. Related Reading: “Buy Bitcoin,” Says Messari CEO Amid Market Downtrend BTC Continues Its Uptrend Despite the supposed buy signal, Bitcoin (BTC) hasn’t made any significant move yet. Instead, it has only seemed to picked up from its slowed-down uptrend in recent weeks. Over the past 24 hours, the top crypto has surged only 1.5% with a market price of $29,402, at the time of writing. This gearing uptrend comes after a notable fall from the $30,000 region in recent weeks. So far, Bitcoin has a 24-hour range between a low of $28,748 and a high of $29,869. Alongside its price, the BTC market cap has also seen an uptrend. Its trading volume signals buying pressure indicating a possible continuous bullish trend. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s market capitalization have surged from a low of $527 billion on April 22 to as high as $569 billion as of today. Its trading volume has also spiked from a daily trading volume of $19 billion to $23.3 billion, over the same period. Implications Of The Banking Crisis On Bitcoin According to Bernstein analysts, the growing banking crisis in the US could have significant implications for the future of Bitcoin. They predict that the crisis will cause another round of money printing and dollar debasement by the Federal Reserve. This will once again bring Bitcoin back into the spotlight as digital gold. Cryptocurrency has long been touted as a hedge against inflation, and its value is often seen as an alternative to traditional safe-haven assets such as gold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Keep Pushing, Why Rally Isn’t Over Yet Notably, Bitcoin has since been publicized to be the future of finance and with the current state of the banking system, its potential to become the future of finance is becoming increasingly clear. While traditional banks struggle with weak balance sheets and low-interest rates, Bitcoin continues to gain value and recognition as a legitimate investment option. Its decentralized nature and lack of reliance on traditional financial institutions make it an attractive option for investors looking to protect their assets in times of economic uncertainty. With Bernstein analysts predicting a new crypto cycle and recommending that investors “buy Bitcoin,” it’s safe to say that the cryptocurrency is set to play an increasingly important role in the future of finance.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin steadies itself comfortably above $29K. One analyst says that investors are now looking for assets that retain their value.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $29,500, up roughly 2.2% over the past 24 hours. BTC topped $30,000 at one point, near its earlier week highs but still well off its April peak close to $31,000. Still, investors seem to have forgotten Wednesday's dramatic seesawing when the crypto dipped to around $27,200 amid a mass liquidation of short and long positions and separate unfounded rumors of bitcoin sales – by the U.S. government and of crypto from failed exchange Mt. Gox – before rebounding.  Since spiking approximately 40% in January, bitcoin and other cryptos have been stubbornly resistant to industry mishaps and wider macroeconomic uncertainty.  ""The operative word here is resilience,"" said Michael Sonnenshein, CEO at crypto asset management company Grayscale Investments, told CoinDesk TV on the opening day of the Consensus 2023 conference in Austin, Texas. ""Despite recent setbacks whether it be trust or certain businesses that were once integral to crypto that are no longer around, what we're seeing is resilience.""  Sonnenshein added: ""It's really encouraging time and again as this industry gets challenged, it demonstrates its strengths and comes out stronger.""  Grayscale and CoinDesk share the same parent company, Digital Currency Group.  Ether was recently trading above $1,910, up about 0.8% from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptocurrencies were recently up marginally little more than 36 hours after they had fallen well into the red. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, recently climbed 0.8%.  U.S. equity markets rose as surprisingly strong earnings from tech giants Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and, most recently Meta Platforms, trumped concerns about unexpectedly sluggish 1.1% growth in first-quarter GDP and the struggles of regional bank First Republic. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, climbed 2.4% and 2%, respectively.  Investors will now be focusing on next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision. The CME FedWatch Tool is currently showing an 87% probability of a third consecutive 25-basis point rate hike, although Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email that the U.S. central bank is close to ending this type of monetary hawkishness. The Federal Reserve will be able to move forward with one, perhaps two, more rate hikes, ""but then that should be it,"" Moya wrote. ""Today’s economic data painted a picture of an economy that is slowing down, inflation is temporarily accelerating, and the labor market is softening.""  Meanwhile, Bob Baxley, chief technology officer at decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Maverick Protocol, told CoinDesk's Jocelyn Yang that bitcoin’s performance in recent days reflects investors’ confidence in the crypto’s ability to hold value even during unsettling events.  “Bitcoin and other crypto assets have clearly been performing as the sort of safe haven that many had hoped this technology class would become,” Baxley told CoinDesk in an email.

The original ""Star Trek"" captain and longtime Twitter crypto guy officially dropped his non-fungible token (NFT) release, Infinite Connections, at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference.  Infinite Connections comprises two collections: Cosmic Explorer, with 2,500 NFTs that feature a Shatner 3D avatar paired with artwork that explores scientific themes like quantum physics and sonic vibrations. Each one also includes a physical action figure of Captain James T. Kirk, the role for which Shatner is best known, each hand-signed by Shatner with a quote from the character.  The other collection is Timeless Voyager, which includes 1,000 NFTs of 2D artwork of future tech and the cosmos. There’s no action figure included, but “select” holders will have access to unspecified IRL opportunities.  ""NFTs are slowly becoming more artistic,"" Shatner said backstage at the conference. ""These, developed by Orange Comet, are among the most artistic that I've ever seen.""  To create and release his collection, Shatner worked with Orange Comet, a Web3 entertainment company that recently raised $7 million in a funding round. The company has also worked with former National Basketball Association star Scottie Pippen, Sir Anthony Hopkins and the hit TV show ""The Walking Dead.""  Orange Comet CEO Dave Broome, who also spoke at the conference, revealed how the deal with Shatner occurred, and how Shatner's intellectual curiosity was a key component.  ""This is a man at 92 who is still inquiring, and still has an ability to learn and embrace technology and understanding what it could do,"" Broome said. ""What we're interested in doing is taking someone like iconic legendary William Shatner and all of the millions and millions of fans that he has, and bring them over into web3.""

42420668,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqWXV,1682640961,3 Giga-Brained Ideas From Consensus Day 2,"One of the major selling points of crypto is that the industry is brimming with new ideas. For one reason or another, crypto tends to attract heterodox thinkers or would-be revolutionaries, much in the same way a loose-hanging community formed around the internet in the 1990s. Part of this stems from the nature of the tech itself, which offers radically new ways to build code-based systems. Another is Web3’s infamous barrier to entry, meaning the people that end up here tend to be committed – and, frankly, smart enough not to get blown out while self-custodying valuable assets.  This article is excerpted from The Node newsletter, which will send two editions daily during the Consensus 2023 conference running down the biggest news from the event. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here or register to attend or livestream Consensus 2023 here.  At the same time, after covering the industry for nearly four years, I often feel as if I’m repeatedly hearing the same ideas. Crypto markets, perhaps more than any other, hang on what insider’s call “narratives.” These are the stories people tell themselves and others about what blockchain technology is good for (or could be good for).  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Still, once in a while, a person or a theory comes along that could truly shake things up (or at the very least are fun to entertain). Here are a few of the giga-brained ideas I heard while roaming around Consensus today.  The future of banking is in the past  Ethan Buchman, the founder of Informal Systems, wants to wage a revolution. Central banks have mishandled the economies they’re meant to support, the “petro-dollar” has caused untold suffering and there are layers of corruption at every level of the monetary system. Of course, blockchain presents a solution. But before he explains how, Buchman wants us to consider the past.  Imagine yourself as a Genoese banker in the 16th century, shortly after double-entry bookkeeping was discovered. At the time, Buchman said the banking industry was composed of a few family-run institutions that sprouted to supply a modernizing and globalizing economy with credit (perhaps for the first time in history). There were no central banks, no depository institutions and few, if any, bank notes.  Instead, what bankers offered at the time was “trade credit,” entries in a ledger that allowed for someone in Antwerp to transact with someone in Medina. Occasionally, because the environment was high-trust, the banking families would meet up to balance their books. To do this, they used an old term-of-art called the “payments graph.”  It’s hard to visualize, but if Cosimo owes money to Catalina, and Catalina owes Albrecht and Leonardo owes Cosimo, there is often a way to map out these deficits to allow everyone to settle their debts – without necessarily injecting extra liquidity into the system. This was done by finding “loops” and “cycles of debt” that allowed banks to zero out their books.  Buchman wants to resurrect this idea for the modern age. The game, which requires collaboration and communication, works because debt can be “cleared” (balanced on paper) without being settled (having funds actually transferred). To this end, Informal Systems, which operates as a workers collective, is building Cosmos-based smart contracts and algorithms that allow communities to do this permissionlessly and automatically.  See also: Open Source: What It Is and Why It's Critical for Crpto  “You show up at a trade fair [the banking conferences of the time] with books reflecting debt, and you mess around with your friends and you wipe out all your f**king debt,” he explained. Indeed, modern banks still do this on a near-daily level using clearing-house and discount windows. “But why should they get to have all the fun,” he said.  What Informal called “collaborative finance,” or CoFi for short, may not work at all. The company has not yet even released a full white paper. But in an age where my peers are saddled with student loans and where international trade imbalances reflect the “structure of power and production in the economy” after centuries of exploitation, maybe it’s worth thinking of an alternative.  For now, you can read more about the idea here. Or you can read the paper that inspired Buchman here.  Crypto and AI  I’ll spare you the rundown of how ChatGPT unlocked a wave of venture capital funding and Silicon Valley-based startup founding, and the history of failed Web3 experiments with artificial intelligence, to say that a lot of people in crypto are now thinking seriously about AI. Some of the uses are prosaic, like building chatbots to help people better understand a jargon-filled industry. Others seem inhumane such as using code to replace coders, to operate Web3 startups with a leaner team. And there’s probably no worse idea than outsourcing smart contract auditing to systems prone to “hallucination.”  Still, Tarun Chitra, the founder of Gauntlet, who is widely acknowledged to be one of the sharpest minds in crypto , thinks blockchains can be useful for AI. The long and short of it is: As more information is produced by machines it’ll become more important to know where all data is sourced from.  Zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptography research area proposed in the 1980s and thrown into hyper-drive by cryptocurrency funding, allows people to check whether someone else’s statement is true without that person having to show all their cards. (The standard description of a “ZK proof” is that a barfly can prove they’re over 21 without pulling out their ID, which also reveals their home address.)  ZK proofs can be deployed in a way that helps everyone prove whether some new data was produced by a human, by a machine or by a machine with access to some particular data set (like an AI trained on proprietary information on Q&A site Quora). “This is quite important because a particular output … is going to be the IP [intellectual property] of the future,” Chitra said on stage at Consensus.  As mentioned, ZK-based systems do not necessarily need crypto to operate, but blockchain can still play an important role by providing immutable records of data provenance, he said. Verifiability is powerful in an increasingly trustless age.  Tech support  Finally, on Wednesday the Near Foundation announced a new project called Horizons that is essentially a startup accelerator mixed with Uber. CoinDesk has a writeup of the system here, which will allow anyone with the idea for a startup to essentially crowdfund funding and business advice from experts.  The system uses a two-way marketplace that takes an idea from Uber, which allows startups to rate the level of support they received from their advisers and advisers to rate the founding team, Horizon co-creator Laura Cunningham told The Node in an interview. It’s what she called a “reputation graph.”  See also: Introducing CoinDesk's 'Consensus at Consensus' Project  Obviously, not every startup will make it, as some business ideas are just plain bad. But using smart contracts to inject a little visibility into the process perhaps everyone can learn. Because, as crypto has shown, sometimes an idea can be valuable even if it hasn’t been deployed.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/28/3-giga-brained-ideas-from-consensus-day-2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52f84666d7055d2fbef9d232a59cf98b24127589-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
