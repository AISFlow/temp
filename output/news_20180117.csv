42380272,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MdFr,1516228204,Milestone: Cboe's First Bitcoin Futures Contract Expired Today,"The first bitcoin futures contract listed by Cboe has expired, a move that came amid a turbulent day of trading that saw the cryptocurrency's price drop below $10,000.  First listed in mid-December, the futures had a rocky start but ultimately those platform issues were resolved. The opening day for the contract saw the price climbing above $15,000.  According to data from CNBC, the F8 contract settled at a price of $11,055, a notable development considering that, at one point today, the price of bitcoin slid to as low as $9,199.59, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Yet in the period of time after the F8 contract settled, bitcoin's price appears to be reversing the trend it has seen in the past two days. At press time, the BPI is reporting a price of $11,344.66 – a figure that is just several dollars above the day's open.  Cboe  data suggests that the market for its G8 contract (set to expire on 2/14) is trading slightly below the market, with the firm's official website reporting a price of $11,220.00.  As for what the future will bring for Cboe's work in the cryptocurrency space, a recent press event covered by Bloomberg suggests that the company may explore products built around other coins – but that is likely to come after more months of work around the futures product.  Speaking to reporters, CEO Ed Tilly said that the process could lead to something like an ETF – a long-sought product – but only if regulators are firmly on board.  ""Before you get into mainstream [exchange-traded products], we need to get through a series of settlements before that makes sense to regulators,"" Tilly was quoted as saying, adding:  ""Those boxes have to be checked before theres' a mass roll-out of exchange-traded products.""

Improving ""anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)” rules is one part of regulating the ""evolving threat"" of cryptocurrencies, according to Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker, who testified before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Wednesday.  Financial institutions need to implement new rules to ensure they are complying with new regulations, which will include a new ""due diligence"" rule which takes effect in May 2018, she said.  Cryptocurrency exchanges fall under this umbrella, Mandelker said, outlining how the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) would work with exchanges to ensure criminal parties were not using cryptocurrencies to transfer funds.  She explained:  “To ensure that virtual currency providers and exchangers know the rules and follow them, FinCEN has prioritized engagement with – and examination of – these entities, focusing both on the approximately 100 that have registered with FinCEN as money transmitters as required, as well as those that have not.”  The agency has partnered with the Internal Revenue Service to recommend actions some of these exchanges can take to better comply with existing regulations, she said. Mandelker also noted that the U.S. is cooperating with other countries to regulate cryptocurrencies in general.  The European Union is in the process of developing more stringent regulations for financial institutions to prevent terrorist financing.as well, she said.  FinCEN has already begun taking enforcement actions as well, she said, citing the U.S.’s shutdown and fine on the former BTC-e exchange, as well as the fine on its alleged operator Alexander Vinnik.

Released Wednesday, the draft circular from the Israel Tax Authority proposes imposing a value-added tax (VAT) on ICOs, differentiating them into two types: service transactions and sales transactions. The draft appeared to indicate that goods or services offered to foreign residents would result in ""a zero tax invoice"" under current law.  While the draft outlines possible methods for taxing companies launching token sales, it does not touch cryptocurrencies directly, according to an announcement posted on the agency's website.  The draft detailed different classifications for companies launching campaigns involving the blockchain use case, focusing on the kinds of products or services the company offered as well as whatever profit model it may take.  Token sales which reap more than 15 million Israeli new shekels (INS) in revenue will be subject to bookkeeping regulations in accordance with existing law, according to the draft.  The amount of taxes owed can fluctuate if a company determines its dues at the end of a year – as opposed to during the year – with the text going on to explain:  ""In cases where the tax liability is determined on a cash basis, at the end of the year, the buyer or recipient of a service is a resident of Israel or vice versa, it is possible that the tax rate for the transaction will change according to the provisions of the VAT Law.""  Investors who sell the tokens they had already purchased from an ICO would be subject to taxation as well, the circular explained. However, groups which trade as a business would be ""classified and registered as a financial institution"" specifically for tax purposes, according to the draft.  The circular emphasized it was subject to change, and the Israel Tax Authority is looking for public input on the provisions outlined.

42380274,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MdH7,1516208248,BitConnect Investors Left in the Lurch as Token's Price Drops 90%,"The price of BitConnect's controversial cryptocurrency has cratered following Tuesday's news that its lending and exchange operation is shutting down – and investors have been unable to sell their tokens despite claims the site would stay online this week.  The closure of BitConnect's lending and exchange platform was a major development given that its sales pitch prominently features the promised returns from lending out the currency, known as BCC, via the site. After the announcement, the price of BCC tanked on the few public markets on which the cryptocurrency trades.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, BCC was trading above $400 at the start of 2018, yet in the wake of Tuesday's bombshell, the price has fallen by more than 90%, trading at roughly $17.25 per coin as of press time  Akin to high-yield investment plans, BitConnect touted larger returns based on the amount loaned (users would deposit bitcoin and buy BCC in order to lend).  As might be expected, BitConnect drew comparisons to cryptocurrency investment schemes such as OneCoin, which was widely believed to be a pyramid scheme.  The allegation that BitConnect is a Ponzi scheme – in which earlier investors are effectively rewarded with the proceeds of new investors – gained traction in recent weeks as state regulators in the U.S. issued cease-and-desist letters to the outfit in connection with an initial coin offering.  The mix of regulatory scrutiny and ""bad press"" was ultimately blamed for the platform shutdowns. And now, users are crying foul and searching for answers amid a wider plunge in cryptocurrency markets.  The situation is playing out across disparate social media channels, with the main BitConnect subreddit being set to private (it has been alleged that this was done intentionally by the subreddit's moderators).  Exchange down already  In its announcement yesterday, BitConnect said that it would close its lending market effective immediately, but that its exchange for the BCC token would remain open for the rest of the week.  Yet users are reporting on social media that this is not the case, complaining that the site isn't allowing them to process trades because the exchange is unavailable.    @bitconnect doesn’t allow me to get my money. I can’t exchange to Bitcoins. #bitconnectworthless pic.twitter.com/nfOpQc660b        — Bea Jacobs (@nbjacobs1) January 17, 2018      In an email to CoinDesk, one BitConnect investor, who claimed to have lost upwards of $400k, reported being unable to cash in BCC tokens via the exchange.  [Update: In a follow-up post to its website on Jan. 17, BitConnect said that it would allow access to its exchange ""tomorrow.]  With the BitConnect subreddit closed off to public viewing, some investors have since shifted to the r/cryptocurrency subreddit to further discuss the situation.  The posts suggest that the financial fallout from the BitConnect mess could reach into the millions of dollars, if not more. BitConnect once offered a referral program, and numerous accounts relate how supporters solicited friends and family to invest as well.  Indeed, some of the ire has also been directed at YouTube posters who advocated for BitConnect, with some of those being accused of removing positive videos in light of the platform closures.  An email from CoinDesk to the BitConnect team was not returned by press time.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing situation.

Both funds went live on their respective exchanges at 9:30 a.m. EST. Reality Shares' Nasdaq NextGen Economy ETF (BLCN) opened at $24.20, while Amplify's Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) started closer to $20.  Both ETFs will exclusively invest in blockchain-based companies, according to a previous CoinDesk article. When the prospectuses were first filed in November 2017, the companies noted that investing in blockchain startups could be risky, as there are few regulations on the technology and companies may not necessarily turn a profit.  However, the prospectuses also noted that the funds would only invest in companies with a market capitalization of greater than $200 million and which had a six-month daily trading average of at least $1 million.  Reality Shares has developed an index with Nasdaq to track blockchain startups which the ETF will utilize, said Kian Salehizadeh, an analyst with Reality Shares. Nasdaq's blockchain research team forms part of the index's contributors. The index is further supported by an algorithm developed by Reality Shares.  Salehizadeh continued:  ""We wanted to do a blockchain technology-related ETF, so not another bitcoin fund but something that takes advantage of the underlying ecosystem. So we developed a methodology in-house which measures seven quantitative factors and we run those factors on a universe of publicly traded [data].""  He further told CoinDesk that the company's ETF originally contained the word ""blockchain"" in its name, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had his company remove the term.  While the SEC has not formally issued an approval of the ETFs, the lack of a formal disapproval means the ETFs were automatically approved under current law, Salehizadeh explained. At present, the SEC has 75 days to issue a disapproval or objection to an ETF filing. If no such disapproval or objection is stated, the funds can be listed.  Companies have previously filed for blockchain-based ETFs, but none had made it as far as listing prior to Reality Shares and Amplify Trust. Most recently, Horizons ETFs Management filed for a blockchain ETF in November.  Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated both ETFs appear on Nasdaq's exchange.

42380277,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MdKt,1516194027,"As Bitcoin's Slide Continues, Prices Look Towards $8K","Bitcoin looks like it might soon test near-$8,000 levels, as December's record-breaking rally continues to unravel.  With major losses over the last few days seemingly brought about by negative regulatory news from China and South Korea, bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $10,280 levels at time of writing, according to Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  A slight recovery from the 1.5-month low of $10,064 hit yesterday ran out of steam at $11,698 at 00:20 UTC today, and price once more started to drop. The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 14.35 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.  With the indicators still all in bearish territory, the technical charts indicate scope for a drop close to $8,000 levels.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Bitcoin closed (as per UTC) well below the Dec. 30 low of $12,500 yesterday, marking a bearish breakdown.  Bitcoin has breached the support of the ascending trendline (drawn from Sep. 15 low and Nov. 12 low).  The 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) carry a strong bearish bias (sloping downwards).  The relative strength index (RSI) also remains bearish.  The above technical factors clearly favor a further drop towards $8,690 – the support of the trendline sloping upwards from Jul. 16 low and Sep. 15 low.  However, the bears are struggling to take bitcoin below $10,313 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 rally) in a convincing manner, and yesterday's dip below that level was short-lived. As for today, prices quickly recovered from the $10,070 (intraday low) to above $10,313.  4-hour chart  As seen in the chart above, yesterday's long-legged doji candle was accompanied by a surge in trading volumes, indicating strong dip demand at $9,928 (doji candle low).  View  The broader outlook remains bearish as indicated by the daily chart. Prices look set to test $8,690–$8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 rally) in the next few days.  A close (as per UTC) today below $10,313 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would boost the odds of a convincing break below $9,928 (4-hour doji candle low) and a slide towards $8,690–$8,052 levels.

42380273,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MdC5,1516190445,"To Understand Bitcoin, I Studied Karl Marx","Tom Goldenberg is chief technology officer at Commandiv, a combined stock and crypto trading platform providing investors with automated trade recommendations and rebalancing tools.    To hear all of the bluster and hype about bitcoin and blockchain these days, you would think that it will solve all of our modern world problems.      Web 3.0 is coming – a new digital age. No industry will avoid disruption, whether healthcare, government, finance or retail.      Yet this may be, to quote the author Antonio Garcia Martinez:    ""The monumental hubris of assuming that the cure for our social ills lies in some as-yet uninvented future, rather than some forgotten past.""    There is much that we can learn from history – as much as we can discover through new technologies.      That's why I delved into Marxism to understand more about what bitcoin is really about.    Reading Satoshi's white paper    I sat down and read Satoshi Nakamoto’s original white paper on bitcoin last month, and I must say that my mind was truly blown. It is a remarkable work.      Yet I had several unanswered questions:      What events influenced the ideas behind bitcoin?  Why would the author choose to be anonymous?  Is bitcoin really what Satoshi says it is? Is it what he (or she, or they) meant it to be?      As I reflected on these questions, I arrived at an insight that I believe applies to both Satoshi and Marx:    ""Genius is creative, but not predictive.""    That is, both Marx and Satoshi articulated a reasoned, well-thought-out vision of the future. But neither had the power to predict how their ideas would influence others or be implemented. And neither could control their own creations.    Genius is often reactionary    Marx's ideas on communism and economics were influenced by his environment. It was that same environment that affected the propagation of his ideas – a fear of industrialization ; that new technology would render laborers useless.      That's ironic, because it also describes our current environment, with the rise of artificial intelligence.      The term ""Luddite"" refers to an actual group of the time that was against new technology. These changes, and the huge inequalities between the industrialists and the workers, prompted Marx to criticize capitalism heavily and propose a communal system instead.      Bitcoin is also a product of its environment. The Satoshi white paper was first published in 2008, shortly after the 2007 recession. That event caused an erosion of public trust in financial institutions that, to this day, is still in disrepair. Thus, the idea to bypass institutions was born.    Removing centralization    Marx and Satoshi approached their respective problems in a somewhat similar way. Marx advocated for a stateless system, where the worker controlled the means of production. Private property would be abandoned for the notion of communal property, and the state would ""wither away,"" in the phrasing of Marx's frequent co-author Friedrich Engels.      Obviously, this withering did not happen in the countries where communists took over the state – the opposite happened, with horrific results.      Satoshi sought to remove financial intermediaries – the banks and credit card companies that controlled the world's flow of value. Instead, a peer-to-peer network would be established, with no central authority. The network would be carefully crafted so that no single actor could influence transactions wrongfully.    Devil in the details    As brilliant as the idea for bitcoin may be, its reality today is inarguably different from what Satoshi envisioned. In the white paper, bitcoin is described as follows:    ""A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.""    While this is not necessarily wrong, this is not how bitcoin is primarily used today.      Satoshi failed to predict bitcoin's difficulty scaling to billions of transactions. The fees for buying and selling bitcoin, as well as the inability of the network to quickly process transactions, have changed its very nature. It is now used less as a payment method, and more as a store of digital wealth.      Bitcoin's main use cases today are as a speculative instrument (many traders are enticed by the large price swings) and as a ""digital gold."" That's not how Satoshi originally envisioned its adoption.      Marx, as noted above, similarly failed to anticipate how his own ideology could be used to manipulate and exploit populations. The idea of a stateless economy became, in practice, totalitarianism. Populists who claimed to have the workers' best interests at heart would succumb to the temptation of power.    Their legacies    Yet, both bitcoin and Marxist thought continue to live on, in adapted forms.      Marxism influenced several labor movements in the United States, and Marx's critiques of capitalism are still echoed by both economists and grassroots movements. Further, several nations have adopted social democracies promoting a more communal form of capitalism.      As for bitcoin, its future is playing out in front of us now. It may not be the final solution (a phrase with its own historical baggage) for peer-to-peer payments. But as a digital commodity, it has revolutionized the way people store wealth.      Marx and Satoshi were both great minds, and their creations will continue to influence coming generations. That does not mean that they knew or could control how those ideas would spawn to life. We can honor their gifts, while acknowledging that they do not have the full, perfect answer.

Called Lightning Charge, the system complements Blockstream’s existing Lightning Network implementation ""c-lightning"" and is intended to make life easier for developers creating Lightning-powered payments applications, the firm said.  According to a company blog post:  ""Together, these additions make it easy for developers to use c-lightning to create their own, independent web-payment infrastructures.""  Lightning Charge is written in node.js and its features can be accessed using an API via its JavaScript and PHP libraries, both of which are part of Blockstream's Elements Project.  ""Web developers will ... get expanded functionality such as currency conversion, invoice metadata, streaming payment updates, and webhooks,"" the post states.  To demonstrate its technology, Blockstream has also announced the launch of e-commerce store powered by Lightning Charge, which enables users to make use of Lightning micropayments on the bitcoin mainnet. However, since Lightning is still at the testing stage, the company says use of the store is ""at your own risk.""  While still not ready for general use, the Lightning Network is one of the most-watched bitcoin-scaling solutions.  Rather than changing bitcoin's underlying code, Lightning effectively adds an extra layer to the network by which transactions would theoretically be made more cheaply and more quickly than directly on bitcoin's blockchain.  Last month, prepaid phone payment provider Bitrefill reportedly used Lightning to top up a cellphone.

42380263,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Md3H,1516183238,Proposed US Task Force Would Tackle Crypto Use in Terrorism Financing,"U.S. lawmakers are eyeing the formation of a new task force to combat the use of cryptocurrency in financing terrorism and other illicit uses.  Introduced to Congress by House Representative Ted Budd (Republican) of North Carolina on Jan. 10, a new bill aims to establish the team, dubbed the Independent Financial Technology Task Force, if enacted.  The task force would primarily focus on researching ways that terrorism can be financed through cryptocurrencies and subsequently proposing regulations to counter such activities.  Bill H.R. 4752, also cited as the ""Financial Technology Innovation and Defense Act,"" indicates the new team task force will be headed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Other members would include the Attorney General, and directors from law enforcement agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Secret Service.  Though yet to be passed into law, the proposed bill may be seen as the latest effort from the U.S. lawmakers to clamp down on the financing of terrorism through cryptocurrencies. As reported by CoinDesk last year, the House of Representatives also introduced the ""Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies Act"" to study the same issue.  Apart from the scope of research and legal proposals, bill 4752 would also appoint the Secretary of the Treasury to initiate a program to reward individuals that provide information leading to convictions for illicit use of cryptocurrency in terrorism financing.  Any rewards, according to the bill, would be paid out from funds appropriated from those convicted for funding terrorism, as well as from related fines and forfeitures.  Elsewhere, the bill states that grants would also be made available, to be authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, for technology solutions that might help detect illicit financing activities.

42380276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MdJd,1516179614,Tokens Will Bring Conflicts of Interest to Healthcare,"Roger Boodoo, MD, is a radiologist and clinical informatics fellow actively seeking opportunities where blockchain technology might be applied to challenges in healthcare.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Let's start with the problematic scenario.  A medical researcher stands behind the podium at a prestigious healthcare conference and proclaims that the ""Kill Cancer Blockchain"" will revolutionize the clinical trials process. The audience erupts with enthusiasm and begins to believe in this new ""blockchain"" concept.  Most of the healthcare conference attendees are unfamiliar with the nuances of blockchain. Little do they know, the researcher holds 100,000 ""Kill Cancer"" tokens and other cryptos in a cold storage wallet.  Disruption, come hither  Sure, that future may be exaggerated, but it's one that might be worth considering.  In the fall of 2016, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), a division within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, challenged industry, academia and developers to a blockchain contest.  The ONC solicited white papers on subjects including patient-reported outcomes, interoperability, healthcare finance and clinical research. Over 70 white papers entered the competition and the contest helped to springboard healthcare into the world of blockchain. Furthermore, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) 2017 annual conference, attended by over 40,000, held a full day Blockchain in Healthcare workshop which sold out.  In 2016, Distributed Health, a healthcare-specific blockchain conference, spawned as well as others, and they grew and gained momentum in 2017.  And this is likely to continue as entrepreneurial concepts are finding fertile ground at the intersection of healthcare and blockchain. However, changing the course of a slowly moving, highly regulated, behemoth takes time.  Medical claims and billing with a built-in fraud prevention blockchain, supply chain management to help prevent phony medications, medical devices with IoT integration, the verification of provider credentials across state lines, private and secure health information exchange with an immutable audit trail, all could cut overall medical cost and improve efficiency.  These are just a few use-cases that blockchain will transform. And many have not been thought of yet, but they are coming…  Unsurprisingly, a plethora of startups are grasping at the opportunity.  For example, Health Nexus from SimplyVital Health is a healthcare-grade blockchain with protocol-level governance and validated HIPAA-compliant miners. The protocol is a fork from ethereum and the smart contracts and apps require Health Cash, the Health Nexus token, to run.  Other healthcare companies or researchers can build apps on Health Nexus blockchain for free. Moreover, many other startups are building on ethereum and initiating their own ICOs. The tokens or coins are then listed on exchanges and made available for traders, investors and speculators.  Conflicts of interest  Indeed, a tsunami of blockchain-related literature and presentations touting the revolution of healthcare is coming and the ensuing conflicts of interest statements will inherently become opaque and cryptic.  Digital cryptocurrencies have seen an astronomic increase in monetary valuation. As this valuation may be rooted in the successes of the blockchain, should presenters of blockchain-based research and applications disclose cryptocurrency holdings and their amounts?  The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ Uniform Disclosure Form for Potential Conflicts of Interest is the de-facto standard, and it is used by many academic journals to include the likes of the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, Radiology and the British Medical Journal.  The purpose of this form is to provide conference attendees and readers of manuscripts with information about the author's other interests that could influence how they receive and understand the work. This form does not address cryptocurrencies specifically but does state that all monies received that can be relevant should be disclosed. It continues to state that it is best to disclose than not to, if there is any question about a conflict of interest.  Cryptocurrencies fall into the ""other"" category. The goal is to provide transparency to allow the objective consumption of the presented material.  Yet, as blockchain efforts expand, we face the question of cryptocurrency holdings as a potential conflict of interest to investigators looking to further its role in healthcare.  This problem is multifaceted, based not only on the financial ties between cryptocurrency and the successes and failures of blockchain, its platforms and applications, but the inherent anonymity of the investment. Like most ethical concepts, this consideration came about through retrospective analysis of past projects and the implications on future blockchain-based research, presentations and publications.  The challenge is the analysis and difference of opinion on the question of whether the new champions of blockchain in healthcare should disclose the holding of cryptocurrencies in their personal digital wallets or in any form of fund, and should they disclose the amount?  Technologies such as immunotherapy, artificial intelligence and CRISPR will also likely change healthcare, but they will follow the convention rules regarding conflicts of interest, meaning authors and presenters will disclose associations with commercial entities or financial support before peer-reviewed publications or professional speaking engagements.  Most traditional financial assets and associations are easily traceable through tax records and statements, which result in a feeling of greater responsibility to disclose. However, the inherent secrecy and anonymity of cryptocurrency raise questions about traceability and disclosure in general.  Conclusion and solution  It's a worthy question, and one I'm thinking about as I weight the benefits of the technology.  I am actively brainstorming healthcare related use cases, beginning to build proofs-of-concept and submitting abstracts to medical societies. I am promoting the use of blockchain, yet it is not clear if I must disclose these potential conflicts.  I believe cryptocurrency holdings should be considered for disclosure when presenting research and potential applications of blockchain technologies in healthcare in any form. These disclosures are not meant to question a person's integrity or hinder progress, but instead to allow for the consumption of information in an unbiased manner.  A conflict of interest later discovered can lead to a retracted journal article or a discredited presenter.  Regardless, if professional societies require presenters to disclose coins of interest or not, I encourage transparency.  Radical transparency can only help to further the adoption of blockchain applications in the healthcare settings, and healthcare hungers for disruption. If the ""Kill Cancer"" tokens are coming, then there may be many buyers, and with a cause like that, who wouldn't want to be among them?

42380264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Md4X,1516165214,The Sidechains Breakthrough Almost Everyone in Bitcoin Missed,"You've heard of proof of work, but what about proofs of proofs of work?  A complex notion, the research on ""Non-Interactive Proofs of Proofs of Work,"" or NiPoPoW, released in October, has received very little attention so far but is heralded as breaking through one of the major roadblocks that has stalled the widely anticipated sidechain technology.  In the paper, researchers from IOHK, IC3 and the University of Athens describe a mechanism for proving that data exists in the bitcoin blockchain in a more efficient way.  Though the idea can be useful in more than one context, it's perhaps most exciting in the way the researchers describe the proofs' benefits for sidechains, a technology that pegs other blockchains to bitcoin, which some, because of its obstacles, have called vaporware, but that others refer to as the ""altcoin killer.""  Sidechains seek to solve a vexing problem – that adding features to bitcoin is a dangerous process since $230 billion of value is at risk if the new feature doesn't work or malfunctions in practice.  Instead of adding new features directly to the bitcoin blockchain, sidechains allow developers to attach new features to a separate chain. Since the chains are still attached to the bitcoin blockchain, the features can take advantage of the cryptocurrency's network effects and test those applications, without harming the main network should vulnerabilities arise.  Because of this, sidechains were met with excitement initially, but has faced contention since many have concerns about the security of the technology.  Even still, some engineers have been grinding away at a parallel version of the technology that tries to rely on better economic incentives to make sidechains more secure, yet some developers remain skeptical they're ready to add to the bitcoin network.  But skeptics see this NiPoPoW research as a big step.  Blockstream's Mark Friedenbach, who co-authored the original sidechains white paper, first proposed in 2014, told CoinDesk:  ""This moves the ball down the field significantly.""  Securing sidechains  The paper helps move forward the idea of trustless sidechains, over the more centralized type of sidechains – where the movement of funds of a federated sidechain is governed by a few companies – used today.  While a simple idea, trustless sidechains are hard to put into practice.  They rely on a technology called SPV (simplified payment verification) proofs, which work like this: in order to send money to a sidechain and back to the main bitcoin network again, users need to attach a proof that they really have the funds. Without these proofs, when users or miners move their money back to the main chain, under certain conditions, they could take more money than they really have.  These proofs need to do two things before the technology can be added to bitcoin: one, prevent this sort of theft, and two, be small enough that they can actually be sent over the network.  While so-called ""compact SPV proofs"" have been proposed, they've proved vulnerable to certain attacks, ones that would potentially allow miners to steal money left on the sidechains.  Yet, the proof outlined in the NiPoPoW paper claims to be resistant to these attacks.  ""It's the first protocol, to my knowledge, which makes [sidechains] secure at all,"" University of Athens cryptography Ph.D. candidate Dionysis Zindros, one of the co-authors of the paper, told CoinDesk.  He went on to explain that by ""secure"" he really means resistance to double spending, where users or miners could spend their coins more than once.  ""It's really a missing piece in sidechain constructions that we fill in,"" Zindros said.  Friedenbach described the change in more technical terms: ""This is a big step towards defining a block header commitment structure that allows for log-sized chain proofs, of the sort that one might use in a decentralized sidechains implementation.""  Work ahead  While Friedenbach calls NiPoPoW ""good research,"" he added, work remains before the technology can be deployed on bitcoin.  This is a recurring theme in the cryptocurrency world, where developers are careful about making changes to the still young and novel code. And while sidechains look to make the process of trying out new features easier and less nerve-wracking, implementing even that will take further deliberation.  For one, to make sidechains more secure, many developers believe merge-mining – when miners mine multiple coins at the same time – would be essential.  ""There is still significant scripting capabilities that would be required before merge-mined SPV-proof sidechains could be supported on bitcoin mainnet,"" Friedenbach said.  But there are other worries around merge-mining that are more paramount.  ""There is also, of course, the non-trivial incentive problem of merged-mining and whether such a solution would be a step back in security, given the current state of the oligarchical mining industry,"" Friedenbach added.  In many's view, since the industry relies on the work of a few large mining pools, it could be possible for these miners to have significant control over sidechains, and it's not yet clear whether mining pools would have the power to steal funds.  That said, this piece of the puzzle is exciting to Friedenbach, even though buzz around the paper has been subdued.  He concluded:  ""This idea deserves more attention.""

42380270,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Md8J,1516149001,Why This Startup Took Part of Its Venture Funding in XRP,"Putting a big bet on the future of Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, sharing economy startup Omni accepted a “majority” of a $25 million investment in XRP.      Hoping the coin’s price will increase over the long haul and allow the company to bypass traditional Series C and Series D investment rounds, Omni CEO Tom McLeod told CoinDesk:      “I’m looking at the long term benefits of having a potentially appreciating value on the balance sheet.”      A traditional venture capital firm, Highland Capital Partners — which led Omni’s $7 million series A in 2016 — was also part of the round, investing an undisclosed amount in U.S. dollars.      Announced Tuesday, the XRP investment feels ill-timed as the price of the coin has fallen almost 50 percent, according to CoinMarketCap, following most of the world’s cryptocurrencies in a day of red in the markets.      According to McLeod, some of the XRP investment, which was led by Ripple co-founder and executive chairman Chris Larsen and Ripple’s CTO Stefan Thomas, will go toward paying freelancers and employee bonuses.      While getting paid in XRP is up to the individual, already the Table Public Relations founder who represents Omni, Anna Roubos, has accepted XRP as a form of payment from the company, she told CoinDesk.      What’s notable is that this use of the coin is a departure from the use case XRP has largely been tailored for — creating liquidity for large financial institutions’ cross border payments.      Yet, McLeod positioned the cryptocurrency as a way to break away from the formal, traditional venture capital model and instead entice talent with an incentive that could have a longer tail such as increasing cryptocurrency prices.      XRP has been on a bull run for the past month, starting its ascent from 20 cents per coin in mid-December until it finally eclipsed $3.80 per coin on January 6.      Yet on Tuesday, the price of XRP hit a two-week low at $0.90.      While the round was formally closed sometime in December, McLeod declined to give an exact date.    Future use    In additional to the investment, Larsen will be joining Omni’s advisory board and Thomas will be joining the startup’s board of directors.      And with that, McLeod said, Omni, which provides a peer-to-peer marketplace for the rental of physical items, has plans to work with Ripple more in the future.      “There are partnerships and plans that will involve Ripple Inc. going forward that will utilize XRP in some fashion,” said McLeod, although the company has no plans to accept XRP for payment right now.      While no specific details were given, Ripple’s current products include xCurrent, a real-time bidirectional messaging platform which doesn’t rely on XRP; xRapid, which uses XRP to lower liquidity costs for payments in emerging markets; and xVia, an API that allows users to send international payments over the Ripple network.      Over the past couple years, Ripple has signed more than 100 financial institutions to its platform, one of the reasons many novice crypto enthusiasts saw XRP as a good (yet inexpensive) investment.      However, there was, at times, fierce debate online about the wisdom of such an investment decision, since most of those partners use xCurrent, which, again, does not involve XRP. Only Mexican payments provider Cuallix gets exposure to XRP through xRapid, although Moneygram recently announced it would be testing the use of XRP for internal processes.      Hello, This is a pilot program being tested on internal MoneyGram International processes and is not intended for consumer use.        — MoneyGram (@MoneyGram) January 11, 2018        Still, McLeod, despite his optimism about the price of XRP, said accepting the investment in the cryptocurrency was about more than just currency speculation.      He told CoinDesk:      “We’re super aligned with their vision for reconciling faster payments. This gives us an opportunity to level up our product.”      Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

BitConnect’s lending service will be shuttered, effectively immediately, while its exchange platform will close in 5 days, according to a post on its website published Tuesday.      “In short, we are closing lending service and exchange service while BitConnect.co website will operate for wallet service, news and educational purposes,” the post explained.      The announcement blames a myriad of factors, perhaps most notably the cease-and-desist letters issued in recent days from regulators in Texas and North Carolina.      Both letters stated that BitConnect was engaging in the sale of unregistered securities tied to a token sale.      “We have received two Cease and Desist letters, one from the Texas State Securities Board, and one from the North Carolina Secretary of State Securities Division,” the BitConnect team wrote. “These actions have become a hindrance for the legal continuation of the platform.”      The post also blamed “bad press” that has “made community members uneasy and created a lack of confidence in the platform.”      BitConnect has been accused of constituting a Ponzi scheme, and several figures in the space, including the founder of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, have levied criticisms against it in recent months.      The BitConnect team also blamed a string of dedicated denial-of-service attacks (DDoS).      Since as early as Jan. 13, BitConnect’s Twitter account has blamed DDoS attacks for problems with its website.      Yet despite the cease-and-desist letters, BitConnect said that its in-progress initial coin offering (ICO) will continue, and that it is building an alternative exchange for the BitConnect token.      “This is not the end of this community, but we are closing some of the services on the website platform and we will continue offering other cyptocurrency [sic] services in the future,” the team wrote.

According to a report from Russian-language news agency TASS, Putin said on Jan. 11 that legislation “will be definitely required in [the] future]” on this front.      ""This is the prerogative of the central bank at present and the central bank has sufficient authority so far. However, in broad terms, legislative regulation will be definitely required in future,” he said.      The news source quoted the Russian leader voicing both the risks and opportunities involved with cryptocurrencies.      “It is known that the cryptocurrency is not backed by anything. It cannot be a store of value. No material valuables are behind it and it is not secured by anything,” Putin reportedly said. “It can be a settlement medium to a certain degree and in certain situations. This is done quickly and efficiently.”      That seeming degree of support – coming from someone who months prior briefly met with Vitalik Buterin, the creator of ethereum – was at odds with quoted comments by Russian prime minister Dimitry Medvedev.      Also reported by TASS, Medvedev said that such an eventuality could occur, especially if blockchain becomes more widely used.
