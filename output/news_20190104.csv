42430081,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRALh,1546641304,"Stablecoin Issuers May Need Licenses in Texas, Unlike Most Crypto Startups","Stablecoins may qualify as “money” under Texas law, according to updated guidance from the state Department of Banking.  A memo published Wednesday by Texas Banking Commissioner Charles Cooper outlines how cryptocurrencies are to be treated under local and federal regulations, in particular adding details of how stablecoins backed by sovereign, or fiat, currencies may be assessed.  The guidance builds upon a previous memo released by the state in 2014, which described how cryptocurrency companies with operations in Texas should treat the nascent asset class.  As in the previous version, Cooper notes that cryptocurrencies are not treated as money under Texas law, and exchanging cryptocurrencies for fiat does not count as ""currency exchange."" As such, startups do not need to acquire currency exchange licenses to conduct transactions – making the Lone Star State one of the nation's most permissive.  However, in the revised version Cooper adds that stablecoins may fall under existing definitions of ""money"" or ""monetary value,"" and therefore anyone who purchases the stablecoin has a claim to the sovereign currency assets underlying the tokens they possess.  This is ""because the issuer has taken on the obligation to provide sovereign currency in exchange for the stablecoin at a later time,"" Cooper writes.  Warning to comply  The document specifically outlines Texas banking policy on different forms of crypto transactions, including crypto-to-crypto exchanges and crypto-to-fiat exchanges. The document also outlines how directly transferring cryptocurrencies from one party to another does not qualify as money transmission.  It further adds:  ""In contrast, because a sovereign-backed stablecoin may be considered money or monetary value under the Money Services Act, receiving it in exchange for a promise to make it available at a later time or different location may be money transmission.""  Whether a stablecoin issuer or exchange actually owes a holder fiat currency may be dependent on analysis, however.  Cooper concludes his memo by warning exchanges and other startups that they must comply with relevant laws, particularly if they conduct money transmission.

Steven Hopkins, the chief operating officer of Medici, planned to resign from that job to become chief revenue officer at tZERO, a regulated exchange for security tokens, according to a December 28 Securities and Exchange filing by Overstock.  The appointment was to follow the conclusion of a deal in which tZERO would buy 67 percent of the crypto wallet startup Bitsy from Hopkins and his father-in-law Richard N. Beckstrand for $8 million and the other 33 percent from Medici via a convertible promissory note worth $4 million.  The note is due for repayment at the end of 2020, the document says, unless it is converted to equity in tZERO, which will happen automatically the next time the company issues more than $2 million in stock.  The Bitsy buyout was scheduled to close on January 1, according to the Overstock filing, which also said the startup had $5.5 million in cash.  A spokesperson for Overstock did not respond to requests for further details by press time.  In an interview with CoinDesk in December, Hopkins and Medici president Jonathan Johnson said that delivering products would be a priority for the venture fund's portfolio companies in 2019.

42430080,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRANh,1546620037,Ethereum Developers Give 'Tentative' Greenlight to ASIC-Blocking Code,"Members of ethereum's open-source development community tentatively agreed Friday to implement a new algorithm that would block specialized mining hardware, or ASICs, pending further testing on the proposed code.  If accepted by the network of users that run the ethereum software, the code change, dubbed ""ProgPoW,"" would block ASICs, such as those made by major mining firms like Bitmain. In its place, the new software would allow general purpose, or GPU hardware – which is typically phased out by ASICs – to compete for rewards on the platform.  ASICs were developed for ethereum as early as April 2018.  Speaking in the developer call today, security-lead Martin Holst Swende said that he prefers the switch as it will help ensure the safety of ethereum's eventual transition to proof-of-stake, a new system in which users mine the cryptocurrency not by burning electricity, but by setting aside coins they hold.  ""We know today that Ethhash has flaws which are currently being targeted. So, that's why I would like to switch as soon as possible to give us time to move to proof-of-stake,"" Holst-Swende said.  Concluding the conversation, developer relations for the Ethereum Foundation Hudson Jameson appeared to categorize consensus as having been achieved on the proposal.  Jameson said:  “Sounds like we have come to agreement that we are tentatively going ahead with ProgPoW, which means we are going ahead unless there is a major problem found with the testing or things of that nature. We will be going forward with ProgPoW.”  This means that, unless developers encounter unexpected issues with the change, ProgPoW would be released as part of a standalone system-wide upgrade, or hard fork, within the next two to four months. Aside from ProgPoW, no other software changes will be included in the upgrade, developers said.  The news comes at a time when Constantinople, the platform's fifth major upgrade, is nearing activation. Speaking on the call, Parity release manager Afri Schoedon said that according to current block times, Constantinople is due to activate ""10 minutes after 12:oo UTC on Wednesday, [Jan.] 16th.""  Originally planned for November, Constantinople brings a host of design changes aimed at streamlining the platform’s code. It also seeks to delay the so-called “difficulty bomb” – a code fix designed to prompt frequent upgrades – for 18 months, while reducing the ether mining reward from 3 ETH to 2 ETH per block.  Developers also said that a further hard fork, dubbed Istanbul, should be planned to occur in October, after a period of nine months. Proposed by Afri Schoedon in today's call, this would be part of a periodic upgrade cycle intended to maintain the regularity of upgrades.  Still, the timing for PropPoW, which will deviate from the periodic upgrade cycle, is still unclear, with developers agreeing to question of upgrade timing in the next developer call on January 18.  ""Let's do some homework until the next core dev call and see how people can implement [ProgPoW] into their frameworks and maybe we can talk about timing in two weeks,"" Holst Swende said.

42430083,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRATh,1546606802,Chinese Bank Giants Tap Blockchain in Trade Finance Efficiency Boost,"The China Banking Association (CBA), the country’s self-regulatory organization for the banking sector, is launching a new blockchain-based platform for trade finance.  The platform was announced last week while the organization is in the process of rolling it out for live usage after several pilot programs aimed at improving the efficiency and security of trade finance transactions.  Over 10 major banks in the region have signed up for the platform, including HSBC (China), Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, Ping An Bank, China Postal Savings Bank, among others.  Lending technical support are Chinese fintech firms including PeerSafe, a Beijing-based startup focusing on distributed ledger technology and a member of the Hyperledger consortium.  The CBA said in the statement that it has completed two pilots for issuing a letter of credits (LoC) and asset-backed securities, with participation from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Merchants Bank.  ""The launch of China's trade finance blockchain has brought together the trade chain of different banks to make cross-bank transactions much faster, safer and more realistic,” Fang Xiao, vice president and head of industrial and commercial finance at HSBC China, was quoted as saying in a news report on Thursday.  Going forward, the CBA said it plans to include more small and medium-sized banks, as well as customs and taxation agencies to the platform.  The trade finance sector is increasingly looking to adopt blockchain technology for improved operations. In September, China’s central bank deployed the “Bay Area Trade Finance Blockchain Platform” across financial institutions in the southern city of Shenzhen.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also announced the launch of a live blockchain trade finance platform in November last year.  More recently, HSBC India and ING Bank, Brussels, facilitated the trade finance transaction on R3’s Corda blockchain platform, for India-based oil and gas conglomerate Reliance Industries and US-based global chemical distributor Tricon Energy.

42402397,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCbz2,1546602465,$4K Ahead? Bitcoin's Low-Volume Price Pullback Could Be a Bear Trap,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recent pullback from highs above $4,200 could trap the bears on the wrong side of the market, the price-volume analysis indicates.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $3,848, having clocked a low of $3,642 on Dec. 28. At that level, BTC was down 14.7 percent from the Dec. 24 high of $4,272, according to CoinMarketCap.  Notably, daily trading volumes across all cryptocurrency exchanges have also dropped in the last few days. At press time, 24-hour trading volume stands at $4.57 billion – down 36 percent from the Dec. 24 high of at $7.24 billion.  A low-volume price pullback is widely considered a sign of weak buyers exiting the market and hence is considered insignificant. The recent drop, therefore, is likely a temporary correction and the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the 3-day chart on Dec. 20 is still valid.  The bullish case, however, would weaken if the cryptocurrency dips below the key support near $3,550.  3-day chart        As seen above (prices as per Bitstamp), BTC closed at $4,073 on Dec. 20, confirming a bullish outside-candle reversal (bear-to-bull change).  So far, however, the follow-through has been discouraging. Prices have dropped in the last ten days, but so have volumes.  The bullish reversal, however, would be invalidated if and when the bullish-higher low of $3,566 carved out on Dec. 27 is breached.  6-hour and 1-hour chart  The triangle breakout seen in the 6-hour chart indicates that the rally from the December low of $3,122 has resumed.  Meanwhile, the bull flag breakout seen in the hourly chart indicates a resumption of the rally from the Jan. 1 low of $3,629.  Therefore, the path of least resistance is on the higher side.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC is likely carving out an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern with the neckline resistance at $4,170.  The bullish setup on the 3-day and intraday chart indicates scope for a test of $4,170 in the next few days.  It is worth noting that the 50-day moving average (MA) is still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. As a result, BTC may attract bears if the MA hurdle, currently at $3,900, proves to be a tough nut to crack in the next 48 hours or so.  View  Bitcoin's low-volume drop from the recent highs above $4,200 is nothing more than a temporary correction.  BTC remains on the hunt for a break above $4,000. The bulls, however, need progress soon, as repeated failure to take out the 50-day MA of $3,900 could prove costly.  A break below the Dec. 27 low of $3,566 would open the doors to re-test of the December low of $3,122.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Vaishali Mehta, who worked as a senior compliance manager at Coinbase from November 2017 to November 2018, joined TrustToken last month as head of compliance.  “Crypto is an exciting place and I have been lucky to have been a part of this 'madness,'"" Mehta told CoinDesk through a spokesperson. ""I really related to TrustToken’s vision to foster a new financial future which is resilient to fraud, failure and greed.""  TrustToken, the company behind the TrueUSD stablecoin, confirmed the hire. Coinbase didn't responded to CoinDesk's request for a comment at press time.  A former head of BSA/AML (Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money-laundering) risk and onboarding at Deutsche Bank, Mehta is one of several high-ranking or long-tenured employees who have left Coinbase in the last few months.  In October, Adam White, who was Coinbase's fifth-ever employee, left to become the chief operating officer of Bakkt, the new digital asset trading platform built by Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. Also that month, Coinbase's head of trading, Hunter Merghart, resigned after just six months on the job.  Coinbase's chief policy officer Mike Lempres left for venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (an investor in the startup) in November. And last month, Coinbase risk operations manager Rees Atlas, who joined in 2013, moved to the marketing communications startup Twilio, and soon after that chief product officer Jeremy Henrickson quit.  New employer  Last year was a busy time for Mehta's new employer, TrustToken. After launching TrueUSD, a stablecoin backed by U.S. dollars, in March, the company raised $20 million of venture funding through a strategic token sale from investors including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), BlockTower Capital, Danhua Capital and others in June.  In December, TrustToken reported successfully passing a smart contract security audit by Certik, SlowMist and Zeppelin. The company said it's storing its dollar reserves in multiple third-party trust companies regulated by multiple U.S. states.  TrueUSD is one of several cryptocurrencies designed to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar that launched in 2018 to compete with the market leader, known as tether or USDT. Stablecoins allow crypto traders to move money quickly between exchanges without having to rely on the banking system.

42402398,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCby3,1546578046,Falling Crypto Prices Aren't Stopping Real Blockchain Progress,"Paul Brody is EY's global innovation leader for blockchain. The views expressed are his own.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  Plunging cryptocurrency values in 2018 and the collapse of the money-for-nothing white paper market in initial coin offerings (ICOs) took much of the focus last year for many people when it came to blockchain mindshare.  All of that marketplace drama, however, concealed an enormous amount of real progress for the technology that will, slowly but surely, lay the foundation for a robust revival of the blockchain markets in the future.  Over the last year, the market did provide lots of drama related to ICOs. Nearly a quarter of all the ICOs from 2017 lost most of their value, and the market as a whole declined by nearly two- thirds.  The first half of 2018 was no better. There were nearly 1,000 ICOs every month, but only 5% of them raised more than $1 million – with one, EOS, raising around $4 billion.  Not only did the bulk of the money raised go to a very small number of the ICOs, but nearly every aspect of the world of blockchain also became more consolidated and, dare I say, centralized, in 2018 – rather counterintuitive for blockchain, since decentralization is at its core.  Public blockchains consolidate  According to a study by EY that examined the ICOs’ progress and investment returns, ethereum, which is the dominant platform and shows the highest activity among developers and on social media, became even more dominant, with more than 95% of all ICOs and funds raised.  The market for exchanges consolidated rapidly as well, with 73% of daily trading volume in the first half of the year taken by the top 10 exchanges. Though the full-year numbers are yet to be updated, that trend seems set to continue.  The biggest exchanges are consolidating their positions in part by rapidly maturing their processes and approach to regulatory compliance. Know-your-customer procedures are being tightened and many of the big exchanges are, or soon will be, audited by some of the major financial services organizations (EY included). These same exchanges have been beefing up their security as well, with fewer large-scale thefts in 2018 than in 2017.  Another big trend last year in the world of public blockchains was the surge in popularity of stablecoins of all kinds, mostly based on fiat currencies. While stablecoins offer some advantages, including stability, they do raise the single most important question remaining for public blockchains: why are they useful?  Parking money in a stablecoin is beneficial if it’s between investments or purchases as a way to avoid volatility, but it’s not a very good investment in and of itself. The purpose of capital markets is to allocate capital to productive uses and, at least for the moment, that doesn’t seem to be happening. For public blockchains in 2019, this is the single most important question.  Private blockchains deliver  While public exchanges have been consolidating their hold on the market, private blockchains are getting to work by delivering real business value for enterprises. At EY, a number of systems entered production status, including our software licensing solutionhttps://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2018/06/ey-and-microsoft-launch-blockchain-solution-for-content-rights with Microsoft and a maritime insurance joint venture with Maersk and Guardtime.  Looking at the enterprise space, there are three key learnings from the work with blockchain in 2018.  First and foremost, the biggest rule in blockchain seems to be: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Over and over again, when companies are working on projects where blockchain seemed to be an excellent fit, they did not move forward because they already found a solution to their problem. Despite the fact that blockchain in nearly every case would be better, that isn’t necessarily enough to justify replacing already existing processes, given the cost and risk.  Second, and very closely related to the first learning, is the primacy of solving real problems. While chief innovation officers sometimes love to do blockchain proofs of concept, the technology is far past that. It’s all about the focus on productizing and solving solutions for line-of-business executives — with real ROI. If one can, with confidence, point to an ROI from a solution, then there’s no need to worry about which blockchain platform or future comes to pass. There is a return from this investment, no matter what.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is clear that companies are prioritizing operations before finance. While tracking products and assets as they move through the supply chain is useful, there are a lot of financial services that could add value, from the very simple approach “payment upon delivery,” to complex services like factoring receivables and trade finance.  However, in most cases, companies want to achieve confidence in their operational systems before closing the loop with payments and financial services, a challenge they will start to take up at the start of 2019.

42402400,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdCc10,1546561896,The Map Is Not the Territory: Rethinking Crypto as an Asset Class,"Sid Kalla, CFA and Bradley Miles are co-founders of Roll, an open standard for social money on the ethereum blockchain.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  Over long time periods, bitcoin's returns have been uncorrelated to the stock, bond or commodity markets.  Even though bitcoin has been highly volatile, adding a small amount of bitcoin to a portfolio of stocks and bonds can actually improve its risk-adjusted returnshttps://waset.org/publications/10006245/analyzing-the-effects-of-adding-bitcoin-to-portfolio- (improve the Sharpe ratio). The drivers of bitcoin’s returns are very different from those of the other markets, and it is therefore rightly seen as an attractive asset class by investors.  However, generalizing this observation to the broader “crypto market” can be hazardous to investor returns.  Let’s first try and understand what it means to talk about ‘crypto as an asset class’ in the first place. Investopedia defines an asset class as follows:  ""An asset class is a group of securities that exhibits similar characteristics, behaves similarly in the marketplace and is subject to the same laws and regulations.""  In reality, these don’t need to be securities – for example, real estate and commodities are not securities but commonly thought of as asset classes.  When we look at the “crypto market” today, does it fit that definition? We argue it doesn’t.  The Case Against  The “crypto market” today is made up of crypto assets that have fundamentally different characteristics. They are governed by different economic realities, have different market structures and have different return characteristics. They are simply too varied to be aggregated into one asset class.  Unlike common stocks that have pretty well-defined economics (limited liability, fractional ownership, voting rights, etc.), this isn’t the case for crypto assets. The economic characteristics of MakerDAO’s MKR token are fundamentally different from Augur’s REP and both are fundamentally different from Ethereum’s ETH.  Philosopher Alfred Korzybski's metaphor of distinctly separating the ""map"" (belief system) from the ""territory"" (reality) is an apt analogy here. Simply using ‘crypto’ to describe all of the tokens above despite their respective incentive structures is mental shorthand – a mental “map” to navigate the space, which doesn’t accurately reflect the ""territory.""  During speculative bubbles, like the one we saw in late 2013 and again in 2017, all crypto assets tend to move together with strong correlation. Over longer time periods, however, this just isn’t true (in fact, many of the most popular crypto assets from 2017 don’t have a long enough price history).  Here’s a December 2013 snapshot of the crypto market as a reference. Outside the top 3, barely any even have survived meaningfully to this day (with the honorable exception of Dogecoin of course).  To add a whole new dimension to this confusion, 2018 saw the hype around “security tokens” as a way forward for the crypto industry. A security token is backed by an underlying asset, like real estate.  If security tokens are the new ICOs, their economic characteristics are nothing alike. If a luxury resort does a security token offering, the returns on that are going to be much more correlated with the luxury resort market, or the real estate asset class than bitcoin. As the industry progresses, there are sure to be many more types of crypto assets, each with its own crypto-economic design and return characteristics.  As new projects enter the space - think Filecoin, Grin, Dfinity, Hashgraph, Algorand, etc., investors would do well to ask themselves the fundamental thesis on which they are buying a crypto asset.  Investors can be easily misled into believing they are investing in bitcoin’s uncensorable money thesis or Ethereum’s decentralized computing thesis when in reality they are simply buying startup stock or local real estate.  Diversification needs to be done more intelligently than buying a bunch of crypto assets and crossing your fingers – investors need a “map” with finer detail to navigate the “territory.  After all, there is no reason to believe that the $100,000 digital cat’s returns should be strongly correlated to $1 billion dollar Telegram network, even though they are both technically ""crypto.""
