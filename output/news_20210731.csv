Speaking at the Aspen Institute Economic Strategy Group, Brainard said, ""The dollar is very dominant in international payments, and if you have the other major jurisdictions in the world with a digital currency, a CBDC offering, and the U.S. doesn't have one, I just, I can't wrap my head around that,"" according to the Reuters report.  Earlier this month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee a Fed report on CBDCs would come in early September as the central bank decides on the merits of issuing a digital dollar. Meanwhile, China is in the testing stage of its own CBDC.  Closer to home, Brainard said the proliferation of stablecoins could fragment the payment system without a digital dollar, according to the report.  A digital dollar could also help people without bank accounts to get government aid such as coronavirus pandemic relief payments, Reuters quoted the Fed governor as saying.  Separately, Brainard said she doesn't see any signs that currently high inflation readings are pushing longer-term inflation expectations above the central bank's 2% target.

The first cryptocurrency by market cap trades at $41,300, at the time of writing, with a 6% and 23.8% profit in the daily chart. The general sentiment in the market has flipped bullish, the fear and greed index signals greed for the first time in months. Other indicators, as many experts have pointed out, suggest a definite shift in the market. The bulls could see more green days in the coming weeks. Data from Glassnode, provided by the CIO of Moskovski Capital Lex Moskovski, recorded an increase in the amount of Bitcoin held by &apos;strongest holders&apos;. According to the Illiquid Supply metric, these holders have risen to an all-time high and suggest &apos;bullish&apos; price action. Charles Edwards, a founder at Capriole Investments, revealed an increase in long-term Bitcoin holders. According to the HOLD Waves metric, these types of investors have been growing their supply since the May 2021 crash. Edwards added: This type of sharp rise never occurred in the early stages of prior bear markets, suggesting that there is a chance the Bitcoin bull-cycle is still intact. Additional data provided by Edwards indicates that exchanges platforms had their &apos;first positive outflows&apos; since last week when Bitcoin made a run from its yearly open at around $29,000 to its current levels. This metric suggests that the demand in the crypto market could be returning and could support further appreciation.

42407070,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf99cs,1627743719,Bitcoin Price Over $41K After Longest Streak in 8 Years,"The bitcoin price was holding above $41,000, the highest since May, after a 10-day winning streak that was the longest in eight years for the largest cryptocurrency.      As of press time bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands at $41,344, up 6.2% over the past 24 hours. Other CoinDesk 20 digital assets were also in the green, with ether rising 4.5% to $2,453 and chainlink jumping 13% to $21.72.      Although the bitcoin price slipped after 0:00 coordinated universal time (UTC) on Saturday, it had notched 10 consecutive daily increases from July 21 through Friday, the longest winning streak since 2013.      Bitcoin reached an all-time high near $65,000 in mid-April as market euphoria peaked and the U.S. exchange Coinbase went public through a direct stock listing. But the price tumbled over the next few months as China cracked down on cryptocurrency mining and exchanges and regulators around the world moved to tighten industry rules. The Federal Reserve began to consider tapering its $120 billion-a-month of asset purchases – a form of extreme monetary stimulus that has been a big driver of the investment narrative that bitcoin could serve as an effective hedge against inflation and currency debasement.      Retail investors who had piled into bitcoin as prices soared early in the year rushed to exit positions, while big institutional investors grew reluctant to enter the market at lofty valuations. Prices traded in a range between $30,000 and $40,000 for about two months.      But after bitcoin briefly dipped below $30,000 on July 20, the cryptocurrency began a steady ascent that has put it on track for an 18% gain in July, the first monthly increase in three months.      ""The incredible winning streak comes at a very strange time when the FUD is thick,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Friday in a newsletter. FUD is an acronym for ""fear, uncertainty and doubt,"" a term often used by crypto traders and analysts to refer to any negative news.      Bitcoin price resistance is still seen as stiff in the low-$40,000 range: ""BTC is potentially rangebound until it breaks and closes above $42,000,"" according to the digital-asset firm Eqonex. ""Trendline support has moved up to $38,200, with $36,500 the next support.""      But some industry analysts are now wondering aloud if the worst of bitcoin's recent bear market might have passed.      ""Something feels different this week,"" Coinbase wrote Saturday in a market analysis. ""Max fear seems to have disappeared.""      On a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is up 43%, vastly outperforming the 17% year-to-date gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/31/bitcoin-price-over-41k-after-longest-streak-in-8-years,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/849207b2aef2daa29240cb1f182219fcab64859f-1300x732.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now, the attention of the watchdogs has shifted to its commercial paper reserve. As a result, this week has been very hot for the company. The regulators focus their attention on what makes up the Tether reserves. Related Reading | Cardano Aims To Facilitate Users With Smart Contracts A report disclosed that Tether&apos;s Michael Hsu said that the US regulators focus their attention on the paper to know if every Tether Token is actually backed by $1 as the company claims. US Regulators Scrutinize Tether From what we learned, the regulators investigating Tether are led by Janet Yellen, the US Treasury Secretary. Before now, Yellen has held some meetings about the possible risks of stablecoins. Now, the &apos; President&apos;s Working Group on Financial Market&apos; aims to know if Tether really holds large amounts of commercial papers as it claims. Commercial papers usually represent debt instruments that companies issue to investors for short-term funds. However, the Working Group does not believe the claims as it compares it to a mutual fund that can lose its investors in one day. Presently, the total USDT in circulation is 62 billion. So, there seems to be a legitimate cause for alarm.

Moody’s lowered El Salvador's long-term, foreign-currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Caa1 from B3.  Noting a “deterioration in the quality of policymaking,” the agency said that the bitcoin law and other measures reflected “weakened governance in El Salvador, raising tensions with international partners – including the United States – and jeopardizing progress toward an agreement with the IMF (International Monetary Fund).”  The bond ratings agency added that the combined factors could increase the risk to El Salvador’s ability “to access sufficient external financing ahead of bond redemptions,” starting in January 2023.  The bitcoin law, which goes into effect Sept. 7, requires merchants to accept bitcoin along with the U.S. dollar.  The law passed by a supermajority in El Salvador's legislature on June 9, with 62 members voting in favor of the bill, 19 opposing and three abstaining, but it has also faced stiff dissent with some opponents arguing it violates El Salvador's constitution.
