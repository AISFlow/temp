18782932,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555306,1697239833,What To Expect If Historical Bitcoin Halving Cycles Repeat,"It’s been quite a bearish week for Bitcoin, as the crypto has fallen around 3% since the beginning of the week. Price action, in particular, has had Bitcoin struggling to break above $27,000, indicating a potential risk of more losses below this resistance level in the near term. However, according to a crypto analyst, this current retracement might be the beginning of a historical Bitcoin cycle before each halving. Analyst Shows Bitcoin Price Correction Based On Historical Trends Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has said in a post that if historical Bitcoin “halving cycles” are any indication, a major price correction could be right around the corner. The Bitcoin halving cuts the block reward for miners in half. Related Reading: US Mega Bank JPMorgan Predicts Harsh Drop In This Bitcoin Metric This happens roughly every 4 years to slow the creation of new BTC and control inflation. Based on historical data from the previous two Bitcoin halvings, the price of BTC could drop by up to 38% before the next halving. In a chart shared on X (formerly Twitter), Rekt Capital showed a major pull back has happened around six months before each halving. In the 2015 cycle, BTC retraced 25% 196 days before the 2016 halving. In 2019, BTC retraced 38%, 196 days before the 2020 halving. So with the next halving slated to occur around April 2024, it would seem the market is now in a prime position for the next correction. Previous halving trends | Source: X Bitcoin is currently 60% below its all-time high, following a similar pattern with past halvings. 200 days before the 2020 halving, BTC was 60% below its all-time high. Likewise, 200 days before the 2016 halving, BTC was 65% below its all-time high. What A Correction Would Mean For BTC Bitcoin’s price direction is currently uncertain, especially as on-chain transactions on the blockchain are now at a three-month low. On-chain metrics have shown that 95% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply hasn’t changed hands in the past month, as investors seem to be holding on to the cryptocurrency in anticipation of the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Although past performance doesn’t always repeat, if this pattern shows up again before the next halving, Bitcoin could be in for a big correction. With the current price of BTC now at $26,770, a 38% retracement could see BTC fall below $18,000. If this happens, it would be devastating for BTC holders.

18779634,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555375,1697234412,"This Trader Is On The Brink Of Losing Money, Will Selling WBTC On Aave V2 Help?","A trader on Aave, a decentralized liquidity protocol operating on multiple platforms, including Ethereum and OP Mainnet, has begun selling wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to repay outstanding debt, records on October 13 reveal. WBTC is a tokenized version of Bitcoin issued on Ethereum that allows holders to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. Trader Selling WBTC To Repay Debt On Aave v2 According to Lookonchain data, the unidentified trader marked with address “0x47ab” borrowed roughly $8 million worth of multiple stablecoins, including USDC, USDT, and DAI, Maker’s stablecoin, on Aave v2 after depositing various assets, including WBTC, Maker (MKR), and Ethereum (ETH) worth approximately $11 million. Related Reading: Failed Bullish Pattern Could Send Ethereum Sub-$1000 When writing, the health factor of borrowed assets stands at 1.09, teetering close to liquidation. According to Aave’s documents, the health factor is a metric that compares the safety of collateral and borrowed loans to the underlying value. Technically, the higher it is, the safer the funds are from liquidation. If the health factor exceeds $1, deposited collateral will be liquidated to borrow outstanding loans. Aave is a popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol where token holders can choose to supply liquidity and earn passive income. At the same time, users can deposit collateral and borrow overcollateralized loans, which they can repay at any time, provided the health factor is around 1. Since loans are overcollateralized, the collateral is usually higher than the borrowed amount. Volatile Bitcoin Prices To Blame? As it is, the trader, Lookonchain shows, has started selling WBTC to repay outstanding debt. A big chunk of what the trader supplied is in WBTC, standing at 366.56 WBTC, worth roughly $9.1 million at spot rates. However, considering market prices have fluctuated recently, the contraction has impacted the health factor, increasing the risk of collateral liquidation. To counter this, the trader sold 3 WBTC for roughly $80,000. The address still owes Aave V2 approximately $8.08 million, mostly in USDT, at around $5 million. There are $3 million of USDC and around $368,000 of DAI. It is unclear whether the trader will seek to borrow more, especially if Bitcoin prices increase. Related Reading: Have Traders Moved Past Dogecoin? Transactions Plunge 98% Since June The address remains long on MKR, the governance token of the MakerDAO protocol; Uniswap’s UNI; Chainlink’s LINK; and Ethereum. Besides WBTC, the trader’s second-largest holding is in ETH, while the smallest is MKR. Ironically, MKR has been one of the top-performing assets, rallying by over 160% in H2 2023 alone. The token peaked at $1,600 in early October before cooling off to spot rates.

42419467,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEVnJ,1697231242,"SEC Won’t Appeal Loss in Grayscale Case, Boosting the Odds GBTC Can Become a Bitcoin ETF","The SEC was rebuked by a court in August for how it rejected Grayscale’s application to turn its bitcoin (BTC) trust into an ETF.  The regulator won’t appeal that loss, a person familiar with the matter said Friday, boosting the odds the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) can be turned into a more-appealing ETF.  BTC's price jumped on the news.  The Securities and Exchange Commission won’t appeal a court’s scathing reversal of its decision not to let Grayscale convert its bitcoin trust into a more investor-friendly exchange-traded fund, according to a person familiar with the matter, possibly clearing the way for the first bitcoin ETF in the U.S.  The markets regulator had until midnight Friday to decide on challenging the court’s decision, but the SEC will let that deadline come and go without appealing, the person said. Reuters reported the news earlier.  Bitcoin [BTC] shot above $27,000 after the news came out.  In August, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC’s denial of Grayscale Investment’s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF was invalid and must be reviewed, calling it an “arbitrary and capricious” rejection. The court said that federal agencies are required to “treat like cases alike.”  “The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved the trading of two bitcoin futures funds on national exchanges but denied approval of Grayscale’s bitcoin fund,” Circuit Judge Neomi Rao said in August.  SEC spokespeople didn’t immediately respond to a request to confirm the agency’s decision. A Grayscale spokeswoman declined to comment before the decision is confirmed.  It’s unclear how the SEC will proceed in its next round with Grayscale’s application. The agency still has the authority to deny it for other reasons besides the ones courts shot down, though Grayscale could challenge those again in court.  Grayscale first applied to convert its closed-end fund into an ETF in October 2021. GBTC is the largest cryptocurrency fund in the world and has been trading at a discount to its bitcoin holdings since February 2021. That discount reached almost 50% at one point but has since retreated to levels around 17%.  Grayscale has long advocated that the conversion of GBTC to an ETF would eliminate the discount as it would close the gap between the price and the underlying bitcoin. The structure of ETFs allows for a creation-redemption model which means new ETF shares can be created to meet demand or redeemed to reduce supply.  Grayscale – a unit of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk – is among a number of other entities that have filed for bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock and Fidelity are among those also awaiting approval from the SEC.

Data has shown that at its current price, the majority of Cardano holders are losing money, further showing the state of the cryptocurrency’s price. Cardano (ADA) addresses in loss is now over 94%, leaving many investors wondering if it’s time to cut their losses and move on. Cardano (ADA) Addresses In Loss Rise Over 94% Cardano (ADA) is currently the 8th largest crypto by market cap, with a market cap of $8.65 billion. However, all metrics have pointed to the cryptocurrency losing stream and struggling to receive inflow from investors. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Breaks Down The Factors Behind The Bitcoin Price Decline For instance, ADA is down by 7.% in a 7-day time frame. Its trading volume has also fallen by 12.67% in the past 24 hours, showing a lack of interest in either buying or selling the cryptocurrency. Data from IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money metric has shown the number of Cardano addresses in red is now at 94.15%. The metric, which shows the number of addresses making profits and losses at a cryptocurrency’s current price, shows that the number of Cardano addresses in loss is now over 4.19 million. Many ADA investors bought in near the peak hype during its all-time high. Of the 4.19 million addresses in loss, 691,480 addresses bought between $1.59 to $2.97, and 608,590 addresses bought between $1.17 to $1.59. On the other hand, only 174,840 Cardano addresses representing 3.92% of the total addresses, are currently at a profit. Source: IntoTheBlock Whale transactions have also been quiet on Cardano’s blockchain in the past 24 hours. Another IntoTheBlock metric shows the number of transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater has been in a freefall since May. Source: IntoTheBlock Is It Time To Jump Ship? The low profitability of ADA holders is probably surprising, given the Cardano blockchain’s popularity. According to recent data released by blockchain analytics firm Santiment, the Cardano network is still the most popular among developers. Cardano developers have also been actively building and introducing exciting innovations to the blockchain and ecosystem. One example of these developments is the updates to its Lace wallet.

The implications of this decision are significant, as it could pave the way for the approval of several other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Impending Approval Of All Proposed Bitcoin Spot ETFs? According to crypto YouTuber Crypto Rover, if the SEC does not appeal the court’s ruling by the end of the day, it would potentially lose its ability to deny future applications, resulting in the likely approval of all proposed spot ETFs. The current list of applicants seeking approval includes prominent names such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Ark/21 Shares Bitcoin Trust, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Trust, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. If all Bitcoin spot ETFs are approved, the move would mark a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Cardano, Solana, And Ethereum Under Heat, Data Points To More Trouble For Altcoins Accepting these financial instruments would provide investors with a regulated and easily accessible avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the underlying asset. The approval would also vote for confidence in the cryptocurrency market, attracting institutional investors and potentially injecting fresh capital into the space. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs also can ignite a renewed sense of optimism and investor sentiment. The anticipation of such a development has already fueled speculation of a Bitcoin rally, with market participants eyeing a new annual high. The thawing of the crypto winter and the approval of these ETFs could create a perfect storm for a Bitcoin price to surge, potentially breaching the $30,000 mark and beyond. Bitcoin Price Awaiting ETF Relief The largest cryptocurrency in the market is striving to reclaim the crucial $27,000 level, trading at $26,700. This level holds significant importance for bullish investors as it represents a key threshold to break the mid-term downtrend structure observed in BTC’s 1-day chart since its yearly high of $31,800 on July 13 Additionally, the failure of the Bitcoin price to hold its 200-day (yellow line) and 50-day (brown line) moving averages (MAs) as support lines is a cause for concern among bullish traders. These MAs, similar to the situation in March 2023, are currently converging. However, the potential approval of a BTC spot ETF could provide much-needed relief to Bitcoin’s price. Forming a complete rally would require overcoming various resistance levels in such a scenario. Related Reading: Failed Bullish Pattern Could Send Ethereum Sub-$1000 In the short term, Bitcoin’s price will likely face a significant obstacle at the $27,900 level, which was briefly surpassed on October 2nd. Furthermore, BTC encounters a 3-month resistance at $28,700, marking the final hurdle before reaching the $30,000 level, serving as another resistance line. Nevertheless, the community anxiously awaits the approval of BTC spot ETFs, hoping that it will bring a sense of relief and bullish momentum for investors and Bitcoin’s price.

42419474,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEVsT,1697223525,Is Hamas Using Crypto to Attack Israel? We Don’t Know,"This Tuesday, Oct. 10, the Wall Street Journal put out a report claiming that Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups were using crypto to finance their operations. “Hamas Militants Behind Israel Attack Raised Millions in Crypto” read the headline.  The piece, based on analysis from blockchain forensics groups, claimed that, between August 2021 and June this year, Hamas had raised $41 million in crypto and that law enforcement was struggling to contain the flows.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The inference was clear. Crypto is subterfuge and shadowy, and not to be trusted at a time of war. The piece noted “gaps in financial crime controls” at exchanges that facilitated the payments. Binance was cited by intelligence agencies in Israel and the U.S. as one platform where suspicious transactions might have occurred.  So how worried should we be about terrorist financing via crypto?  We spoke with Yaya Fanusie, a former CIA staffer who has been tracking crypto financing of terrorism since 2016. He is now director of policy for anti-money laundering (AML) and cyber risk at the Crypto Council for Innovation, a San Francisco group that promotes the use of decentralized technology.  Fanusie argued that crypto is far from a golden ticket for groups wanting to raise money secretly. In fact, it may be the exact opposite. The public nature of public blockchains, exchanges and wallet addresses opens up terrorist financing to scrutiny.  “It's a double-edged sword. [The terrorist group] may get some donations from a donor who is, you know, dumb enough to fund your public wallet. But that’s going to raise the risk of that person being caught and coming under the radar of security,” he said. In fact, Hamas said in April that it was suspending its bitcoin (BTC) donation campaigns for exactly this reason.  “Reading between the lines, they’re saying ‘look, we've been raising this, we've been getting donations, but what it's doing is bringing attention to us when these wallets are being publicized. It's allowing Intel security law enforcement to actually go after and find who [our] supporters are and learn about the network,” Fanusie added.  When Fanusie first started tracking crypto financing for terrorism in 2016, Hamas raised about $600 that year. But, after some success in 2019 and 2020, the flow of crypto donations has started to slow.  Fanusie noted two other nuances that may have been lost on readers of the WSJ. One, it’s not clear if that money raised in crypto actually went into the attack on Israel last weekend, though that was the inference.  “The Wall Street Journal report does not say ‘Hamas used $40 million for this attack. That's not there. We can't determine that. But of course, if that's coming out on Tuesday, that's the implication,” Fanusie said.  And two, it’s not clear if the millions raised actually reached terrorists at all. The funds may have been seized by law enforcement along the way.  “There were these attempts to raise this money, but [law enforcement may have been] able to go to these exchanges, stop them and close them,” Fanusie said.  Fanusie also played down the idea that privacy coins and mixing services might offer effective workarounds to using systems that broadcast transactions publicly, like the Bitcoin network. Privacy coins such as monero (XMR) don’t have enough liquidity for the purpose and mixing services are problematic too. Last year, the U.S. sanctioned Tornado Cash, an Ethereum mixer used by Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group, showing how far the arm of the law can stretch.  The WSJ report raises issues that have long been debated in crypto circles. Is crypto a tool for increased privacy or increased transparency in transactions, financial or otherwise? To critics of crypto, it is a subterfuge system best snuffed out and contained.  To advocates, it improves accountability and keeps actors honest, because they have to show their dealings to the world.  The public has generally failed to get its head around this paradox and reports like the WSJ’s hardly help to educate on the nuance. Fanusie, in fact, sounds relatively optimistic that improved AML and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures will help allay terrorist concerns going forward.  “The industry is taking illicit finance even more seriously. There are incentives to strengthen AML,” he said “And I think we’re going to see a push within the ecosystem to see that. Which is good.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | XMR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | XMR | BNB,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/13/is-hamas-using-crypto-to-attack-israel-we-dont-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3879437b61b134a033b8b38ab708bbca3317b057-3872x2592.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He got 5,000 BTC for around $22 at the time, although this figure often varies. Nevertheless, Koch ended up forgetting about this purchase until four years later when Bitcoin had blown up. By the time the Norwegian man got into his Bitcoin wallet, his initial $22 purchase had ballooned into $850,000. Upon seeing the life-changing sum, Koch revealed that he had used part of the money to buy himself a flat in Oslo.

So here are some picks that look good. Fetch AI (FET) Brings AI To Crypto The AI narrative is still holding strong both within and outside the crypto market and this has positioned some projects to be able to take advantage of its expected growth. Fetch AI’s native FET token has already shown the opportunity that lies in this space but that was only in a bear market. A bull market could see FET’s price rise further and do numbers. The project is looking to democratize AI access through a crypto economy. This means users will be able to access AI in a completely decentralized and permissionless way unlike the AI products seen in traditional spheres. Secret (SCRT) Challenges Bitcoin With Privacy Presently, when the topic of privacy coins comes up, two names tend to pop up quickly, which include Monero’s XMR and Secret’s SCRT. Secret actually users ‘Secret Contracts’ to allow decentralized applications to offer completely private transactions. As the demand for privacy grows among crypto users who constantly have to be aware of the government’s encroachment, SCRT’s value proposition becomes even more important. Added to its low $51 million market cap, SCRT could see a rally similar to that of Bitcoin. Radiant Capital (RDNT) With Fragmented Liquidity When it comes to carrying out transactions on-chain, liquidity becomes king, and this is where Radiant Capital (RDNT) comes in. The project is looking to consolidate fragmented liquidity in a bid to enhance the available liquidity for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunge: Long-Term Holders Buy $1.35 Billion Worth Of BTC This will work across a number of lending protocols regardless of the blockchain that they are on. So instead of hopping from one protocol to another, DeFi users can take advantage of this using a single protocol. Radiant’s value proposition in a sector that is continuously evolving and growing could see it put on a Bitcoin-like rally. This could see its market cap go from its current $70 million to billions of dollars.

42419466,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEVmH,1697221498,Ethereum's New Low-Fee Regime May Put Its 'Ultra Sound Money' Thesis to Test,"Ethereum is likely entering a new regime dominated by low network revenue generated from fees, testing its native token ether's [ETH] deflationary supply narrative, crypto data analytics firm IntoTheBlock said in a report.  The Ethereum blockchain's income from network fees dropped to its lowest level since April 2020 and is down 90% from its high this May, according to IntoTheBlock data.  Ethereum users over the past years' bull market complained about high transaction costs – also known as gas fees – while the network was prone to clogging due to increased activity from non-fungible token (NFT) trading and decentralized finance (DeFi) yield farming. Those days are gone as prices for cryptocurrencies cratered, demand for NFTs collapsed, and DeFi activity plummeted.  The proliferation of layer 2s, which have been developed to help Ethereum scale and increase its capacity, has also contributed to bringing down fees, the report noted. While the development is positive for Ethereum users who can execute transactions cheaper than before, it impacts ETH's supply by keeping it inflationary by burning fewer tokens than new issuance.  ""The decrease in fees is putting ETH's 'ultra sound money' thesis to a test,"" said Lucas Outumuro, IntoTheBlock's head of research.  Over the past 30 days, ETH token supply has grown by 33,500 ETH – worth some $52 million – driven by the low activity on the blockchain, data shows.  Outumuro said that network fee revenue will likely stay low as speculative activity dries up and users continue migrating to layer 2s. For example, NFT trading was responsible for the bulk of tokens burned in 2021 and early 2022, but last week, it only represented 8%, he said in the report.  ""The low fee regime represents a major transition for Ethereum, trading off high revenues and deflationary supply for the promise to be able to attract mainstream users through layer 2s,"" he added.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/13/ethereum-new-low-fee-regime-may-put-its-ultra-sound-money-thesis-to-test,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/926be966b1403c438e40be1a1da6733a662fcc50-1120x588.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419459,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEVg5,1697220802,Everything to Know About Sam Bankman-Fried’s Second Week in Court,"The second week of Sam Bankman-Fried’s closely-watched criminal lawsuit brought up allegations the former FTX chief executive approved bribes of Chinese Communist Party officials, sought emergency funding from Saudi Prince Bin Salman and was aware of the day-to-day operations of Alameda Research, despite claiming he instituted a firewall between the exchange and hedge fund.  Looking for more SBF courtroom coverage? Check out The SBF Trial newsletter, written by CoinDesk reporters and editors on the ground in the courtroom.  Caroline Ellison, SBF’s former girlfriend and ex-CEO of Alameda, kicked off the week with explosive testimony on Tuesday. Like in the prosecutors’ examination of FTX co-founder Gary Wang last week, Ellison admitted to committing fraud early in her questioning. Both Wang and Ellison have taken plea deals with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), along with another former FTX higher up, Nishad Singh, due to take the stand later in the trial, which could lead to reduced penalties for their professed crimes.  Ellison’s testimony covered her rocky relationship with SBF, her anxieties about Alameda’s nearly unlimited line of credit at FTX and the ways SBF coached the naturally timid math major through becoming the face of one of crypto’s most valuable trading firms. At least once on the stand Ellison broke into tears while discussing the tumultuous days leading up FTX’s collapse, when it became clear the exchange could not cover all the necessary customer withdrawals. (Exchanges, unlike banks, are not supposed to invest or spend deposits.)  See also: Who Is Alameda Research's Caroline Ellison?  Ellison also discussed the relief she felt when a doctored version of Alameda’s balance sheet was leaked to CoinDesk, leading to the publication of an award-winning article that cast doubt on the solvency of SBF’s crypto trading empire. FTX could not meet its obligations to customers, Ellison said, because the money had been stolen.  According to Ellison, FTX customer funds were withdrawn to meet many of Alameda’s financial obligations, including loans it took out from crypto lenders and to patch holes in the balance sheet after several of the supposedly market neutral hedge fund’s crypto investments went bad.  When Genesis Capital, a CoinDesk sister company, asked to see an updated accounting of the trading firm’s position, SBF allegedly “directed” Ellison to create seven false versions of its balance sheet that hid the money Alameda had misappropriated from FTX. She said on the stand she was aware this was a fraudulent misrepresentation that masked the true risks Alameda had accrued.  FTX customer’s assets also paid for Bahamian luxury real estate, venture capital deals and to fund a wide-spread political funding campaign, which was allegedly guided by SBF’s mother, Barabara Fried’s, Democrat campaign financing outfit. Ellison, who had asked for and was denied equity in Alameda, estimated $5 billion in personal loans were disbursed to FTX insiders.  SBF’s lead attorney Mark Cohen developed an argument during a cross-examination that, as CEO, Ellison was responsible for the firm’s deficient management. In particular, Ellison was asked about why the hedge fund failed to hedge for a market downturn or soured deals, which SBF supposedly suggested. For her part, Ellison admitted Alameda could have been more financially prepared, but also said no trading strategy could account for the billions in funds SBF had marshalled elsewhere.  At Ellison’s direction, FTX executives Wang and Singh gathered data about Alameda’s accumulated borrowings that found the firm had withdrawn deposits amounting to over three-quarters of FTX's customers' total holdings, including over half of the ETH on the exchange and lesser amounts of customers’ USDT and BTC. A later witness, Alameda developer Aditya Baradwaj, on Thursday said Alameda lost at least $200 million through preventable mistakes, including $100 million lost to a phishing scheme.  District Judge Lewis Kaplan continued this week to admonish SBF’s defense attorneys, who many courtroom attendees have said are asking redundant questions. Cohen’s ultimate strategy during Ellison’s cross-examination, which began and ended Thursday, has been described as meandering and confusing. In a sidebar with the judge, the prosecution accused SBF of sneering and laughing during Ellison’s testimony, which his lawyers denied.  See also: Defending the Indefensible? Sam Bankman-Fried's Lawyers | Opinion  CoinDesk has combed through recent reporting, court documents and transcripts to find the biggest highlights of the trial this week, including on how exchange token FTT was used to mislead investors, recent revelations about the $400 million attack of FTX and the most damning allegations so far.  Sam Bankman-Fried considered shutting down his hedge fund Alameda Research in mid-2022 due to concerns over its “nefarious trading activity” and over-leveraged position on the nominally separate exchange, FTX, according to an unpublished blog post introduced in SBF’s trial.  On Tuesday, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison testified the fund knowingly manipulated its balance sheet at SBF’s direction to look “less risky to investors.” The 28-year-old Ellison also said Alameda effectively stole billions of dollars from FTX customers to fund doomed investments and buy influence with politicians.  SBF’s defense attorneys have argued Ellison, a former romantic partner of the defendant, was a negligent manager of Alameda who ignored instructions from Bankman-Fried to “hedge,” contributing to the businesses’ collapse. The suggested strategy allegedly involved buying S&P 500 options, which SBF (largely erroneously) believed was “uncorrelated” with the crypto market.  On the stand Wednesday, Ellison revealed SBF was in talks with Saudi Prince Mohammed Bin Salman about backstopping FTX losses before it declared bankruptcy. SBF, allegedly, was regularly briefed on the amount of money Alameda had drawn against FTX customer accounts.  In an attempt to recover $1 billion in frozen funds on Huobi and OKX exchanges, which were locked up in a money laundering investigation in China, Ellison testified Alameda had attempted to bribe Chinese government officials into releasing the capital. The claim was stricken from the record.  Ellison also said Alameda paid Thai prostitutes to open accounts on those exchanges so they can run trading strategies meant to slowly drain the locked funds, which represented a significant percentage of the hedge fund’s assets at the time.  Ellison’s infamous “Things Sam is freaking out about” list was introduced as evidence, a Google Doc she updated “often” detailing her on-again-off-again boyfriend’s growing anxieties. Included on the list were “bad press” coverage and SBF’s scheme to sic regulators on rival Binance, on the belief that FTX would absorb Binance’s customers, which would help fill in its missing $8 billion.  SBF is accused of cultivating “a culture of secrecy” among higher-ups. This included using encrypted messaging app Signal (and setting messages to delete within a week), and preferably holding in-person meetings. Execs also used “coded” language — like referring to “our Korean friend” to refer to the alleged “backdoor” used to siphon funds from FTX.  SBF has argued this behavior was recommended by FTX’s hired counsel. Several FTX executives began saving messages during the exchange’s liquidity crisis in November that led to the firm filing for bankruptcy protections.  See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? | Opinion  FBI agents seized several documents belonging to Ellison when raiding her parents’ home in December 2022, including her personal diary and Google Docs referring to fraudulent activity at FTX in code.  Lax security practices at FTX could have resulted in billions of dollars in losses when the exchange was hacked last year. Accounts tied to FTX and FTX.US were drained on Nov. 11, 2022, mere hours after the company filed for bankruptcy, after someone accessed hot wallets. A new Wired report claims Gary Wang was able to send an FTX advisor $500 million in crypto while another party sent funds to custodial BitGo. Last week, the stolen funds began to move to privacy tools.  Russia-based cybercriminal groups have since been linked to the $400 million hack of FTX last November. According to analysis firm Elliptic, a65,000 ETH tranche of stolen funds ($100 million) was transferred to the Bitcoin blockchain using the RenBridge service. The attackers are still unknown, with suspects ranging from rogue employees at FTX to North Korean hacker group Lazarus.  An Alameda Research developer said the Sam Bankman-Fried-owned hedge fund lost at least $200 million through mismanagement. This includes a $40 million loss yield farming on a “new blockchain of questionable legitimacy,” $100 million lost through a fake phishing link on Google Ads and a host of other calamities spurred by SBF’s desire “to move very, very fast.” The employee, Aditya Baradwaj, also said FTX stored crypto keys in plaintext in an easily accessible file.  Alameda struggled to get an audit, according to Ellison’s testimony on Thursday. The firm apparently tried to hire accountants in 2021 to 2022, but “they couldn't or wouldn't do it"" after reviewing Alameda’s books. Reportedly, former FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame prepared Alameda's balance sheets, but at some point, Ellison took over this task.  According to CoinDesk reporters in the room, Ellison’s “cross” was occasionally “meandering” and at times appeared vexing to District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who cautioned SBF’s attorneys not to repeat questions or ask about already established facts. Asked about the firm’s borrowing policies, Ellison reportedly asked Cohen: “Do you have anything more specific?”  After a back-and-forth between the DOJ and SBF’s lawyers over whether FTX’s now widely-profitable investment in AI startup Anthropic could be brought up, Judge Kaplan said it would be misleading evidence (suggesting that FTX customers could be repaid in part or in whole). In a Sunday court filing, the DOJ said SBF’s $500 million investment in Anthropic in 2022 came from customer funds. Ellison was also an investor in the firm, which is reportedly nearing an investment from Amazon valuing it at $4 billion. Kaplan ultimately agreed Thursday with the prosecution that a successful investment using customer funds was irrelevant, drawing a comparison to someone stealing money from the Federal Reserve to use on Powerball lottery tickets.

42419471,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEVrR,1697220218,Hamas' Crypto Ties May Lend Energy to Sen. Warren's Money Laundering Bill,"One of the U.S. Senate's top crypto critics, Elizabeth Warren, says the cryptocurrency support of Hamas offers more evidence to back her effort against crypto illegality.  Warren had already tapped high-profile, bipartisan names to back her legislation meant to target crypto money laundering.  The revelations that the terrorist group behind last week’s attack on villages in southern Israel that left more than 1,200 Israelis dead was partially funded with cryptocurrency may lend additional weight to an effort from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and others to push for a law targeting money laundering and sanctions abuses in crypto.  The Senate bill, which the Chamber of Digital Commerce argues would “eradicate digital asset innovation from the United States at the expense of market security,” extends anti-money-laundering requirements from the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) to providers of digital assets wallets, crypto miners, validators and other network participants. While it wasn't previously seen as having a strong chance at becoming law this year, the attack by Hamas could strengthen Warren's argument.  ""We believe this materially improves prospects for the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023 as it makes it politically difficult for any lawmaker to stand in the way of tougher AML/BSA for crypto,"" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, wrote in a research note.  So far, the legislation introduced in July hasn't made any overt progress toward a committee approval. But the high-profile senator from Massachusetts has tied the Hamas news to her effort.  ""It’s alarming and should be a wakeup call for lawmakers and regulators that digital wallets connected to Hamas received millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies,"" Warren posted this week on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. She argued it's time to make sure law enforcement agencies have the right powers to ""crack down on crypto-financed crimes.""  The bill was co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), who has often occupied a middle ground between the parties on important legislative issues, and Republican Sens. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). And Warren later gathered additional support from Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who leads the Homeland Security panel.  That's a heavy roster, though any controversial bill faces an uphill climb in this Congress, where each party controls one of the chambers, the House of Representatives is currently operating without a speaker and the funding of the government will expire on Nov. 17. Still, some of Warren’s money-laundering concerns have also been addressed in another piece of legislation – an amendment to the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

42419476,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEVwb,1697218171,"SBF Trial: Crypto Lender BlockFi Believed Alameda Was Solvent Given Balance Sheet It Was Shown, CEO Testifies","NEW YORK — BlockFi CEO Zac Prince resumed his testimony against former counterparty Sam Bankman-Fried on Friday, detailing to the court how his lending firm was forced to declare bankruptcy because of its involvement in FTX and Alameda Research.  BlockFi started lending money to Alameda Research around the end of 2020 or early 2021, Prince said, in what he recalled were “very robust loan agreements.” After an initial round of loans, Alameda requested more money from the lender in the second quarter of 2021 after which BlockFi let the hedge fund borrow “significantly” more money following a conversation with Bankman-Fried.  As of May 2022, BlockFi’s loans to Alameda exceeded $1 billion, Prince said. But BlockFi started asking for money back because BlockFi had suffered losses from the collapse of the Terra Luna crypto ecosystem.  Alameda Research repaid all the money, after which BlockFi made new loans to the company worth $850 million.  When asked about how BlockFi made sure that Alameda would at one point be able to pay back its loans, Prince said that it received multiple quarterly balance sheets from the hedge fund that showed that it had a large sum of liquid assets and was solvent. Alameda also posted collateral, consisting mostly of FTX’s native token FTT and other cryptocurrencies.  Before collapsing in November 2022, Alameda had about $800 million to $850 million of outstanding loans from BlockFi, Prince said, and $650 million remained after Alameda’s demise. Alameda even posted additional collateral in the form of FTT as well as Robinhood and shares of a Grayscale trust, Prince recalled.  Besides being a lender to Alameda, BlockFi was also a customer of FTX. It had Alameda collateral on FTX and also traded customer funds worth around $350 million on the former exchange.  In total, Prince recalled, BlockFi lost “a little over a billion dollars” as a result of its involvement with FTX and Alameda Research, which was enough to force it to declare bankruptcy less than three weeks after the collapse of Bankman-Fried’s empire.  The cross  Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s lead attorney, asked Prince to walk through BlockFi’s master loan agreement, credit facility documents and other reports the company generated as part of its business with Alameda.  At one point, Cohen asked Prince to clarify BlockFi’s due diligence process, asking for the names of any attorneys who may have been involved. Prince said BlockFi’s general counsel, three deputies and their teams all may have been involved in reviewing Alameda’s paperwork.  Near the end of Friday’s session, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos asked Prince to explain why BlockFi filed for bankruptcy when it did, leading to Prince saying he did not think it would have filed in November 2022 if its funds on FTX and loans to Alameda hadn’t been “impaired.”  It may still have had to file for bankruptcy later, he later clarified.  Fine Print  Friday was Prince’s second day testifying. He had taken the stand for a mere eight minutes Thursday, following former Alameda Research employee Christian Drappi and former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, both of whom testified about Alameda’s role in taking FTX customer funds. During his Thursday appearance, Prince explained how crypto lenders work.  Notably, he testified that BlockFi’s customers were well aware that the company lent customer funds out to other parties to generate interest. This information was in BlockFi’s terms of service, and Prince said he advertised it in other ways, like discussing it on podcasts – seemingly drawing a stark contrast to FTX.  Prosecutors have spent the first two weeks of Bankman-Fried’s trial asking former FTX executives and employees whether the exchange’s customers were aware that their funds were being loaned to Alameda.  They were not, four different witnesses said.

18768429,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555296,1697216435,Have Traders Moved Past Dogecoin? Transactions Plunge 98% Since June,"Data shows that Dogecoin transactions have dropped more than 98% since June, a sign that investors have lost interest in the meme coin. Dogecoin 7-Day Transaction Count Has Dropped To Just 37,300 According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, activity on the DOGE network has really slowed down recently. The metric of interest here is the total number of transactions that the Dogecoin blockchain is observing every day. When this indicator has a high value, it means that the investors are making a large amount of moves on the network right now. Such a trend implies that the holders have an active interest in trading the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Rejection At This Historical Line, Bear Market Back On? On the other hand, low values imply the blockchain is only seeing a few daily transfers, which can be a sign that traders have no interest in using the meme coin currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average number of daily Dogecoin transactions over the past few months: Looks like the 7-day average value of the metric has been heading down in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin blockchain observed a high amount of transaction activity during July and the first half of August. As the second half of August kicked off, however, the indicator’s value saw a steep decline. The reason behind this sharp drop is likely to be the crash that the price of the meme coin saw at about the same time. Before this crash, DOGE had been trading above the $0.076 mark, but after it, the asset plummeted toward the low $0.06 level. Till now, the coin hasn’t been able to recover from this plunge. Rather, the memecoin’s situation has only become more dire recently, as its price has registered some drawdown even below these lows. From the chart, it’s visible that the transactions on the network have seen a similar fate, as they have dropped to pretty low levels now. At present, the 7-day average number of daily transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain stands at 37,300, which is quite the plunge compared to the 616,000 spike seen in July. The current levels are even worse when looking at a longer timespan, as IntoTheBlock notes that the asset had been enjoying 2.1 million 7-day average daily transfers just back in June. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunge Below $27,000 Drives Investors Into Fear, Will Rebound Occur? Compared to this high in June, the network activity today has declined by more than 98%, which is a staggering figure. It would appear that almost no one wants to use Dogecoin right now, at least compared to the high interest the coin had seen a few months back. Historically, rallies have been backed by a high amount of user activity, but as transfers have shown no signs of any recovery recently, it’s not surprising that the meme coin’s price hasn’t been able to display any momentum, either.

That's who narrowly got the party's nomination, but after less than two days of campaigning for the House's top job, he dropped out in frustration, unable to win over the handful of lawmakers whose resistance could tank his ability to get the 217 votes needed to take the job.  ""We have to have everybody put their agendas on the side and focus on what this country needs,"" Scalise said when he withdrew, adding that some of the members need to look in the mirror and ask themselves what they want. ""Are we going to get it back on track? Or they're going to try to pursue their own agenda?""  The next steps are murky as Republicans seek a new nominee, and that uncertainty could envelop digital assets legislation that House lawmakers and crypto lobbyists had hoped would see action in November. Two crypto-focused bills await action in the House: one to set up government guardrails for U.S.-issued stablecoins and the other to establish a wide-reaching system of regulations for crypto markets.  Scalise stepping back leaves Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) in the speaker role on a temporary basis, which means he can't mind the store at the House Financial Services Committee, where he's chairman. That's the committee doing the House's heavy lifting on crypto legislation. Meanwhile, the extent of McHenry's powers as a stand-in speaker are unclear, but it's unlikely that pushing crypto legislation would be a top priority.  Since Scalise is staying in his current job, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), one of crypto's biggest fans in Congress, won't get greater power by stepping into that majority leader role. This keeps him – at least for now – as majority whip, the No. 3 role in the House leadership, unless the search for a speaker eventually seeks him out.  The leading remaining candidate for speaker is Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the chair of the House Judiciary Committee and the favorite of former President Donald Trump. But he's already failed to get the majority of Republicans to back him in their internal balloting to nominate a speaker this week.  Scalise dropping out ""injected unneeded additional chaos into the race for House speaker and has members questioning if anyone can reach the magic number of 217,"" according to an analysis Friday from Beacon Policy Advisors in Washington.

42419468,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEVoL,1697211898,SEC Deadline on Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Dispute Approaching at Midnight,"The final hours are ticking down for an appeal from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its dispute with Grayscale Investments over establishing a spot bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded fund (ETF). If the agency does nothing further by midnight Eastern, Grayscale's application to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF formally returns to life.  Industry observers are widely expecting the SEC to let the deadline run out because the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision 45 days ago was clear and even harsh in its assessment of how the agency declined the application, calling it ""arbitrary and capricious"" and saying the regulator was inappropriately trying to treat a spot ETF differently than a similar futures ETF. However, as the SEC is forced to rethink the Grayscale effort, it technically has the authority to further extend the dispute if the commission wants to find fault with other aspects of the application.  At stake is what could be an easily traded, mainstream investment product focused on bitcoin. The industry hopes a spot ETF will bring investors in from the sidelines.  Grayscale first applied for its GBTC closed-end fund (currently with roughly $17 billion in assets under management) to be converted into a spot bitcoin ETF in October 2021. Grayscale – a unit of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk – isn't alone in its pursuit of this approval. High profile financial firms including BlackRock and Fidelity are also awaiting SEC word on their applications for spot bitcoin ETFs.  ""GBTC remains operationally ready to convert to an ETF upon appropriate regulatory approvals,"" Jennifer Rosenthal, a Grayscale spokeswoman, said on Friday.  SEC spokespeople didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Even in a victory for ETF applicants, plenty of questions remain as to when the first product would go online, and whose it would be. The approvals required from the SEC are wide-ranging and involve multiple divisions at the agency, and it's unclear whether the agency would approve several applicants at once or proceed on a timeline based on when applications came in. As for the markets, experts are guessing that the SEC's eventual approval of the ETFs is at least partially priced in.  ""That makes it less clear how much more bitcoin could outperform if a favorable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision occurs,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase Institutional, wrote in a monthly report sent to subscribers on Thursday.

Increasingly higher lows during the year and a horizontal resistance zone had formed an ascending triangle – a potentially bullish chart pattern. This pattern, however, is possibly failing. A busted pattern target could send the price per ETH sub-$1,000. Is the bullish chart pattern breaking down? | ETHUSD on TradingView.com Ethereum Ascending Triangle Begins Breakdown: Target $700 Ethereum put in its bear market low back in June of 2022 while Bitcoin and other coins kept falling through the end of the year. Despite the early lead in a bear market recovery, ETH has underperformed against BTC in 2023. Now it is at risk of falling to a new low with a target of deep below $1,000 if a presumed bullish pattern breaks down instead of up. Related Reading: Ethereum News Catalyst Could Trigger Triangle Breakout To $4,000 ETHUSD has been trading in what appears to be a textbook ascending triangle pattern since its 2022 local low. A series of increasingly higher highs has created an upward slowing trend line. A horizontal resistance zone across $2,000 has kept price action at bay. Volume has been trending downward throughout the course of the pattern. Price is at roughly two-thirds to the triangle apex. Ether even had positive news at its back: the launch of the first Ethereum Futures ETFs. Yet it has failed to produce any meaningful upside, and is now trying to move back down causing the bullish pattern to bust. If the pattern does break downward, it would have a target of around $700 per ETH based on the measure rule. Or is the a bearish barrier triangle anyway? | ETHUSD on TradingView.com Elliott Wave Explained: Golden Fibonacci Extension Targets $300 ETH Although the ascending triangle is considered a bullish chart pattern, it only has a roughly 63% probability of breaking out, per the Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns by Thomas Bulkowski. The remaining 37% of the time break down. But technical analysis is a broad study. An ascending triangle to one trader, could be barrier triangle to another. A barrier triangle is simply an ascending or descending triangle as defined by Elliott Wave Principle. In Elliott Wave Principle, triangles are especially telling. They only appear before the final move in a sequence. Because Elliott Wave labels waves with the trend as 1 through 5, triangles are corrective and appear only in the wave 4 place – just prior to wave 5 which ends the sequence. Related Reading: Doom Signal Warns Of 50% Crypto Collapse In a bear market, corrective structures are labeled ABC. Triangles themselves can appear during a B wave, which once again, is ahead of the final move in the ABC count. C wave targets are often found by projecting the 1.618 Fibonacci ratio from the A wave. This makes the target of the busted pattern somewhere around $300 per ETH. Between the measure rule and the Fibonacci extension target, Ethereum could be facing sub-$1,000 prices in the future.

The platform's native token (THOR) has risen by 10% in the past 24-hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  The updated terms and conditions restrict users from accessing the exchange if they are based in countries sanctioned by the U.S., UK or the European Union. Specific countries cited include Myanmar, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, Syria and Zimbabwe.  ""THORSwap is back online!"" the company wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). ""Other than the shiny new terms of service, users won't notice a thing. Behind the scenes, we've partnered with an industry leader to put some extra guardrails in place to help prevent the flow of illicit funds.""  The THORSwap protocol runs atop THORChain, a network that allows users to freely trade tokens between different blockchains. It had paused operations a week ago – shifting into ""maintenance mode"" – after ""consultation with advisors, legal counsel and law enforcement,"" as the team put it.  That announcement came after a crypto wallet labeled as belonging to ""FTX Exploiter"" suddenly started moving around funds in recent weeks to various addresses and protocols – including THORSwap; the funds had sat dormant in the wallet for many months.  The FTX Exploiter wallet held some of the $600 million that was drained by hackers from wallets associated with Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange, amid the chaos that followed the company's messing bankruptcy filing in late 2022.

The altcoin market has been stabilizing over the last day, but fresh data points to potential issues in the short term. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Says Ethereum Price Can Reach $35,000, Here’s When As of this writing, Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.23 with sideways movement in the past day. Solana and Ethereum recorded similar price action over this period, but these assets have been slowly bleeding into support on the weekly chart. Cardano, Solana, And Altcoins Could Get Hit Data shared by the Co-Founders of crypto analysis firm Glassnode via social media platform X indicates a rise in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). The metric was slowly trending to the downside, but it found some support yesterday and could be poised to regain previously lost territory. The metric measures the percentage of the total crypto market capitalization comprised of Bitcoin. In addition, whenever BTC.D reaches a certain point, it often leads to mini altcoin bull or bear markets. The metric could hint at further losses for Cardano, Solana, and other tokens in the current scenario. The Glassnode Co-Founders stated: It’s not just ETH feeling the heat; other major altcoins like Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, Tron, Polkadot, and Polygon are also deep in the red. With Bitcoin’s dominance climbing past 51%, inching closer to its 2021 peak, altcoins are indeed feeling the pressure. To see the resurgence of the much-awaited Altcoins Season, a significant recovery will be essential. As seen in the chart below, the Bitcoin Altcoin Cycle chart is moving closer to a “Bitcoin Season,” as indicated by the blue line. As Bitcoin Dominance trends upwards into the 50% territory, altcoins will likely keep seeing losses in the short time frame. However, the Bitcoin Altcoin Cycle chart shows that the BTC.D stands at a critical zone. The metric has bounced back into the Altcoin Season Territory in the past. In particular, Cardano, Solana, XRP, Ethereum, and other altcoins enjoyed a substantial rally in July. If Bitcoin can’t produce a catalyzer, something to push it above the 50% area in dominance, then Altcoins can see some profits. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Addresses ETHGate Rumors: Did Ethereum Bribe The SEC To Go After XRP? Ethereum could potentially hold the key to propel altcoins into a hot season. On this cryptocurrency’s price action, the Glassnode co-founder stated: From its weekly resistance at $1,744, ETH has tumbled, marking an 8% decline in just two weeks, landing it at $1,574.

Lucie wrapped up her tweet affirming the commitment to Shibarium’s growth as an L2 solution, stating, “Our steadfast commitment to building Shibarium as a successful L2 solution remains unshakable.” She championed the collaborative and innovative ethos that forms the foundation for the tokens and the burgeoning Shibarium ecosystem, saying: This journey, marked by collaboration, innovation, and dedication, is the bedrock of our tokens’ triumph and the thriving Shibarium ecosystem. Together, we’re shaping the future of decentralized applications, one innovative step at a time. #ShibariumJourney However, not all members of the SHIB community are on board with the project’s current trajectory. A notable tweet from @a_king_li read: “@ShytoshiKusama: L2 has been released for two months now, and there are no major projects, no good ecosystem or trustworthy swap. As a responsible official, should we release some official cooperative ecosystems or swap, so that funds can come in with peace of mind.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu-Based BONE Gearing Up For Massive Rally, Here’s Why The concerns primarily arise from the absence of any major dApp on Shibarium, as touched on by Lucie. Notable projects like ShibaSwap and the Metaverse are yet to be operational on Shibarium. Furthermore, there’s a noted decline in Shibarium’s user and transaction statistics. After an initial hype with over 200,000 transactions daily post-launch, recent numbers hover above a mere 10,000 transactions per day. Shiba Inu Price Stabilizes The stagnation in Shibarium’s development may be a contributing factor to the dissatisfaction of some community members, as well as SHIB’s recent price action. As detailed in our last in-depth analysis, the SHIB price currently treads on decisive technical grounds, influenced by two significant chart patterns. On the 1-week chart, SHIB showcases a promising quadruple bottom formation, indicating a potential bullish surge of up to 250% if realized. Contrarily, a descending triangle pattern, which has evolved over 60 weeks, suggests a bearish downturn. This is highlighted as SHIB’s price, currently at $0.00000682, has dropped below the descending triangle’s crucial neckline of $0.00000715. For now, SHIB has stabilized and recovered slightly, having already fallen to $0.00000671 yesterday. Hope also comes from previous instances, such as the dip in June followed by a 59% rally, suggesting the potential for swift recoveries. However, for this to happen, SHIB needs to record a weekly close above the $0.00000715 this week or next week. This might cement the bullish quadruple bottom trajectory. In case the scenario does not play out, SHIB could fall again towards the yearly low at $0.000006.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) has outperformed other cryptocurrencies amid macroeconomic uncertainty, partially due to traders pricing a potential approval of spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Coinbase Institutional. ""We think the divergence in the performance of bitcoin and other tokens shows that the potential approval of one or more spot bitcoin ETPs has already been partially priced in. That makes it less clear how much more bitcoin could outperform if a favorable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision occurs,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase Institutional, said in the latest monthly report sent to subscribers on Thursday.  U.S. regulators have targeted former Voyager Digital CEO Steve Ehrlich with lawsuits claiming he engaged in fraud and deliberately misrepresented his customers’ government protections. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced related actions against Ehrlich on Thursday, with the CFTC also including in its court filing that Circle's USDC stablecoin and bitcoin as commodities. The CFTC accused Ehrlich of defrauding customers by misleading them about the strength of the company and doing business without proper registrations. The FTC said he lied about customers’ funds being protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Caroline Ellison, 28, wrapped up her testimony on Thursday, her third day of questioning in the Sam Bankman-Fried trial. Sporting the same gray blazer as the last two days, Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend was asked about her company's accounting. Alameda engaged with a few accountants in 2021 to 2022, but after those firms reviewed Alameda's books, ""they found they couldn't or wouldn't do it,"" Ellison said, as she faced questions from Attorney Mark Cohen. Former FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame initially prepared Alameda's balance sheets, but at some point, Ellison took over this task, she testified. The company's financials are at the center of Bankman-Fried's demise. An award-winning CoinDesk story in November 2022 that cited Alameda's confidential balance sheet caused many to doubt the viability of Alameda and FTX.

42392315,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4x9X,1697198400,Bitcoin Wallet Maker Finances 3D-Printed Gun Documentary,"The company behind a bitcoin wallet known for its privacy features is stepping out as a benefactor of the arts.  Samourai Wallet is credited as an executive producer of ""Death Athletic: A Dissident Architecture,"" a documentary about Cody Wilson, the firebrand advocate for homemade firearms. The film, directed by Jessica Solce, will premiere at a private showing in New York on Saturday and in Austin, Texas, the following weekend, with a digital release scheduled for Oct. 21.  ""Samourai joined the production in 2021 with funds to help me finish the film. I was self-producing [until] that point,"" Solce told CoinDesk. ""They provided financial backing for post-production of the film,"" along with another executive producer, Thomas Donnelly. She would not disclose the film's budget but said it was a six-figure number.  ""Death Athletic"" follows Wilson, the founder of Defense Distributed in Austin, Texas, over the course of seven years. It chronicles his legal battles with the U.S. government and 20 state attorneys general for the right to publish files that show how to build weapons using a 3D printer or computer numerical control (CNC) mill. (These firearms are often called ghost guns because they can be made without a serial number or registration.)  The film also covers Wilson’s arrest for sexual assault in 2018, his subsequent plea to a lesser charge and probation sentence, and his resignation and eventual return to Defense Distributed, led during his absence by Paloma Heindorff.  ""We believe that the culture of a movement is one of the most important aspects to the longevity of that movement and how loyal it remains to the original vision,"" Samourai said in a statement to CoinDesk. ""As such we have made several bitcoin contributions to artists and creatives in the space over the years.""  Financing ""Death Athletic,"" however, ""was our biggest show of support to date.""  Many early bitcoin adopters and hardcore users see Wilson as a kindred spirit, and not only because he also worked on Dark Wallet, an early predecessor to privacy-enhancing software projects like Samourai. He has long declared that sharing the open-source blueprints for weapons is an act of speech, protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, similar to arguments cryptocurrency advocates often use against certain forms of regulation.  ""We see serious parallels in the homemade gun space and in the fully sovereign private bitcoin space,"" Samourai's statement said. ""Both are strongly stigmatized in the media, both require strong men to fight against all odds. There are lessons both communities can learn from another.""

Early Thursday, Frax unveiled sFRAX, an ERC4626 staking vault allowing holders of the protocol's partially collateralized fractional-algorithmic stablecoin FRAX to earn yields matching the U.S. Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate on reserve balances (IORB), currently around 5.4%.  The product debuted with an APY of 10%, eventually converging with the Fed's 5.4% IORB rate. So far, more than 150 users have poured in more than $35 million in the vault, according to Dune Analytics.  FXS' price rose 7% to $5.66 on Thursday, but has since pulled back to $5.49 to indicate a 0.5% gain on a 24-hour basis, CoinDesk data show. The steady price action is consistent with the continued low-volume range play among market leaders bitcoin and ether.  The new offering comes as lending protocol MakerDAO enjoys a first-mover advantage in capitalizing on high interest in the U.S. According to Parsec Finance, MakerDAO has invested over $2 billion in short-term bonds via offchain structures since February 2022, offering a 5% savings rate on DAI and buy back its MKR token.  On a year-to-date basis, MKR has gained over 168%, outshining bitcoin's 62% rise by a big margin. FXS, meanwhile, has gained only 32% this year. Some in the crypto community expect FXS to catch up with MKR.  ""Impressive growth from sFRAX with $24.6M allocated to Frax Finance's FinresPBC short-term U.S. Treasuries strategy currently yielding 10%.

18755588,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555312,1697194902,Crypto Analyst Breaks Down The Factors Behind The Bitcoin Price Decline,"As the bear market continues to linger, analysts have weighed in on the decline of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and the crypto market, by extension. This time, another crypto analyst has explained what is influencing Bitcoin’s price decline. Factors Causing BTC’s Decline Bitcoin notably dropped below the $27,000 level on October 12. Addressing this decline in a recent episode on the ‘Cheeky Crypto’ YouTube channel, Crypto analyst Nick noted that there wasn’t much going on in the news and the only thing that could have affected Bitcoin’s drop was the US inflation data, which was recently released with the CPI rising higher than expected. Related Reading: US Mega Bank JPMorgan Predicts Harsh Drop In This Bitcoin Metric He then analyzed key on-chain metrics that could have affected Bitcoin’s price. According to data he pulled up from Cheeky Crypto’s site, there were 903,210 active addresses in the last twenty-four hours (he released the video on October 12). The data also showed that 610,686 active addresses received Bitcoin during that period, and 560,331 active addresses sent Bitcoin during the same time frame, amounting to 265,000 transactions. What was, however, more interesting was the fact that only 23 million addresses held BTC out of the total 48.7 million addresses in existence. He stated that these figures were important to give an insight into Bitcoin’s adoption rate as one could easily assume that almost all the Bitcoin addresses in existence held BTC. Meanwhile, less than half actually did. BTC price continues to fluctuate | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com More Selling Pressure For Bitcoin As to another factor that could be causing the decline, he noted that retail investors had been selling in the past few days. However, the silver lining, as Nick highlighted, is that this selloff suggests that institutional investors are accumulating once more, considering that they had once dumped their tokens on these retail investors. Additionally, 108 wallets hold over 10,000 BTC. These wallets, which Nick labeled as the “master manipulators” of BTC’s price, are also experiencing a similar sell-off trend as these wallets are down 8.47% in the last 180 days, which suggests that they are “aggressively” selling off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunge: Long-Term Holders Buy $1.35 Billion Worth Of BTC From the chart he shared, one could see that the trend dates back to April 2023 (the peak of accumulation by these wallets) as they have begun to cool off and dump some of their holdings on the market. His analysis suggests that there could be a bigger picture regarding Bitcoin’s decline rather than any immediate factor. Despite this decline and the amount of liquidations that have occurred, Nick is still optimistic that Bitcoin could end this month in the green. October is reported to be one of the best-performing months for Bitcoin, with the crypto token ending October in the green for the last five years.

42392309,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4wUV,1697192943,DeFi Is Losing the Race to Become the Future of Finance,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is rapidly emerging as the biggest loser in the ongoing cryptocurrency bear market.  The total amount of capital locked on DeFi protocols dropped to its lowest point since February 2021 on Thursday as traders pull liquidity to secure higher yields that come with less risk.  When DeFi burst onto the scene in 2020 in a period that was dubbed ""DeFi summer,"" many believed that the ability to borrow and lend without and intermediary was groundbreaking and that DeFi firms were about to dislodge its traditional finance (TradFi) counterparts.  However, DeFi's ""future of finance"" narrative was soon knocked over as the wider crypto market succumbed to a bearish cycle in 2022. Interest rates continued to spike across the globe as central banks scrambled for a way to fight inflation. This led to increased yields across money market funds and mortgage funds, leaving the DeFi sector without any incentives for new capital.  TradFi competition  Now, Vanguard's money market fund is offering clients a yield of 5.28%, the returns for staking Ethereum on Lido meanwhile stand at just 3.3%, leaving a minimal risk to reward ratio compared to traditional finance products.  This caused DeFi's fragile liquidity to run for the exits, with total value locked (TVL) across all protocols dropping from $163.5 billion in April 2022 to today's figure of $36 billion.  ""There is certainly less yield in everything now,"" Folkvang's Head of DeFi Trading Vyomesh Dua told CoinDesk. ""But even in this low TVL regime we see a lot of high activity and opportunities around the new stuff people have been developing.""  ""Every time a new DeFi product catches a lot of attention, activity in the whole ecosystem surrounding it increases and there’s exciting but short-lived opportunities to make money,"" Dua added. ""However the capital one can deploy in this space today is limited as the opportunity sizes are smaller.""  There has been a few of emerging narratives like liquid staking, which lost much of its interest after Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake network, tokenization of real world assets (RWAs), on-chain derivatives and new blockchains, but none of these have been able to capture the level of appetite last seen in the summer of 2020.  That summer, it was not uncommon to see DeFi yields soar to between 18% and 35%. This yield of course came with a risk as hackers honed in on the sector with a series of complex exploits to part investors with their money.  DeFi hacks proliferated in 2022 and 2023, with a report earlier this month describing how $212.5 million had recently been stolen in a three-week period.  In 2023, there has 297 crypto hacks, resulting in a loss of $1.89 billion, according to Money Monger's crypto heist report.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/13/defi-is-losing-the-race-to-become-the-future-of-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8f31d82759cc4cf4d4f846a57080017e74dccc7-5184x2769.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392301,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4vzj,1697191200,Things Sam Bankman-Fried's Lawyers Should Be Freaking Out About,"For a moment Thursday, it looked like Sam Bankman-Fried’s lead attorney, Mark Cohen, was lulling the U.S. Department of Justice’s star witness, Caroline Ellison, into a false sense of security on the stand.  The former Alameda Research CEO was clearly comfortable testifying during her cross-examination. She answered “yes or no?” questions with unnecessary levels of detail – a generally unwise practice for witnesses in a criminal trial. The government’s star witness even corrected Cohen’s choppy pronunciation and wording on certain questions.  And yet, at the end of a nearly five-hour back-and-forth the press corps hoped would be fiery, Cohen rested without proving his expected point: That Caroline Ellison was perhaps more responsible for FTX’s collapse last November than his own client. It was an argument Cohen seemed to telegraph in his opening statement, when he blamed Ellison’s failure to hedge Alameda’s bad crypto bets as somehow paramount. By his closing question to Ellison, he’d seemingly failed.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Cohen, a well-regarded white collar crime attorney, also failed to severely undermine Ellison’s credibility. He landed one solid hit on the crypto empire’s insider trustworthiness when he caught her conveniently forgetting the somewhat positive characterization of Bankman-Fried’s awareness of their various (alleged) crime-ing that she’d lodged during extensive pretrial interviews with prosecutors.  A feverish-sounding, immediate intervention from Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon indicated she understood the moment’s gravity. Judge Kaplan, who hates sidebars even more than the morning’s court security officer hates cell phones, then called for one – revealing that he, too, understood. Did the jury? Probably not.  Cohen did not bring up any questions about her recreational drug use. He did not deeply probe her past romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried. (Granted, doing so might have caught jurors’ ire). While answers to his initial line of questioning suggested Ellison ran Alameda on her own with little oversight from the defendant – possibly contradicting her testimony from Wednesday – Cohen dropped that angle fairly quickly.  He also did not capitalize on Ellison’s aggressive overanswering. Cohen did a verbal double take when his binary question,“Was hacking a risk to Alameda?” yielded, “Yes, it was, it happened a few times,” from Ellison. And yet, he did not follow up.  Cohen’s cross-examination plodded through old ground. He wrapped on a superficial kicker that cast Ellison as a baddie, but hardly worse than Bankman-Fried.  To be clear, the defense has not yet begun presenting its case or confirmed that it has one at all. We don’t know what final arguments they’ll make to demonstrate Bankman-Fried is not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And the attorneys are limited in what they can discuss during cross-examination: They can only discuss issues brought up during the prosecution's initial direct examination.  But Thursday's lackluster questioning of a key witness to the operation and collapse of what was once a multibillion-dollar empire continues a trend by the defense team. Christian Everdell, Cohen’s partner in the courtroom, had a similarly aimless cross-examination with Gary Wang, another former FTX executive, last week. (Editor’s note: Actually it was Tuesday, but it sure felt like last week.)  There, Everdell focused on specific details about Wang’s signing of loan agreements with Alameda, his cooperation agreement with the DOJ and the Alameda software bug. But he failed to really poke holes in the former chief technology officer’s testimony or argue that his testimony was solely to advance a government narrative.  By contrast, the DOJ has so far crafted what seems to be a clear, straightforward narrative: Sam Bankman-Fried took billions of dollars from his customers and investors, and he directed his closest friends to do things that enabled him to take these funds. He then gambled those billions on risky bets and poor corporate governance – and lost. But the main issue at the heart of the government’s case is that he took the funds to begin with.  Thursday’s knockout blow came at day's end, when prosecutors played secret tapes of Ellison revealing to her Alameda underlings that the company had used FTX as its personal piggy bank. It was a Watergate-esque moment that captured the jury’s full attention.  The prosecutors’ Alexander Butterfield equivalent, an Alameda software engineer named Christian Drappi, testified about the secret tape in a somber (if kinda messy) black suit and black tie. His contribution may well have buried the defense.  The defense's ineffective response attempted to discredit Ellison’s smoking gun tape from the all-hands meeting by playing a section where she laughed and said it had all been “fun.” But prosecutors mitigated that attack vector by getting Drappi to confirm Ellison nervously laughed all 18 months he knew her.  Judge Lewis Kaplan even commented on the defense’s possible fumbled play (after the jury was sent out during a break).  “You have spent the last day and a half doing your level best – and I'm not criticizing. I understand it's your job. You should have been doing it – trying to impugn her credibility. You did that in the opening statement. You are going to do it in closing,” he said during a back-and-forth on admissible evidence.  Cohen, to his credit, broached new ground in some of his questions to Ellison on Thursday, but still managed to confuse her with some of his queries and asked for three sidebars and a 15-minute break within the first two hours of his case. All together, he questioned Ellison for a mere two hours and nine minutes before lunch – and less than three hours overall, by our math.  The consensus among observers is clear: The defense’s strategy is totally opaque right now.  — Nikhilesh De, Danny Nelson  Courtroom scenes  Judge Lewis Kaplan is a gifted orator who also seems to accept no nonsense from the attorneys arguing before him. During one sidebar – which the jury couldn’t hear – on Thursday, he took both the prosecution and defense to task for spending a large amount of time asking former Alameda Research developer Drappi – a “low level” employee – about whether or not he saw Bankman-Fried often as the head of FTX and owner of Alameda.  “You both get A+ in evidence law, but this is a colossal waste of time,” the judge told the attorneys. “There is absolutely no doubt he owned the company. Ellison, the ostensible co-CEO or CEO, runs all these decisions through him. He was obviously the boss. What are we wasting this time for?”  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Danielle Kudla and Sassoon and defense attorney Everdell argued over whether Drappi could say that Bankman-Fried was misrepresenting his role with Alameda in tweets, an argument the judge said was “a joke.”  Kudla said the prosecution just wanted to establish that Drappi saw Bankman-Fried.  “Why don't you ask him that,” the judge said. Kudla said she was and it would take 10 minutes.  “Some people don't have 10 minutes left to live,” the judge retorted.  Sassoon clarified that the prosecution wanted Drappi to confirm what Ellison, as a cooperating witness, said.  “If your case rises and falls on whether this guy believed that Sam Bankman-Fried was running the show, you've got troubles,” Judge Kaplan said. “Could we move along?”  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  Prosecutors told Judge Lewis Kaplan at the end of Thursday’s session that they planned to call BlockFi CEO Zac Prince back to the stand to open testimony on Friday, followed by two other witnesses, one of whom would be a law enforcement official. BlockFi is a crypto lender that ran into trouble during the crypto bear market last year, and (briefly) got a bailout from Bankman-Fried.  Friday’s session is expected to end early, around 1 p.m. ET. Depending on the timing and how long Prince and the second witness take, we may not hear from the law enforcement official until Monday.  Prince’s early testimony hints at what he’ll likely be asked to speak to – how FTX’s conduct and collapse ended his own company’s ambitions.  “As a result of FTX and Alameda's bankruptcy, because of our lending to Alameda but also some exposure we had to the FTX platform, BlockFi was forced into – into bankruptcy,” Prince said at the end of the day Thursday.  Prosecutors may also look to illustrate the differences between how BlockFi used customer funds and how FTX (allegedly) did. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos asked Prince on Thursday if BlockFi’s customers knew that their crypto holdings were being loaned out.  “Absolutely,” replied Prince. “This is something that we were very clear about. Everyone knew us as a crypto lending platform.”  — Nikhilesh De",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,"Nikhilesh De, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/13/things-sbfs-defense-lawyers-should-be-freaking-out-about,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This sets the stage for two potential outcomes in the ongoing fourth cycle, with the $135,000 prediction aligning with both CryptoCon’s November 28th price model and his Trend Pattern price model. Conversely, the $89,000 figure is aligning with the 5.3 diminishing returns theory. Historical data further adds depth to this analysis. Bitcoin’s inaugural cycle, spanning 2010-2014, saw it catapult from a minuscule value to a peak of $1,177. The subsequent 2015-2018 cycle commenced at $250, witnessing an unprecedented climb to $20,000 by its close. The journey from 2018-2022 manifested Bitcoin’s resilience as it surged from sub-$6,000 levels to a commendable $68,800. Related Reading: Bitcoin Doom Signal Warns Of 50% Crypto Collapse Delving into the intricacies of the Gann Square’s “Fan” Lines offers more clarity. The “2×1 Fan” line, represented in blue, plots a trend angle where the price progression is double that of time. Traditionally, when the Bitcoin price is close to this line, it indicates a “fair value”. In its 13-year history, Bitcoin has only extremely rarely fallen below the line, most recently in late 2022 following the collapse of FTX, then the second largest crypto exchange, and during the Covid crash in March 2020. The “1×1 Fan” line, depicted in green, portrays a market in equilibrium with prices increasing in tandem with time. Historically, Bitcoin’s price peaked near this line during the parabolic run-up in the second and third cycles, providing the theoretical basis for the $135,000 prediction. The Diminishing Returns Theory: Only Sub-$90,000? In a subsequent post, CryptoCon further explained the $89,600 target. He stated that “$90k is slightly above the 5.3 diminishing returns theory.” According to the theory, Bitcoin’s returns diminish by a factor of 5.3x from the bottom to the top of each cycle, suggesting the next cycle’s peak might be around $77,000. CryptoCon remarked, “After measuring returns from cycle bottoms to tops on the daily time frame as precisely as possible, the returns from cycle tops to bottoms are not 5.3. They are as follows: 5.34x, 4.96x, and 5.63x.” Diving deeper, CryptoCon pointed out, “There is merit to the 5.3, as the average of these numbers is 5.31. However, we cannot say for sure that this will be the returns if this is just an average.” Highlighting the potential peaks based on past cycles, he commented on the more grounded numbers. “The real numbers so far range from the lowest cycle top of $73,522 to the highest at $81,675 with an average cycle top of $77,122.” Related Reading: Legendary Investor Declares Now Is The Time To Buy Bitcoin: Here’s Why Discussing the possibilities of Bitcoin hitting a much-anticipated $100,000 mark, CryptoCon explained, “$100,000 would mean a 3.84x diminish, implying Bitcoin would need to exhibit a drastically lower diminishing return rate this cycle.” Drawing attention to Bitcoin’s historical relationship with Fibonacci extensions, he stated, “Bitcoin has consistently hit a Fibonacci extension level at each cycle top. If $77,000 is the anticipated target, this would be a deviation. The cycles have previously matched Fibonacci extensions of 58.764, 19.764, and 3.618. For this cycle, the lowest Fibonacci extension measured from weekly candle bodies is the 1.618, suggesting a price of $104,000 which corresponds to a 3.7x diminish from the last cycle.” CryptoCon concluded by inviting speculations on whether external factors, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, could provide the necessary momentum to shift these models. “Many believe that ETFs will have the strength to disrupt these models and predictions. Returns are evidently diminishing, but is the 5.31x ($77,122) average return going to be this cycle’s peak?” At press time, BTC traded at $26,906.

42392317,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4x4P,1697182144,"Bitcoin Spot ETFs Approval Partially Priced In, Coinbase Says","Approval of the highly-anticipated spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is partially priced in, Coinbase Institutional's David Duong Argues.  The expected deluge of money into the spot-based ETFs will likely happen overtime.  In financial markets, a particular asset often stands out on the back of unconfirmed good news, while the broader market suffers due to adverse macroeconomic developments.  That's precisely what has happened in the crypto market in recent months. Bitcoin (BTC) has outperformed other cryptocurrencies amid macroeconomic uncertainty, partially due to traders pricing a potential approval of spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Coinbase Institutional.  ""We think the divergence in the performance of bitcoin and other tokens shows that the potential approval of one or more spot bitcoin ETPs has already been partially priced in. That makes it less clear how much more bitcoin could outperform if a favorable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision occurs,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase Institutional, said in the latest monthly report sent to subscribers on Thursday.  Since BlackRock (BLK) and other traditional finance heavyweights filed for spot-based BTC ETFs in mid-June, bitcoin has gained 8%. At the same time, ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value and leader for alternative cryptocurrencies, has lost 7.5%, CoinDesk data show.  Bitcoin, a macro asset, outperformed the wider crypto market despite untoward developments in the term structure of the U.S. Treasury yield curve since mid-June, a sign other factors, including ETF expectations, have been at play in the BTC market.  The cryptocurrency rose even as the spread between yields on the 10-year and three-month notes ((3m10y slope) has increased (re-steepened) by nearly 70 basis points to -0.8% since mid-June as opposed to ether, which declined, retaining the inverse relationship with the Treasury yield curve's term structure.  ""Crypto prices have had an inverse relationship with changes in the term structure of the U.S. Treasury yield curve since mid-1Q23. But the strength of that relationship is very different for BTC (vs. the U.S. 3m10y slope) compared to ETH (vs the U.S. 3m10y slope),"" Duong said.  The 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the aforementioned yield spread is 0.45, ""a relatively weak linear relationship between bitcoin and the recent steepening in the yield curve,"" according to Duong. Meanwhile, ether shows a strong inverse relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0.76.  ""This deviation started to emerge in mid-June, around the time of multiple spot bitcoin exchange-traded product ETP filings in the U.S.,"" Duong said.  The crypto market has waited for a spot-based bitcoin ETF for years in hopes that it would open floodgates for mainstream money. According to NYDIG, bitcoin spot-based ETFs could bring $30 billion in new demand for the world’s largest digital asset.  BTC outlook  Going by Coinbase's analysis, bitcoin may lose its edge over the broader market for some time once the spot-based ETF is approved. We have seen this happen following the launch of the futures-based ETFs in October 2021.  ""That [pricing of spot ETF) makes it less clear how much more bitcoin could outperform if a favorable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC decision occurs. That is, in the event of one or more approvals, we believe there could be meaningful net inflows, but these may take time to materialize while markets tend to be impatient,"" Duong said.  That was the case with the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), the first spot gold ETF in the U.S., which debuted 19 years ago and currently has over $50 billion in assets. Bitcoin propounders consider the cryptocurrency as digital gold.  Per Duong, GLD drew just $1.9 billion in inflation-adjusted terms in the first 30 days from the launch, with the tally rising to $4.8 billion by the end of the first 12 months.  Duong, however, maintained that the impact of the potential launch of spot-based ETFs would go beyond flows, signaling a ""tacit shift"" in the regulatory environment, which could bode well for market valuations.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/13/bitcoin-spot-etfs-approval-partially-priced-in-coinbase-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8d7972553621ce157e9c1b4d45809c493295e66-998x561.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Major tokens, such as XRP, Solana's SOL, BNB Chain's BNB have stabilized after being in the red.  Crypto markets seemed to stabilize in the past 24 hours following a nearly week-long drop as ongoing geopolitical conflicts seemed to weigh down on prices of riskier assets.  Markets slumped since Monday as traders priced in rising oil prices and a drop in traditional equities as the turmoil could impact international trade, analysts told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin hovered just over the $26,8000 mark after losing 3% in the past week, with ether (ETH) traded over $1,500 after a 5% weekly hit. Other major tokens stabilized after seeing some losses: XRP and Solana’s SOL had dumped as much as 8%, while BNB Chain’s BNB and dogecoin (DOGE) had performed slightly better with a 3% loss.  Some analysts opined the current price action observed in bitcoin markets was not necessarily bullish or bearish, and pointed to an equilibrium among buyers and sellers instead.  “Bitcoin has recently been in a building phase, neither particularly bullish nor bearish,” said Andy Bromberg, CEO of Beam told CoinDesk in an email. “At the moment, there's a balance, with few newcomers entering into Bitcoin and equally few exiting,”  “This balance creates a relatively stable price. Significant movement is unlikely to happen until after some sort of catalyst, such as the halving or the introduction of spot ETFs,” Bromberg added.  Traders are eagerly awaiting the approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., expecting the offering to open the floodgates to broader institutional demand and an inflow of new money.  Meanwhile, part of Friday’s stability in the bitcoin-led market may have come from confidence in the long-term “quality” asset after an initial sell-off scare.  “After the exuberance of the last few years, we’ve seen a large flight to quality, both in terms of providers and assets,” said Dan O’Prey, Chief Product Officer of Bakkt in a note to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin, being the most decentralized and secure asset, has also benefited from flows from the riskier, long-tail coins.’  Bobby Zagotta, US CEO of Bitstamp said that bitcoin would “continue to be the most established, understood and trusted cryptocurrency available for the foreseeable future,” adding that the exchange’s active trading clients continued to grow on a week-on-week basis.",NEUTRAL,SOL | BNB,BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/13/bitcoin-is-currently-neither-bullish-or-bearish-traders-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72ae280e7f877c015503d0e65549a58cf333d430-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $26,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).

BTC traded below the $27,000 level to enter a bearish zone. Finally, the bulls appeared above the $26,500 support. The price remained well-bid near the $26,550 level. The bears made two attempts to push the price below $26,550, but they failed.

The stablecoin holder swapped 131,350 USDR for zero USDC, allowing an MEV bot to swoop in and claim $107,000 in profit. The USDR Depegging, Stablecoin Falls To $0.50 The stablecoin is issued by Tangible protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that claims to be tokenizing housing and other real-world assets. Due to the immutable nature of the Polygon network, the USDR holder is now at a loss. All on-chain transactions cannot be reversed unless there is a network rollback, which will unwind other transactions as a result should validators choose to do so. However, considering how public ledgers operate, it is improbable that a rollback will be done to recover funds. Related Reading: Buy LINK Now? Chainlink Touted As ‘Safest Bet’ For This Mega Trend There has yet to be any feedback from the MEV bot operator on whether they can refund the affected user. Since the error was on the swapper’s side and not the hack, the community’s response to this mistake remains largely muted. Real USD, USDR, is a stablecoin backed by a blend of other crypto assets and real estate. Considering the stablecoin’s construction, USDT is interest-bearing, meaning holders receive rewards. It was meant to track the USD but lost its peg on October 11 after a wave of redemptions drained the project’s treasury of its liquid assets, including DAI. By the close of October 11, USDR was trading versus the USD at around $0.53, a near 50% drop, triggering panic. Moments after the rapid withdrawal of DAI and liquid assets from its treasury, the team explained that USDR fell to as low as $0.50 before recovering. Tangible Finance Working On A Recovery Plan Despite the depegging, the USDR issuer said it is working on making holders whole, saying the crisis is mainly “liquidity related.” It also attempted to assuage holders, assuring that “the real estate and digital assets backing USDR still exist and will be used to support redemptions.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Doom Signal Warns Of 50% Crypto Collapse Updating the community on X, the issuer said it is not “going anywhere” and is working on a “plan”: Tangible isn’t going anywhere. We have a flywheel that works and plans to continue building within that. A critical part of our shared future success is maintaining the trust we’ve established with our users over the past year, which we hope to maintain through the plan below. Beyond the panic selling and one holder losing over $100,000 to an MEV bot, the extent of the USDR depeg has not been fully quantified. As of October 12, Polyscan data shows over 2,400 USDR holders. In total, they cumulatively control slightly over 45.5 million of the stablecoin.

The CFTC filed a complaint in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging fraud and registration failures related to the operation of the Voyager digital asset platform and an unregistered commodity pool. Voyager Faces Legal Action For ‘Misleading Customers’ According to the CFTC, Ehrlich falsely marketed the Voyager platform as a safe haven for high-yield returns, deceiving customers to purchase and store digital assets. Per the filing, Voyager allegedly took “reckless risks” with customers’ assets, leading to Voyager’s bankruptcy and significant customer losses. The lawsuit seeks various penalties, including restitution, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Get A Boost, Dip In This Bitcoin Metric Suggests New Rally In a separate but related action, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has charged Voyager and Stephen Ehrlich with violating the FTC Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The FTC alleges that the company falsely claimed customers’ accounts were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and misled consumers about the safety of their deposits. The FTC’s complaint states that Voyager enticed customers to deposit funds by assuring them of the safety of their assets on the platform. However, Voyager was neither a bank nor a financial institution, and the deposits were not eligible for FDIC insurance. The FTC alleges that consumers suffered significant losses when Voyager experienced financial difficulties, including being locked out of their accounts and losing over $1 billion in cryptocurrency assets. Stephen Ehrlich Rejects Settlement Voyager and its affiliates will be permanently banned from handling consumers’ assets and offering related services as part of a proposed settlement. The companies have also agreed to a judgment of $1.65 billion, which will be suspended to allow Voyager to return the remaining assets to consumers during the bankruptcy proceedings. Stephen Ehrlich, however, has not agreed to a settlement, and the FTC’s case against him will proceed in federal court. The FTC’s complaint further alleges that Ehrlich transferred millions of dollars to his wife, Francine Ehrlich, including funds linked to the alleged unlawful conduct. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunge Below $27,000 Drives Investors Into Fear, Will Rebound Occur? The proposed settlement also prohibits Voyager and its affiliates from misrepresenting product benefits, making false representations to obtain financial information, and disclosing consumer information without consent.

18731157,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555207,1697155212,"Analyst Expects The Worst For Bitcoin: Will Bears Force Prices To $17,000?","Taking to X on October 12, Zoran Kole, a trader, said reasonable bids for Bitcoin stand at around $17,000 and $18,000. Though Kole didn’t provide timelines for retraining these levels, the prediction means the coin could slide 35% to around December 2022 territory if the prediction comes true. Will BTC Drop To December 2022 Levels? The position the trader takes appears contrarian and opposes every optimistic preview laid out by bulls. Bitcoin finds itself in a precarious position and is primarily bearish at spot rates. Looking at the daily chart, the coin is down approximately 17% from July peaks and trickling lower at spot rates. As it is, there could be more drawdown, considering that the coin has been performing in the past few hours. To illustrate, Bitcoin breached the $27,000 support on October 11 and is edging lower at spot rates, confirming the losses from early this week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Rejection At This Historical Line, Bear Market Back On? From a top-down preview, it also appears that BTC bulls are under pressure and have failed to unwind losses of August 17. The flash crash in mid-August saw the coin breach critical support–now resistance around $28,300. Bitcoin has since failed to break out above this level. There was an attempt on October 2, but bears flew in, reversing all gains. Bitcoin is within the August 17 and 18 trade range while trading volume, or participation, remains relatively suppressed. From volume analysis, this is bearish. However, how fast the coin can recover or break even lower depends on how prices react at immediate support at around $25,000 registered in mid-September. Bulls Expect Bitcoin Halving And ETFs To Drive Prices The odds of Bitcoin dropping to the $17,000 and $18,000 zone, subsequently confirming Kole’s prediction, will be elevated if sellers press on, breaching $25,000. Bulls remain confident, citing fundamental factors mostly revolving around 2024’s Bitcoin halving event, where the network will slash miner rewards by half from 6.25 BTC. At the same time, supporters expect the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the country’s first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).
