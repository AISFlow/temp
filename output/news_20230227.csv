The platform will also implement “Auto-Learning Avatars,” which collect users’ information to provide a personalized metaverse experience.

42414306,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB474T,1677535779,Crypto Con Artists Leave Trail of ‘Rip Deal’ Victims From Amsterdam to Rome,"The nascent and barely regulated crypto industry is rife with exploits, hacks and digital pump-and-dump schemes – some of them netting upwards of hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of seconds, from a computer somewhere, the identity of the perpetrator typically obscured behind a fake online identity.  So it would seem almost quaint or pulled straight from a Hollywood script that a crew of smooth-acting fraudsters would spend weeks or months courting blockchain-project executives, unspooling a fanciful and elaborate investment narrative, then follow through with in-person, face-to-face meetings at a restaurant – only to ultimately abscond with cryptocurrencies in the single-digit-millions of dollars and never be seen or heard from again.  And yet, based on interviews with victims and authorities, this exact scenario has played out multiple times in recent months in cities across Europe, including Rome, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Brussels.  It’s the crypto long con.  Cases have been referred to authorities in Austria and Italy, according to victims and a German police officer who has interacted with some of the victims.  According to the officer, who asked not to be named given the ongoing nature of the investigation, police are categorizing this wave of crypto scams as “rip deals” – tempting-sounding offers where victims are promised large amounts of money but ultimately end up with their own pockets emptied.  Victims’ accounts of their interactions with what appear to be rip-deal gangs are uncannily similar: Scammers posing as investment agents meet their victims face-to-face at a restaurant or hotel lobby, and ask for proof of funds. The victims set up a crypto wallet that seems legitimate – but chosen by the scammers – and then fund the wallet. Once the funds are sent over, the scammers are somehow able to drain the wallets. The top working theories are that they get the victim’s private keys or exploit security flaws in the wallet.  The most prominent, and public, victim to date is Webaverse co-founder Ahad Shams. Earlier this month he shared a statement over Twitter that he had been a victim of a $4 million crypto hack after meeting in a hotel lobby in Rome with scammers posing as investors.  Recently, another victim, Chris Hunter, the CEO of Coin Publishers, a firm that focuses on publications and data for crypto saving and borrowing products, shared his account of a similar scam setup he experienced in Barcelona, Spain.  According to several people who said they fell victim to the scams, authorities are actively investigating whether the incidents are connected.  Rip-deal gangs  The German police officer told CoinDesk they’re unaware of any ongoing investigations in Germany on this scam, but confirmed that Shams’ case had been relayed to a special investigator in Austria who specializes in rip-deal gangs.  In November, Austrian authorities convicted an Austrian national with Serbian roots who was arrested in Rome and extradited back to Vienna after the scammer allegedly performed a rip-deal con on four victims and stole their crypto. The details alleged in the case were similar to those in Shams and Hunter's stories.  The difficulty with catching these gang members is they operate across different jurisdictions, making it hard to trace their movements.  “What we are missing on the national or European level is a kind of database” that has pan-European information on these gangs, the German police officer told CoinDesk.  Although the German officer was unaware of any ongoing investigations related to Shams’ case in Germany, another person told CoinDesk the German authorities reached out to another crypto rip-deal victim in 2021 about their active investigation after the victim was scammed in Amsterdam.  Other rip-deal victims told CoinDesk that Italian authorities are investigating similar scams that have taken place in Rome.  Who are the victims?  The scams that have taken place are like a scene out of untold Hollywood noir or neo-noir features – ""The Sting,"" ""The Spanish Prisoner,"" ""The Grifters,"" ""Snatch.""  None of the victims are sure how the scammers were able to steal their funds from their wallets without having any kind of interactions on their devices; some suspect there might be hidden cameras in the restaurant, or maybe hypnosis was involved.  Some of the victims have gathered in a Telegram group where they can share information about the perpetrators to see if there is any overlap, according to an article by The Register.  Since the release of The Register’s article, multiple people told CoinDesk they suspect that some scammers posing as victims have tried to infiltrate the victims’ Telegram group to collect information on what they know and which authorities they’ve spoken to, causing more distrust among members who already have lost a lot of trust – in each other, business, law enforcement, the crypto industry and maybe humanity more broadly writ.  Other victims or almost-victims that CoinDesk spoke with, who asked not to be attributed to avoid embarrassment or further victimization, described having experiences similar to those Shams and Hunter detailed in their public statements. The victims showed up to a specific restaurant the scammers picked in Rome, and the scammers would insist on being seated at a specific table if they were put elsewhere.  One detail that pervades most of the victims’ accounts is that the bogus investors said they worked for or with a “Joseph Safra.”  The German police officer told CoinDesk that he was willing to speak to a reporter partly to warn other crypto companies to be on the lookout for similar scams.  As if the ranks of online degen exploiters trolling digital-asset markets for victims weren’t already terrifying enough.

Meanwhile, each action on a Web3 game, non-fungible token (NFT) platform or decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocol requires signing a confusing and occasionally alarming set of transaction information, often coupled with a gas fee regardless of whether the transaction is successful.  With all these minor inconveniences stacked atop one another, it’s no wonder the industry has such a hard time gaining more users.  Read more: Are Dapps the Future of the Creator Economy?  Building a better Web3 UX  What’s less understood is why it is so hard to create an intuitive, streamlined dapp UX.  By comparison, signing up for and using centralized exchanges is amazingly simple. Although there are a few steps required to create an account, exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken don’t require users to have any technical ability.  That ease of use suggests that overcoming impediments to a good user experience in Web3 isn't as simple as assigning a talented designer. Instead, it requires both a technical and regulatory approach  The technical challenge in designing Web3 UX is how to do so without executing transactions on behalf of the user, which would require access to the user’s private key and thus compromise the security of his or her funds.  Approaches to this problem include multi-party computation, wherein a private key is split across multiple entities and devices instead of requiring a single user to write it down and keep it safe. Other approaches have been suggested by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who emphasized the importance of account abstraction at the blockchain level as a solution so that a dapp could pay for a user’s gas fee, thereby creating a smoother user experience. These are promising approaches, each of which helps prevent the possibility of a dapp using funds without the user’s permission. Many developers are familiar with this security problem because it is inherently technical.  Regulatory issues are less understood  But developers are typically less aware of regulatory considerations that also need to be designed around, particularly when it comes to what the dapp’s code is and isn’t programmed to do. For example, dapps may have regulatory issues if the code could have been written to stop a user from performing a problematic transaction, but the developers failed to do so. In other words, if a user needs the dapp in order to sign a transaction, it can be argued that the dapp can unilaterally block a transaction from happening. As a result, there may still be regulatory issues to contend with even if the security of the dapp isn't at issue.  In another case, what if the transaction interacts with an address that has been blacklisted by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and the dapp could have but didn’t prevent it? Alternatively, will the Commodity Futures Trading Commission think it is the dapp’s responsibility to prevent a retail user from purchasing a derivative? What if the transaction manipulates the market? What will the Financial Action Task Force, a global group that fights money laundering, think? Perhaps it will label the dapp as a financial intermediary and attempt to impose a know-your-customer/anti-money-laundering (KYC/AML) requirement on the dapp.  Read more: FATF Agrees on Action Plan to Drive Implementation of Global Crypto Norms  Moreover, dapp developers need to consider not just the regulations of today, but also those that might come tomorrow. Governments may decide that a protocol’s veto rights incur direct responsibility and pass legislation accordingly. A KYC obligation would add new user frictions into the dapp onboarding experience and might require the dapp to hire a small army of compliance professionals.  Web3 dapps must be prepared for regulatory scrutiny  All of which is to say, dapp developers need to be aware of the full regulatory landscape if they want to design robust product that will facilitate a better user experience without compromising many of the benefits and principles of self-custody in the first place.  If Web3 builders want to build something genuinely useful for the masses, it isn’t as easy as simply creating a non-custodial protocol and pretending that the laws applied to financial custodians and intermediaries don’t matter – how the protocol grants or blocks permissions on how user funds are used must also be considered. This means the only way for designers to know what new UX features are available to them, and what design decisions won’t potentially get their project blacklisted, is to understand the regulations that apply to centralized financial custodians and intermediaries, and what regulations might apply to emergent Web3 protocols in the future.  Every user experience is designed to increase the likelihood that a user will arrive at a specific decision or outcome. The builders who anticipate future policy hurdles and consider today’s imperfect crypto regulations as they write their design playbook will ultimately design thoughtful, seamless Web3 user experiences that will make it easier for the next 100 million users to get on board.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Mark Lurie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/27/in-creating-better-web3-experiences-developers-must-anticipate-regulatory-scrutiny,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ce1c644d94851288dacaddc2dabab8b9cc70a9d-5323x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393857,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQycj,1677534198,Crypto Markets Analysis: Stablecoins Trend Lower Despite Bitcoin’s Recent Performance,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) momentum this year has yet to ignite larger-scale investment in other crypto assets such as stablecoins.  Despite BTC’s 43% rise in 2023 and the 38% gain of ether (ETH), a significant amount of capital remains inactive, major stablecoin indicators suggest.  Most notably, the stablecoin supply, which serves as a key mechanism by which many crypto assets are purchased, has been declining. When the stablecoin supply increases, it implies there is more capital to purchase crypto assets. When the supply of stablecoins falls, it implies the opposite.  The aggregate supply net position change of the top four stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI) has been negative since Sept. 14, and has been trending lower since Feb 7.  For historical context, the aggregate supply net position change for stablecoins was positive between February and March in 2022, reflecting strong demand for digital assets during that time period.  Meanwhile, the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR), another key stablecoin indicator that measures the ratio of bitcoin’s market cap to the market cap of stablecoins, has been increasing, indicating that the buying power of stablecoins has decreased relative to BTC.  The current SSR may indicate an underlying decrease in demand for BTC exists. But a more optimistic interpretation is that capital is sitting on the sidelines to be deployed in some capacity in the near future. While BTC has traded in negative territory in five of the most recent seven days, volume was relatively in line with its 20-day average.  In some cases, BTC trading volume fell below its 20-day average. The same holds true for ETH, which has traded lower recently, but on average to below-average volume. At the moment, BTC and ETH appear to be establishing new levels of support near $23,000 and $1,640, respectively.  The longer that BTC and ETH trade near these ranges, the more confidence investors are likely to have in those levels. The supply of stablecoins may be an important signal to watch and not just an indication of negative sentiment. A shift from where supply currently stands to where it stood between 2020-2022 could indicate a move higher.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | DAI,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | DAI,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/27/crypto-markets-analysis-stablecoins-trend-lower-despite-bitcoins-recent-performance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35c4631169a9bccdb9588f31d15ad1e91288239d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414314,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB47kv,1677530499,Crypto Crime Hit All-Time High of $20.6B in 2022: Chainalysis,"Crypto crime accounted for a record-setting $20.6 billion worth of blockchain transactions in 2022, according to a new report from blockchain research firm Chainalysis.  While other forms of illicit activity may have trended down, “there were two categories that really stood out in terms of their growth, and that’s sanctioned activity and hacking,” Kim Grauer, head of research at the firm, said Monday on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  According to the Chainalysis report, criminal activity accounted for 0.24% of all blockchain transactions last year – an increase from the year before of 0.12%. However, crypto crime is “a small share of total volume at less than 1%,” the report found.  Grauer said that after the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) began to crack down on crypto platforms in 2021 rather than singling out crypto addresses of specific bad actors, all transactions done by the platforms that were said to facilitate crimes were counted. With this new categorization, Chainalysis found a majority of the sanctioned activity in 2022 came from funds “flowing to Garantex or other services like that after the designations occurred.”  Garantex is a Russian-based crypto exchange that continues to operate. The exchange had $1.3 billion in inflows through October, following its sanctioning in April, the report found.  When OFAC tried to limit illicit activity on other crypto-based platforms, such Hydra’s darknet market and decentralized mixing service Tornado Cash, the agency’s efforts varied, Grauer said. Its success often depends on the type of entity OFAC is sanctioning and whether users in that jurisdiction care about the sanctions imposed on the platform.  Chainalysis found a significant increase in the amount of funds hacked by North Korean organizations during 2022. North Korean-based cyber criminals hacked $1.6 billion worth of funds, beating their own record from the previous year, Grauer said.  She said it is likely bad actors exploited vulnerabilities of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. In 2022, $3.8 billion worth of crypto was stolen from DeFi protocols, an increase from $3.3 billion stolen the year prior.  “We can’t continue to have this rate of hacking,” Grauer said, “because it just really undermines trust in the ecosystem.”  Read more: Sanctioned Mixer Blender Re-Launched as Sinbad, Elliptic Says",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/27/crypto-crime-hit-all-time-high-of-206b-in-2022-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b1f5a84c2f9cb1768d562f6ad2e48d0caee80b3-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414311,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB47V0,1677528994,"Coinbase Trade Volume Surpasses Uniswap’s, Countering Expectations for a DEX Surge","Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s trading volume has surpassed the popular decentralized exchange platform Uniswap’s this year, according to a report from crypto data firm Kaiko.  As of Tuesday, trading volumes for Coinbase had reached about $93 billion, nearly double the $57 billion on Uniswap, Kaiko said. At one point in 2022, the exchanges’ respective volumes were nearly equal.  Following last year’s collapse of the FTX exchange and other centralized entities in the crypto ecosystem, market watchers anticipated seeing more traders pivot to decentralized exchanges (DEX), and at one point in 2022 that shift seemed to be occurring. But DEXs have presented challenges for users.  Data from analytics platform DefiLlama showed that November trading volumes on decentralized platforms surged to $113 billion, their highest monthly level since May, but they now seem unlikely to surpass $100 million this month, based on daily volumes.  Conor Ryder, research analyst at Kaiko, said the calls for a transition to DEXs look “a bit premature” as centralized exchanges (CEX) still serve a critical role in onboarding the average investor.  “Presumably the average investor has still put off by the worse user experience on some of these DEXs, compared to the more straightforward experience on CEXs,” Ryder told CoinDesk in a direct message on Twitter. “I think CEXs will always be an essential part of the exchange landscape, whether we like it or not.”  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, said the initial spike in demand for noncustodial trading and decentralized finance (DeFi) at large after the meltdown of FTX has “waned out.” Outumuro highlighted that the daily number of new Ethereum addresses along with trading volume remained small on DeFi exchanges.  According to data from IntoTheBlock, the daily number of newly created Ethereum addresses reached some 228,000 on Nov. 24, their highest level since May 2021, but has retreated to less than 90,000 daily.  “Getting onboard into Coinbase is much more similar to what people are used to with other tech or finance platforms, whereas getting into Uniswap is a completely different flow,” Outumuro told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “This makes adoption take a little longer as new users may feel intimidated.”  JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note in November that slower transaction speeds, pooling of assets and order-traceability features are likely to limit institutional participation. The analysts noted the absence of a limit order/stop loss feature on DEXs, their dependency on price oracles that source data from centralized exchanges, vulnerability to hacks, exploits, the need for over-collateralization and systemic risks from the cascade of automated liquidations as hindrances to widespread adoption.  ""While there has been some increase in the share of DEX in overall crypto trading activity in recent weeks, this is more likely to reflect the collapse in crypto prices and the deleveraging/automatic liquidations that followed the FTX collapse,"" the authors wrote.

Before joining Arca he spent a decade at Big Four accounting firm KPMG on the mergers and acquisitions team, including a stint as a decentralized finance (DeFi) analyst.  Bassiri's exit comes several months after the Arca Digital Yield Fund – which he co-managed with Arca Chief Investment Offiucer Jeff Dorman – was shuttered. The Digital Yield Fund opened for business in the summer of 2021 but exposure to Terra's UST stablecoin and the fallout from that collapse led to the fund's closing in August.

The token initially gained as much as 1.5% to $23.86K following mixed durable goods data in the morning, only to swing back to negative territory, down 1.9% to $23.19K, as of 3:11 p.m. ET. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) also dipped 1.6% to $1.61K. Core durable goods orders rose 0.7% in January from a month earlier, more than economists had forecasted and up from the downwardly revised -0.4% reading in December. The topline number, though, slid 4.5%, surprising to the upside, from the revised +5.1% December print. Stock-market investors cheered the headline print after suffering the worst weekly loss so far in 2023. Pending home sales, meantime, unexpectedly surged M/M in January thanks to a retreat in mortgage rates at the time. Like equities, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) changed hands on the heels of a nearly 7% loss for the week ended Feb. 24, as market participants steered clear of riskier assets in the midst of hotter-than-expected inflation data. Over the last day, the global crypto market cap slipped 1.1% to $1.07T at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data . And with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) struggling for direction, most crypto-exposed stocks, such as Silvergate Capital ( SI ) -2.7% , Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) -1.2% and Coinbase Global ( COIN ) +0.9% , traded mixed with markedly less volatile price action than usual.

DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.  From a consolidated balance sheet perspective, DCG held total assets of $5.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022, the report said. This included cash and cash equivalents of just $262 million. Investment assets, including tokens, Grayscale trust shares, venture and fund investments amounted to $670 million. The remaining assets consist mostly of assets held by divisions Grayscale and Foundry, according to DCG.  A DCG spokeswoman said all the investment assets and the value of the venture portfolio have been marked to market.  DCG’s Q4 revenues were $143 million, with losses of $24 million. Consolidated revenues for the full year were $719 million.  In its annual independent stock valuation, DCG had an equity valuation of $2.2 billion, or a price per share of $27.93. “This appraisal is generally consistent with the sector’s 75%-85% decline in equity values over the same period,” the report said.  Despite the challenges of last year, DCG said it had “hit a milestone” regarding the restructuring of Genesis, pointing to a nonbinding term sheet agreement involving some of the main creditors.  The agreement involves extending the maturity of DCG’s May 2023 obligations to Genesis Capital of approximately $600 million (at current market prices) to June 2024. Also included is the restructuring DCG’s infamous $1.1 billion promissory note, due in 2032, in exchange for the issuance to Genesis Capital creditors of a new class of DCG redeemable, convertible preferred stock.

42421348,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsfF,1677528312,Gary Gensler’s Take on Crypto Doesn’t Matter,"Securities law has been a main conversation topic for the crypto intelligentsia and unintelligentsia since New York magazine published an interview with Gary Gensler, where Intelligencer author Ankush Khardori drilled the top U.S. securities regulator late last week about his meeting with Sam Bankman-Fried.  There are many threads to pull here, including an important philosophical point about securities law.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In the interview, Gensler suggested that all cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin are securities. The direct quote was: “Everything other than bitcoin, you can find a website, you can find a group of entrepreneurs, they might set up their legal entities in a tax haven offshore, they might have a foundation, they might lawyer it up to try to arbitrage and make it hard jurisdictionally or so forth.”  As many crypto lawyers have said, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler does not determine the law or how it is applied. That’s the job of the courts. His input obviously matters, but his word is not law (here is a good Twitter thread from attorney Logan Bolinger on this point).  No one should be surprised by Gensler's statements. In fact, he has already said that he views bitcoin as a commodity and all other cryptocurrencies as probably securities. If direct quotes from CNBC interviews aren’t enough for you, then consider cryptocurrency exchange Kraken’s recent SEC settlement and shuttering of staking services for U.S. clients as additional proof.  Nevertheless, Gensler’s reiteration of “bitcoin is a commodity; cryptocurrencies are securities” has been cause for celebration in the corner of the internet where a certain breed of Bitcoin maximalist lives. (I should know, I spend a lot of time there.) These self-described toxic maximalists celebrate bitcoin’s special status as a nonsecurity and other cryptocurrencies' unspecial status as securities.  Never mind how odd it might seem that bitcoiners are celebrating regulation, it’s more useful to think about whether regulation even matters. I’ve written before that “... it doesn’t matter whether bitcoin, ether, SOL, dogecoin or AVAX are deemed securities,” and I still believe that. What actually matters is the SEC’s mandate to enforce laws against market manipulation to protect investors is a valiant purpose, and contending that market manipulation only matters in the context of securities is exactly wrong.  Who cares if bitcoin is a commodity, security or a pet rock?  The answer is: A lot of people. But the right answer is: No one should.  Bitcoin market manipulation should be stomped out too, it’s not just a nonbitcoin crypto problem. It’s not like commodities are immune from market manipulation or anything like that (just ask gold and silver). Practically, from the perspective of a lawyer, trader or entrepreneur, it might matter if Gensler stands up and contends that some asset is a security.  But the broader point is that nothing would change about what that asset fundamentally is whether he calls it a security or not. It would just mean that a different U.S. regulatory body might have some jurisdictional claim over that asset.  We shouldn’t ask: “Is XYZ a security?” We should instead ask: “How much does securities law and regulation matter if XYZ is borderless, decentralized and censorship resistant?”",NEUTRAL,AVAX,AVAX | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/27/gary-genslers-take-on-crypto-doesnt-matter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f7383c4bc682e5cc3d4b5e2f7d40094639baffc-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414321,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4J3N,1677527555,Axelar Introduces Virtual Machine for Developers Building Cross-Chain Crypto Apps,"Axelar, the blockchain network that helps developers build cross-chain crypto apps, is expanding its product suite with the introduction of Axelar Virtual Machine (VM) – a generalized environment for building interconnected blockchains.  “Axelar Virtual Machine will allow developers to build their dApps (decentralized apps) once – whether on EVM, Cairo VM, Cosmos or another ecosystem – and run them on all chains,” Axelar said in a statement.  Most blockchains today are walled gardens; apps built on one chain typically lack access to data or services on another. Different blockchains can use different programming languages, and operating across chains generally means using headache-inducing infrastructure like bridges and oracles.  Axelar describes itself as “Stripe for Web3” – just as Stripe provides a one-stop-shop for Web2 developers to bake virtually any banking institution into their apps, Axelar aims to help Web3 developers integrate seamlessly across different chains.  Axelar’s main product offering is a network that was purpose-built to communicate with a growing set of different blockchains. The Axelar network and its accompanying application programming interface (API) help developers build crypto apps that work with assets on all of these chains.  But building cross-chain crypto apps remains complex – each time a developer deploys on a new chain they need to run through a lengthy set-up process and re-tool their code for chain-specific quirks. By Axelar CEO Sergey Gorbunov’s estimate, cross-chain developers spend “70% of their time” prepping their code to deploy on new chains “versus actually coding the application logic.”  “We kind of took a step back and said, ‘OK, how can we simplify all of these issues for the ecosystem?’” Gorbunov told CoinDesk. “This is where the idea of creating an excellent virtual machine – an interoperability layer – came about.”  The Axelar Virtual Machine  A virtual machine is like a software version of a physical computer – it is a place to build applications that read and write data in a shared space. (The Ethereum Virtual Machine, for instance, hosts programs – called smart contracts – that can alter the state of the Ethereum ledger.)  Axelar says its new VM will extend upon the protocol’s cross-chain mission by providing a framework for building blockchains that – like the Axelar network – can natively swap assets and messages between one another. Blockchains connected to Axelar’s new VM will be able to talk to one another, and app builders that develop VM-compatible apps will be able to deploy their software onto VM-compatible chains.  Taking the Stripe analogy a step further, Gorbunov describes the new Axelar VM as a Web3 version of Google’s Kubernetes – a popular toolkit that provides building blocks for developers to spin up and scale web apps.  “Kubernetes allows you to program how you want to deploy your application in the Web2 world. Like what are the regions where it needs to be deployed? What are the application servers? What are the databases behind it?” Gorbunov explained. “Similarly, using the [Axelar] virtual machine, we can let [Web3] developers specify their deployment configurations and then upload their code. And then with one transaction, that code will get pushed to all the chains interconnected through the Axelar protocol.”  Over the next six months as Axelar begins to roll out its VM, Gorbunov says his team will be “working with app developers and protocol developers to build templates” that will allow developers to roll out their apps with certain deployment conditions pre-configured.  Axelar’s most recent fundraising round valued the company at over $1 billion. According to Axelarscan, a tool that tracks Axelar network activity, the protocol is currently connected to 32 different chains – including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum – and has processed $86 million in asset transfers over the past 30 days.  UPDATE (Feb 28, 00:17 UTC): Changes language in the ninth paragraph to more accurately reflect that blockchains ""connect"" to the VM (Axelar's VM is not a toolkit for building brand new blockchains).",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ARB | AXL,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/27/axelar-introduces-virtual-machine-for-developers-building-cross-chain-crypto-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/734d45b6fdbcb3d5b3bbe88dd08b6532b0c1bfac-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411957,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhk4I,1677520392,How the Top 1% Covers Crypto,"Bitcoin’s returns in the past decade have attracted enormous interest and investment, especially since the pandemic crash in 2020. As the market was flooded with cash, questions about the value of the dollar together with the search for alternative sources of return attracted investors to bitcoin.  Source: CoinDesk Indices. Data from Bloomberg. All data is monthly ending 12/30/2022. XBX incepted Nov. 3, 2014.  The growth in the digital asset market expanded as investors looked to participate in the technological innovation of a lifetime. Today, the use cases and technology reach far beyond bitcoin, and by some measures, there are more than 10,000 digital assets from which to choose. So, understandably, knowing how to participate in the simple growth of the new economy has become more complex.  At CoinDesk Indices, we have applied the most well-known, reliable, and time-tested index concepts to digital assets to deliver a simple representation of the market so that investments can grow with it. The CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index (DLCS) chooses between five and ten of the largest, most liquid digital assets and market cap weights them to measure most of the crypto market in the simplest way possible. At present, just five assets—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Polygon and Solana—cover more than 60% of the digital asset market cap as measured by the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).  Since it is important to filter the top digital assets appropriately in what can seem like the wild west of an emerging market, the DLCS constituents are chosen according to its index methodology, which aims for investability by including digital assets with sufficient trading on eligible exchanges that are reliably safeguarded by certain custodians. The index is reconstituted quarterly, and only adds new assets from a watchlist that requires those assets to have passed all eligibility criteria for a full prior quarter prior to their inclusion. This reduces turnover and allows for more efficient operations.  Although the DLCS is currently highly concentrated, this is typical among market-weighted indices in nearly all asset classes. DLCS helps investors who are looking for a high-quality mix of digital assets beyond bitcoin get simple market exposure.  Exhibit 1: DLCS Weights and Constituents as of January 6, 2023:     Since its launch on April 4, 2022, the DLCS has lost 57.2% (data ending Jan. 20, 2022 ). This performance reflects the difficult environment of the time due to the combination of macroeconomic factors such as inflation and rising rates and the impacts of crypto-specific events such as Terra/Luna, Voyager, 3AC and FTX. Since the FTX’s collapse, DLCS has recovered 35.4%, and it is up 29.3% year-to-date in 2023 (data ending Jan. 20). Optimism on decelerating inflation and smaller rate hikes coupled with digital asset decentralization, interoperability and infrastructure is driving the rebound. The market will likely continue to capitulate in the short term and grow in the long term. DLCS will measure it all in real-time along the way.

According to the report, Binance transferred the collateral to hedge funds including Alameda Research and Cumberland/DRW and did so without informing its customers. According to blockchain data from Aug. 17 to early December examined by Forbes, a period that encompassed the collapse of fellow crypto exchange FTX, holders of more than $1 billion of crypto for B-peg USDC tokens had no collateral for instruments that Binance said would be fully backed by the token they were pegged to. B-peg USDC are digital replicas of dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC.  Binance's chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillman, told Forbes the movement of money among wallets was common practice and not a problem. ""There was no commingling,"" Hillman said, because ""there's wallets and there is a ledger.""  On Tuesday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted about the Forbes article, accusing the publication of ""intentionally misconstruing facts"" and referring to ""some old blockchain transactions that our clients have done."" Zhao said that Binance's users are free to withdraw their assets any time they wish and that users ""also must deposit to Binance first to be able to withdraw, which are also easily traceable on the blockchain.""  In a statement sent to CoinDesk on Monday, a Binance spokesperson said the exchange has ""never invested or otherwise deployed user assets without consent under the terms of specific products. Binance holds all of its clients’ assets in segregated accounts which are identified separately from any accounts used to hold assets belonging to Binance.""  The spokesperson also said that the transactions identified by Forbes relate to internal wallet management and did not affect the collateralization of user assets.  ""While Binance has previously acknowledged that wallet management processes for Binance-pegged token collateral have not always been flawless, at no time was the collateralization of user assets affected,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""Processes for managing our collateral wallets have been fixed on a longer-term basis and this is verifiable on-chain.""  Binance recently said it was moving to a semi-automated process for managing the reserves of tokens it issues after years in which reserves were mixed with customer funds and at least one major stablecoin, Binance-peg BUSD, was not always fully backed.

Some 73% of the voters rejected the plan.  MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that manages the lending platform Maker through proposals and votes. Maker issues the $5 billion stablecoin DAI, backing its value by collateralized digital assets from borrowers and, increasingly, by real-world assets (RWA) such as liabilities from traditional financial institutions such as banks.  Cogent Bank, a Florida-based, state-chartered bank with more than $1 billion in total assets, proposed borrowing up to $100 million in DAI stablecoin from Maker and would have used the funds to extend loans to its corporate and industrial clients, according to the MIP-95 proposal posted on Maker’s governance forum.  The rejection follows less than a year after Maker approved a similarly structured loan to Huntingdon Valley Bank in August, and represents a blowback to Maker’s aspiration to onboard more traditional players to its platform.  Before the vote concluded, MakerDAO voter London Business School Blockchain, noted concerns that unlike ""prior real-world asset deals, there is no way to quickly liquidate the loan portfolio should Maker wish to reduce its exposure to the underlying assets.” Still, London Business School Blockchain voted in favor of the proposal.

The Ordinals-driven rally, however, failed to impress derivatives traders.  Data from Coinglass shows the funding rates in the perpetual futures market tied to STX remained negative even as open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active perpetual futures contracts, doubled to $80 million.  In other words, new money entering the perpetual futures market amid the continued price rally is betting on a reversal. The negative funding rate – the cost of holding bullish long/bearish short positions in perpetuals – implies that leverage is skewed on the bearish side.  ""It could be a case of traders fading the hype of STX and shorting, largely due to the return of deeply negative after every price rally in the last week,"" Conor Ryder, research analyst at Paris-based Kaiko, told CoinDesk. ""I suspect traders are betting that there isn't a follow-up to Bitcoin NFTs and this is more of a flash in the pan.""  Stacks Network, focused on unleashing Bitcoin's potential as a programmable blockchain, has been the beneficiary of the non-fungible token (NFT) on Bitcoin fever kicked off by the launch of the Ordinals protocol on Jan. 21. Ordinals are NFT-like art references inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of bitcoin (BTC).  Per Ryder, the negative funding rates could also be due to STX being a relatively illiquid token.  ""As funding rates are the difference between spot and futures, when spot prices surge disproportionately more than derivatives, often due to illiquidity, this can cause funding to move deeply negative,"" Ryder said.

BitDAO, one of the world’s largest decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), saw its token jump from about 55 cents on Saturday to abut 60 cents on Sunday, a gain of roughly 5%, according to TradingView data. The rise pushed BIT ahead of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as one of the weekend’s best performers.  In the past 24 hours, the token has continued its uptrend, trading at $0.6120 at the time of publication — its highest price in a week.  BitDAO’s fund aims to pour money into more than 100 early-stage investment projects building on the Mantle Network over the next three years. The fund is part of a larger strategy to incentivize developers to build on the modulated layer 2 network and drive its wider adoption.  At $200 million, the fund is double the size of prolific decentralized exchange Polygon’s $100 million fund that was announced last spring and is larger than Injective’s decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption fund, launched in January.  BitDAO has performed well in recent weeks after taking a hit during the unraveling of centralized cryptocurrency exchange, FTX.

42414327,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4JJI,1677506400,Illinois Officials Pushing State Crypto Licensing to Emulate New York’s BitLicense,"Illinois is trying to follow in New York’s crypto footsteps with a new oversight regime, said David DeCarlo, Illinois’ first regulatory innovation officer, who is among the prominent advocates for the plan now being shepherded through the state legislature.  A coordinated pair of bills has been introduced in both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly that would establish a crypto license for the state as well as consumer protections that would include disclosures and the safeguarding of customer assets. The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR), where DeCarlo works, has helped craft the new measures that could put Illinois in league with New York and eventually California in setting up comprehensive state-level crypto regulations.  “It's happening too often where there's some scam or collapse that's hurting consumers directly in their pocketbooks,” DeCarlo said in a CoinDesk interview. The state needs ""safeguards in place soon so we can get in front of those,"" he said, plus a way to give the latest financial innovations some stable footing in Illinois.  The Illinois legislation would require crypto firms to seek licensing akin to New York’s BitLicense, and it would also establish trust companies that could handle custody of digital assets. Crypto exchanges and other virtual assets businesses would have to provide investment disclosures, protect customer assets, have defensive measures against hacks and shield themselves against use by money launderers.  The effort may not be welcome news for cryptocurrency businesses that have had run-ins with BitLicense oversight, which the CEO of New York-based bitcoin rewards app Lolli argued has made New York “one of the most crypto-hostile states in the nation.” Only a couple of dozen such licenses have been issued, and they’re famously difficult to obtain. Even New York City Mayor Eric Adams has bashed them.  “We definitely took some ideas of what was working in New York,” DeCarlo said, and he added that the IDFPR has also been in touch with California to make sure everybody is working toward a complementary framework “that would work across New York, Illinois and California.”  However, California’s most recent legislative effort last year for its own BitLicense was vetoed by the governor.  One potential boon for the Illinois version is that companies already licensed in a state with similar rules – so far, New York – would be allowed to do business in the state while awaiting their local license, DeCarlo said. Firms that are already operating in Illinois would also get some time to comply.  “Current holders of an Illinois money transmitter license will also have a transition period to come into compliance with the requirements of that statute,” a spokesman for the state’s financial regulator said in a statement.  The consumer side of the Illinois legislation, patterned after the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, gives the state regulators the power to enforce the crypto rules and also to pursue misdeeds committed by unlicensed firms.  “It’s not just a trial balloon that's being floated,” DeCarlo said, and lawmakers there seem to recognize an urgent need to do something. “I think there's momentum to be able to coalesce behind something that will protect the residents of Illinois.”  Two Democratic former chairs of their chambers’ financial institution committees, Sen. Laura Ellman and Rep. Mark Walker, introduced the matching bills. Walker said in a statement that the measures “not only work to hold bad actors accountable, but allow good actors to enter the marketplace and prove to customers they are operating within the bounds of the law.”  “The devil is going to be in the details with respect to how they establish the licensing regime,” said Nelson Rosario, founder of boutique law firm Rosario Tech Law who also teaches crypto legal issues at the Chicago-Kent College of Law. Basing the system on New York could make people wonder whether a license granted to only a handful of firms is stifling innovation, he suggested.  “Something like this may just be inevitable,” Rosario said, because the U.S. tide is turning toward crypto regulation in the wake of industry disasters over the past year.  In the absence of U.S. federal regulations for crypto, which still seem to be at least months away, the states have moved more quickly to fill the vacuum. Many of them – still including Illinois for now – are overseeing digital assets firms with money-transmitter regulations.  For Illinois to take the next step, the legislative campaign must get the bills through committees in both chambers by the session’s May conclusion. The assembly is dominated by Democrats, and any approved bills would head to the desk of Gov. J.B. Pritzker, also a Democrat.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/27/illinois-officials-pushing-state-crypto-licensing-to-emulate-new-yorks-bitlicense,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac91666ce6242609c05b5edf7cfa908bd7a4352d-3881x2183.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC fell below $23,000 on Saturday, its lowest point since Feb. 15. Short-bitcoin funds, which profit from a decline in the price of BTC, saw inflows last week while the price of bitcoin fell over 3% after it failed to consolidate above $25,000. ""We believe this reaction reflects nervousness amongst U.S. investors prompted by the recent stronger-than-expected macro data releases, but also highlights its sensitivity to the regulatory crackdown in the U.S.,"" CoinShares said in a weekly report.  Liquid staking is the new second-largest crypto sector, overtaking decentralized lending and borrowing. Liquid staking is now a $14.1 billion sector based on the total value of assets that have been locked on blockchain networks by users in return for rewards. Decentralized lending and borrowing protocols have $13.7 billion locked, while decentralized exchanges remain the largest sector with $19.4 billion. The upcoming Shanghai software upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain is seen as the catalyst for the rise of liquid staking because it will enable stakers to withdraw the ether they have staked and accumulated rewards on for the first time.  Texas regulators have said the benefits to creditors from Binance.US’ proposed acquisition of bankrupt lender Voyager Digital may be negligible. A court filing Friday said the benefits hinge on whether Alameda Research is successful in recovering $446 million transferred to Voyager prior to its own bankruptcy. The court document also detailed concerns over Binance’s staking program, which it said appears to constitute an illegal securities offering. Alameda Research is a trading firm affiliated with collapsed crypto exchange FTX. It was also owned by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's 30-day rolling correlation with Ethereum's native token ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value.  The correlation between the two has strengthened since mid-January, a sign of renewed focus on macroeconomic factors.

The interest rate hike by the Fed does not contribute to a significant increase in optimism about Bitcoin. This article will present the factors still exerting downward pressure on the price of coins and not allow talking about a complete change from a bearish trend to a bullish. On January 20, 2023, the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) broke through the bearish trend that had been observed for fourteen months and thus brought a touch of optimism to the crypto market. Bitcoin has been consolidating in the $21,500-$25,300 range since the end of January, indicating the first significant signs of market stabilization as the Fed continues to raise interest rates and increase geopolitical tensions around the world due to a Chinese balloon entering US space and increased hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. N_Aisenstadt - TradingView This article will present the factors still exerting downward pressure on the price of coins and not allow talking about a complete change from a bearish trend to a bullish one. On the other hand, more and more signs on the market indicate the beginning of a recovery in investment interest in cryptocurrencies after the devastating news about hacker attacks on crypto exchanges and even the bankruptcy of some of them in the second half of 2022. Increasing fees in the Bitcoin network One of the first factors that are beginning to point to the transition of the crypto industry from a bearish cycle to a bullish cycle is the increase in the average transaction fee in the Bitcoin network. The key reason for the rise in commissions is the increase in the number of transactions in the Bitcoin network, and as a result, competition for inclusion in blocks is intensifying. Consequently, crypto miners are starting to select transactions with higher fees to maximize their revenue for their services. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode After reaching a multi-year high in November 2021, the price of BTC was in a bearish trend until January 16, 2023. At the same time, fee revenue remained extremely low for only four months after the price of Bitcoin reached $65,000 per coin. After many market participants became disillusioned with cryptocurrencies and apathy reigned, relatively low prices attracted new traders and investors who took advantage of the situation. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode At the moment, we can see the fee momentum breaking above one, indicating an increase in block space demand. As a result, this not only leads to a recovery in miners’ profits but can also confirm the emergence of hope among crypto community members with the subsequent end of the crypto winter. The balance of crypto exchanges continues to decline In recent quarters, the cryptocurrency industry has been flooded with news of various exchange hacks. On October 6, 2022 , there were reports on many information resources that hackers successfully hacked the blockchain associated with Binance, stealing $566 million in BNB, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Fantom ( FTM-USD ), Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), and other coins. And in mid-January 2023, FTX stated ( FTT-USD ) in a report to creditors that $415 million of digital assets were stolen due to hacking attacks. And as a result, many investors began to be more conservative in holding Bitcoins, Litecoins ( LTC-USD ), and other coins, moving them to more secure offline crypto wallets. Moreover, the trust continues to decline in exchanges that were actively used to conduct transactions with coins until Q3 2022, and at the moment, many of their clients prefer to keep their assets under their control. On November 22, 2022, the total number of Bitcoins held by Coinbase ( COIN ) was around 531,242, and the next day there was a significant withdrawal of funds in excess of 44,000 BTC as a result of the spread of adverse reports about the bankruptcy of FTX. On a larger scale, there is a trend toward reducing the holding of coins by investors on the balance sheet of a crypto exchange. So, since the beginning of 2022, Coinbase's clients have withdrawn a little less than 195,000 Bitcoins, thereby creating additional pressure on the financial position of one of the largest exchanges in the world. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Moreover, one of the additional reasons for the reduction in the balance of Coinbase may be the desire of investors to take profits from their investments due to the increase in the price of Bitcoin by just over 40% over the past month and a half. Overall, in Q4 2022, the company posted an operating loss of $474.5 million, starkly contrasting to the last three months of 2021, during which Coinbase posted its highest operating income ever. The continued downward trend in operating income from quarter to quarter is a red flag and can be a significant cause for concern for investors and the entire crypto community. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Seeking Alpha In addition, Binance's partner in issuing Binance USD, Paxos , is under the gun. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has begun a discussion with Paxos about the need to change the legal status of this stablecoin, and the regulator is also considering steps against the company. In the event that Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ) is recognized as a security, this will open Pandora's box, as a result of which many other stablecoins can receive this status, which will lead to more stringent regulation and loss of interest by traders and investors in the crypto industry. You can already see how the balance of Bitcoin at Binance ( BNB-USD ) has decreased by 10.6% from the peak in the 4th quarter of 2022. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Fed rate hike At the Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which was held from January 31 to February 1, the majority of its participants agreed that it is necessary to raise the interest rate by 0.25%, which is in line with the expectations of investors and traders. However, the negative moment was the information that several participants of the meeting were in favor of raising the interest rate by 0.5%, and thus this could lead to higher borrowing costs and, as a result, lead to a slowdown in economic growth. One of the possible reasons for the desire of some members of the FOMC to tighten monetary policy and thereby raise the key rate by 50 basis points may be the fact that the pace of slowing inflation is declining and, as a result, it is necessary to act more aggressively to achieve the inflation target at 2%. So, the annual inflation rate in the United States was 6.41% as of January 31, 2023, which is only 0.04% less than the previous month. Source: YCharts If the Fed raises the interest rate by 0.5%, then this will strengthen the US dollar and increase investment interest in US Treasuries ( US10Y ) ( US2Y ) compared to Bitcoin, which is trying to get out of the bearish cycle. Conclusion After a fourteen-month bear market that brought frustration and apathy to various digital assets on the part of crypto community members, the first significant signs of its recovery finally appeared on the horizon. During the bearish period, there has been a redistribution of Bitcoin ownership from investors who are less disciplined and less confident in the asset to those who clearly understand the value of cryptocurrencies in a rapidly evolving digital world. In recent weeks, there has been a significant increase in the number of transactions, which positively affected miners' profits. In Q1 2023, two key players in the crypto industry, Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) announced an increase in Bitcoin mining. Given the increased price of cryptocurrencies and the rise in the number of mining equipment, it can be said with high confidence that the largest Bitcoin mining companies have successfully passed the test of the strength of their financial position from Mr. Market. According to a report by Fidelity Digital Assets , a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, European and American institutional investors have reported an improvement in the perception of cryptocurrencies and continue to increase investment in various digital assets. In my estimation, in 2023, there will be a tightening of regulation by various government agencies, which, on the one hand, will reduce the appetite of speculative traders in the short term, but on the other hand, will attract the attention of long-term and more conservative investors. So, for example, according to the optimistic forecast of ARK Invest , the price of Bitcoin can reach $1.48 million by 2030, but with a more conservative estimate, Katie Wood's company ( ARKK ) can reach the price of the most popular cryptocurrency in the amount of $258,500, which is significantly higher than the current values. In addition, many institutional market participants continue to reduce interest in commodity mastodons such as Exxon Mobil ( XOM ), Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ), and Chevron Corporation ( CVX ) and begin to increase their appetite for riskier assets. In conclusion, I would like to note that according to my model, in the next two weeks, I expect a correction in the price of Bitcoin due to the strengthening of the US dollar against other currencies during the Fed's interest rate hike and also the tightening of tensions between the administration of US President Joe Biden and the Chinese government. After that, the accumulation phase may come, which I will use to buy shares in Bitcoin mining companies and ETFs involved in managing digital assets.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582354-is-bitcoin-smart-investment-for-portfolio-now?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10041159.jpeg

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  Following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's plan to sue Paxos, the issuer of stablecoin binance USD (BUSD), there have been more than $3.5 billion in BUSD outflows, representing a 23% fall in market capitalization, Citi noted. The outflows have generally made their way into rival stablecoin tether (USDT), the bank said.  “Total-value-locked (TVL) activity in ETH terms has not picked up as much as prices,” the note said, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes are unchanged this month after a steady decline.  The bank notes that non-fungible-token (NFT) activity has increased in recent weeks, though transactions levels remain far below 2022 averages.  Crypto search interest remains low despite the year-to-date rally in digital assets, the note added.

Each new bull market typically heralds new leadership, in the form of new sectors and stocks. Artificial Intelligence stands a strong chance of taking up the leadership baton. Cryptos and related stocks look like they can deliver outsized returns. After a strong January, February has proven to be more difficult for the stock market. This has coincided with rallies in the USD and global bond yields, which share an inverse correlation with risk assets. A large number of growth stocks have broken out higher from multi-month bases and have held their rallies after beating earnings expectations. This tells me that the medium term trend for stocks is still higher, although we may see more range-bound action in the near term. Based on the charts, two leading sectors have caught my eye, and I think any pullback will create buying opportunities in them. The first sector is Artificial Intelligence Many smaller cap leaders within the AI space have experienced explosive rallies since the start of the year, and I think the stage is set for them to embark on the next leg higher. C3.ai ( AI ) is one such stock. Note the impressive volume coming in, which is above average compared to past levels for the stock. As a percentage of market cap, some of these high-volume days are hitting up to 100% of the stock's market cap in a single trading day. This is a sign of institutional interest. AI is now building a flag pattern, and looks primed to breakout higher. Daily Chart: AI Tradingview BigBear.ai ( BBAI ) is another small cap AI stock that is building a large triangle pattern, digesting its recent rally. I believe its 50% pullback from its highs will prove to be an attractive buying opportunity, given the high institutional interest coming in. BBAI has seen surges in its trading volume, coming in between 41% to 100% of its market cap in a single session of late. Daily Chart: BBAI Tradingview There are many other AI stocks that are on my focus list, as I wait for them to set up. SoundHound AI ( SOUN ) is another clear leader, and is currently consolidating in a flag pattern. Its high volume surges are also signs of heavy institutional interest. Daily Chart: SOUN Tradingview These three AI stocks are amongst many others I am monitoring. Do keep in mind that the leading stocks of the previous bull market rarely recover to their highs again. Each bull market typically begins with new leadership, in the form of new sectors and stocks. The AI space is still fairly new, and we could see huge gains in the smaller cap names. The second sector I am watching closely is the Crypto space Bitcoin ( GBTC ) and Ethereum ( ETHE ) have recovered above their pre-FTX highs, and have been largely unmoved in the recent selloff. This relative strength is impressive, and stands out amongst risk assets. Daily Chart: Bitcoin Tradingview Daily Chart: Ethereum Tradingview There are a few crypto-related stocks that I am watching closely. Silvergate Capital ( SI ) has found it very difficult to make new lows, despite all the bad news (missing earnings, etc.). Recently, trading volume has surged, and this has coincided with BlackRock and Citadel increasing their stake in the stock. If the big boys are coming in, I want to ride on their coat-tails. SI is now building a multi-month base, and short interest is 78% of float. Daily Chart: SI Tradingview Crypto miners also look good. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) has seen a surge in trading volume, with dollar value traded hitting as much as 16% of its market cap in a single session in the past few weeks. The stock has also recaptured above its moving averages, which are now starting to provide support from below. Daily Chart: RIOT Tradingview Marathon Digital ( MARA ) has also seen a huge pickup in volume. On 13 Jan, volume traded hit 65% of its market cap. There is quite certainly institutional buying involved, as retail traders are not likely to move the stock in such a big way. Short interest on MARA stands at 44% of float. Daily Chart: MARA Tradingview To sum up, if we are at the start of a new bull market, then the leadership baton is likely to be passed to a new sector. I think the AI sector stands a good chance in this aspect. As previously mentioned, old leaders of the previous bull market are unlikely to recover to their highs. As such, crypto stocks are unlikely to see new highs in the near future, but may still deliver strong returns.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4582346-new-leading-sectors-ai-and-cryptos-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10038839.jpeg

42414330,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4Jjp,1677497189,"Allure of Bitcoin Ordinals, DeFi Drives Crypto Funds to Bitcoin Layer 2-Token Stacks","Prominent crypto investment funds are turning to tokens of the Stacks Network as they bet on the growth of Bitcoin. Stacks is a so-called layer 2 companion chain for smart contracts focused on bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, allowing for the creation of related financial products.  Stack’s STX tokens have jumped 23% in the past 24 hours, adding to a 50% surge over a seven-day rolling period, CoinGecko data shows. Demand for the tokens has increased since the arrival of the Ordinals protocol, which went live on Jan. 21 and allows users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. The token's market cap topped $1.2 billion as of Monday.  A recently published investment thesis by North Rock Digital highlighted Stacks' focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), the innovative use of smart contracts and its compatibility with Bitcoin as attributes that set it apart from other blockchain projects.  “We believe there is a massive and relatively untapped market opportunity, a huge cultural inflection point in the community (sparked by ordinals) and transformative Stacks upgrade coming later this year,” North Rock Digital founder Hal Press said in a tweet over the weekend.  The firm noted that Stacks has a strong community, experienced leadership and a clear road map for growth, and concluded that investing in Stacks could yield big returns as the project develops and gains adoption.  Since its launch, Ordinals has caused a spike in bitcoin transactions and a resurgence in Bitcoin network development. It has also reignited discussions of Bitcoin scaling – a controversial topic in crypto circles.  So far, more than 197,000 unique inscriptions, a term for each individual token on Ordinals, have been conducted, Dune Analytics data shows.  North Rock didn't disclose specifics of its STX investment. Press didn't immediately respond to requests for comments.  In its thesis, North Rock said Stacks offers several advantages over blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, including lower fees, faster transaction times and enhanced security.  The analysis also explores potential use cases for Stacks technology, including the creation of decentralized social-media platforms, prediction and trading markets and lending and borrowing applications. Such products are the bedrock for $50 billion in locked token value on applications built on other blockchains, data from DefiLlama shows.     A Stacks upgrade scheduled for March 20 may have also contributed to the recent price growth of STX. Developers introduced the Stacks 2.1 upgrade in a post last week that details several new features and improvements to the protocol.  One of the main features is the introduction of ""Stacking 2.0,"" an updated version of the Stacks consensus mechanism. Stacking is a process in which STX token holders can lock up their tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards.  Stacking 2.0 aims to make the process more accessible and inclusive by allowing smaller token holders to participate and earn rewards. The upgrade will also add improvements to smart contract functionality, enhanced scalability through the use of a new ""microblocks"" feature and better support for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).",POSITIVE,BTC | STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | STX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/27/allure-of-bitcoin-ordinals-defi-drives-crypto-funds-to-bitcoin-layer-2-token-stacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e44d46bf40156de0a7febe6e36d2d65f1edf7954-1566x894.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Short-bitcoin funds had $10 million in inflows during the week ended Feb. 24, according to crypto asset manager CoinShares. Long-bitcoin funds bled $12 million, the third straight weekly outflow.  Broadly speaking, digital-asset investment products saw minor outflows of $2 million.  Short funds provide investors a bearish exposure to an asset's price. For instance, ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF offers short BTC exposure that profits from the cryptocurrency's price declines. A ""short"" position in financial markets is a bet on a price decline.  ""We believe this reaction reflects nervousness amongst U.S. investors prompted by the recent stronger-than-expected macro data releases, but also highlights its sensitivity to the regulatory crackdown in the U.S.,"" CoinShares noted in the weekly report, explaining the inflow into short-bitcoin funds.  Bitcoin (BTC) fell over 3% last week after failing to establish a foothold above a key resistance level at $25,000.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell 2.4%, outperforming perhaps because of its rising deflation rate.

42414315,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4IXX,1677494174,$1B Voyager-Binance Deal Benefits Halved if Alameda Loan Claim Succeeds: Texas Regulators,"The benefits to creditors from an offer from Binance.US to buy bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital hinge on a $445 million loan claim by Alameda Research, making the deal potentially not worth bothering with, Texas regulators said in a Friday court filing.  The filing by the Texas banking and securities agencies said that Voyager’s creditors might be better off if the company simply liquidated assets and warned that would-be buyer Binance.US may be illegally offering securities through its staking program.  “If Alameda is successful in proving its administrative expense claim … recovery could be decreased from 51% to 24%-26% – an amount much lower than what the general unsecured claimants are estimated to receive in a Chapter 7 liquidation,” said the court filing, which was also backed by securities regulators from New Jersey.  Voyager lawyers have said the Binance.US deal has significant creditor support, but the Texas filing says they weren’t sufficiently warned about the risks of Alameda, the trading arm of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, successfully clawing back loan repayments made before its own bankruptcy.  The Binance.US deal, which is worth $1.02 billion, should also be quashed because customers weren’t warned personal data could be transferred to underregulated overseas jurisdictions, the filing also said.  Binance concerns  The document, which was filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, also detailed concerns over Binance’s business model.  ""Binance.US’ staking program differs from traditional crypto staking and appears to constitute an illegal securities offering,” Joe Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board, said in a statement.  His comments follow enforcement action against crypto exchange Kraken, which had to pay a multimillion-dollar fine to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month and agree to end staking-as-a-service in the country.  “While Binance.US has affirmatively represented to its customers that it was working on getting licensed in Texas, Binance.US has never applied for a license with the SSB (State Securities Board) and, after a year, abandoned its license application with the DOB (Department of Banking) after failing to submit sufficient financial information,” the court filing said.  The terms of use Voyager customers must sign “may even effectively permit Binance.com to act in the U.S. even though Binance.com purportedly does not deal with U.S. customers,” the regulators added.  The deal for Voyager has also been opposed by the SEC and Federal Trade Commission, which said it was probing allegations of deceptive marketing by Voyager before it filed for bankruptcy in July. A hearing on that issue is scheduled for Thursday.  Binance.US didn't immediately return a call for comment.

42414334,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4KAM,1677488341,Liquid Staking Replaces DeFi Lending as Second-Largest Crypto Sector,"Liquid staking, which allows users to earn rewards for locking cryptocurrency in a blockchain network while retaining the liquidity of the locked funds, is now bigger than decentralized lending and borrowing.  The total value of crypto assets deposited in liquid staking protocols was $14.1 billion as of European trading hours on Monday, making it the second-largest crypto market sector, according to data source DefiLlama. The total value locked in decentralized-finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing protocols was $13.7 billion, the third largest, while decentralized exchanges, with deposits of $19.4 billion, held the top spot.  The Ethereum blockchain's upcoming Shanghai software upgrade, which will allow stakers to withdraw the ether (ETH) they have staked and the accumulated rewards for the first time, has galvanized investor interest in liquid staking. Liquid staking is the best-performing crypto sector this year, with growth in total value locked approaching 60%.  ""It [the upgrade] will innovate the current space by allowing for healthy competition between liquid staking solutions, will strengthen ETH's position by providing yield from staking/unstaking, and will give users the security of maintaining sovereignty over their assets,"" Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto research firm and data provider Messari, said in a newsletter published Friday.  By opening up to withdrawals, the upgrade is expected to improve overall liquidity. Since December 2020, more than 16.5 million ETH has been staked in Ethereum's Beacon Chain, of which 42% has been locked through liquid staking protocols, mainly Lido.  Users of liquid staking protocols like Lido receive derivative tokens such as staked ether (stETH) on a 1:1 basis. These derivative tokens represent a user's stake and can be used to generate additional yield across Defi protocols. Lido's governance token LDO has rallied 220% this year, outperforming industry leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether by a huge margin. Governance tokens of Lido's rivals Rocket Pool and Frax have also surged, according to CoinDesk data.  Liquid staking's increased popularity relative to decentralized lending could also be attributed to the yield differential between the two sectors.  Lido, which controls over 75% of the liquid staking market, offers an annualized percentage return of 4.8% on staked ether, 6% on staked solana and 6.3% on Polygon's MATIC token. That's higher than the rates available for lending top stablecoins USDT, USDC and DAI on the DeFi giant Aave.  Liquid staking is expected to grow further, because the ETH staking ratio, which measures the percentage of the cryptocurrency's supply staked, is significantly lower than other layer 1 cryptocurrencies.  ""Only 14% of ETH is currently being staked vs. 58%, the average for layer 1 coins, Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital-assets platform Matrixport, told CoinDesk. Its likely interest in staking will continue to swell.""  Binance Research recently voiced a similar opinion, forecasting more inflow of money into staking protocols after the Shanghai upgrade.  ""It could be argued that many groups of individuals had been waiting for Shanghai to stake their ETH, as withdrawals will remove the liquidity risk and uncertainty of an previously undefined lock-up period,"" Binance Research said in a report early this month.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH | RPL,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/27/liquid-staking-replaces-defi-lending-as-second-largest-crypto-sector,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1099a0b5b9b252dc5d33408ee46460a59c3f64b-2645x926.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414336,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4K53,1677485914,French Police Arrest Duo Involved in Platypus Crypto Exploit,"Two people alleged to be behind an attack on the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Platypus have been arrested, according to a tweet by France's police department.  Of the $9 million in stolen assets, Platypus said it has recovered 2.4 million USDC and 687,000 BUSD; it has also worked with Tether to freeze 1.5 million USDT. French police seized approximately $220,000 worth of crypto as part of the arrest. USDC, USDT and BUSD are all stablecoins that are designed to reflect the price of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar.  USP, a Platypus USD-backed stablecoin, is currently trading at 32 cents, according to CoinGecko.  Platypus is a stablecoin-centric automated market maker (AMM) on the Avalanche blockchain. According to DeFiLlama, Platypus has $39.2 million in total value locked (TVL). The protocol’s TVL is down significantly from a March 2022 high of $1.2 billion.  In a tweet, the protocol’s team thanked Binance and ZachXBT for their assistance in tracing the identity of the attacker.  The type of attack used against Platypus involved a flash loan and is similar to the structure of attack used against Mango Markets late last year. Flash loans aren’t inherently a bad thing, they were initially developed as used as a tool for traders looking for arbitrage opportunities.  This particular attack used a logic error within USP’s smart contracts, which continually checks for solvency. As CoinDesk previously reported, the attacker used borrowed crypto from Aave to supply liquidity to a trading pool on Platypus. The smart contracts then issued a liquidity provider token, LP-USDC, and placed it into a staking contract on the protocol. They then borrowed USP stablecoins against their LP positions and withdrew everything to Aave to repay the flash loan.  On Feb. 24, Platypus announced it intends to replay a minimum of 63% of funds to users after it managed to recover a part of the $9 million drained from the protocol last week.

42410826,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtl1,1677481253,Start of the End? Testnet Goerli Ether Spikes to $1.60 as Traders Jump on Opportunity Meant for Developers,"Prices of Goerli ether (gETH) spiked to over $1.60 over the weekend, rising from 7 cents Friday and reaching a market capitalization of as much as $15 million.  Data from DEXTools shows that nearly a million dollars worth of gETH was traded in the past 24 hours, with 3.79 million total gETH in circulation and 1,260 token holders at press time.  But goerli ether is no trendy Ethereum fork or an Ethereum rival marked up by hype men: These tokens are a testnet version of actual ether for developers to simulate transactions, smart contacts, and other activities prior to deploying on the Ethereum mainnet. This means that these tokens are supposed to be free – issued simply for testnet developers.  As such, the gETH price spike has ended up attracting criticism from the crypto community.  “Testnet ether is supposed to be free but is being marked up by speculators,” well-known developer Mudit Gupta said in a tweet on Sunday. “Keyboard warriors will tell you that the developers are buying it but no, they are not. Maybe 0.1% are buying for consumption.”  “This is the start of the end of Goerli testnet. It served us well,” he added.  Testnets are a testing environment that mimics real-world blockchain usage, allowing developers to find and patch critical bugs for upcoming products or features meant to be deployed on the mainnet.  This prevents unintended damage that could potentially lead to monetary losses or a technology breakdown.  The gETH market bunged into existence earlier this month after the cross-chain trading platform LayerZero created a swap product that allowed developers to purchase the testnet ether directly from the decentralized exchange Uniswap.  LayerZero wanted to create a market that made it significantly easier for Ethereum developers to test and have access to ether on the Goerli testnet.  Developers and users have, so far, had to rely on services called faucets to gain testnet tokens, which isn’t a straightforward process.  The tokens were initially priced at 10 cents apiece and were listed on Uniswap on Feb. 22. When a user purchased the tokens on Uniswap, a series of swaps between ether and goerli ether were conducted on both the Goerli testnet and Ethereum mainnet – resulting in the native ether on Ethereum to ether on Goerli.  But markets attract speculators, and more so in the crypto world. For some on Crypto Twitter, betting on gETH is a way to invest in the base roots of applications supposed to later be built on Ethereum – a sort of leveraged bet on ether.  Speculators are having fun while at it. As of Monday, there’s already a non-fungible token (NFT) collection built on the Goerli network, as well as a Shiba Inu-themed goerli inu meme coin.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | UNI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/27/start-of-the-end-testnet-goerli-ether-spikes-to-160-as-traders-jump-on-opportunity-meant-for-developers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53be1f4e2ac12d5cf9a6c9129de2b4296f764413-1024x1024.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414346,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4SoJ,1677459951,First Mover Asia: Solana in the Green After Weekend Deep Freeze,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Solana is back and ticking upwards while bitcoin appears overbought.  Insights: The SEC has overreached in its latest actions against crypto entities, but the crypto industry must improve its lobbying efforts to ensure future regulation is effective.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,111.23 +22.5 ▲ 2.1% Bitcoin (BTC) $23,475 +354.0 ▲ 1.5% Ethereum (ETH) $1,636 +43.7 ▲ 2.7% S&P 500 daily close  3,970.04 −42.3 ▼ 1.1% Gold  $1,820 +11.2 ▲ 0.6% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.95% ▲ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Good morning, Asia, here’s how the crypto market is moving this Monday.  Solana is up early 4% after the protocol crashed twice during the weekend, freezing transactions. The Solana Foundation says an investigation is underway into the cause of the crash and will be available shortly.  Meanwhile, bitcoin is trading flat at $23,475. The world’s largest digital asset is up 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Ether is up 2.7% to $1,636.  Katie Stockton, founder, and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, recently said on CoinDesk TV that bitcoin appears “overbought” making it difficult to clear $25,000.  “The overbought condition would suggest that that resistance is left intact,” she said.  Ether, Stockton says, is looking just like bitcoin. Both are part of a top-down-oriented market where macro forces are price action “as opposed to the fundamental value of things.”  “[Ether] does look just like bitcoin, the range there as defined by resistance around $1,670,” she said.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, adds that bitcoin is attempting to find support during a minor price correction.  ""If bitcoin remains in the current range, we are likely to see $25,000 and then $30,000. A rejection from here could see $20,000 first, followed by $18,000,"" he said in an email to CoinDesk.  Looking toward next week, the U.S is scheduled to announce its consumer confidence index for February on Tuesday and jobless claims on Thursday. In Asia, the People’s Bank of China will be announcing its balance of trade figures on Tuesday and its inflation rate on Thursday.  With the world’s two biggest economies set to announce important economic data over the next week, all eyes will be on crypto to see if it can overcome key resistance levels.  Insights  Crypto Lobbying Needs a Reset: More FTC, Less SEC  CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey writes the weekly ""Money Reimagined"" newsletter. This essay originally appeared on CoinDesk's website on Feb. 24.  Is there a method to the SEC’s madness?  Of all the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) actions against crypto entities that have stirred the industry’s ire, the agency’s recent move forcing New York-based Paxos to cease issuing its partner Binance’s BUSD stablecoin is the most deserving of an outcry. How, critics rightfully asked, can a token that’s explicitly designed not to fluctuate in price be considered a security?  But a recent account in Fortune suggests the SEC may not have been thinking of securities law at all in that action. Binance was automatically converting competitor-issued stablecoins held by its exchange’s customers’ into BUSD. To me, that looks like an antitrust concern, not one of BUSD being a security.  Now, if there’s one area of enforcement where the crypto community, with its anti-middleman ethos of decentralization, should get behind, it’s prosecution of monopolistic behavior. But that leaves us with the question of why is the SEC getting involved here and not the nation’s trustbuster, the Federal Trade Commission?  I get two takeaways from this:  Another reminder that, in the absence of clear legislative boundaries for crypto, the SEC is striking out wherever it can to assert authority. It’s partly turf war, partly political posturing during a post-FTX moment in which crypto is a convenient whipping boy.
