42401055,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLf0p,1518365126,Crypto Jobs? Where We're Going We Won't Need Jobs,"Kade Morton is a security consultant and open source enthusiast. In his spare time, when he isn't volunteering for Mozilla, he's working on his own open-source decentralized application, Aletheia. Follow him on twitter @cypath      In a recent CoinDesk op-ed, Sandro Ro urges the blockchain community to ""construct and act by a new culture whereby our companies care deeply about its people and society's problems and act accordingly.""  Making work more rewarding for employees is an arguably noble goal, but it’s one that I believe is doomed to fail.  Moreover, particularly in the blockchain space, it misses the point of this era's innovations.  A critical look at employment  According to the oracle of the age, Wikipedia, slavery is any system in which principles of property law are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals, as a de jure form of property. A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration (unless you count room and board).  In the modern form of employment we work under, employment contracts stipulate what we must and must not do. It’s very close to ownership. A lot of people are unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement because work is often hard to find.  Sure, people can quit. But quitting without another job can literally kill you. We need money to survive. We live in a world with enough resources to go around, but we need some way to distribute them since we don’t trust each other to share equally. So, humankind invented money, items granted for effort expended that can be exchanged for resources.  Money is effectively a ledger. It’s incredibly unequal, but it’s still a record of a transaction.  And money is the remuneration many would say, so working is not slavery by our definition. However, examine the situation many are in. People work for food, housing and health care. But homeownership, a healthy diet and proper medical care are a dream for many, and only growing more distant.  So what are we getting in return for work? Not a lot, it seems. Employment is basically slavery. This is not to belittle historic atrocities or the plight of those trafficked for slavery in the modern age. We’ll call employment wage slavery to differentiate it from true slavery.  When people say we should make employment better for employees, they’re saying we should make wage slavery better for wage slaves.  The forces against improving conditions  Wage slavery is also, by its very nature, antagonistic to making things better for the wage slaves. Wages are the largest overhead most companies have and the point of business is to make as much money as you can with the smallest overheads possible.  Companies actively fight against raising wages and at some point, as an employer, you’re going to look at your profit/loss statement and say “employees will have to live with how things are, I can’t eat into my profit margins any further.”  Assuming your profit margins, if even present, are not already razor thin. An employer might not have freedom to move in improving work conditions.  The forest for the trees  It doesn’t have to be like this, though.  Humankind is capable of breathtaking wonders. We have entire factories staffed by almost nothing but robots. We have artificial intelligence that can outthink humans . We can 3D print houses.  As time moves on, the strict necessity of having a human to do a particular job will ebb away, and with it our need to work.  But what is not ebbing away is our need for food, shelter and healthcare. We still have the fundamental issue of trust. We don’t trust each other to share.  Imagine if we had a decentralized immutable ledger, that allowed people to distribute things because they can verify all the transactions themselves and build consensus. Surely then we can build a system that people would have faith in to distribute resources equally.  Oh wait.  We have such a ledger. It’s called a blockchain.  Blockchain’s first breakout implementation was a currency. It’s like saying “we have a ledger we can trust. What should we distribute? I know, other ledgers!” It’s absurd.  To say that blockchain entrepreneurs should make employment better for employees is only a part step on a long road because the path you’re on can render money useless if we walk it to the end.  Wonders  The UN has already tried distributing aid using a blockchain. What’s stopping us from creating a universal basic income of fresh food and water ? A lack of political will?  Did a lack of political will stop the invention of Bitcoin?  Yes, blockchain entrepreneurs should try to make employment better for employees. But that’s like stepping into a cavern with a candle and only acknowledging what you can see with the candlelight.  Everyone working in blockchain should realize the transformative nature of this and other technologies. Some I’ve mentioned and there are many more. We have the ability to create wonders. Not just companies that create a lot of value for shareholders, real world changing wonders.  When your time in this world is said and done, which do you want to say you built?

42428549,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8mLh,1518360310,"Prices Aside, Crypto's Tech Stack Is Steadily Improving","A look at the headlines of late may leave you with a familiar conclusion – with all the ups and downs in the market, it's just too early to take crypto seriously.  And it's true, despite the best efforts of even the industry's most notable developers, the world's largest cryptocurrencies remain not just volatile, but difficult (and risky) to use, at least in a way that their creators' intended.  Still, heading into 2018, enthusiasts the world over are hard at work on improvements.  As such, there's optimism advances could start to compound, creating a user experience that finally starts to transcend the issues – namely, the high fees and long wait times – users of most blockchains have become all too accustomed to.  In fact, in the year ahead, blockchain users could see exciting new features and scientific firsts that just might help push the industry closer to that vision:  1. Off-chain channels  What if it was possible for blockchain-based transactions to avoid using the blockchain at all?  That's the big idea behind off-blockchain payment channels, an idea that harkens back to 2015, but whose time may have finally come this year. Most associated with Bitcoin's Lightning Network, the idea is actually more general than this specific instance.  Essentially, off-blockchain payment channels would allow two people using any one cryptocurrency to send small payments back and forth, settling to the blockchain (and dealing with its high fees and slow transaction times) only when absolutely necessary.  Due to the potential impact, the idea is catching on – ethereum developers, while they often don't see eye-to-eye with their bitcoin peers, are at work on the same type of solution.  But there's more than just a rivalry at play, there's also reason to believe 2018 might be different in that actual live transactions could be sent in significant numbers.  The developers behind bitcoin's Lightning Network have declared the technology almost ready based on successful tests. Meanwhile, ethereum's developers have also unveiled successful tests for their versions of the concept, Raiden Network, with a more ambitious version, Plasma, potentially around the corner.  2. Real-live staking  As their popularity grows, attention is also being paid to the electricity required to sustain cryptocurrencies.  While the relevant data is difficult to pin down, proof-of-work, the consensus protocol that underlies bitcoin mining, is best defined as an energy-intensive process. As such, there are concerns about its electricity use could have large-scale environmental effects.  This is leading to new research on an idea from 2011. Called proof-of-stake, or ""consensus by vote,"" the idea has been implemented, however, not at the scale intended by ethereum.  As such, it's long-awaited project Casper is likely to be under significant scrutiny this coming year, and early versions are beginning to see the light.  In a testnet released on New Year's Eve, one variation of Casper, was claimed to be functional. Karl Floersch, a leading developer behind the technology, told CoinDesk at the time that the code is working with ""no hiccups.""  Work remains to adapt this early version of Casper across the different ethereum clients, but ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has said he expects the technology will be tested alongside proof-of-work sometime in the future.  3. Privacy advances  Privacy has been a somewhat neglected promise in the majority of blockchains, but it's nonetheless an issue that could see improvement this year.  Most notable is the advances in zero-knowledge proofs, what Buterin has called ""the single most under-hyped thing in cryptography right now,"" are getting cheaper and easier to deploy.  A form of cryptography that hides information without risking validity, it's already been adapted to a small degree into ethereum, which could lead to a wave of startups experimenting with private smart contracts in novel and unexpected ways.  Plus, in a white paper published earlier this month, a system for achieving zero-knowledge without compromising trust – a point of contention in some earlier iterations of the tech – was released, an update which could have exciting consequences.  And as existing tech matures, privacy-centric cryptocurrencies such as monero and zcash are also set to improve.  In preparation for an upgrade, zcash has been steadily reinforcing its security, while monero is stepping up to implement ""bulletproofs,"" a feature that could cut fees by 80 percent.  4. Decentralized exchanges  No, this isn't just a new version of Coinbase or Kraken.  As the industry's largest exchanges struggle to cope with the influx of new adopters, an increasing number of projects are at work developing something called a decentralized exchange. The term denotes not just a new browser-based exchange, but rather a type of software users can use to swap one cryptocurrency with another without a central entity.  2017 saw a flood of new decentralized exchange projects, such as ShapeShift's Prism, 0x, OmiseGo, Kyber Network, and many others.  Expect those efforts to accelerate this year.  So far, hardware wallet Ledger has already integrated with decentralized exchange Radar Relay, allowing users to trustlessly exchange tokens based on ethereum.  While functionality is limited (it's only supported by a single wallet and only ethereum-based tokens can be sent), many in the industry see it as a glimpse into the future of not just cryptocurrency exchanges, but the technology itself.
