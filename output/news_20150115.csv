42377940,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVnl,1421364723,Crypto 2.0 Roundup: Kickstarting Colored Coins and a Public Policy Push,"At a time when many bitcoin sectors are struggling, 2015 began with an outpouring of interest and show of strength for the crypto 2.0 community.  CoinDesk profiled a number of the promising projects, naming 19 to watch in the year ahead, but as our readers showcased, there remain many more that have garnered enthusiastic communities for their efforts.  However, while development continues on many exciting projects, a few notable names have so far used 2015 to turn the page. In this week's roundup, we focus on projects that are reenergizing for new objectives in the year ahead.  Breaking ground on 2.0 policy  One of the more contentious applications of cryptographic tokens has been in the field of distributed fundraising and crowdfunding, a space that saw Swarm emerge as one of its leading voices in 2014.  Amid this backdrop of uncertainty, the startup is holding a collective workshop at MIT Media Lab that will propose solutions to the public policy issues that are prohibiting development in the wider crypto 2.0 space.  Swarm CEO Joel Dietz told CoinDesk that the event, being held from 15th to 18th January, will attempt to provide new clarity, specifically to developers in the space who may be unsure of whether they can pursue certain ideas.  Dietz said:  ”The goal that I have is to give entrepreneurs a green light in certain areas to innovate in, to say here are the yellow light areas where we don’t know and here are the red light areas where you, probably at least, shouldn’t be doing this stuff until there’s more regulatory clarification.”  The event will see four working groups discuss topics including cryptographic tokens, smart contracts, crypto-equity and intellectual property. Participants include DATA’s Constance Choi, ID3’s John Clippingerhttps://idcubed.org/team_member/john-henry-clippinger/, Harvard’s Berkman Center’s Primavera de Filippi, bitcoin-focused policy group Coin Center and noted US law firm Perkins Coie.  The working groups are set to present their findings during a livestreamed event to be held at 2pm EST on 18th January.  A new start for Colored Coins  The bitcoin ecosystem is now inundated with a number of ambitious crypto 2.0 projects. But one of its oldest concepts (dating back, some say, to 2012) is that bitcoin’s protocol could be used for asset transfer via colored coins.  Advocates would argue it’s also still the simplest. Rather than using a unique token like mastercoin (MSC) or counterparty’s XCP on top of bitcoin, colored coins is a layer on top of bitcoin that augments or 'colors' bitcoins to signify assets by adding to their metadata.  However, for a long time, the colored coins movement has struggled to gain traction, even as companies like ChromaWallet, CoinPrism and CoinSpark entered the market.  To long-time enthusiast Amos Meiri, this was due to the fact that, while many found the idea of colored coins compelling, the movement had no “father” to watch over its development.  Meiri told CoinDesk:  “There was no standard, this was like the main thing that was frustrating for everyone that wanted to work with colored coins, you had different implementation and no tools to know how to work with the others, and there was also no one to manage this domain.”  As a director at the open-source, non-profit Colored Coins organisation, however, Meiri is looking to change this narrative by bringing all of the existing entities in the ecosystem together to address standardization in 2015.  “The goal is basically quite simple, what we want is, if you issued a coin in Coinprism, your ChromaWallet would know how to read it and people would be able to use different tools being developed on the ecosystem,” he said.  Meiri indicated that the Colored Coins organisation has purchased the colored coins domain, coloredcoins.org, and that it will now manage that platform. A revamped version of that website is expected to launch on Sunday.  Still, Meiri acknowledged that the group has work ahead to counter the momentum of market-leading crypto 2.0 projects like Counterparty, and he promised more updates ahead.  “This is something that we’re going to do, and it will have the money and effort behind it to create a community around it,” he concluded.  Behind GetGems’ rebranding  Long one of the most-watched product plays in the crypto 2.0 space, Gems abruptly announced this past week that it would rebrand as GetGems.  The abrupt change is, according to lead developer Daniel Peled, a necessary one, as when it recently attempted to upload the GetGems app to the Google Play store as “Gems Messenger”, problems persisted.  “It was hard for people find the app because there are a lot of apps starting with the word Gems,” Peled explained, adding that he believes there are many benefits to making the change now while the project is still in its infancy:  “GetGems is easier to find on the store, it gives the user more information about the product and is also our domain name.”  Peled indicated that no copyright issues initiated the change.

42377938,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVlF,1421360735,"Bitcoin Exchange Processor EgoPay Freezes Funds, Disables API","UPDATE (16:46 GMT): Payment solutions company Payeer has shown CoinDesk evidence that it has $185,503.32 and €5,460.75 in a frozen wallet with EgoPay.      Electronic payment processor and gateway EgoPay has frozen accounts belonging to a number of its clients, including cryptocurrency exchanges such as BTC-e and Bitmarket.pl.  BTC-e  told CoinDesk that EgoPay is denying it access to $80,000 of its funds having placed this sum in a ""frozen wallet"".  Slovakian cryptocurrency exchange GOLDUX.com confirmed $7,183 of its funds are also being withheld by EgoPay, which is based in Lithuania and registered in Malta.  The problem isn’t just limited to frozen funds, with EgoPay customers claiming some of the payment processor’s core technical features have also stopped functioning correctly.  API issues  According to a member of the team at Poland-based exchange BitMarket.pl, the EgoPay API returned several faulty transaction notifications on 28th December.  The company said:  ""These notifications were posted from the usual IP address of Egopay ... and were verified correctly by the SCI callback to the www.egopay.com server. However, the funds from these transactions were not added to our wallet.""  A BitMarket.pl spokesperson said the company also found it “suspicious” that the transactions had very similar ID codes, when these are normally very different.  GOLDUX.com’s representative said his company had also been experiencing problems with EgoPay’s API.  “The issue started at the end of December when we received some fraud callbacks from the EgoPay API. After that, EgoPay disabled its API and all payments were done manually,” he said.  A few days later, on 8th January, the representative received an email from EgoPay stating that a portion of GOLDUX.com’s funds had been frozen. He also noticed that payments were no longer being processed by the company at that time.  Where payments had previously been marked as “completed”, GOLDUX.com suggested they were remaining as “pending”.  When CoinDesk tested EgoPay’s API, we attempted to make a transaction but found our funds also labelled “pending”, with no further movement.  Lack of communication  When logged in as a user on EgoPay, a message is displayed notifying clients of a delay in payment processing, it states:  ""EgoPay Members will be experiencing higher than normal review times for all withdrawals and deposits as EgoPay is currently conducting a system migration. EgoPay will now be able to provide a more secure netywork for all members through wihch to complate their online transfers. EgoPays standard review time frames and service level agreements will return to normal and EgoPay appreciates your cooperation and understanding.”  Not only are EgoPay’s clients dissatisfied with their funds being locked, they are less than pleased with the company’s lack of communication on the matter.  The site’s Live Support feature remains offline, even during the stated working hours, and the support team’s Skype accounts are also offline.  A representative from BTC-e, known only as ‘Alex’, said he hadn’t heard from EgoPay since 22nd December.  EgoPay’s CEO Tadas Kasputis failed to respond to requests for comment on these latest service interruptions.  Past problems  The current instance isn’t the first time companies have had their funds frozen by EgoPay. On 4th August, EgoPay froze BTC-e’s account, which contained $200,000, without giving any warning or explanation.  At the time, an EgoPay customer support staff member told CoinDesk:  “We were investigating a string of suspicious transactions … in to EgoPay from several outside sources. The risk involved with these transactions ranges from losses occurring due to chargebacks and external government investigations for money laundering purposes or illegal activity funding.”  Alex said some of BTC-e's funds were released on 8th August, but that his company was then blocked entirely from accessing its EgoPay user account in mid-September, with $150,000 stuck inside.  Allegations abound  In September, BTC-e voiced allegations that EgoPay was insolvent and had “stolen” its clients’ funds. On 23rd September, Kasputis responded to requests for comment, rebutting the accusations and accusing BTC-e of attempting ""to utilize client funds for personal uses"".  Both companies continued to dispute the others’ allegations of wrongdoing.  In more recent allegations, the representative from GOLDUX.com shared his belief that EgoPay’s servers were hacked in late December. He alleges that this is what affected the company's merchant API, which enabled false callbacks to be made to several of the merchants and exchangers that use EgoPay.  For now, EgoPay’s clients are continuing to wait to hear from the company, to find out if and when their transactions will be completed and whether or not they will gain access to their frozen funds. Alex from BTC-e isn't holding out too much hope, though.  ""They've gone,"" he said.  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story.

42377925,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVTd,1421355714,Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles Implicated in Silk Road Trial,"UPDATE (16th January 01:13 GMT): Mark Karpeles has denied claims he operated Silk Road Marketplace.      The trial of alleged Silk Road ringleader Ross Ulbricht heated up today during the questioning of a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent by the defense team, led by Ulbricht's lawyer Joshua Dratel.  The DHS witness, agent Jared DerYeghiayan, reportedly claimed that Mark Karpeles, former CEO of the embattled bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, was once suspected to be the online black market's mastermind, Dread Pirate Roberts.  Reporters from the courtroom took to Twitter to address his claims; two suggested that the defense team is building a case to argue Karpeles is actually the ""real mastermind"" behind the Silk Road.  WIRED reporter Andy Greenberg, who has closely followed the Silk Road case and was present in court today, referenced the suspicions brought up in court:    DHS agents strongly suspected at one point Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles was Silk Road's Dread Pirate Roberts...more to come when we adjourn      — Andy Greenberg (@a_greenberg) January 15, 2015    This statement was corroborated by a tweet from VICE reporter Kari Paul, who has been in the courtroom since the trial began on Tuesday:    Defense in Silk Road trial arguing Mark Karpeles, CEO of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, was the real mastermind behind Silk Road.      — Kari Paul (@kari_paul) January 15, 2015    Just a theory?  While it's unclear whether Ulbricht's lawyers plan to use the DHS agent's suspicions of Karpeles in their strategy, Greenberg made a point to clarify that the defense team has made no such claims yet:    To be clear, everyone, defense has NOT made the argument Mark Karpeles was DPR, instead got a DHS agent to admit he was a suspect      — Andy Greenberg (@a_greenberg) January 15, 2015    It appears that other reporters in the courtroom perceived the claims as an argument from the defense that Karpeles – not Ulbricht – is Dread Pirate Roberts. Forbes reporter Sarah Jeong tweeted about the defense's ""theory"":    Defense's alternative theory seems to be that MARK KARPELES OF MT GOX and one other were the real DPR. #SilkRoadTrial      — Sarah Jeong (@sarahjeong) January 15, 2015    During his cross-examination by Dratel, it was apparently revealed that DerYeghiayan wrote emails about his suspicions of Karpeles as far back as 2012.  In one such email, DerYeghiayan appeared to note that Karpeles' motive for running the Silk Road could have been to control the price of bitcoin to benefit his exchange, Mt Gox:  ""[Silk Road] would be a device for leveraging the value of Bitcoin, and if he could create a site independent of Bitcoin, you could control the value of Bitcoin.""    Karpeles denies involvement  Tokyo-based Karpeles himself later responded on Twitter, with a denial:  Followers responded to Karpeles' newfound interactivity to fire questions at him about Mt Gox and its missing bitcoins. Karpeles answered that he still does not have the answers, and regards himself as much a victim of the alleged hack as Mt Gox's customers.  Karpeles later sent an extended statement to Motherboard, noting the Silk Road investigation had already concluded itself that he was not the ringleader.  ""This is why I am not the one sitting during the Silk Road trial,"" he said, suggesting that Ulbricht's defence team was merely trying to divert attention from its own client.    ""I have nothing to do with Silk Road and do not condone what has been happening there. I believe Bitcoin (and its underlying technology) is not meant to help people evade the law, but to improve everyone's way of life by offering never thought before possibilities.""          To clarify further, he wrote that a domain called silkroadmarket.org was registered by a customer of KalyHost.com, a service of his company and Mt Gox parent Tibanne.  The trial commenced on 13th January, where in his opening statement Dratel said Ulbricht was the creator of the Silk Road. He argued, however, that Ulbricht ultimately handed off responsibility to another entity, who framed him once law enforcement began to investigate the online black market.  As such, the news of Karpeles' implication in the trial is just the latest twist in what has already proven to be a case filled with surprising revelations.

42377941,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVij,1421350819,Vogogo Cuts Fraud Mitigation Costs in Industry Awareness Bid,"The recent $5m hack at leading bitcoin exchange Bitstamp may be evidence that fraud remains a pressing concern in the bitcoin business community.  However, according to Vogogo CSO Rodney Thompson, the industry has yet to make a concerted effort to embrace solutions that can help mitigate that risk, which he described as dire given its proven ability to sink bitcoin businesses.  He is hoping to add pressure that conversation, announcing that Vogogo will offer its fraud and risk management services as a standalone to all cryptocurrency businesses, and that it will waive the costs associated with the integration of the offering.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Thompson asserted that Vogogo is seeking to provide the offering at a reduced cost to help ensure the long-term health of the ecosystem, and by extension, the company’s current and future customer base.  He said:  “Unless more companies are willing to help different crypto-businesses set up and deal with crypto-transactions, too many of these businesses are going to be compromised. It’s important for Vogogo for this vertical to be very healthy. Our profits come on a per-transaction basis, but we need businesses in the crypto-industry to be able to transact.”  Thompson went on to attack the notion that bitcoin entrepreneurs can rely on the inherent security offered by bitcoin during the transaction process, citing the demonstrated abilities and resourcefulness of fraudsters.  “Sophisticated fraud will always be at your doorstep,” Thompson said. “If something happens, you have to be able to deal with it in real time while it’s happening.”  Vogogo customers will be able to use the company’s services for three months free of charge, and with no future obligation.  The announcement comes just months after Vogogo raised $8.5m in new funding last summer as part of an effort to bring its services to businesses outside of its home market of Canada.  Hands-on training  As part of the onboarding process, Thompson said that Vogogo will also teach cryptocurrency businesses how to use its fraud mitigation tools, which he said can deal with fraud in real time during the fiat-to-crypto transaction.  However, he stressed that unlike other solutions, Vogogo strives to make the information that its tools provide actionable.  “If someone makes a suspicious transaction, and does it two or three times, you’ll know you’re in the middle of a [fraud] ring. This isn’t about mailing us your utility bill, these are the things that are done in real time and that are automated,” he said.  He went on to frame these tools as necessary, given that single incidents can cost companies thousands of dollars at a time when many are still striving to reach wider audiences on limited budgets.  Crypto focus  Thompson also stressed that Vogogo's offering is unique in that its solutions are designed for the digital currency ecosystem regardless of the specific cryptocurrency being used.  As such, the CSO further described ongoing events in the industry – in bitcoin and beyond – as disappointing given that the tools to reduce fraud are already available.  “It’s also frustrating as we believe these types of sophisticated fraud events can be effectively prevented with the right systems in place,” he added.  Current Vogogo clients include CoinTrader, ANXPro, Rock Trading and more.

42377926,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LVXP,1421341810,Ciphrex Raises $500k to Advance Multisig Wallet Offering,"Cryptocurrency security firm Ciphrex has completed a successful A-Series funding round, raising $500,000 (£327,934)      Six accredited investors took part in the round, according to the company, but they wished their participation to remain private.      Enrique Lombrozo, co-CEO and chief operations officer, said:      “We are glad to announce we’ve met our goal of raising half-a-million dollars in this initial round. We raised $300k immediately, back in October 2014, and then we raised the remaining $200k in the last few weeks. These funds will allow us to further advance, promote and expand our line of products.”              Ciphrex's product line includes mSIGNA and CoinSocket. The former is a multisig wallet application which supports offline keychain generation, offline signing, multi-device synchronisation, account management and multiple blockchains.      The wallet works in conjunction with CoinSocket, an application development platform that allows the secure management of multisig accounts for businesses.      When asked about his recent fundraising efforts, Lombrozo said:      ""We feel fantastic! That's all we need to get us to round B. We are working on our business plan for the next stage and will be ready to offer a Series-B in the next few months.""            Bitcoin draws venture capital    The news comes after CoinDesk's State of Bitcoin report found that bitcoin venture capital investment surpassed that of early stage Internet investment last year.      BitPay and Blockchain both completed successful A-rounds in 2014, respectively raising $30m and $30.5m in May and October. Notably, the Blockchain round was the largest ever single investment made in a bitcoin company.      In total, bitcoin firms raised $314.7m in 2014, representing a 3.3-fold increase over the previous year.    North America, which has been receiving venture capital investment in bitcoin since 2012/13, is still the place to be for startups trying to raise cash.  The growth of multisig  After many notable hacks in the space, a high emphasis is currently being placed on security when it comes to bitcoin storage.  Multisig is increasingly being seen as a more secure option since, rather than merely requiring a single password, it needs 'm of n' keys to authorise a transaction. 'M of n' might be two of three, or three of five, or more, depending on the levels of security required.  When Ethereum recently required a more secure solution for storing bitcoins raised in their crowdsale, the decision was taken to use Ciphrex's multisig solution.    When asked about the issue, Lombrozo commented:      ""Security is the primary concern for financial transactions. Ciphrex's platform provides a general m-of-n multisig account management architecture supporting bitcoin and other altcoins.""            Will O'Brien, CEO and co-founder of BitGo, a bitcoin security company and pioneer in multi-signature technologies, examined bitcoin security trends in a previous CoinDesk article and noted that ""2014 was a pivotal year in bitcoin security"" due to the wider acceptance of multisig.  He pointed out that there had been a 79-fold increase in daily multisig transactions over the last year and that exchanges had now started to adopt the technology.  However, ""we still need more adoption of multisig as an industry"", he concluded.

42398140,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWUO,1421337618,Xapo Looks to Outer Space in Latest Bitcoin Security Push,"The normally tight-lipped bitcoin services provider Xapo has announced a slew of new updates focused on bolstering its security offerings.  Though the move allows the company to remove fees for its signature vault storage service, adding multi-signature authorization to that offering and completing a Service Organization Control 2 (SOC2) Type I Audit. But it is perhaps its partnership with Silicon Valley startup Satellogic that showcases the extent to which it seeks to secure the bitcoin it holds for customers.  Today Xapo announced it will work with Satellogic to locate specific elements of its security architecture within a low Earth orbit satellite that its partner aims to use to take high-quality images in real time. Though it didn’t elaborate further on the measure, citing security reasons, Xapo suggested that the ability to maintain data as well as physical and jurisdictional security were key elements that encouraged the deal.  CEO Wences Casares explained that the measures are all aimed at increasing the company’s security, which he suggested is paramount in light of the industry's continued security struggles.  He told CoinDesk:  ”A lot of the people who have large amounts of bitcoin, that’s what they care about most – security. Nothing is more important to security than keeping private keys offline. We’ve seen the problems of that recently, you can keep them offline but when you bring them online, that’s when compromises happen.”  Sattelogic CEO Emiliano Kargieman also explained that with the partnership his company aims to showcase the power of its technology to new markets.  ""Our partnership with Xapo allows us to showcase the integration of our satellite platform into mission-critical, daily processes in the financial industry, while we play a key role in helping the company develop the most secure storage service in the bitcoin space,"" Kargieman told CoinDesk.  Xapo's emphasis on security is not surprising given that at launch it was billed as “bitcoin’s Fort Knox"", a reference to the famous US bullion depository.  However, it could be seen as a return to the company’s original value proposition, as 2014 saw Xapo introduce a number of features in addition to its service aimed at more everyday bitcoin users, including hot wallet accounts, a dedicated tipping button and bitcoin debit cards for international users.  Offline security still necessary  The announcement positions Xapo as an advocate for offline storage at a time when other companies in the bitcoin security sector are seeking to move away from such offerings.  For example, bitcoin security services provider BitGo has called for the widespread adoption of multisig wallets as an alternative that will allow users both security and usability while preserving the digital nature of the bitcoin currency.  However, Casares indicated that Xapo sees a bitcoin ecosystem where there is still demand for cold storage solutions.  “I think that they are different things,” he said. “It’s like saying in the world you only need checking accounts – that’s not true, you also need savings accounts.”  Framing Xapo’s vault accounts as savings accounts, Casares said his company’s main competition in the consumer market is not with any bitcoin service provider, but with homemade cold storage solutions.  Further, he said the vault service is also a bid to attract new markets, such as larger institutional investors that may see an opportunity given the current price of bitcoin.  “We also see a lot of large investors that are on the verge of investing in bitoin, but their main concern is how to keep it safe,” Casares added.  Refunds for vault users  It's not only new customers that will benefit from the changes to the Xapo Vault’s pricing. The company pledged that existing customers who have previously paid annual storage fees will now receive pro-rated discounts along with the improved features.  The merger of multisig and cold storage has also resulted in what the company dubbed “deep cold storage”, which aims to utilize custom servers, as well as three-of-five multi-signature transaction authorization, in what it called an industry first.  “Xapo’s deep cold storage security architecture means that private keys are created, stored, and maintained offline, in servers that have never and will never touch a network, even when used to sign transactions,” the company said.  It further indicated that deep cold storage would use radio wave-blocking Faraday cages, “military-grade security controls” and be stored in “reinforced underground bunkers” at its Switzerland facility.  Xapo added that it expects to make further improvements to its security architecture in 2015. Its SOC2 audit was conducted by Burr, Pilger & Mayer LLP.

42398127,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWHb,1421329825,Bitcoin's Price Drop in the Headlines,"The fact that bitcoin is endowed with a somewhat volatile nature does not come as a surprise to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, who saw it soar beyond $1,000 in late 2013, only to see it diminish in value again throughout 2014, and drop a further 40% at the beginning of this year.  What happened in the early hours of yesterday, however, caused shockwaves far beyond the bitcoin community. The price crashed from $224 at midnight to around $175 (a drop of almost 22%) in just a matter of hours, before rebounding again.  Unsurprisingly, the drop in value has set off a whirlwind of conversation about the future of bitcoin, both from within and outside the community.  Twitter  was awash with comments throughout the whole of yesterday, as bitcoiners and commentators pondered the causes and potential ramifications of the drop.  The mainstream media has also reacted, acknowledging the extreme price movements and predicting the potential effect on the cryptocurrency's future with varying degrees of level-headedness or hysteria.  So, what did they say? CoinDesk has rounded some up of the top headlines from yesterday.  The moderate view  Unsurprisingly, there was no real consensus across publications. While some prophesied that the future of bitcoin was bleak, others took more measured views.  The New York Times ran with, ""As Bitcoin's Price Slides, Signs of a Squeeze"", in which Sydney Ember commented that confidence was dwindling, and stating that ""some mining companies have started to flash the warning signs.""  As the price of bitcoin drops, and difficulty stays relatively high, mining companies are left to assess their dwindling profit margins.  Mashable's Seth Fiegerman explained that CEX.io, which runs a cloud mining service, had been ""forced to suspend operations due to the declining prices presumably cutting into profit margins"".  The Guardian's piece, titled ""Bitcoin price plunge sparks new crash fears"", distinguishes between what is currently happening from what occurred in the summer of 2011 and 2013:  ""This time the cryptocurrency has not been the victim of a speculative bubble that then popped. Rather, the price of bitcoin has been declining fairly consistency since June 2014, when it started falling after months of temporary stability at about $600 a coin.""  CNBC's Everett Rosenfeld  , draws on recent events to explain the possible reasoning behind the current price drop, putting forward the argument that cryptocurrency speculators may have been spooked by the Bitstamp hack which saw the loss of $5m in bitcoins.  The ban imposed on bitcoin-related websites by the Russian authorities may also be a contributing factor, he said.  Doom and gloom  FT Alphaville  's report reads almost like a bitcoin obituary and, in a rather surprising twist, draws on an analogy with one of George Orwell's most famous books.  ""With Animal Farm in mind, has Bitcoin the asset’s failure thus shone a light on a system which routinely propagandises the benefits of sharing intellectual property for free while rewarding only those who live by entirely different principles?""  It also goes on to question whether ""bitcoin really represented something akin to perestroika, a political movement for reform which in reality only benefitted a select bunch of shrewd operators"".  One of the most negative positions is perhaps put forward by The Sydney Morning Herald, which described bitcoin's entry into 2015 as ""appalling,"" claiming that the currency ""appears to be in freefall"".  The Australian newspaper also alludes to the fact that some are crediting the market's instability to the notable Trial of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, which began in New York City yesterday.  Looking on the bright side  TechCrunch's John Biggs throws some positivity into the mix with the headline ""The Rainbow After the Bitcoin Storm"". Although he acknowledges that the current value ""is a far cry from the heady $1,000 days of late 2013,"" he also asserts that ""unlike Robert Redford's sailing trip, all is not lost"".  Timothy B Lee, over at Vox, claims that ""Bitcoin has already fallen 40 percent this year. That doesn't mean it's doomed"".  Jerry Brito, executive director at Coin Center, has his say in a Wired article, opining that:  ""The price of bitcoin doesn't matter right now.""  Shifting focus away from the price, Brito compares bitcoin to the early days of the Internet and its positive evolution throughout the years:  ""Unlike the early web, bitcoin has a price ticker people look at daily, and so they wring their hands. Every dip and spike in the price gets a lot of attention and spells either doom or irrational exuberance.”  Only time will tell what the future holds for bitcoin. At the time of press, however, the price had returned to around $224, and was largely recovered from yesterday's dip.

42398142,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWWM,1421319861,Coinplug to Roll Out World's Biggest Convenience Store Bitcoin Scheme,"UPDATE (16th January 01:18 GMT): Coinplug wishes to clarify to Korean readers that, while users can request to buy bitcoins over-the-counter at 7-11 stores now, the physical okBitcards will be available from the end of February.  South Korean bitcoin services company Coinplug is rolling out a pre-paid bitcoin purchasing service to around 24,000 convenience stores across the country, with 8,000 7-Eleven stores already participating.  The company says its 'okBitcard' service will be on sale in other major chains by the end of January. With those numbers, it will be the most widespread distribution of its kind in the world to date.  Physical cards will be printed at the end of February with fiat values of 10,000, 30,000 and 50,000 South Korean won (approximately $10, $30 and $50). To protect against theft and deal with bitcoin's unpredictable price, the cards are activated only at point-of-sale.  Until the cards are ready, customers may ask cashiers directly to purchase bitcoin at the counter, upon which they can receive a printed receipt with redeemable PIN code.  okBitcard comes hot on the heels of another convenience store-based service in Asia: BitoEX's integration with 5,000 in-store kiosks in Taiwan. By selling physical cards, Coinplug is eliminating the need for customers to learn how to use the kiosks or use SMS messages to authenticate purchases.  Winning over newcomers  Coinplug  's Richard Yun told CoinDesk that the cards make bitcoin easier for the average consumer to buy, potentially winning over newcomers who might find the experience of buying bitcoin through an online exchange or face-to-face daunting.  Yun said:  ""When users redeem okBitcards, they automatically get an instant wallet. It's good for people who find it hard to buy BTC like teenagers, and buying for gifts etc.""  The process works as follows: A customer purchases a card over the counter and the cashier prints out a receipt with an individual PIN code. The purchaser then redeems the bitcoin using either the okBitcard mobile app or the okBitcard website.  The physical card itself, therefore, represents fiat value only and does not need to carry any bitcoin value. Coinplug's exchange issues the required amount of digital currency when the card is redeemed.  Other companies in Asia, such as Singapore's CoinPip and Malaysia's Cryptomarket, have sold cards pre-loaded with bitcoin value, albeit on a smaller scale.  As well as putting bitcoin front and center in mainstream view, the cards are a means of easily acquiring bitcoins in smaller amounts, and of transferring bitcoin value from person to person without needing a wallet or Internet connection.

Its Android wallets can now send and receive bitcoin via NFC on compatible devices, rather than with QR codes.  Coinplug is also launching its second locally produced bitcoin ATM, made by bank ATM manufacturer Nautilus Hyosung. The machine will be located in the public foyer of Korea University's computer science department, which held a bitcoin forums for its students in September last year.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/15/coinplug-to-roll-out-worlds-biggest-convenience-store-bitcoin-scheme,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15c67aa8b915d1aa5c8f1a9228dbf4c543c4ce0d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
