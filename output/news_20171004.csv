42427831,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4K7h,1507155892,GAW Miners CEO Held Liable for $9.8 Million Judgment in SEC Case,"A US federal judge has signed off on a final judgment against Homero Josh Garza, the CEO of the now-defunct cryptocurrency mining firm GAW Miners.  The judgment, entered on October 4, comes less than two years after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first filed suit against Garza, GAW Miners and ZenMiner, a related firm. Garza was accused and charged with violating securities laws through the offering of so-called ""Hashlets,"" or ""virtual miners"" which were sold to customers through an internal exchange.  Today's judgment follows a guilty plea from Garza, given in July, in a related criminal case pursued by the U.S. Justice Department. Garza plead guilty to a single wire fraud charge and faces sentencing early next year.  In the SEC's civil case, Garza has been held liable for $9,182,000, an amount that the court order said will be ""deemed satisfied by the order of restitution that will be entered against him when he is sentenced in the related criminal case."" It comes after the agency won a default judgment against GAW Miners and ZenMiner for $11 million in disgorged profits and civil penalties.  GAW Miners, prior to its collapse, previously offered hosted mining services. It later moved into the cloud mining business, through which customers can purchase hash power generated by hardware owned by the miner. But in the case of GAW, the firm didn't actually possess as much hash power as it sold – prompting a harsh rebuke from federal prosecutors in their original complaint from December 2015.  ""Though cloaked in technological sophistication and jargon, defendants' fraud was simple at its core – defendants sold what they did not own, and misrepresented the nature of what they were selling,"" they wrote at the time.

42379953,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LMht,1507150847,SEC Chair 'Optimistic' on Efforts to Catch ICO Bad Guys,"The nature of initial coin offerings (ICOs) makes it harder to catch fraudsters compared to penny-stock scams, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) told a Congressional committee today.  Jay Clayton appeared before the House Financial Services Committee during a session dedicated to the SEC. The event covered a range of topics, including a hack of the ageny’s corporate filing system, EDGAR, last year.  Yet just after the recess, Congressman Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) asked about Clayton’s position on ICOs, remarking that “it reminds me of the old days with these penny stocks.”  Clayton – who said last week that he is ""concerned"" about the risk of the funding use case being used to facilitate pump-and-dump frauds – echoed those comments, stating that he believes his agency is up to the task of policing token sales.  He told the committee:  “I’m cautiously optimistic about the division’s enforcement of this. They know this is a ripe area for pump-and-dump. Pump-and-dump – it’s actually easier here than it is in the penny stock area, because it’s all electronic, it’s all anonymous, [and] it’s harder to catch the bad guys at the end of the day.”  The SEC chair also suggested that the prevalence of potential fraud could hamper wider adoption of the tech in capital markets. Outside of the ICO use case – through which startups or other parties can issue cryptographic tokens in an effort to fund or bootstrap a new blockchain network – market operators have looked at the tech as potential replacements for existing trading and post-settlement systems.  But according to Clayton, that work could be impaired – particularly in the absence of wider education on the risks involved with ICOs.  “It’s going to be a lot harder to get the benefits of this kind of technology, technological advancement,"" said Clayton.

Axel Weber, who previously served as head of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, made the remarks during an event in Zürich earlier today, according to Reuters.  After noting that his skepticism toward the cryptocurrency ""probably comes from my background as a central banker,"" Weber argued that in spite of arguments to the contrary, bitcoin only partially satisfies the common definition of a currency.  He told event attendees:  ""The important function of a currency is, it’s a means of payment, it has to be generally accepted, it has to be a store of value and it’s a transaction currency. Bitcoin is only a transaction currency.""  Weber reportedly criticized the cryptocurrency market back in late 2015, according to a report at the time from City A.M. He is said to have remarked that the bitcoin model is set to fail ""because there is no lender of last resort – there will always be boom and bust.""  The UBS chairman becomes the latest figure from a major financial institution to weigh in on the topic of cryptocurrencies.

42379959,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LMlf,1507138201,Ethereum Client Update Sets Byzantium Hard Fork Date,"Ethereum's most popular client has upgraded its code to enforce the upcoming Byzantium upgrade set for later this month.  The code from Go Ethereum (Geth) officially enshrines the hard fork for block number 4,370,000, a time previously established by developers during an ethereum core team discussion on September 22. With the Geth release, the network moves closer to implementing the first of two parts in the wider Metropolis upgrade. The addition of the code to Geth is notable because it greatly increases the likelihood that the upgrade will happen at that time.  Geth, which is maintained by developers employed by the Ethereum Foundation (the Swiss nonprofit that manages development on ethereum more broadly), accounts for roughly 69 percent of all ethereum nodes, according to data from Ethernodes.org.  If the block time remains consistent between now and then, the hard fork – which will make previous versions incompatible with the wider ethereum network following the upgrade trigger – will officially occur on October 17.  Anyone running a ethereum node with Geth is requested to update their software to ""ensure a smooth transition,"" the code release states.  In a reddit post accompanying the release, ethereum developer Peter Szilágyi advised node operators to update their software at least a week prior to the mainnet launch. Other clients, such as Mist, will issue updates in the coming dates, Szilágyi predicted.  ""Please give yourselves ample time to switch to the 1.7.x series (1.7.1 specifically for Byzantium) before the hard fork to avoid any surprises as the series does contain non-trivial database optimizations ([it] also gives us time to fix anything if something doesn't work as it should),"" he commented.  The code release comes in spit of the recent spam attacks on the Ropsten test network, though those interruptions were not enough to deter ethereum developers from the work on testing Byzantium.  As previously detailed by CoinDesk, the upcoming hardfork, which is the first part of a larger upgrade planned for the platform, will feature a variety of improvements including increased speed and ramified security. Certain changes may also eventually pave way to increase privacy on the ethereum blockchain.

42379954,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LMj9,1507133708,OneCoin Promoter Targeted By Finnish Police in Ongoing Investigation,"A police investigation in Finland into the OneCoin cryptocurrency investment scheme is accelerating.  The Finnish Broadcasting Company reports that, according to law enforcement officials in the city of Österbotten, an as-yet-unnamed OneCoin promoter is now the subject of an ""economic crime case.""  ""The...damage is over half a million euros,"" said Antti Perälä, an official with the city police who is leading the investigation.  As many as 20,000 residents of Finland have invested in the scheme, which sees promoters selling packages of ""tokens"" that can then be redeemed for OneCoins through a centralized, online website. The OneCoin promoter is one of two individuals that are the subject of the financial crimes investigation, according to police sources.  The investigation, revealed in August, is actually the second OneCoin-related inquiry launched in the country to date. A previous one, according to BehindMLM, was conducted by national authorities before ending with no charges filed.  Countries like Germany and India have moved in recent months to crack down on the scheme, which has been widely criticized as a fraudulent pyramid scheme, and regulators elsewhere have issued warnings to investors as well.  Notably, the Österbotten police official predicted that a wider investigation into OneCoin could be launched jointly between several law enforcement agencies within Europe or beyond.  ""If there is a crime investigation around OneCoin, it will be bigger and involve several countries, in my opinion,"" Perälä said.

42379964,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LMvj,1507130117,"Ripple Price Consolidates, But Could It 'Swell' Higher?","The cryptocurrency that powers Ripple's XRP ledger is showing signs it may be consolidating ahead of a boost.  At press time, the XRP-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate seems to be building a base around $0.20-levels. The third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has gained 2.56 percent in the last 24 hours.  Elsewhere, Ripple news was quiet, and no major news was observable on its major channels and company forums. But, while week-on-week XRP is trading dead flat, it's possible traders see opportunity in an upcoming event sponsored by Ripple.  Notably, this month, Ripple is to host ""Swell"" – an event aimed at bringing the world's financial leaders together to network and discuss trends and strategies. Swell will go head-to-head with Sibos, Swift's annual banking and financial conference scheduled for October 16–19 in Toronto, Canada, and bring in speakers including World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee.  As search volumes have shown to be heavily correlated with cryptocurrency price activity, this could foreshadow brighter days ahead for the XRP/USD exchange rate.  Still, it's possible that ripple is simply trading sideways alongside the general market.  Daily chart  Our daily chart shows:  The bullish break of the falling channel on September 25 was followed by a higher-highs/higher-lows (rising channel) pattern.  A bullish crossover between the 50-day moving average and 100-day moving average was confirmed on October 2.  View  XRP looks set to revisit $0.23–$0.24 levels in the short term. A break below $0.1984 (confluence of 100-day moving average and rising channel support) would abort the short-term bullish view.  A bullish-to-bearish trend change would be confirmed if XRP drops below $0.188 (September 29 low).

15989271,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/12-month-forecast-bitcoin,1507128215,"12 Month Forecast For Bitcoin, What Do We See","If you have invested in Bitcoins, you are likely to be keeping a close eye on the price. But, just what have the experts predicted for Bitcoin for the coming year, and overall long term? For the most part, experts are predicting big things for Bitcoin. Many believe that we are not even close to hitting the tip of the iceberg, and that great things are set to happen. So, are there any predicted troughs along the way? Read on to find out what the experts think. The Good: The majority of experts have predicted great things for Bitcoin. Anyone in the industry will agree that masterluc is something of a legend in the Bitcoin community, so when he has predicted that Bitcoin will reach $15,000 by the end of this year, people are listening. He has gained this reputation as being a Bitcoin oracle, after he called the top of the Bitcoin bubble in November 2013. He has since predicted that not only will Bitcoin reach $15,000 before the year is out, but it will also reach between $40,000-$110,000 by the end of the bull run – something that he feels will be by the end of 2019. Ronnie Moas, the founder of Standpoint Research has mirrored masterluc’s prediction of success. Although, he looks further into the future, noting that despite Bitcoin being more than three times more valuable than gold, we are only at the very tip of the iceberg, and predicts the prices to soar to $15,000-$20,000 in the next three years. Kay Van-Petersen, a Saxo Bank analyst predicts that the market capitalisation of Bitcoin could grow to $1.75 trillion, making each Bitcoin worth $100,000. Although this is longer term than other experts, as he is looking across a ten-year period, he has made successful predictions before. He is assuming that all cryptocurrencies will account for 10% of the ADV of fiat currency trade in 10 years, and this currently stands at over $5trillion. Ten percent of this is $500 billion, and he has predicted that Bitcoin will account for 35% of this share, which would bring Bitcoin total up to $175billion. So, when you consider that there will be approximately 17 million Bitcoin’s in circulation in ten years’ time, each Bitcoin will be worth over $100,000. He is very quick to add that he feels that Bitcoin is here to stay, stating, “This is not a fad, cryptocurrencies are here to stay”. Other experts, such as Alena Vranova and Vinny Linghm echo this, agreeing that the price of Bitcoin is set to rise. Vranova believe that the price could rise quicker than expected if more countries begin to legalise it. Linghm agrees with this statement, and suggests that there are three main reasons that the price will rise. These are; the rising venture capital investments in blockchain technology, a huge number of Bitcoin acceptance and finally, the limited supply of Bitcoin. He has also made a statement saying that he has a “strong belief” in Bitcoin, and does not consider Ethereum to be the biggest competitor. The Bad: Unfortunately, not all experts are predicting big things for Bitcoin, and some have predicted pit falls that the cryptocurrency could fall into. Obviously, Bitcoin suffered a small set back when China banned cryptocurrency, and although it quickly recovered, other milestones like this could have a negative impact on the currency as a whole. Thomas Glucksmann, who is head of APAC business development ultimately believes that in a year, the price of Bitcoin is likely to have increased; however, he has warned investors that they should get themselves ready for volatility in November. He believes the cause of this will be because some investors in the Bitcoin community might move to reject SegWit2X, which could create another split in Bitcoin, and potentially create another cryptocurrency, thus affecting the current price of Bitcoin. Alena Vranova, has predicted another possible outcome for Bitcoin, and unfortunately, it does not fare as well as the previous one. Vranova predicted that if there is any negativity within Bitcoin, such as volatility or restricted legislation, the price might crash to just $50 per Bitcoin. Obviously, this is a huge difference to earlier predictions, but goes to show how majorly something can affect the cryptocurrency. The Ugly: Finally, it is important to recognise that not everyone sees Bitcoin being as successful as others do. Mark Cuban; founder of MicroSolutions and Broadcast.com has recently attacked Bitcoin on Twitter, making claims that it is not a currency, merely a bubble. His Tweets included; “I think it’s in a bubble. I just don’t know how much it corrects. When everyone is bragging about how east they are making $=bubble”. His main complaint comes with the fact that it is not Bitcoin that is successful, rather the blockchain that surrounds it. He backs up his opinion further by stating that currencies have to be stable in order to be reliable, which he does not believe Bitcoin to be, saying; “Just because Bitcoin’s exchange rate has reached thousands of dollars, this doesn’t mean that anyone would be willing to give you thousands of dollars for your Bitcoin.”. Peter Schiff, who is an investor who predicted the 2008 mortgage crisis, mirrors the opinion of Cuban, and has likened Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a Ponzi scheme that has been built on “just plain greed”. He also feels that there is simply no way to predict what will happen to Bitcoin in the future as it is just so volatile. Finally, Tony Robbins closely follows Bitcoin, but is not completely sold at all, comparing an investment in the popular cryptocurrency to a trip to Vegas. He says, “I think [Bitcoin] is very iffy…I don’t have a clue. I look at that as it’s like going to Vegas”. He agrees that whilst some investments could make you a lot of money, they simply are not predictable or steady, advising investors to only invest what they can afford to lose.

He has since predicted that not only will Bitcoin reach $15,000 before the year is out, but it will also reach between $40,000-$110,000 by the end of the bull run – something that he feels will be by the end of 2019. Ronnie Moas, the founder of Standpoint Research has mirrored masterluc’s prediction of success. Although, he looks further into the future, noting that despite Bitcoin being more than three times more valuable than gold, we are only at the very tip of the iceberg, and predicts the prices to soar to $15,000-$20,000 in the next three years. Kay Van-Petersen, a Saxo Bank analyst predicts that the market capitalisation of Bitcoin could grow to $1.75 trillion, making each Bitcoin worth $100,000. Although this is longer term than other experts, as he is looking across a ten-year period, he has made successful predictions before. He is assuming that all cryptocurrencies will account for 10% of the ADV of fiat currency trade in 10 years, and this currently stands at over $5trillion. Ten percent of this is $500 billion, and he has predicted that Bitcoin will account for 35% of this share, which would bring Bitcoin total up to $175billion. So, when you consider that there will be approximately 17 million Bitcoin’s in circulation in ten years’ time, each Bitcoin will be worth over $100,000. He is very quick to add that he feels that Bitcoin is here to stay, stating, “This is not a fad, cryptocurrencies are here to stay”. Other experts, such as Alena Vranova and Vinny Linghm echo this, agreeing that the price of Bitcoin is set to rise. Vranova believe that the price could rise quicker than expected if more countries begin to legalise it. Linghm agrees with this statement, and suggests that there are three main reasons that the price will rise. These are; the rising venture capital investments in blockchain technology, a huge number of Bitcoin acceptance and finally, the limited supply of Bitcoin. He has also made a statement saying that he has a “strong belief” in Bitcoin, and does not consider Ethereum to be the biggest competitor. The Bad: Unfortunately, not all experts are predicting big things for Bitcoin, and some have predicted pit falls that the cryptocurrency could fall into. Obviously, Bitcoin suffered a small set back when China banned cryptocurrency, and although it quickly recovered, other milestones like this could have a negative impact on the currency as a whole. Thomas Glucksmann, who is head of APAC business development ultimately believes that in a year, the price of Bitcoin is likely to have increased; however, he has warned investors that they should get themselves ready for volatility in November. He believes the cause of this will be because some investors in the Bitcoin community might move to reject SegWit2X, which could create another split in Bitcoin, and potentially create another cryptocurrency, thus affecting the current price of Bitcoin. Alena Vranova, has predicted another possible outcome for Bitcoin, and unfortunately, it does not fare as well as the previous one. Vranova predicted that if there is any negativity within Bitcoin, such as volatility or restricted legislation, the price might crash to just $50 per Bitcoin. Obviously, this is a huge difference to earlier predictions, but goes to show how majorly something can affect the cryptocurrency. The Ugly: Finally, it is important to recognise that not everyone sees Bitcoin being as successful as others do. Mark Cuban; founder of MicroSolutions and Broadcast.com has recently attacked Bitcoin on Twitter, making claims that it is not a currency, merely a bubble. His Tweets included; “I think it’s in a bubble. I just don’t know how much it corrects. When everyone is bragging about how east they are making $=bubble”. His main complaint comes with the fact that it is not Bitcoin that is successful, rather the blockchain that surrounds it. He backs up his opinion further by stating that currencies have to be stable in order to be reliable, which he does not believe Bitcoin to be, saying; “Just because Bitcoin’s exchange rate has reached thousands of dollars, this doesn’t mean that anyone would be willing to give you thousands of dollars for your Bitcoin.”. Peter Schiff, who is an investor who predicted the 2008 mortgage crisis, mirrors the opinion of Cuban, and has likened Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a Ponzi scheme that has been built on “just plain greed”. He also feels that there is simply no way to predict what will happen to Bitcoin in the future as it is just so volatile. Finally, Tony Robbins closely follows Bitcoin, but is not completely sold at all, comparing an investment in the popular cryptocurrency to a trip to Vegas. He says, “I think [Bitcoin] is very iffy…I don’t have a clue. I look at that as it’s like going to Vegas”. He agrees that whilst some investments could make you a lot of money, they simply are not predictable or steady, advising investors to only invest what they can afford to lose.

Heavily critical of cryptocurrency exchanges, Xinhua said they had become a favourite among criminals across the world in an article today. Exchanges, it continued, are known to have ""concocted pyramid schemes"" and ""engaged in illegal activities"" – criminal activity ""disguised as scientific and technological innovation.""  The solution? These entities must be met with ""iron fist governance,"" according to the news agency, which also praised authorities' ""zero tolerance"" to the financial risks and illicit activities.  The article follows a statement by authorities in early September, which prohibited the sale of blockchain tokens as a method of fundraising. In the following month, a number of exchanges, citing the statement, announced they would voluntarily close their doors.  Xinhua argued that, even following the crackdown, there are still many ""regulatory vacuums"" that authorities need to address, in part because of the global use of cryptocurrencies.  Solutions suggested by the agency – which is often considered the voice of the government – include strengthening existing regulations and establishing a full regulatory framework for exchanges with specific requirements, such as a cap on large volume trading, ID verification, and know-your-customer and anti-money laundry procedures.

15990229,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/buy-bitcoin-live-uk,1507115227,How To Buy A Bitcoin If You Live In The UK,"It has not always been easy to purchase Bitcoins if you live in the UK, thanks to the strict rules and regulations surrounding the trading of cryptocurrency; but, the good news is that it has become easier than it once was. You have probably read about the advantages of trading Bitcoin, namely they speed at which you can send payments between countries and continents; however, in the UK, one of the main problems that we face is that traditional banking systems have not always caught up to this, which in turn, makes them very reluctant to service the Bitcoin companies. Like we said, it has got easier, as several UK exchanges have been launched in the past few years, which has allowed Brits to purchase Bitcoins, without having to send their money to a European bank, which is how many got around it before. So, what issues do we face? The main problem we face in the UK when it comes to purchasing Bitcoins is the British banks. They are so reluctant to service Bitcoin companies, which means that many companies are having to bank elsewhere in the UK; like we briefly mentioned above. Because of this, the buyer will often face lengthy delays in receiving their Bitcoins, not to mention the higher fees that they face for the international transfers. Often, you will have to wait between two to five days for your funds to arrive, which is not the speedy payments that you have heard about at all. The good news is though that the British government is slowly working to make the UK a cryptocurrency friendly environment. That said, many are debating whether a UK exchange that provides SEPA bank transfer actually offers many advantages, other than the fact that you can deposit in GBP. Regardless of this though, many new banking partnerships are being formed slowly, that allow Bitcoin exchanges to add local deposit options for customers in the UK. So, just wear can you turn if you want to buy Bitcoin and you are a UK resident? The first thing to bear in mind is just how volatile Bitcoin is. The price often climbs and drops again significantly in very short time frames, so before you buy any Bitcoins, and most certainly afterwards, you need to ensure that you are keeping a close eye on price charts. Most buyers will time their purchase well, and get Bitcoins when the value is low. Bitcoin Exchanges that cater for the UK: Bitcoin exchanges offer you a way to buy and sell Bitcoins and other currencies. Although this is one of the easiest ways to purchase Bitcoins, you need to take a few steps beforehand. For most exchanges, you will be required to register and provide a proof of residency and identity. This is for anti-money laundering purposes. You then need to set up your bank payment, that have been provided by the exchange, which allows you to fund your account and then begin to purchase your Bitcoins. Even though the UK is slowly moving towards a crypto friendly environment, you should avoid using the word, ‘Bitcoin’ in any payment references. Some banks are so reluctant to have anything to do with cryptocurrencies that they have even been known to shut down accounts. Bitstamp Bitstamp is a Slovenia based exchange that allows cash deposits via SEPA and eCheck. In January 2016, it announced that it will accept Visa and Mastercard payments for UK customers. Coinfloor Coinfloor is a Bitcoin exchange that is based in London. It places an emphasis on security, thanks to the 100% multi-signature cold storage for Bitcoin holdings. Coinfloor is an HMRC-approved bureau de change. There is a charge of £5 to deposit GBP and £10 to withdraw. Coinbase Coinbase is a popular exchange that has just introduced a facility for UK users to purchase Bitcoins. CoinCorner CoinCorner is an exchange that is based in Isle of Man, and is between a full exchange and a peer to peer marketplace. You can deposit funds into an account, and then buy and sell Bitcoins. No fees are charged on deposits, but there is a £10 fee for GBP withdrawals. Bitcoin Brokerages: Quickbitcoin This is a London based Bitcoin brokerage, which enables its customers to buy and sell Bitcoins in any amount. You can make deposits by UK Faster Payments, or by cash deposits at a bank. P2P Marketplaces: It is worth noting that there are a number of different peer to peer platforms that allow individuals to buy, sell and trade Bitcoins. These include, Bittylicious, BitBargain, LocalBitcoins, Coinfloor Market and CryptoMate. The above shows that there are a number of different avenues that you can go down if you are a UK resident who is looking to purchase Bitcoins, and it goes someway to show that the UK is becoming more welcoming to Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Over the last year, Bitcoin ATM’s have started to pop up around London and other areas, and in certain areas you can even purchase Bitcoin vouchers. This shows that it is becoming more accessible and that it is completely possible to purchase Bitcoins if you live in the UK.

You have probably read about the advantages of trading Bitcoin, namely they speed at which you can send payments between countries and continents; however, in the UK, one of the main problems that we face is that traditional banking systems have not always caught up to this, which in turn, makes them very reluctant to service the Bitcoin companies. Like we said, it has got easier, as several UK exchanges have been launched in the past few years, which has allowed Brits to purchase Bitcoins, without having to send their money to a European bank, which is how many got around it before. So, what issues do we face? The main problem we face in the UK when it comes to purchasing Bitcoins is the British banks. They are so reluctant to service Bitcoin companies, which means that many companies are having to bank elsewhere in the UK; like we briefly mentioned above. Because of this, the buyer will often face lengthy delays in receiving their Bitcoins, not to mention the higher fees that they face for the international transfers. Often, you will have to wait between two to five days for your funds to arrive, which is not the speedy payments that you have heard about at all. The good news is though that the British government is slowly working to make the UK a cryptocurrency friendly environment. That said, many are debating whether a UK exchange that provides SEPA bank transfer actually offers many advantages, other than the fact that you can deposit in GBP. Regardless of this though, many new banking partnerships are being formed slowly, that allow Bitcoin exchanges to add local deposit options for customers in the UK. So, just wear can you turn if you want to buy Bitcoin and you are a UK resident? The first thing to bear in mind is just how volatile Bitcoin is. The price often climbs and drops again significantly in very short time frames, so before you buy any Bitcoins, and most certainly afterwards, you need to ensure that you are keeping a close eye on price charts. Most buyers will time their purchase well, and get Bitcoins when the value is low. Bitcoin Exchanges that cater for the UK: Bitcoin exchanges offer you a way to buy and sell Bitcoins and other currencies. Although this is one of the easiest ways to purchase Bitcoins, you need to take a few steps beforehand. For most exchanges, you will be required to register and provide a proof of residency and identity. This is for anti-money laundering purposes. You then need to set up your bank payment, that have been provided by the exchange, which allows you to fund your account and then begin to purchase your Bitcoins. Even though the UK is slowly moving towards a crypto friendly environment, you should avoid using the word, ‘Bitcoin’ in any payment references. Some banks are so reluctant to have anything to do with cryptocurrencies that they have even been known to shut down accounts. Bitstamp Bitstamp is a Slovenia based exchange that allows cash deposits via SEPA and eCheck. In January 2016, it announced that it will accept Visa and Mastercard payments for UK customers. Coinfloor Coinfloor is a Bitcoin exchange that is based in London. It places an emphasis on security, thanks to the 100% multi-signature cold storage for Bitcoin holdings. Coinfloor is an HMRC-approved bureau de change. There is a charge of £5 to deposit GBP and £10 to withdraw. Coinbase Coinbase is a popular exchange that has just introduced a facility for UK users to purchase Bitcoins. CoinCorner CoinCorner is an exchange that is based in Isle of Man, and is between a full exchange and a peer to peer marketplace. You can deposit funds into an account, and then buy and sell Bitcoins. No fees are charged on deposits, but there is a £10 fee for GBP withdrawals. Bitcoin Brokerages: Quickbitcoin This is a London based Bitcoin brokerage, which enables its customers to buy and sell Bitcoins in any amount. You can make deposits by UK Faster Payments, or by cash deposits at a bank. P2P Marketplaces: It is worth noting that there are a number of different peer to peer platforms that allow individuals to buy, sell and trade Bitcoins. These include, Bittylicious, BitBargain, LocalBitcoins, Coinfloor Market and CryptoMate. The above shows that there are a number of different avenues that you can go down if you are a UK resident who is looking to purchase Bitcoins, and it goes someway to show that the UK is becoming more welcoming to Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Over the last year, Bitcoin ATM’s have started to pop up around London and other areas, and in certain areas you can even purchase Bitcoin vouchers. This shows that it is becoming more accessible and that it is completely possible to purchase Bitcoins if you live in the UK.

42379966,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LMuT,1507114904,Where SAFT Falls Short,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  In this opinion piece, his latest in a weekly series of columns, Casey offers qualified praise for the recently released SAFT framework and makes the case that legislative reforms are needed to deliver on the true promise of tokenization.  Who says only software developers can hack?  The team from Cooley LLC and Protocol Labs, which released the SAFT project white paper on Monday, makes a fine group of ""legal hackers.""  The SAFT (Special Agreement for Future Tokens) concept offers a clear-headed bridge solution to the real risk of legal action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a risk that threatens to disrupt the booming industry of crypto-token sales. The idea offers a compliant path for developers of token-based decentralized applications to responsibly raise the funds they need build out their platforms.  Still, for those of us who believe utility tokens have the potential to change economic paradigms, spur collaboration and innovation and incentivize people to develop and protect public goods and resources, there's something inherently disappointing about the SAFT concept.  First, a SAFT is deliberately set up as a security, which means that without going through the cumbersome, expensive and restrictive process of SEC registration, issuers can sell them only to ""accredited investors.""  This limits potential participants to those earning more than $200,000 annually or who have non-residential assets worth more than $1 million. Its arrival almost feels like an admission of failure, a step back from the goal of democratizing capital markets.  Ethics issue  Any crypto person worth their salt wants to empower the little guy.  They want to beat the Old Boys clubs of Wall Street and Silicon Valley, and boost the pool of reachable investors that developers of open-source protocols can tap to build self-perpetuating decentralized networks and forge the peer-to-peer economy of the future.  None other than Protocol Labs founder Juan Benet has put voice to this frustration.  In a July blog post announcing the SAFT-based sale of filecoin, a token intended to bootstrap the development of his Interplanetary File System, Benet said he wanted to ""personally say 'I'm sorry' to all of the people frustrated by the accreditation requirements.""  He lamented:  ""We wish we could make our upcoming token sale as broad as we possibly can.""  The problem is not the SAFT, of course, which is a sound compromise for letting founders fund development work without fear of being shut down, while protecting investors from fraudsters who would run off with their money. The problem is the law itself.  And that's where the SAFT Project may be most helpful. It could spur debate, not only about how to stay within existing regulations, but also on how to reform legislation to create a much broader, fairer and robust environment for funding innovation.  If that doesn’t happen, token issuers will find underground ways to raise money and set up shop in friendlier jurisdictions, limiting U.S. engagement in this industry and curtailing its potentially positive impact on the world.  Letter of the law  Founders who launch token sales – frequently described as initial coin offerings, or ICOs – tend to argue that their tokens provide functional ""utility,"" exempting them from securities registration. Since users need the tokens to access their platforms' services (or so they assert), their ICO offering documents often describe them as product akin to a negotiable membership ticket.  But the SAFT Project team makes the solid conclusion that in the pre-sale period – before a platform's network is developed and before users are actively exchanging tokens for services – many, if not all, ICOs would pass the SEC's benchmark Howey test for defining securities, especially its ""expectation of profit"" provision.  ""Purchasers in these direct presales tend to expect profit predominantly from the seller's efforts to create functionality in the token,"" the SAFT Project's white paper reads. ""As such, these sellers may unintentionally be selling securities, and may have failed to comply with several U.S. laws.""  The SAFT, defined as an investment contract, acts a legal bridge to solve this dilemma.  Once the platform has reached a point of functionality, the issuer delivers tokens to the SAFT investors, who can then sell them freely to the general public since they are, at that point, no longer considered securities. The structure may have the additional benefit of holding developers to account regarding their promise to build a platform, since they must wait until the second phase to sell their own tokens.  But there's no getting around the fact that, under a SAFT, it's wealthy investors that gain ground-floor entrance to the startups that may become the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of the future, not regular Joes in flyover states.  Level playing field  This is why legislative reform is needed.  It's not to say some protections for investors aren't needed. As compelling as the libertarian ""caveat emptor"" case can be, securities laws have evolved as they have because, after centuries of scams and exploitations dating back to the South Sea Bubble, societies have demanded them.  The problem is they've gone too far. After a decade of near-zero interest rates while hedge fund managers and venture capitalists made a killing, small investors are right to demand that they be allowed to invest in projects they believe in.  We also have an existing framework to improve upon: the JOBS Act.  As the name suggests, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 was initiated to spur growth during the sluggish recovery from the 2009 recession by giving startups access to a wider pool of funds. It required the SEC to write new rules that, among other things, allowed startups to tap crowdfunding mechanisms in equity financing rounds.  But once the crowdfunding rules came into effect in 2016, they included heavy restrictions. They capped the fundraising opportunities at $1 million per year per startup, limited individual investors earning less than $100,000 to a total investment of just $2,000 per year and imposed burdensome disclosure requirements on startups using the facility.  As a result, few have availed themselves of it.  Right direction  Given that the JOBS Act followed the biggest financial crisis in 80 years, the hesitation of lawmakers to go further wasn't surprising.  But the rules were developed before most people had any idea of blockchain technology, which offers new opportunities for transparency and accountability. Features such as proofs of reserves, multi-signatory escrow arrangements and open-source software development should, if properly used, bring new protections for investors, regardless of how rich they are, and mitigate the need for external restrictions.  People in the crypto community have an opportunity, in other words, to show just how much more secure capital raising could be under a fully auditable blockchain system that no centralized institution can undermine.  It will need a stronger self-regulatory approach in which best principles for token issuance are fostered by an ecosystem of analytics, ratings, founder registries, software audits and probing journalism.  If the SAFT idea takes off, we'll be best served if it ends up being more than just a way to stay compliant.  We should see it as a framework with which to promote a ICO model that's robust and secure yet open and fair, to ensure that the token economy evolves with the kind of wide public access that's needed if it is to fulfill its sweeping potential.

42379961,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LMoB,1507113037,Greek Court Backs Extradition of Alleged Bitcoin Exchange Operator to US,"A Greek court has backed a request that the alleged former operator of bitcoin exchange BTC-e should be extradited to the U.S. for trial.  The accused, Alexander Vinnik, is wanted in U.S. for allegedly operating the exchange without a license, and using it as a platform to launder money to the tune of $4 billion.  Soon after today's ruling, lawyers of the accused reportedly moved to appeal the decision.  According to Associated Press, Vinnik's lawyer, Alexandros Lykourezos, said: ""We have taken immediate action and appealed the ruling and the case will be examined by the criminal division of the Supreme Court.""  Speaking at his hearing today, Vinnik denied his role as the operator of BTC-e, claiming he had merely worked as a technician for the platform.  The News Tribune  reports that Vinnik told the court:  ""I have nothing to do with what I am accused of.""  The accused also claimed that the laptop seized during his arrest was in no way related to his employment, adding that it contained only children's cartoons for his family.  Vinnik was arrested in July while on holiday in Greece soon after the sudden closure of the BTC-e exchange by international law enforcement officials.  The Russian is also wanted for extradition to his home country in connection with the same crimes.  Greek courts have yet to make a formal decision on the request, although Vinnik's lawyers reportedly said in today's appeal that they had no plans to contest extradition to Russia.  Vinnik's wife, Alexandra, previously told RT she thought U.S. extradition would be ""weird,"" as the accused had neither lived nor worked in the country.

42379951,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LMgd,1507111233,When Not If? Banks Strike Optimistic Tone on Blockchain Impact,"""We are in the process of developing a new operating system for the planet.""  The remark, issued by Barclays' vice chairman of corporate banking, Jeremy Wilson, perhaps summed up the scope and tenor of discussion at the Blockchain for Finance conference yesterday. Held in Dublin, the event played host to participants more at home in suits than hoodies, though the mood was no less enthusiastic than if it was packed with developers.  Leading off with a panel of C-Suite executives from large financial institutions, it was here Wilson issued his positioning statement, one that added to the outlooks of other panelists assembled to provide a top-down view of blockchain work originating in the financial sector.  However, if Wilson appeared awe-struck at the enormity of the promise of blockchain and distributed ledger applications, he was equally critical of the work the industry is doing to assess ethical and moral dimensions of the coming impact.  Emmanuel Aidoo, director of blockchain at Credit Suisse, also hinted at fragile complexities. He likened the integration of blockchain into financial processes to a game of Jenga – you pull out the blocks from the bottom and hope that the tower doesn't crumble.  But while few details about live implementations were forthcoming, all participants mentioned specific projects their institutions had undertaken. And, in contrast to years past, Wilson wasn't a lone voice on the panel remarking on the potential of what is to come when – not if – these projects come to fruition.  Hadley Stern, senior vice president of Fidelity Lab, told attendees:  ""Asking us that is as if Tim Berners-Lee had just developed HTTP and you're asking us if the internet will change the world.""  Tip of the iceberg  The rest of the day's panels included discussions on trade finance, identity and cross-border payments, with almost all on stage emphasizing the potential for blockchain and the challenges in determining where to start.  Xavier Laurent, blockchain lead from Credit Agricole CIB, warned against trying to address the whole value chain at once, while Gadi Ruschin, CEO of blockchain startup Waves, agreed that digitizing a complete process is not realistic today.  Given the prevailing sense of caution, it is not surprising that most panels conveyed a mix of frustration at the complexity of the systemic and technological limitations. One theme that came up frequently was that of regulation, with Jean Devambez of BNP Paribas pointing out that there are more questions than answers for how legal frameworks will adjust to the capabilities of blockchain.  This is especially evident when it comes to the problem of identity on the blockchain, noted Anne-Marie Bohan, partner at law firm Matheson, arguing that the use case will be held up in the short-term, for legal rather than technological reasons.  As Oliver Naegele, founder and CEO of Blockchain Helix, explained, regulators tend to be technology neutral – rather, it is the processes and the protections that they care about. Elsewhere, their evolving role was also food for thought, shedding light on new responsibilities and expectations.  Tod McKenna, COO of Prudential, said:  ""The key question is, what is the role of the regulator in this new world?""  Small steps  But these questions didn't go entirely unanswered.  Also present were representatives from global lawmaking bodies. For example, in the closing panel, Peteris Zilgalvis of the European Commission talked about how the political arm of the 28-nation bloc might approach regulation going forward.  Notably, Zilgalvis expressed his desire to combine a cautious approach with a desire to identify and get ahead of the issues that need addressing.  As well as enhancing supervisory convergence and expanding supervision, Zilgalvis hinted at an increasing focus on the development of a coherent infrastructure.  In an intriguing indication of further work to come, he alluded to yet another regulatory tangle – that of self-executing pieces of blockchain code called smart contracts, concluding:  ""Smart contracts might need regulation if we want to make them legally binding.""  As the comments show, far from being merely caught in the blockchain wave, financial incumbents and regulators appear to be charting their course.

Bank of Montreal (BMO), CaixaBank, Commerzbank and Erste Group are now taking part in the project, which is being built on top of the open-source Hyperledger Fabric framework. The platform, dubbed Batavia, was first unveiled in September 2016 at the Sibos banking conference in Geneva.  The idea behind the project is to build a system through which international trade transactions can be carried out from start to finish. Instead of paper-based letters of credit, trade finance transactions would be executed through smart contracts – self-executing pieces of code that trigger when certain conditions are met, instead.  Speaking last year to CoinDesk, Beat Bannwart, UBS's head of product and market development for transaction banking, said that the primary intent was to link the parties involved over the course of a trade transaction more seamlessly.  ""We looked at it from a transaction banking point of view, so we involved people from trade, from supply chain finance. But the aim was actually to combine all these different steps into one single solution, where the entire business flow is covered,"" he said at the time.  Those behind the Batavia project are aiming to start a test phase involving customers sometime early next year.

Beginning almost as soon as development began on the Ropsten testnet, the disruptions come at a time when developers are testing new code called Byzantium, an upcoming hard fork that will ring in the platform's third stage of development.  However, despite the fact that the hard fork is planned for October 17, developers say there's no reason to believe the attacker will delay time-sensitive work. That's not to say there couldn't be complications, though.  During a test period, ethereum developers use an alternate version of the blockchain to test the accuracy of new code. Ropsten is one of three, but it's an important one as it is the only testnet which allows both main ethereum clients, Geth and Parity. In short, unlike other testnets that are meant for more experimental features, Ropsten is unique in that it mimics the proof-of-work consensus model popularized by bitcoin and that ethereum uses today.  Looking for another option, the spam attack has pushed some developers into a more secure test environment, Rinkeby, though this appears as though it could have implications for the work.  Speaking in an online forum, Raiden developer Lefteris Karapetsas touched on the issue, describing Ropsten as the ""closest thing to the mainnet"" and stating this similarity can provide better testing conditions.  Karapetsas stated:  ""It's really important to have it working.""  No alarm  The attack, which can be witnessed here, consists of a Ropsten address swarming the blockchain with thousands of auto-generated, faulty transactions.  Since the start, the attacks have continued in waves, leading the spammer and the developers into a game of cat-and-mouse to keep the fake transactions from interrupting the network.  But since so few miners run the software necessary to power the test blockchain, attacks are relatively easy. To this effect, a similar attack was documented in March of this year, an event which actually forced developers to rewrite the Ropsten blockchain.  At the time of writing, developers seemed to have successfully staved off the attacker by raising the cost of transactions. However, developers were also impacted by the price increase and have been unable to run tests, documenting their frustration on social media.  Luckily, ethereum developer Casey Detrio believes the attacker will not delay the Byzantium test period. He told CoinDesk: ""It's only a distraction and inconvenience.""  On top of that, it's not exactly clear to ethereum developers why someone would attack a test blockchain. Unlike attacks on the mainchain, the ether used on Ropsten is a test currency, and has no value its own right.  As such, it's hard to imagine what the incentive is to attack, beyond malignant trolling.  Detrio told CoinDesk: ""I imagine they get a kick out of it.""
