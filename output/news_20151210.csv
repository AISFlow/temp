42378489,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIx9,1449753315,'Satoshi' Denies Being  Wright Amid Doubts Over PGP Data,"Someone claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto has denied being Australian Craig Wright in a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.  The email is from satoshi@vistomail.com, which is widely attributed to Satoshi. The message reads:  ""I am not Craig Wright. We are all Satoshi.""  However, the message is not authenticated and it's unclear if the the address was manipulated or hacked. Satoshi's email was allegedly hacked last September.  An analysis of PGP key data by bitcoin core developer Greg Maxwell and Motherboard casts further doubt on claims that Craig Wright is bitcoin's creator.  Wired and Gizmodo published investigations on 8th December claiming that Satoshi's identity had been uncovered: bitcoin's creator is Australian Craig Wright. The stories mentioned several PGP public keys that were supposedly created and controlled by Satoshi.  But an analysis of the keys' metadata by Maxwell revealed problematic inconsistencies when compared with data from the sole public key known to be under Satoshi's control.  The keys referenced by Wired and Gizmodo use a different cipher suite than Satoshi's key. This cipher suite was also released in 2009, or about a year after the keys were supposedly created.  Maxwell posted his analysis on r/bitcoin and noted:  ""That they were different at all was surprising, considering that they claim to be generated less than a day apart.""  Maxwell also told Motherboard that he possessed chat logs where he discussed 'fake' Satoshi keys with others. The keys mentioned by Wired and Gizmodo were never referenced at the time, probably because they didn't exist then, he theorised.  Motherboard also analysed the keys, demonstrating that they could easily have been back-dated to show they were created in 2008. A key's creation date can be manipulated by changing the date and time of the machine it is created on.  Additionally, keys can be created that are linked to email addresses that the user doesn't control. Motherboard journalists demonstrated the creation of a backdated key and one linked to an email address not under their control.  Wright's whereabouts are currently unknown. Australian police raided his home and office several hours after the Wired and Gizmodo stories were published.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/10/satoshi-denies-being-wright-amid-doubts-over-pgp-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0f58a80f58170137a47714c4584ed06e4114323-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iJ3R,1449745037,Kleiner Perkins is Using Blockchain Tech to Incentivize its Founders,"KPCB Edge has gone public with Edgecoin, a private blockchain project the investment firm will use to reward startup founders who help both KPCB and other portfolio members.  With the formal launch, the early-stage investment firm, launched in June, will provide all its investors with an Edgecoin web wallet containing 10 edgecoins. As a first use case, founders who identify other entrepreneurs who they believe KPCB should invest in are able to spend their edgecoins as a way to signal their trust in that individual or team.  KPCB Edge  indicates that, following the transaction, it will set up a meeting with the recommended startup within 72 hours, with a full partner meeting taking place if possible.  The company wrote in a blog post:  ""Edgecoin serves as a record of valuable ways our founders and advisers help us, allowing them to participate in the upside of successful companies. It also gives us a valuable dataset to observe how our network interacts, and to correlate these to a range of other outcomes of interest.""    KPCB told CoinDesk it sees Edgecoin as a way to help its founders share in the fund's upside when they help other entrepreneurs in their portfolio, or help new ones connect to the firm    In addition to KPCB Edge founders, the firm said Freada Kapor Klein and Kapor Capital will be using the network to recommend companies for its consideration.  The project has been in beta since early 2015, and as of today, one founding member from each KPCB startup will be granted a web wallet, though developers said this could scale to full founding teams as the project matures.  Developers indicated that the Edgecoin blockchain took about a weekend for the firm to develop, but that creating an interface and user experience on top of this layer took additional time, as did conducting legal due diligence on the service.  The Edgecoin network  Unlike many private blockchain projects, Edgecoin is notable as it is a fork of the alternative digital currency litecoin.  There are a few technical differences between Edgecoin and litecoin, with the most notable being block times are reduced from roughly 2.5 minutes to 1 minute, and that users don’t have to pay transaction fees to send edgecoins.  Edgecoins are also not tradeable on an open market or between founders. Administrators, in turn, have the ability to add new coins to the network, though a finite number, the company said, have been pre-mined, or set aside for KPCB’s use.  Further, as opposed to a global network of distributed computers, KPCB said it has three Amazon EC2 instances and a firewall securing the network.  Project developers said that while founders do have to trust KPCB Edge to run the network, concerns about security aren’t warranted as it’s in the best interest of the firm to ensure that it is not vulnerable to attack.  Edgecoin is currently invite only, though KPCB has made a block explorer for the network public so that others can observe and verify its transactions.  Edgecoin transactions  In comments to CoinDesk, the KPCB team also revealed details about transactions, noting that founders who spend coins to recommend a founder do not receive coins back if the firm ultimately does not invest.  Instead, the transaction details would include a status message, which will be updated with a reason as to why KPCB passed on a deal.  Founders whose suggested entrepreneurs are selected, however, are then able to profit from the carry of the investment. The transaction then serves as an irrefutable record of the founder’s contribution.  ""If an edgecoin holder wants to prove to others that they executed an edgecoin transaction, and show others the metadata (transaction message, website, etc) associated with it, we will allow them to generate a string containing this data signed by the private key associated with the public key used in the transaction,"" the blog post explained.  The string can then be used to independently verify that the sender owns the address in question by validating the signature.

42378488,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iJ0v,1449735028,Blockchain Panel Draws Capacity Crowd at Finnovasia,"A blockchain-focused panel at Finnovasia yesterday drew so many interested FinTech professionals extra chairs needed to be brought into the auditorium.  The panel session at the Hong Kong conference centered on how blockchain is changing banking in Asia, with the audience there to hear insights from UBS Asia-Pacific CTO Peter Stephens; BitSpark CEO George Harrap; and ANX CTO Hugh Madden, among other industry participants.  Amongst the assembled panelists it was perhaps Stephens that drew the most attention from Finnovasia’s attendees for his insights into how the financial services firm is experimenting with how blockchain tech could evolve its business model  Stephens told the audience:  ""Banks are engaging. They're trying to understand where this future lies. This isn't just a new customer experience, this is real disruption from the business models. It will take business models out completely, it will create new business models. Disruption from blockchain isn’t just going to be in financial services.""  In response to a question by moderator Pindar Wong, Stephens further noted that UBS is investigating a variety of blockchain technologies, including open-source options from bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as permissioned networks.  Stephens also spoke about UBS' interest in blockchain technology as a way to replace its ""several hundred"" internal ledgers, an issue he suggested was by no means unique to UBS. He added that he believes the blockchain could impact any company processes that either ""lock up capital"" or are ""manually intensive"".  Elsewhere a diverse set of industry stakeholders including Gatecoin CEO Aurelien Menant; Bitquant’s chief science officer Joseph Wang; and WIP Solutions CEO Alex Edana presented views on various issues facing the technology.  Bitcoin or blockchain  In what has become a widely asked question at recent conferences, panelists were encouraged to share their thoughts on which blockchain technologies were likely to ""win out"" or otherwise be widely used by traditional finance.  As expected, answers varied depending on the business model of the panelist.  Madden, whose firm ANX has been pivoting toward working with enterprise clients, for instance, said he believed in offering clients ""mature products"", and that bitcoin is the only such offering in the blockchain market today.  ""We use bitcoin when we need to put something in the market that doesn’t break,"" he said. ""If your time to market is two years, Ethereum is much more sophisticated technology.""  WIP Solutions CEO Alex Edana, whose company is building a blockchain that does not use proof of work mining, unsurprisingly spoke out against bitcoin's reliance on a distributed network of computers outside the control of any one individual or entity.  ""If you try to sell me on proof of work or 10-minute throughput, I would say 'Why should I trust a third-party?' Miners, if you don’t know them, there's a problem with know your customer (KYC), there’s a problem with control,"" he said.  However, Edana was quick to stem his criticism, adding:  ""As an asset fine, fantastic. I think it's exciting.""  Blockchain overload  One of the more interesting audience questions asked the panel to address how the panelists believed financial incumbents should engage with the technology, and whether they will need partners to help them explore the technology.  Here, Stephens spoke about UBS and its partnership with blockchain consortium startup R3, stating that he doesn't believe banks can learn the technology on their own.  ""This technology is all about sharing,"" he said. ""You can't share on your own. This is why we're engaging. We're not exclusively doing R3. We'll have other experiments with industry startups, telcos and banks.""  On the subject of the many projects ongoing in the blockchain space, another audience question sought to assess how financial incumbents could avoid creating a situation where there are as many blockchains as private ledgers.  To this, Stephens voiced his belief that the industry needs to embrace ""open standards"", which he suggested would need to be a feature even of permissioned blockchains.  Edana was confident that collaboration would likely be easiest and most swift in smaller markets where industry collaboration would be easier.  ""Australia will be the first market on the blockchain in three to five years,"" he said. ""There, you only have [a small number of] banks and a couple exchanges.""  While panelists may have been conscious of a market with too many blockchains, audience members did not suffer a fatigue from the subject matter.  In a later panel, Ernst & Young’s Ira Dhalawong summed up the enthusiasm for the technology at the event, noting:  ""The room has thinned out since blockchain.""

42378477,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIkZ,1449729485,North Carolina Exempts Select Bitcoin Businesses from Regulation,"North Carolina has carved out regulatory exemptions for select bitcoin and blockchain businesses in a move industry supporters say avoids problematic provisions in place in other US states.  In a substantial update to its money transmitter FAQ page, the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks (NCCOB) has exempted digital currency miners; non-financial blockchain services; and multi-signature and non-custodial wallet providers from the state's Money Transmitters Act (MTA).  Notably, the exemptions are the result of collaboration between the NCCOB and industry advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which worked with law firm BuckleySandler LLP and government relations consulting firm Gide on the initiative.  The NCCOB had previously supported a legislative bill that would have covered bitcoin and digital currency related business activities.  As noted by the CDC and its partners, the decision by North Carolina to instead collaborate directly with industry stakeholders contrasts with efforts like New York’s state-specific licensing regime, the BitLicense, which was enacted earlier this year.  BuckleySandler counsel Amy Kim said in a statement:  ""These FAQs are quite remarkable as they define specific activities as falling outside the scope of the regulation, which very well may serve as a template for other state interpretations.""  In addition to the exemptions, the agency specified that digital currency transmission is regulated under the MTA, as are virtual currency ""exchangers and administrators"" depending on their business model.  ""An exchanger that sells its own stock of virtual currency is generally not considered a virtual currency transmitter under the NC MTA. In contrast, an exchanger that holds customer funds while arranging a satisfactory buy/sell order with a third party, and transmits virtual currency and fiat currency between buyer and seller, will typically be considered a virtual currency transmitter,"" the FAQ page reads.  North Carolina further clarified that it does not require a special license for digital currency businesses operating in state, noting that it ""applies the same standard” to these entities as money transmitters operating with fiat currencies.  Overall, the changes mark one of the most sizeable updates to the agency’s FAQ page, and provide new clarity to industry businesses seeking to reach customers in the ninth most populous US state.  According to bitcoin advocacy group Coin Center, North Carolina law had previously only exempted authorized agents of businesses that had obtained a money transmitter license.

42378491,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iJ2B,1449721878,What We Know: Alleged Bitcoin Creator Craig Wright's Tax Troubles,"Authorities are investigating Craig Wright, the man now believed to be bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, but the reasons behind the latest actions in Australia are murky.  Following the publication of new evidence suggesting Australian businessman Craig S Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, law enforcement officials appear to be suddenly interested in Wright.      Police were quick to raid his home and office in Sydney, Australia, yesterday. The actions have so far ignited speculation as to why authorities are interested in Wright, and whether this has to do with his connection to the digital currency.  So far, the official line from authorities is that the events are unconnected.  According to reports, authorities have attributed the action to an investigation by the Australian Tax Office (ATO), though the timing of the investigation into the matter, it's safe to say, appears suspicious.  For now, the agency is sharing few details. When reached for comment, ATO spokesperson John Hulin told CoinDesk:    ""Due to confidentiality provisions in the Tax Administration Act the ATO cannot comment on any individual's or entity's tax affairs.""    This doesn't mean that the community is without clues, however.  Documentation uncovered by WIRED, Gizmodo and Business Insider offers possible insight into to why the ATO is investigating Wright and whether their might be validity to the official claims by authorities.  Bad blood  So far, the most compelling resource offering insight into the matter is a liquidation document for Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Pty Limited, a bitcoin firm Wright attempted to launch in 2013.  Authored by Hotwire's corporate advisory firm McGrathNicol, the document centers on issues between Hotwire and Australian tax authorities. As reported by Investor Daily, the dispute put a damper on Wright's business plans, which ultimately fizzled as Hotwire’s problems with the ATO worsened.  Where the blame lies in the incident is unclear from available evidence, and may hint at bad blood between Wright and the organization.  McGrathNicol attributes Hotwire's failure, in part, to the ATO, which it alleges did not send AU$3.4m in goods-and-services refunds owed to the company in a timely manner. Also cited were Wright's personal bitcoin losses due to the collapse of the now-defunct Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox,  The document also provides a timeline that details the dispute over the refund.  Elsewhere, Business Insider revealed McGrathNicol has inferred that the ATO put additional pressure on Wright and his business. An update to creditors dated 23rd November shows the ATO assessed a penalty of AU$1.7m to Hotwire because it did not believe the company had a claim to the AU$3.4m.  The matter is being considered by the ATO’s Private Groups & High Wealth Individuals division, according to the update.  Problems between Wright and ATO continued after this dispute, however.  BI further reported that Hotwire filed for a AU$5.5m tax return for 2014, an amount that the publication said has not yet been released to the company by the ATO.  Hotwire’s cash problems appear to be driven by the refund hold-up, and according to the creditor report, there is no indication as of last month as to when the funds will be released – if at all.  Another firm tied to Hotwire, Panopticrypt, appears to be in similar straits owing to ATO scrutiny, according to a November creditors update.  February meetings  More clues to the nature of the disputes can be found in a transcript outlining a meeting between Wright and ATO representatives on 18th February, 2014, and included in Gizmodo’s report.  Present at the meeting were Wright's accountant, John Chesher, and attorney Andrew Sommer, in addition to Wright himself. Representing the ATO were Dev McMaster, Marina Dolevksi and Hoa Doa.  A subsequent meeting took place on 26th February, and included two representatives from the ATO, Chesher and Wright’s bookkeeper, Ann Wrightson. The minutes for the meeting were published by Gizmodo, though the ATO declined to confirm the veracity of the transcript and minutes to CoinDesk.  It is during the 18th February meeting meeting that Wright pushed for bitcoins to be classified as a kind of currency. As previously reported, it was then Wright claimed he had ""been running bitcoin since 2009"".  In one set of remarks attributed to Wright's attorney, it's suggested the push to have bitcoin deemed as a form of money for tax purposes would have implications for Hotwire and Wright's other ventures.  In another passage, Sommer went further in the push for the bitcoin-as-money classification. This part of the meeting also offers clues to the structuring of the claimed bitcoin holdings said to be primarily held outside of Australia – with the exception of a transaction involving Hotwire's Denariuz bitcoin bank project.  At one point, attorney Sommer refers to ""six different audits"" taking place against Wright's businesses. These firms include Coin Exchange, Cloudcroft, Strasan, Denariuz (the bitcoin-only bank) and Hotwire PE.  In the documents, Sommer outlined the nature of the dispute with the ATO as well as a series of events leading up to that meeting in February. In this segment, Sommer suggests that Wright has faced scrutiny from the tax agency as early as 2009.  The documents  also show the ATO scrutinized whether bitcoins were actually paid out between Wright's entities – a line of inquiry that appears to have been complicated by the ATO's limited knowledge of the technology.  Not only does the transcript illuminate the ATO’s query, but it offers clues to the degree of tension between the two sides.  Early in the discussion, Wright and Sommer pointed to an ATO decision made on 30th September that was never sent to them, despite apparent references in other correspondence.  The minutes also suggest Wright's troubles with the ATO appear to have been complicated due to a business association with Mark Ferrier, an Australian citizen who was arrested in 2013 for alleged fraud tied to a venture called MJF Mining Consulting.  Notably, Wright’s reported bitcoin holdings were used to pay for a software transaction, a detail that could be relevant to the ATO as it suggests there is evidence supporting its investigations of his business use of bitcoin.
