42405485,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMdyp,1606519978,Ripple Is Cashing Out a Third of Its Stake in Surging MoneyGram,"Blockchain payments firm Ripple is selling roughly one-third of its stake in MoneyGram, in its first such sale of company stock since the startup invested in the remittance giant in 2019.      According to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Friday, Ripple owns 6.22 million shares of MoneyGram, or 8.6% of shares outstanding, plus a warrant to buy up to another 5.95 million shares, for a total equity position of 12.2 million shares, or 17% of MoneyGram's shares outstanding.      Ripple is now selling up to 4 million shares, or approximately 33.3% of its entire stake, if you count the shares represented by the warrant. After the sale, Ripple will still own at least 3.22 million shares, or 4.44% of MoneyGram. When including the additional shares represented by the warrant, which gives Ripple the right to execute a stock buy at a predetermined price, the blockchain payments firm will still own about 11% of MoneyGram.      Under the terms of Ripple’s initial investment announced in June 2019, the company bought the shares in MoneyGram at $4.10 apiece, at a significant premium to their price at the time. With shares of MoneyGram up more than 260% this year, closing at $7.42 on Wednesday, Ripple can now net a significant profit on its investment.      ""Ripple is a proud partner in MoneyGram's digital growth transformation. This is purely a judicious financial decision to realize some gains on Ripple's MGI [MoneyGram International] investment and is in no way a reflection of the current state of our partnership,” a Ripple spokesperson told CoinDesk.      The sales are still in process, according to the spokesperson, who didn’t respond to an emailed question asking what the company intends to do with the proceeds from the stake sale.      Ripple completed the purchase of a $50 million equity stake in MoneyGram in November 2019.      As recently as the end of Q3 2020, Ripple had paid $9.3 million to MoneyGram, noted as “market development fees” on MoneyGram’s latest financial statement, for the remittance firm’s use of Ripple’s XRP-based settlement network, the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network (formerly known as xRapid).      See also: Goldman Sachs Sells $6.5M of Shares in Ripple Partner MoneyGram: SEC Filing      MoneyGram has used this cross-border solution to conduct transactions in Europe, Australia and the Philippines since June 2019, for which Ripple has paid MoneyGram at least $52 million. The remittance firm piloted Ripple’s flagship cryptocurrency in 2018.      “We will remain a significant shareholder in MoneyGram following the sale. [The company is] clearly a leader in the global payments space in over 200 countries and territories. In just over a year, we've made incredible progress and look forward to continuing to work alongside MoneyGram to transform cross-border payments,” the Ripple spokesperson said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/27/ripple-is-cashing-out-a-third-of-its-stake-in-surging-moneygram,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01bc7621c92006fc67cacd5ec3eca41b963dafd7-1262x808.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Friday, a week-long voting period seeking to determine how “admin fees” were to be allocated closed in favor of token holders. Now, in three days, some $2,631,601.92 worth of fees – accrued before the vote opened – will head to community member coffers.      The protocol will continue to disburse fees on a weekly basis following this initial payout, Curve CEO Michael Egorov told CoinDesk.      Curve’s recent vote could be seen as a successful exercise in distributed governance, where platform users are encouraged to participate by having skin in the game. The vote passed unanimously with 95 votes cast in favor, representing 49.75% of the entire eligible voting pool.      See also: The Fourth Era of Blockchain Governance      This point is all the more emphatic considering the confounding origins of Curve’s governance token. In August, an anonymous DeFi user preemptively deployed smart contracts for the decentralized autonomous corporation and token the team were building, without their knowledge or consent.    An exercise in decentralized governance    The Curve team adopted the front-run code due to intense community interest during the heyday of governance and liquidity token yield farming.      In order to vote, users must stake CRV tokens to the protocol’s voting contract which then supplies users with veCRV, creating a kind of voting escrow. Since September, veCRV holders have earned half of the 0.04% trading fee the protocol levies, with the other half going to liquidity providers.      See also: Meet the Yield Farmers Plowing Cryptocurrency’s Riskiest Trend      “The vote for this splitting already took place in the past, and the current vote activates the code to trustlessly distribute the fees now and in the future to veCRV token holders,” Egorov said. “While we've been writing and testing the code, the amount of fees accrued over 69 days, waiting for distribution, appeared to be $3 million.”      Curve is the sixth-largest DeFi protocol with approximately $1.3 billion worth of cryptocurrencies locked in its various smart contracts. Token trading has been flat since the governance vote passed, according to DeFi Pulse.      UPDATE (11/29/20 - 17:30 UTC): Corrects Curve's TVL to approximately $1.3 billion, not $800 million.

The report by journalist Nathaniel Popper, published Friday, is based on commentary from 23 current and former Coinbase employees. It paints the picture of a company that “has long struggled with its management of Black employees.”      Coinbase, which became aware of a potential story during the fact-checking process, attempted to front-run the story Wednesday evening. The company emailed a statement to its employees and then published that email in a blog post, alerting the public to an imminent “negative story.”      Read more: Coinbase Preemptively Rebuts Unpublished New York Times Expose      “Given that this story may be read by your friends, family and professional contacts, we wanted to give everyone a heads-up and provide some important context,” the statement reads. Notably, it expressed the company's belief that the NYT’s report would “likely quote” three former Coinbase employees and one former contractor. This proved to be an underestimation.    'Never experienced anything like Coinbase'    The NYT's report details several incidences of allegedly discriminatory behavior, ranging from racial stereotyping to inadequate practices around the hiring and promotion of Black employees. The Times reports that at least 11 former employees contacted the human resources department or their managers about such incidents.      Crypto, like the larger tech industry, has come under fire for a lack of diversity. In an opinion piece for CoinDesk titled “The Crypto Community Needs to Stand Up and Fight Racism,” Robert Greenfield, CEO of Emerging Impact, wrote, “The crypto community is conveniently selective about what aspects of society it wants to change.”      “Most people of color working in tech know that there’s a diversity problem,” said one former Coinbase employee, Alysa Butler, in Popper’s article. “But I’ve never experienced anything like Coinbase.”      Kim Milosevich, a Coinbase spokesperson, told the New York Times the company “does not tolerate racial, gender or any other forms of discrimination.” She is also quoted as saying, “All claims of discrimination are treated very seriously, investigated by both internal and third parties, and the appropriate action is taken.”      Coinbase, an $8 billion exchange, made headlines in September after CEO Brian Armstrong published an open letter declaring Coinbase as an “apolitical” and “mission driven” company, with the understanding that social justice issues should not be discussed on company time or channels.      Days later, the company offered a severance package for all employees who were uncomfortable with Armstrong’s mission statement. As of Oct. 14, 5% of Coinbase employees had left the firm.

42405472,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMcfA,1606493250,Crypto Custodian Copper Aims to Bridge Gap Between DeFi and Traditional Finance With New Tool,"Crypto custodian Copper is looking to connect institutions to the emergent world of decentralized finance (DeFi) with a newly unveiled product.      Announced Friday, CopperConnect is a bridge between Copper’s existing storage services and DeFi apps. In a press release for the new tool, Copper claims DeFi risks have been decreasing, making the speculative field more appealing to institutional clients.      “In the past, the DeFi space was viewed as too volatile for many crypto funds. However, over recent months, the number of unaudited DeFi projects (i.e. projects where their smart contracts have not been security checked by third-party experts) have decreased, and fluctuations in value of DeFi markets have become less dramatic,” Copper said.      However, decentralized money market Aave’s CEO, Stani Kulechov, said there has been “a significant increase in the number of institutions looking to deposit liquidity onto our project,” in the press release.      No institutional client is named or quoted in the press release that may have expressed DeFi-curiosity to Copper. The startup did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment by press time.      Copper’s new financial plumbing provides a way to “comply with [institutions’] exacting risk management rules,” Kulechov continued.      CopperConnect is an infrastructure system that provides security throughout the custody, transfer and lock-up process, as an asset makes its way to a DeFi smart contract. The Google Chrome application, or browser extension, reportedly works to connect Copper’s multi-party computation (MPC) custody system to both centralized exchanges and DeFi apps.      When exiting a DeFi pool, assets can only be returned to the wallet from which they came, according to Copper. It is unclear whether the service is functional with all DeFi applications.      Aave’s Kulechov said the system eliminates nearly all operational risks. Katrina Daminova, Copper’s head of product, suggested it also adds efficiency.      In September, crypto firm Trustology revealed a “DeFi Firewall” to its suite of institutional investment tools, also meant to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. While, Curv, another crypto custodian, now provides institutions access to leading DeFi protocol Compound.      In February, Copper raised $8 million in fresh capital with plans of expanding into new markets. “Since 2017, we have seen many crypto custody solutions emerge that don’t fully meet the needs of institutions,” Copper CEO Dmitry Tokarev said at the time. “Instead, they have built for an institutional framework that doesn’t exist yet, and is unlikely ever to, leaving institutions discouraged.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/27/crypto-custodian-copper-aims-to-bridge-gap-between-defi-and-traditional-finance-with-new-tool,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17391ce34a0a9f431d3a73b64bd5ac6010961af3-2400x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405474,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMch8,1606490501,Industry Pros Weigh In on Rumors of New Crypto Wallet Regulations,"Recent rumors about U.S. regulation of private, self-hosted crypto wallets have some compelling context.      For example, the proposal submitted last month by U.S. authorities to lower the anti-money laundering (AML) threshold for cross-border transactions (its consultation ends today, Friday), seems to support the hypothesis that outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is rapidly making more rules around crypto.      The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Federal Reserve’s rule change proposal would reduce the threshold from $3,000 to $250 for AML compliance for any transfers – in crypto or fiat – that go outside the U.S.      Concerns over user privacy in relation to that proposed change are nothing compared to the outright fear created by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s tweets about the threat to self-custodied wallets, a central tenet of crypto.    Shortened response period    It’s worth pointing out that the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the $250 threshold was given just a 30-day response period, when normally the industry would be granted 60 or 90 days. Another interesting rumor is that these stronger rule changes are coming directly from political appointees, rather than long-term career people at FinCEN or on the policy side.      “Many of the people at FinCEN are career people who are going to be at FinCEN 10 years from now, and they have a slow and steady process that works really well for them,” said Justin Newton, CEO of Netki, a technical solution for crypto AML compliance. “Mnuchin has until Jan. 20, to get done the things he wants to get done.”      Read more: Coinbase CEO: Trump Administration May ‘Rush Out’ Burdensome Crypto Wallet Rules      This is borne out by the brisk 30-day period for response to the recent ""Travel Rule"" change, said Newton, which “could be because they're trying to get this done before Mnuchin leaves.”      Another Travel Rule solution builder, Joseph Weinberg, co-founder of the Shyft Network, said the industry and its various regulators are in an “educational phase” and considerations around unhosted wallets should be carefully measured.      “It would surprise me if something came out really quickly,” Weinberg said. “A big knee-jerk reaction isn't something that should happen because people are realizing that if we work together we can solve these problems. There are different ways of approaching this than just throwing a 1980s version of SWIFT at crypto to figure out in a year.”    Self-hosted crypto wallets    It’s important to be clear about what regulators likely mean when they talk about unhosted or self-hosted wallets and how that relates to the global recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). This involves creating a compliance bridge between wallets hosted by a virtual asset service provider (VASP) and an unhosted or private wallet. (Technically speaking this is not the same as the Travel Rule, where there are VASPs at either end of the transaction.)      Read more: Why FinCEN Wants Details on All Cross-Border Transactions Over $250      Adding a due diligence requirement around unhosted wallets is in some way equivalent to sanctions screening in the traditional financial world, said Netki’s Newton. “It doesn’t matter if the other end of a transaction is a bank, a VASP, the corner store or Uncle Bob, sanctions apply to every transaction that occurs,” he said.      Another point to note is that the U.S., were it to enact some self-hosted wallet regulation, would not be the first country to do so. In Switzerland, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) introduced guidelines in January 2020 requiring exchanges to implement travel rule requirements on transactions over $1,000 and where the ownership of non-custodial wallets must be proven.    Right fit for FATF?    The issue of private wallets has been at the forefront of the FATF agenda this year, with substantial liaison with the private sector through its Virtual Asset Contact Group (VACG), said Malcolm Wright, advisory council chair at industry trade group Global Digital Finance. Meanwhile, the U.S. has long been an early adopter of cryptocurrency legislation which has provided foundational steps for the maturity of the industry, he said.      “If the rumors Brian Armstrong has flagged are true, we would hope that the administration will engage with industry, as the FATF has done through the VACG to ensure the impact and shape of any proposals are right-fit rather than preventative for responsible innovators,” Wright said.      Read more: All Global Crypto Exchanges Must Now Share Customer Data, FATF Rules      Certain sections of the 12-month review provided by FATF this summer (paragraphs 53 and 54) hinted at the path ahead regarding unhosted wallets. In addition, the Financial Service Agency of Japan (JFSA) who is leading the FATF working group on virtual assets has discussed the issue of lack of identity information on non-custodial wallets, said Dave Jevans, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace.      CipherTrace has been meeting with FinCEN, Treasury and FATF since 2019 on the virtual asset recommendations, and travel rule in particular, Jevans said.      “There has been chatter about this over the last two weeks,” he said. “Our view is that forcing a ‘Swiss+’ model is a bad idea. This is where VASPs cannot send or receive funds from non-custodial wallets without some form of KYC declaration. This makes it more difficult for people to manage their own money, and to send money to businesses or family. It is a shortsighted move that will not stop criminals, since they will simply use layering techniques to get around these controls.”    Banning crypto    Summing up, Siân Jones, a partner at XReg Consulting and the driving force behind a FATF-compliant messaging standard for crypto, said the rumored U.S. regulations were “entirely plausible.”      “The U.S. is the most vociferous around the FATF table,” said Jones. “Much of the rules are driven by the U.S., which has been pushing hard for a fairly strict regime. The policymakers there, largely the same people, are also pushing for this kind of thing. They still say, ‘If we're not satisfied with this, we can ban it.’ And they're the only country really that talks in those terms.”      Jones pointed to the linguistic nuance, whereby FATF refers to “unhosted wallets,” while everybody in the industry refers to them as “self-hosted wallets.”      “I think that itself is quite a revealing point,” Jones said. “To the policymakers, they see this as unhosted, uncontrolled, and stuff that is unregulated; that's where the 'un' comes from. People in the industry see this as some self-possession thing, and therefore very different.”      The Treasury Department did not return requests for comment by press time.

According to Russian newspaper Kommersant, the bankers were chiefly concerned over how centralized the digital currency system, currently under consideration, might be if launched. The event included representatives from institutions such as Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank, as well as e-payment firm Qiwi.      Russian Standard Bank Chairman Alexander Samokhvalov, also at the meeting, told Kommersant the commercial banks would support a scenario in which they would serve as intermediaries, but not one where the Bank of Russia maintains all the individual digital ruble accounts itself. The latter offers ""no room"" for commercial banks and could cause a bank run, Samokhvalov said.      Another participant told the newspaper anonymously that banks want more clarity on whether the digital ruble is planned as an alternative to paper cash or the current electronic payment system. They said banks ""don't take seriously"" the idea that the digital ruble would be a third form of domestic currency, as the Bank of Russia has said in a report.      The meeting took place at the Fintech Association, a consortium of Russian banks and payment operators which, among other things, is developing the Masterchain blockchain platform. The Bank of Russia is planning to hold a series of such meetings, including a discussion in the Russian parliament, RBK news agency reported.      See also: Russian Prime Minister Pledges to ‘Civilize’ Crypto Market and Prevent Scams      The central bank issued its report in October, outlining the possible scenarios for launching its a national digital currency. Later, Chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina said she views the idea as ""promising"" and the digital ruble, if seen favorably by the market, might be piloted at the end of 2021.

Huobi Labuan said in an emailed press release it aims to provide users in the nation with a ""safe and regulated"" platform for trading cryptocurrencies.  The exchange received a digital asset trading brokerage service license from ""Malaysian authorities"" in September for a nine-month trial period of operation, according to the release.  Responding to a question from CoinDesk, a representative detailed that the Labuan Financial Services Authority issued the license.  Under the license, Huobi Labuan is permitted to provide spot and derivatives trading services in Malaysia.  The exchange will initially support over a dozen different crypto assets including bitcoin, ether, EOS and Huobi's own HT token. After the trial period, more cryptocurrencies can be added.  The crypto exchange has been set up as a ""local operating partner"" of Huobi Cloud – a scheme allowing ""vetted partners"" to launch exchanges leveraging Huobi’s trading technology and digital asset infrastructure.  CoinDesk reached out for further details on who the partner entity is.  Huobi Global is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency spot exchange by volume, according to CoinMarketCap.

Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant's exchange inflow indicator – which measures the 144-block (roughly 24-hour) average of mean bitcoin deposits across major cryptocurrency exchanges – has risen to 2.5 bitcoin, the highest level since March 20.      In other words, the average size of inward-bound transactions to trading platforms has risen to eight-month highs.      ""The data shows whales [large traders] are transferring their coins to exchanges,"" CryptoQuant CEO Ki-Young Ju told CoinDesk. ""The cryptocurrency usually trades in a sideways-to-negative manner when whales become active on exchanges.""      Bitcoin is trading near $16,820 at press time, representing a 2% drop on a 24-hour basis. The cryptocurrency saw rejection above $17,400 early on Friday.      The possibility of prices falling to or below Thursday's low of $16,327 cannot be ruled out with average inflows now moving above two bitcoin – into CryptoQuant's ""danger zone.""      A reading above 2.00 on the indicator has consistently paved the way for notable price drops this year. The indicator rose above that level at least a week before the 40% drop seen on March 12.      Similarly, the sharp sell-off seen in November 2018 was preceded by a sharp rise in the metric.      Technical chart studies indicate low odds of an immediate bounce to levels above $19,000.      Thursday's price drop was backed by the highest sell volume (red bar) since June 1. As such, the pullback looks to have legs. Short-term momentum indicators such as the five- and 10-day moving averages are now looking south.

In a Nov. 19 court ruling reported by The Block Friday, the Jiangsu Yancheng Intermediate People's Court set out all the cryptocurrencies confiscated by law enforcement from the scam operators to date.  The document lists 194,775 BTC, 833,083 ETH, 487 million XRP, 79,581 BCH, 1.4 million LTC, 27.6 million EOS, 74,167 DASH, 6 billion DOGE and 213,724 USDT.  At time of writing, the digital assets are worth almost $4 billion by CoinDesk's calculation.  ""The seized digital currencies will be processed pursuant to laws and the proceeds and gains will be forfeited to the national treasury,"" the court ruled, per the report.  The PlusToken scam will have taken even more than this massive sum from victims.  Previous sell-offs of ill-gotten gains have been linked to drops in the price of bitcoin, as supply suddenly spiked.  It's not clear how China would dispose of the cryptocurrencies, per the report.

Scheduled to take effect on Nov. 28, the new restriction will only allow users to withdraw digital assets equal in value to the total of Korean won (KRW) deposited 24 hours after a withdrawal was requested.      The withdrawal delay is only applicable to cash deposits that are exchanged for cryptocurrency. There is no time limit on Korean won (KRW) withdrawals corresponding to KRW deposits. Similarly, users can deposit digital assets and withdraw KRW or digital assets within 24 hours.      ""If a member with a balance of 0 won in an Upbit account deposits 1 million won and requests withdrawal of a digital asset worth 1 million won before 24 hours, the withdrawal will not work. However, after 24 hours of deposit, you can withdraw digital assets worth 1 million won at the time of withdrawal application without such restrictions,"" according to Upbit's notice on Friday.

The Chinese president said he would work toward greater cooperation among the 10 ASEAN nations, and promote a “digital Silk Road” in the region, according to the South China Morning Post.  The speech comes in an apparent attempt to strengthen China's position locally, after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden said he would work with regional allies to take on China's might.  Xi said, “China regards ASEAN as a priority in its neighborhood diplomacy and a key area for high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative” – a major infrastructure and economic development project underway since 2013.  The bloc could work with China to establish a “China-ASEAN digital port to promote digital connectivity, and build a ‘digital Silk Road,'"" the president said.  So far there is no suggestion that the digitization proposal would use blockchain underpinnings, but Xi has previously touted the technology across the Chinese economy.  According to the report, China has been trying to build closer ties with ASEAN countries – which include the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia – amid the trade war that developed under Donald Trump.  ASEAN members were not initially universally keen on Xi’s proposed digital Silk Road, according to an international relations expert cited in the report.

42405463,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMcWJ,1606458052,Libra Plans Dollar-Pegged Stablecoin Launch in January 2021: Report,"Libra, the Facebook-initiated stablecoin project that's been targeted continuously by lawmakers, might get off the ground as early as January 2021, albeit in a more limited format than the original multi-currency basket envisioned.      According to a report by the Financial Times on Friday, instead, Libra may launch a single dollar-pegged stablecoin next year, according to “three people involved in the initiative.""      The global stablecoin project was initially proposed to be pegged to a basket composed of multiple fiat currencies, but was walked back by project leaders in April as a result of regulatory pressure from lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad.      The project's leaders announced Libra could launch as a series of stablecoins, each pegged to a fiat currency, rather than one multi-currency basket during that revamp.      Now, Libra's “global stablecoin” will simply launch as a single coin backed 1:1 by the U.S. dollar, according to the FT, pending approval from the Swiss financial regulator FINMA.      The other currencies within the basket and the composite may still be rolled out at a later time. The dollar-pegged coin could launch as soon as January, according to FT, which did not name its sources.      Facebook unveiled the Libra project in June 2019, announcing its vision for the global stablecoin.      It immediately faced regulatory backlash from lawmakers worldwide, who cited concerns about Libra's potential to threaten financial stability or enable money laundering.      The social media giant helped form the Libra Association, a governing council for the project, later that year. It now has 27 members.      See also: Libra Association Taps Saumya Bhavsar as General Counsel for Payments Subsidiary      While its limited form, as a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar might placate policymakers, the project still faces a significant uphill battle as regulators seek to clamp down on the digital payments industry and hold senders and receivers to account for their transactions.
