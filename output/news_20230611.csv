The U.K.-based company’s protocol enables developers to build AI systems on smaller data centers, personal gaming computers and other connected hardware and to pay on demand. Gensysn uses a cryptographic verification network that without the need for intermediaries allows users to determine that machine learning work shared over the protocol has been finished correctly..  “The realization of its (AI’s) potential requires huge computational power,” Gensysn co-founder Ben Fielding, said in a press release Monday (UTC). “We’re harnessing the electricity of a new age and making it available to everyone at unlimited scale and fair market prices.”  Fielding said that such widespread accessibility was “essential” for avoiding “dangerously biased technology serving the many but built by the few. The key to useful, aligned AI is allowing everyone in the world to contribute to its development.”  In the release, Gensyn co-founder Harry Grieve also noted that “with decentralized networks, value simply accrues to the network as a function of supply and demand.”  “It also sharply increases the amount of compute supply by connecting previously underutilized hardware from around the world,” he said.  The announcement comes amid surging interest in AI, which could potentially transform the way businesses in a range of industries operate, including media, retail, manufacturing and financial services. Last month, computer chipmaker Nvidia, whose products are integral for the graphics processing units (GPUs) at the core of AI systems, reached a $1 trillion valuation.

Prominent investment firms CoinFund, Canonical Crypto, Protocol Labs, Eden Block and a variety of AI and crypto venture capitalists and angels joined a16z in the round.  “The recent advancements in AI are incredible, but substantial computational power requirements give big technology companies an advantage over startups in the race to capture AI’s value,” a16z crypto General Partner Ali Yahya said in a statement. “We believe nobody combines the knowledge and cultural understanding of both the AI and crypto cypherpunk worlds better than Gensyn, and look forward to partnering with them to make infrastructure for AI much more widely accessible.”  Read More: When AI and Blockchain Merge, Expect the Mundane at First",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/11/blockchain-based-ai-compute-protocol-gensyn-closes-43m-series-a-funding-round-led-by-a16z,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/898c3be9af56dd711a31d6eceb716430d3d7de3f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The allegations leveled against the crypto exchange suggest its involvement in unlawful activities, specifically multiple violations of securities laws. Consequently, the impact of these allegations manifested as substantial outflows from the exchange, prompting Changpeng Zhao, the CEO, to disclose an astonishing figure of over $392 million in net outflows in the last 24 hours. It’s worth noting that Binance has dealt with significant outflows before, indicating a history of navigating such challenges.

The aftermath of the recent lawsuit has caused BNB to plummet in value. Coingecko reports that the token has experienced a drastic decline of over 23% in just the span of a week. Source: Nansen Binance Vs. The SEC: What’s The Gist? According to the official SEC press release, the company and 13 other entities are being sued for the operation of an unregistered exchange and the commingling of customer funds through companies related to Binance. The regulatory body also alleges that Binance had knowledge of the regulations regarding exchanges and securities but chose to ignore those laws, putting investor funds at risk just to maximize profits. They also highlighted the sale of unregistered securities. The SEC targets the company’s “Simple Earn” and “BNB Vault” crypto-lending products. These products are part of Binance’s staking service and, with the recent crackdown on staking services by the SEC, are considered securities by the regulatory body. BNB market cap currently at $36.6 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com The SEC also targeted Binance’s failure to restrict the exchange’s services to US citizens. Just this March, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alleged that the company is breaking various financial laws including the ones intended to stop money laundering. The SEC also remarked that Binance misled customers through “strategic and targeted wash trading”.

Source - Coingecko At the token’s current price point of $235, BNB bulls should defend the $234 support level to target higher highs in the short term as long as no bearish news hits the market. But at the moment, it seems that the weight of the bears will defeat any attempt for a bullish breakout. However, if the bulls are able to defend this support level, a return to the $300 price point might be possible.

Consequently, the Polygon blockchain token experienced a significant drop of 31% within a week, setting a new record. However, there is some positive news as it has managed to recover, witnessing a promising rebound of over 11% in the last 24 hours.

Already knew, already confirmed.$SOL $ADA $MATIC and others L1’s got the security stamp. Regulation will kick hard = tight choice of L1/L2 coins. Where will all this money flow to? pic.twitter.com/jw5xpLRA4j — Zoomer Oracle (@ZoomerOracle) June 5, 2023 MATIC is one of the 13 tokens within the Binance lawsuit to be designated as a security. Polygon Labs, the developer of MATIC, issued a statement on Twitter defending Polygon saying that the network is “developed outside the US, deployed outside the US, and focused to this day on the global community that supports the network.” This recent lawsuit against Binance was followed up by the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase, citing that the company is operating an unregistered exchange in connection with the company’s staking service. Fear, Uncertainty And Doubt In The Market With the recent classification of several cryptocurrencies as securities, the market has slid considerably within the past week. Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency, gained dominance in light of the recent regulatory fillings against Binance and Coinbase. The other tokens in the list are SOL, ADA, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, and COTI. According to the lawsuit, the tokens are listed as investment contracts. This made the SEC label them as securities in accordance with the Howey Test, which is a test to know whether a certain asset is a security or not. MATIC market cap at $5.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com This move by the SEC was in line with its recent actions against the crypto industry. Just this February, the regulatory body cracked down on Kraken’s staking service along with forcing the company to pay $30 million in penalties for the violations. If the mentioned tokens and companies fail to comply with the SEC, it may lead to another Ripple-like event which will affect the market. MATIC Bulls Should Watch This Level At the time of writing, MATIC is being supported at the $0.6 price level which will act as the launch pad for future bullishness. However, external market forces still hold sway in the token’s momentum and price actions in the near future. The recent lawsuits already slashed millions upon millions of possible gains for investors. Source: Coinglass Related Reading: Bearish BNB Signs Hint Downtrend May Persist Beyond Expectations Meanwhile, CoinGlass data shows MATIC long positions being liquidated as the market crashed after the lawsuits were made public. Despite this, buying pressure after the crash continued with MATIC bulls holding $0.6 support. If they can hold on to this support level, we might be able to see a return towards the $0.83 support in the medium to long term.

The agency’s scare tactics may succeed in the US, but it struggles with the overall market. The US SEC made its position against crypto known this week when it launched severe regulatory action against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, and Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange by trade volume in the US. Leading the agency in its crusade is Gary Gensler, a man who has made his views of the industry no secret. Following the SEC’s lawsuits against the exchanges, the market was expected to react severely, and the prices would plunge. However, Bitcoin and the broader market held steady throughout the week. However, Gensler’s SEC made allegations in its suit against Binance, which labelled several popular cryptocurrencies unregistered securities. The SEC listed Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti (COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS). The agency’s naming of these tokens as securities did, however, cause panic in the market and spurred trading platform Robinhood to delist MATIC, SOL, and ADA from its platform come June 27. Alt-Market Reacts to Robinhood Delisting Although the market did not react as much as expected during the week, it did see a dramatic plunge on Saturday. Undoubtedly fuelled by Robinhood’s delisting announcement, the crypto alt market saw significant declines. ADA was trading down by as much as 25%, while SOL and MATIC also saw double-digit losses. Amid the dire market conditions, Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com announced it would suspend its institutional exchange service for US customers. Compared to the broader market, Bitcoin was only trading down only 5% to its lowest level since March and was trading hands at around $25,000. The market appeared to recover ever so slightly by Sunday morning, but the “bloodbath” continues. Did Gary Gensler Offer His Services to Binance? A surprising report emerged this week amid the chaos when CNBC revealed that Gensler had a series of conversations with Binance officials and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Binance lawyers allege that Gensler offered his services as an advisor to the exchange in 2019. Although merely reports at the moment, the allegations undoubtedly damage Gensler and call into question his intentions as Chairman of the securities regulator. The Crypto Industry Will Prevail The SEC and all its might may continue to slap the industry with a barrage of claims, but it seems unlikely that it will manage to bring the industry down. The agency is certainly doing substantial damage to the US crypto industry, but the crypto market at large will not be taken down. In light of the recent events in the crypto industry – recall the spectacular failures of FTX, we cannot live under the illusion that the industry can go on unregulated. However, the US’s approach to this is simply wrong and unproductive and achieves little bar driving crypto off US shores and into the hands of territories which welcome it with open arms.
